1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,800
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,920
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Son of a bitch.

11
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
Son of a bitch.

12
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,420
Well, it's been a week since no podcast.

13
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,660
Yeah, it was Easter Sunday.

14
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,660
I hope it's been worth it.

15
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,160
Sorry guys, that was my fault.

16
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm the reason.

17
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
You rose from the grave.

18
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
I know, I know.

19
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Yeah.

20
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Dang.

21
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,200
Ben, what did you give up for Ash Wednesday?

22
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,000
Did you give up anything?

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's sort of Wednesday.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Smoking weed.

25
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,920
You did, huh?

26
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,040
Smoking weed for Ash Wednesday, yeah, I gave it up for my entire life, because Ash Wednesday

27
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
is just that important.

28
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
Every Wednesday, I give it up.

29
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,560
Your real ash, your real ash head.

30
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,800
Yeah, I used to be.

31
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,520
I put my blunt out on my forehead and I said, oh, there's no more.

32
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't need it anymore.

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
You did.

34
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,600
You did a Dr. Manhattan thing where you drew the symbol on your forehead, but you used

35
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,760
the blunt and you made a weed leaf.

36
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,160
That's exactly right.

38
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,400
I drew the entire tetrahedra canna binol molecule, a complicated diagram, I'll do it.

39
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,120
I'll do a symbol that better represents me.

40
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,240
It will be one I respect for 20.

41
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Recently.

42
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,880
It will be one I respect draws the Tesla logo.

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,960
Recently a passenger, a Lyft passenger gave me a weed.

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
He gave me free weed.

45
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
That's spectacular.

46
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,720
And a jar, just because.

47
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
That's, yeah.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Because you were based?

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Yeah, pretty much.

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,280
It seems like a bad business model.

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,880
It seems like you're losing money doing such a thing.

52
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,840
As long as you got it in addition to payment, well, you can't jump into the car until you

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480
actually pay for the app.

54
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Like the app has your cards or your paint anyway, you know, so you're going to give

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
me money anyway.

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
And he is, I guess I was just talking to him about society.

57
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,640
I was telling him about society and the problem with society is kind of like this guy's kind

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,040
of based as you get some weed and it works out perfectly because I ran out.

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
So yep.

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
It does work.

61
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
It does work out perfectly.

62
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Got refilled.

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Yep.

64
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,360
Life be like that sometimes.

65
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
She gets sugar.

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
No.

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
I don't need sugar.

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Sugar high.

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
That's what I'm chasing.

70
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah.

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah.

72
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
No more weed now.

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,240
Only sugar.

74
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,360
Just glucose.

75
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
What's it called?

76
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Glucose.

77
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Glucose.

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
I tried.

79
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Okay.

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Glucose heads.

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:51,600
In my pursuit of a perfect licorice, I changed my strategy up and I have created something

82
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,760
called rather than you sugar like a fucking moron, I've created invert sugar.

83
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,600
Do you know what that is?

84
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Salt.

85
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah.

86
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Invert sugar.

87
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Yeah.

88
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I've created anti-sugar.

89
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

90
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,080
It's actually, it sounds less complicated than it is.

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,600
It's just you put sugar in water.

92
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
You ever make rock candy?

93
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
You know how when you put sugar in water and then you cook it down, it like crystallizes?

94
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Yeah.

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
I have not done that, but I know that, yes.

96
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Okay.

97
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Yeah.

98
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,160
Well, if you add a little bit of acid, I guess it like changes, it like reverses the molecular

99
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,800
structure or something.

100
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,080
It changes the molecular structure such that it does not do that anymore.

101
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,240
And that's how you can, you can cook sugar down into like a thick, gloopy syrup.

102
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,520
Down into what, down into what we confectioners call the softball stage of sugar reduction.

103
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
So shut up.

104
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Shut the hell up.

105
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,280
It's not funny.

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
So yes.

107
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,440
They're so fucking silly.

108
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,000
These pÃ¢tissiers look down their nose at me.

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,240
So I cooked, yes, I made a jar of a softball stage invert sugar and I tried making licorice.

110
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
I tried making a Twizzler with it.

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
It was still too soft, but it was much smoother.

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
Do you believe it?

113
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,520
It was much smoother than what the ones I had done with refined sugar.

114
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
So that's an improvement.

115
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah.

116
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah.

117
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,400
You're kind of like a senior citizen, Ben.

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
Wow, I really thought you were going to say you're like Walter White because everyone

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
says, wow, Ben, you're like Walter White.

120
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
Oh yeah, I bet you want me to compare you to Walter White.

121
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I bet you love it.

122
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,760
You'd be like the eighth person to do it, so, you know.

123
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Is that because you don't have any hair anymore?

124
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Because I have no hair and because I make concoctions in the kitchen.

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
You live in New Mexico.

126
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
I live in New Mexico.

127
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
I have cancer.

128
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Yeah.

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
That's an upcoming.

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
My wife hates me.

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Yeah, true.

132
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Your wife does hate you.

133
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Did he ever do any rapes?

134
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Did he ever do any rapes?

135
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
No.

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
He did in a sexual assault.

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I remember that.

138
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Against Skyler?

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
On Skyler?

140
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Yeah.

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Well, you know.

142
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
She was pregnant.

143
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
She didn't want it and she was just going too hard.

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,560
He thought he could get a horny tie whenever he wanted.

145
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Yeah.

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
And he's kind of like a wife consent matters.

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm a cool gang banger drug dealer now.

148
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
You have to respect me and, you know.

149
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Yeah.

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Yeah.

151
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Yeah.

152
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Breaking Bad is pretty cool like that, where it's like, yeah, you know, nerds kind of do

153
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,560
ruin everything when you think about it.

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Especially like, you know, drug, drug dealing.

155
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
They ruin it.

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
They should stay with the kitchen.

157
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Not me though.

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Not you.

159
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
No, you're different.

160
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Not me though.

161
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Not me though.

162
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,560
You know that roller coaster that is designed to kill you?

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
You mean Phantom's Revenge?

164
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
No.

165
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Sure.

166
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
That's a roller coaster of an experience reading that.

167
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
No, you'll be dead by the end of it.

168
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,560
No, there's an actual roller coaster called Phantom's Revenge.

169
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Oh, I don't know if it's called.

170
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
It's not called Phantom's Revenge.

171
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
I know the thing he's talking about.

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
It pre-exists the video game.

173
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
It pre-exists the famous video game.

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Okay, no, not that one, because the one I'm talking about doesn't exist.

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
It's like a hypothetical, like designed roller coaster.

176
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,560
It's the thing that everybody makes in like roller coaster tycoon as soon as they boot

177
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
up the game.

178
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Yeah, basically.

179
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
What?

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
It's like, let me, I'll look for an image for it, but it's basically has like a huge

181
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
ass like ramp that goes straight up into the air and it has like, it has like enough

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,560
apparently like the loops number that it chooses is enough to straight up kill you.

183
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,560
I saw someone tweeted out recently with the caption, yeah, I would survive this.

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Oh, is it the one where like the loops get smaller and smaller and like the centrifugal

185
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
force gets higher and higher and eventually turns you into a milkshake?

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Yeah, it starts really tall and it goes like a pigtail.

187
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah, I would survive.

188
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
I just wouldn't let it kill me.

189
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Yeah.

190
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Mr. Beast should invent, like create that with his money and then people can see how cool

191
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
they are by surviving the euthanasia coaster.

192
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
That'd be some good content.

193
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Mr. Beast should put transphobes in it.

194
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
I bet it's a painless way to go.

195
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I bet you passed out well before.

196
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Do you feel it when you get turned into a milkshake?

197
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Is that a feeling, you know?

198
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I think you'd have passed out well before it happened.

199
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
There we go.

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
But yeah, basically it's this.

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,560
This is a graph of how you would feel.

202
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,560
In fact, you feel really like really good right at the top and then very quickly becomes

203
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
powerful.

204
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
And then quit, you would alternate rapidly.

205
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,560
You would feel good and bad alternating until you're dead.

206
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
It kind of reminds you of what it is like.

207
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
We're not even sure that if you drop the thumbnails really funny.

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
We're not even sure that if you drop a human into a black hole, they'll even feel it.

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
We're not exactly sure what's going to fucking happen to you.

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,560
Yeah, like if your brain is halfway through the event horizon, do the neurons firing even

211
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
reach the other part of you?

212
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Is that like, is it just like, dude, what the fuck?

213
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,560
I always thought that's a really cool way to go.

214
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,560
There was some sort of anime where they defeat the final guy by dropping his ass into a black hole.

215
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,560
And he's just getting stretched beyond infinite.

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
And is he even feeling it?

217
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Is it even like he's in this in between state of alive or dead?

218
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
It's so confusing.

219
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
I've tried to wrap my head around.

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,560
I've seen so many YouTube videos trying to explain what you would feel at the edge of

221
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,560
a black hole going into it because time stops.

222
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Well, time dilates.

223
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Dilates to a point where it basically is like you don't perceive anything happening.

224
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
So would you just be sitting there?

225
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,560
No, your time would be relatively dilated compared to an outside observer.

226
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,560
I mean, you would experience time for yourself moving normally.

227
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,560
But then like, you know, time would be moving really fast like outside of the event horizon.

228
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,560
You'd be falling in and you'd see like the universe die like outside.

229
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,560
You'd see like the entire universe die.

230
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Well, you wouldn't see anything because light couldn't get in.

231
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Well, no, it can get in though.

232
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
It can get in. It just can't get out.

233
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Interesting.

234
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
That's so cool.

235
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
So like all the photons are like flying in and you've got to like catch them with your eyeball.

236
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Otherwise they'll pass you into the infinite nothing.

237
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah.

238
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
It's the little game.

239
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
You've got to see how many photons you can catch.

240
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
That's right.

241
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Black holes can like get full, can't they?

242
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
And then they explode.

243
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
No.

244
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
When they get full, they go, oh, I'm so full.

245
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Oh, I'm so fast.

246
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
They're stunk.

247
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Wrong.

248
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
No.

249
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I don't think I can eat anymore.

250
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
They can't get full, but they can get empty.

251
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah.

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
What's the thing with the...

253
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,560
It's like a big swoosh of energy like escaping a black hole and making it shrink.

254
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Like the matter inside of it is escaping as some sort of a thing.

255
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
It's not a big swoosh.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,560
It's a very gradual process of, oh, what's the thing?

257
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,560
There's a certain kind of radiation that a black hole does emit.

258
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,560
And a black hole can eventually like radiate away all of its mass.

259
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
That's cool.

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Which you would think it couldn't do, but it does.

261
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
I would survive a black hole.

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
But it's really slow.

263
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I could probably survive a black hole.

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Yeah, I played out to wilds.

265
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I know my way around a black hole.

266
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Yeah, I could escape.

267
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Hawking radiation, hawking radiation.

268
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Deep radiation.

269
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Hypothetical particles formed by a black hole's boundary.

270
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
Yeah, so I could hypothetically survive is what you're saying.

271
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,560
So you're saying it's not 100%.

272
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,560
What if things named after people were named after their first name instead of their last name?

273
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Steve's radiation.

274
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Steven radiation.

275
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
That's like Steven Universe.

276
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah, Steven radiation is Steven.

277
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Yo.

278
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,560
And like Newtons would be Isaacs.

279
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,560
The force of 20 Isaacs.

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I guess it wouldn't change that many things.

281
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
But I just like the idea that it could be a force that is measured in jobs.

282
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
A more casual.

283
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,560
That'd be a pretty funny kind of like naming convention.

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
That'd be a pretty funny alternate reality where everything is the same.

285
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,560
It's just that now we just name things based off people's first names.

286
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
And that's just like the one difference.

287
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Yeah.

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,560
So like the capital of the United States is just called George as is the state.

289
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Yeah.

290
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
I remember there was one story.

291
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,560
I probably mentioned this before about alternate realities.

292
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,560
And the one difference between the reality they jump into is that Bob Dylan didn't create the stage name Bob Dylan.

293
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,560
He just uses regular name instead.

294
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Sad.

295
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
A very disturbing universe.

296
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,560
An evil universe, if you will.

297
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Yeah.

298
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Hey, I watched a movie.

299
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Hey, I watched a movie over Easter.

300
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
No way.

301
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Nate showed me this great film.

302
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
You might have heard of it.

303
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
It's called RRR.

304
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Are you familiar?

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Oh yeah.

306
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I heard it's really good and it's three hours long.

307
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
It is three hours long.

308
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
It should have been longer.

309
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
What is what is this film?

310
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,560
I've heard it is an it is an Indian action drama.

311
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Well, it's like about it's sort of about like real life Indian people.

312
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,560
But it's like a fictionalized version of their lives where it's like they never knew each other in real life.

313
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,560
But the movie is like what if they did meet each other and they were best bros for life and they had anime superpowers.

314
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
And it's so good.

315
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
It's so cool.

316
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:26,560
There's there's big like it's not technically a Bollywood movie because it was made in a different language.

317
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
It's made in the Telugu language, which is not Hindi.

318
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
So it's it's something called Tollywood.

319
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
But you know, it's whatever.

320
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:46,560
It's an Indian movie and it and it's got those Bollywood style like big like Indian dance numbers just in the middle of like action scenes or like just whatever.

321
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,560
There's just a whole bunch of them and it's just so it's so earnest.

322
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,560
It's like to a Western to my Western sensibility.

323
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:14,560
It just comes off as having like absolutely no sense of like irony or like self consciousness about just like just have the characters do a big stupid dance number after they, you know, have a big battle or whatever.

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Wait, but how am I supposed to know when to laugh?

325
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,560
The characters look at the camera and say, um, that just happened.

326
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Um, that just happened.

327
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
You're always supposed to be laughing.

328
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
You're always laughing.

329
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
That's the that's the goal.

330
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,560
The job of the person next to you whenever you're watching it.

331
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Yeah, he's supposed to poke you in the shoulder and say, did you see that?

332
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
That just happened.

333
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Yeah.

334
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Yeah.

335
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Yeah.

336
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Please laugh.

337
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
We don't need we don't need Joss Whedon telling us that just happened.

338
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,560
You're you're annoying friend in the theater.

339
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Can just be did you see what just happened and you go?

340
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
Yeah, shut up.

341
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Trying to watch the movie.

342
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Did you just happen there dancing?

343
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Can you believe that?

344
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I don't know.

345
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
I want to like gush about it.

346
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
I want to like, I want to like spoil it.

347
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I want to tell you all the all the amazing things that happen in RRR.

348
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,560
But like the emotions instead, maybe of like what?

349
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Which experience?

350
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,560
It's it's would you say it's like funny bad good or like actually brilliant?

351
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
It's not it's not.

352
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
No, it's not bad at all.

353
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
It in no way is it bad at all.

354
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Like none of none of my enjoyment of it was ironic.

355
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Like I was I was laughing with the movie because it was very silly at times.

356
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I like those.

357
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
But it's silly in a way that just made me clap.

358
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,560
It just made me clap and go just maybe clap and jump out of my seat and go.

359
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes.

360
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Yes.

361
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Sounds sounds good.

362
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
How do you spell it?

363
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,560
Is it just the letter?

364
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
It's the letter RRR.

365
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I guess it technically stands for rise roar revolt.

366
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,560
In them, but in the move in the movie, there's like there's there's like chapter beginning that are like.

367
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Okay, so the characters are like it starts with one that's like story and the R is big in story.

368
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,560
And then they introduce this one character who is the fire and the R is big.

369
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,560
And then there's another character who's the water and the R is big.

370
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
But that's not what the R stands for.

371
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
It's awesome.

372
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,560
They just like our they just they just like the R is there a pirate that goes R.

373
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
There is not a pirate.

374
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh, there is not a pirate.

375
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
I really do want to watch it.

377
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
But there is a jungle man.

378
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
There is a jungle man.

379
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Which is like a pirate.

380
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Jungle man.

381
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Jungle children.

382
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
You know, children from the jungle.

383
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Children from a book.

384
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm trying to think of what can I even what can I say without the without.

385
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
What can I say that hasn't already been said?

386
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Would you say the unforgettable moments?

387
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Would you say that your hatred of people with melanin?

388
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Like you probably change your mind on it.

389
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Like you probably like people with melanin now.

390
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
It made me.

391
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,560
It made me think maybe they have a chance.

392
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Maybe maybe they maybe maybe there's something to these.

393
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Maybe there's something to these brown people.

394
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Maybe maybe some brown people are cool.

395
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You know, sometimes like how some white people are cool sometimes.

396
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
You know, the movies basically about how white people are bad.

397
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
True base.

398
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
This is very woke.

399
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
This is very, very woke film.

400
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
That's awesome.

401
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,560
Kind of reminds me how every time I pick up a passenger who's like Indian or like a darker shade of skin.

402
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
I raise my fist in a brown power.

403
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I tell him, you know, have a brown pride.

404
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
United together.

405
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
You pull out.

406
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,560
You know that shot of the guy hold in family guy, the guy holding out the skin color guide.

407
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Yeah.

408
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
That's like if you're lighter than this, you're a tourist.

409
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
If you're darker than this, you're a terrorist or something.

410
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Yeah.

411
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
You pull it.

412
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
You make it.

413
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
You make a fist.

414
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
You pull out the guide.

415
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
If you're lighter than this, you punch them.

416
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
And if you're darker than this, you fist bump.

417
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Nice.

418
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I think I think it I think it makes a lot of sense.

419
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Cheesy.

420
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Were you the driver in that story?

421
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah.

422
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Oh, I thought I thought the driver gave gave you weed.

423
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,560
And I thought that seems a bit odd.

424
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
You know, I'm I was the driver.

425
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
The passenger gave me weed.

426
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
That's nice.

427
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Yeah.

428
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
I mean, I thought it was either way.

429
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Yeah.

430
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,560
So, you know, I got I got paid and I got weed, which is pretty great.

431
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Because I kind of, you know, I'm low.

432
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm probably not going to smoke it until like I do another round of pre-orders.

433
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
That's usually trying to get really stressed out.

434
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
It counts.

435
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:59,560
The I just OK, give remember when you and Munchie reviewed s cry Ed and you did a terrible job and you completely and you

436
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,560
completely like a normal person would and I was like, huh, what's going on?

437
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
You watched it.

438
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
You want first of all, the whole premise of three episodes terrible.

439
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,560
You literally did not even get to understand what the show is about.

440
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
The show is about.

441
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Unlikely video, how to tell a bad anime from one episode.

442
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,560
We will give us we would be in generous.

443
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
S cry Ed.

444
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:31,560
S cry Ed is about an unlikely bromance between the two biggest badasses in the world and they're opposing

445
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,560
ideological philosophies.

446
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
And you didn't even get to that part.

447
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
But that's but that's what RRR is like.

448
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,560
It's like s cry Ed, but Indian and good, actually, even though I like s cry Ed.

449
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
So, yeah.

450
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't know.

451
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,560
There's there's you'll be you'll be sold in the field be sold in the first 15 minutes.

452
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,560
If you if you turn it on, I think there's a establishes right out the gate.

453
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
What kind of movie are in for?

454
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I really can't really can't say enough good things about it.

455
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
It showed me that movies can be good, actually.

456
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Nice.

457
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,560
That's that was me when I watched the Mario movie.

458
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I was like, oh, movies can be good now.

459
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
I guess it JK.

460
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,560
I guess it won a an Oscar despite being from India.

461
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,560
It won an American won an Oscar for like one of the musical numbers in a fair world.

462
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,560
It probably it should have been like up for like best picture.

463
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
I mean, I'm no expert.

464
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,560
I mean, it was it was my movie of 2023, even though it came out last year, I guess.

465
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,560
But it would probably it would have been my movie of 2022 as well.

466
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,560
You haven't seen them.

467
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
You haven't seen everything everywhere.

468
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
All at once.

469
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
You know, I did see it.

470
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
No, I liked our no, I definitely liked our better than everything everywhere.

471
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Everything everywhere was like fine.

472
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
It was good.

473
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I enjoyed it.

474
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,560
I thought it was very I thought it was a very twee twee, which I am not a huge fan of.

475
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Damn.

476
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,560
I thought the met I thought the metaphor was a little strained.

477
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
You know, it was OK.

478
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
It was good.

479
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
It's a good movie.

480
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah, I really liked everything everywhere.

481
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,560
You must prefer RR is even better than must be a good year for movies.

482
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Ben clearly has a favorite of Asian.

483
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
He prefers East Asians.

484
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I feel like I feel like everything everywhere.

485
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
I don't know.

486
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,560
It felt like it was really trying to like tell you something like it really thought it had some something to say.

487
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:40,560
RRR doesn't have anything to say except India fucking rules and fuck the British and well, that's an anime is awesome.

488
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
It's probably got something to say.

489
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
It does.

490
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Yeah, it definitely does.

491
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,560
The end of the movie is like a big dance.

492
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,560
It's like a big dance scene and even like and the director of the movie starts dancing with all the characters.

493
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:06,560
While like pictures of like Indian like political like revolutionary figures like are like scrolling by in the background.

494
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Yeah, no, the movies the movies got politics that I don't understand because I don't know who these people are.

495
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,560
That's really cool.

496
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
It is pretty cool.

497
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:22,560
I wish more people would do that where like they would the cast and crew would start dancing.

498
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
That it was cool.

499
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
It's like it's like it's like it's very silly.

500
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
They don't do that in America.

501
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
They don't do that in Hollywood movies.

502
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Yeah.

503
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,560
They like imagine if the imagine if the Avengers just started like doing like an Irish jig.

504
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
They just all started doing like a big jig.

505
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:46,560
But Ben, you never you never seen the show a peacemaker because that's the intro of the show is them.

506
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Is all the cast members doing like dancing to a glam rock song.

507
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
It's a pretty good intro.

508
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Cool.

509
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah.

510
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Cool.

511
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
I like it.

512
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Okay.

513
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll watch our just three hours.

514
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
So busy.

515
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I can't I can't recommend it enough.

516
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
It's it's three it's three hours.

517
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,560
It felt like it felt like two or one hour per hour.

518
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
One hour per hour.

519
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
That's right.

520
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Didn't did.

521
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Yeah, earned every minute of it.

522
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
I would I would even watch it again.

523
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,560
I don't like rewatch movies, but I would I would watch it again.

524
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,560
That's how that's how serious I am about the quality of this film.

525
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Ben rewatching a movie.

526
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
I know.

527
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
I know.

528
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
That's that's how serious.

529
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
I can't wait.

530
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Is that John Cena?

531
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Yeah, John Cena's peacemaker.

532
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
His mask is on crooked.

533
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
His face is no the mask is straight.

534
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
The face is crooked.

535
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
Yeah, I love this intro.

536
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
It's pretty good.

537
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I forget the name of the kind of like animation where there's like a little

538
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
there's like anime characters.

539
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,560
People use it when they kind of make like little Miku music videos,

540
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,560
but I wish someone would like create a template out of this and you can just

541
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,560
put your characters dancing to it or something.

542
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I think it I just think it would work perfectly and probably catch on.

543
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,560
But alas, I do not have the time.

544
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I'm watching this peacemaker opening credits.

545
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
I will say RRR has better moves.

546
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Definitely.

547
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Not bad.

548
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
You know, these are all white people.

549
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
These are all white people, unfortunately.

550
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
This is white culture.

551
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
This is white.

552
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Well, glam rock is like a pretty pretty white.

553
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
That's that's true.

554
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
There's one there's one.

555
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Unfortunately, the one blemish on the on RRR is that there is one good white.

556
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Nice.

557
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
But she's not but she's not that important.

558
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,560
There's only one good white person kind of like in Black Panther.

559
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
They have they have a good white CIA member.

560
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:55,560
She's there's one there's one good British person and it's a lady who is

561
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,560
maybe the maybe the maybe the dumbest part of the movie.

562
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Damn.

563
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Maybe the part that I think is the dumbest, but it's OK.

564
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
It's fine.

565
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,560
That's funny.

566
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
She is nice and but she gets she gets to dance.

567
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
So, you know, good for her.

568
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
That's good.

569
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Yeah, I feel I feel represented.

570
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Um, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

571
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Shut up.

572
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Okay.

573
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
You got nothing to say.

574
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Don't say duh.

575
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
All right.

576
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
That's the end of the episode.

577
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Goodbye.

578
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I got nothing.

579
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
I got nothing.

580
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I want to talk about comics for a little bit.

581
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Little bit of those comics have been working on Clarissa chapter five now,

582
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
but it's been a little bit of rocky.

583
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,560
I've I've I've gotten, you know, I don't know what it was.

584
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I put the first volume on Amazon.com and I got some purchases and it was so cool.

585
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
And I was just sort of looking at that.

586
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,560
And then, you know, the the money stopped, you know, the people stopped buying it.

587
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
I'm like, OK, so that's the people who know about it.

588
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
They've got it.

589
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,560
I should probably like try to market it more often, make some noise about it.

590
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Yeah.

591
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
As I'm working.

592
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Yeah.

593
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,560
And I was like, I don't know why this was so strangely difficult.

594
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I think it might be an ADHD thing.

595
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I've heard like this sort of thing is might be an ADHD sort of thing.

596
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:35,560
But like, I was I was having this plan of like going to post every page from Clarissa

597
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Facebook on my Twitter and Tumblr and Instagram, just posting the page one per day and then

598
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,560
having a link to where you can read it and buy stuff.

599
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
And I'm like, I could schedule tweets like that.

600
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I could just put them all up there.

601
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
And that would be so easy.

602
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
It would be the easiest thing in the world.

603
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,560
And I don't know why I couldn't do it.

604
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I was just it was staring me in the face.

605
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
It was like the most the least amount of work I could do.

606
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,560
You'd have to schedule several hundred tweets.

607
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Right.

608
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Like it's more like 60 67 at this point.

609
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:18,560
But like it's like for you post four pages for each tweet and just put it in a thread.

610
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I could do that.

611
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
But then it would be less.

612
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
It would be less.

613
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,560
I mean, it's probably a smarter thing to have more more pages.

614
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
But I don't know.

615
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Some pages are not that interesting.

616
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:35,560
But I think one page just because if they're too small, then like you can't see them when

617
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
you're scrolling past the small thumbnails.

618
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
And I think one page is fine.

619
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,560
That's that's not I mean, that's like probably going to take you like a couple hours to do

620
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
like 67.

621
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Well, it's not that easy.

622
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,560
I mean, no, but like even doing one, I was thinking, OK, well, maybe if I don't schedule

623
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,560
them, maybe if I just put one up to get the ball rolling and I couldn't do it, I was like

624
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
sort of freaking out.

625
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
It was a weird experience.

626
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Did you not want did you not actually want to do it?

627
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,560
I wanted to do it and it was it would be so easy.

628
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:14,560
And like every bone in my body was saying, nah, and I don't I didn't get it.

629
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
It was very odd.

630
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,560
And so I had a sort of maybe I was depressed.

631
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I didn't even really feel like I was.

632
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,560
But I've been slowly grinding my bones into a fine mist.

633
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,560
And now I'm getting back to doing some some actual line art for the new chapter, at least

634
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
that something is getting done.

635
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
That's good.

636
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I I did not I did not finish Biscopades.

637
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Like I said, I might I did do some more.

638
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,560
But I didn't I didn't finish it.

639
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,560
You were talking in the chat like the chapter is nearly done.

640
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
What did you mean by that?

641
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
In the chat.

642
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Just a few minutes ago before the few minutes ago.

643
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
In the DM to me.

644
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Almost done with the new chapter.

645
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Of one piece.

646
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Oh, whoops.

647
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
No, I have I have some more Biscopades page.

648
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,560
I think I have like.

649
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Seven more pages or something.

650
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Didn't didn't didn't get to spend all my time working on them this past two weeks.

651
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Like I maybe it would have liked to.

652
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,560
But, you know, it's getting there.

653
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,560
No, I know I was talking about the one piece chapter, which I has been out for a while.

654
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
It's been out for a while.

655
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
There was a break last week.

656
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,560
So by the time this episode comes out, there'll be a chapter.

657
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,560
That we will not talk about.

658
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Great.

659
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Good scheduling.

660
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
We're really, we're really, we're really on the ball.

661
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I guess we should we should mention why there was no episode because we didn't actually say.

662
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
I just wasn't here.

663
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,560
You weren't here for, I guess I assume Easter meetup or something.

664
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,560
I went to my family house for Easter and I wasn't at my computer.

665
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Yeah.

666
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
And I could have done a gift cusp.

667
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I didn't really feel like it.

668
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,560
I was also celebrating and mostly.

669
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
I like now that the weather has changed a little bit.

670
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah.

671
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,560
And I just wanted to spend my whole Sunday just lying in sunbeams.

672
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,560
I wanted to go outside and have the sun on my face.

673
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,560
And I would look up at to it with my eyes closed and be like, oh, yes.

674
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Yes.

675
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Oh, yeah.

676
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Oh, yeah.

677
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
It was winter.

678
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
That's the best feeling.

679
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,560
It was winter like four days ago and then three days ago.

680
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
It was like 80 degrees at night.

681
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,560
I was walking around in a t-shirt in shorts in the evening.

682
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Yeah.

683
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
That's too hot.

684
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
It didn't feel like 80.

685
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,560
During the day it was kind of hot, but it didn't feel like 80 at night.

686
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,560
The weather said it was, but it was like walk around comfortably in t-shirt weather.

687
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
It was great.

688
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Now it's not that one.

689
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
It's a little bit breezy.

690
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,560
It's a bit like a random storm will come through and hail.

691
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
And then it'll be like five minutes later.

692
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
It'll be nice and bright and sunny.

693
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,560
It's been a nice time to be outside and looking up at the clouds and be like, oh,

694
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,560
imagine if there was a skypea up there or something.

695
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Imagine if there's a skypea at me.

696
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,560
That's like, you know those pictures that are like regular people versus creative people?

697
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah.

698
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh, yeah.

699
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,560
And they just have like a bit of hair dye.

700
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,560
It's like the creative person, it's like the girl is watching her chicken roast in the

701
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,560
oven, but the creative girl has pink hair and is imagining that a dragon is cooking

702
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,560
the chicken in the oven with its fire breath.

703
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
That's you, creative people.

704
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Yeah.

705
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
It's like you.

706
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
I look at big clouds and I'm like, oh, yeah.

707
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
So cool.

708
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
What if there was a man living on them?

709
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
What if there was a little guy up there?

710
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I mean, unironically though, sometimes a cloud looks like you could climb it.

711
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
It's a snowy mountain.

712
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Sure.

713
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
And that's, I just like looking at it.

714
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I just like drooling, like dumb, like duh, like looking up.

715
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
That's me.

716
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,560
That's where I want to be in life.

717
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Well, you can't.

718
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,560
What a creative person.

719
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah, that's so creative of you.

720
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I'm so creative.

721
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Normal people look down at their shoes all day.

722
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
They don't look up.

723
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
They don't see the real world.

724
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Normal people look down at their phone and watch pornography.

725
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Like Pokemon pornography.

726
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Yes.

727
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Yes.

728
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Disgusting.

729
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Kids these days are more interested in seeing Pikachu choke on a 12 inch cop instead of

730
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,560
looking at the sky where the real beauty lies.

731
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,560
They look up and see God choking on a 12 inch cop.

732
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,560
It's like it says in the Bible.

733
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Oh, the beautiful bird song.

734
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Beautiful bird dong.

735
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Man, I'm not in any comics.

736
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,560
I think the last one I drew was my Jesus comic for Easter.

737
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,560
You know what you haven't done, Cheesy?

738
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
What?

739
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,560
I haven't done my voice in Pagliacci.

740
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Where's the voice Pagliacci?

741
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I'm working on it.

742
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
You were so in a rush.

743
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,560
You're like, Ben, you got to give me that voice.

744
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,560
If I don't get that voice, it's going to throw a wrench in the whole works.

745
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
I did say.

746
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
And I slaved over it.

747
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
I did say those.

748
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
Those were my exact words.

749
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Yes, that's true.

750
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Just for you.

751
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Just to keep this machine well oiled and running.

752
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,560
But then what you got to understand is that I owe I owe money to Fredo taxes.

753
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,560
And I'm currently doing double shift over here so I can pay them.

754
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Fuck.

755
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Yeah, I forgot it's tax.

756
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
It's tax day in like two days.

757
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Yes, it is.

758
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
I haven't done him.

759
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Wait, really?

760
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Oh, wow.

761
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Yeah, whatever.

762
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah, whatever.

763
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I'll just file for an extension, maybe if I can.

764
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,560
I am when I went to my tax guy, I showed him like everything last last year,

765
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,560
which was my humble linear.

766
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,560
I showed him how much like how much money I didn't make.

767
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,560
And he's all like, wow, so basically just running everything on a loss.

768
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
And I'm like, haha.

769
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
Didn't.

770
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Yeah.

771
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Didn't you?

772
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Oh, did you not have like taxes withheld from your pay checks or whatever?

773
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,560
No, you don't you don't get a rebate.

774
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Okay.

775
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
All right.

776
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I don't either.

777
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Yeah.

778
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,440
So yeah, but he but luckily my tax guys is pretty chill guy.

779
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,440
He his office is covered in like little G.I. Joe figures.

780
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I don't know if I talked about this guy before, but I don't think so.

781
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
He's pretty cool.

782
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Yeah.

783
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
His office is covered in G.I. Joe figures.

784
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,440
He would makes like little custom ones where he like him and him and me part of the G.I.

785
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Joe figure community.

786
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,440
They just give each other little parts and then glue them together.

787
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
The G.I. Joe figure community.

788
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
Yep.

789
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
They make like the GI bros.

790
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
The GI bros.

791
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Yeah.

792
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Little custom figures for characters and whatnot.

793
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,440
He really likes my comic and all the shit that I do.

794
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,440
So he'd be like, yeah, you're running everything at a loss, but you know, that's how that's

795
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
how it is when you're working on your dreams.

796
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Like, haha.

797
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Yeah.

798
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Yeah.

799
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
I guess.

800
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
I guess.

801
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
I guess that's how it is, huh?

802
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
That's sex.

803
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Yeah.

804
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,440
You just got to pick yourself up by your bootstraps.

805
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
I guess.

806
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Yeah.

807
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
You have to fling yourself up by your bootstraps.

808
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,440
You got to like, like David and Goliath swing yourself around by your bootstraps.

809
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,440
And then we got to right into the eye of the giant.

810
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,440
You have to fling yourself right into the giant yourself.

811
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,440
You got to escape orbit by your bootstraps.

812
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
True.

813
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
True that.

814
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
You got to have the eye of the tiger.

815
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
I am.

816
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Yeah.

817
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,440
But killing tigers is illegal.

818
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Who said that?

819
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
Is anyone important?

820
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Did any person, any relevant person say that?

821
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
That's what I thought.

822
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Uh-oh.

823
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Um, what are we doing here?

824
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
What are we doing?

825
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
What are we talking about?

826
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Let's go.

827
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Let's go.

828
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Well, I was talking about comics.

829
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
This comic.

830
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
This is the last comic I made.

831
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,440
And it pissed off a lot of, there's so many angry Christians at me on TikTok.

832
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Are they really?

833
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Yes.

834
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Some of them are speaking in Polish to me and they're mad.

835
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Who has time for this?

836
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Who has time for this?

837
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
I don't know.

838
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
This is so silly for a thing to get people really mad.

839
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
It is.

840
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,440
Yeah, it's really funny.

841
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,440
And it was kind of a banger because it made me jump up by 100 followers on TikTok when

842
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
I did it.

843
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
It's pretty good.

844
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Yeah, it's pretty good.

845
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Do you know this meme, Ben?

846
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,440
The Annie Man Studio meme.

847
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,440
It's like, it's an animated something or other.

848
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
It's like a...

849
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,440
These guys walk in and it's got a huge butt and they look at it.

850
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
But I don't know if that's in context.

851
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:31,440
There's this South American studio called Annie Man and they do animated gay porn, right?

852
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Yeah.

853
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,440
But they kind of do it in a classic cartoon style for some reason.

854
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Okay.

855
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,440
And their intros are very funny and there's one where there's like a black man with a

856
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,440
huge ass and he's walking down the street and all the other men are all going at him.

857
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,440
And they're following him and they're all bobbing to the head of the beat of the song.

858
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Right?

859
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
Okay, sure.

860
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Yeah.

861
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,440
And they eventually get into an elevator with him and they go up to some sort of hotel room

862
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,440
where they all have gay sex with him but they're all still dancing.

863
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Like they're still doing like a little dance while they're having gay sex.

864
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Sure.

865
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Sure, beautiful.

866
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Yeah.

867
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,440
It's a beautiful courtship ritual.

868
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,440
So why do you tell me all this for?

869
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
What's the...

870
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
What's the...

871
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Oh, it's just the most recent comic.

872
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,440
Okay, so this is that but it's Jesus.

873
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Yeah, it's that by Jesus.

874
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Okay.

875
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
The Romans are fine.

876
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,440
You know, it's an outside the box concept and I appreciate it.

877
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Thank you.

878
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,440
It's just like how it was when it happened.

879
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Yeah, it is as it was as the Pope says that one time.

880
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Oh.

881
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
It's the original of it.

882
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Forgis on the Jeep?

883
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,440
That's the line from the song that they use in the meme.

884
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,440
There's a song called Ballin' and they use like a sped up version of that song for the

885
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,440
meme and it just kind of works.

886
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Oh, this looks terrible.

887
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Yeah.

888
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Yeah.

889
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Okay.

890
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,440
Yeah, you think it was a good looking gay boy?

891
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I don't know.

892
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
This is like the proud thing.

893
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
The bad.

894
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
The bad.

895
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Bare-chested is like they drew the whole thing.

896
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
I love the...

897
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Like each frame and it's all jerky.

898
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,440
I love the scene where like once they get up to the hotel room he like does it like a

899
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,440
funny spin and he takes off all his clothes.

900
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,440
I like all the guys in top hats and the wife and the big floofy just like appalled, like

901
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
dropping their monocles.

902
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Like, well, good heavens.

903
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Good heavens.

904
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:51,440
This man walking down the street with like the biggest, thickest ass ever.

905
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Yeah, so people have been using this as kind of like a meme template.

906
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
Gotcha.

907
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,440
This is me putting my hat into the ring.

908
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Gorgas on the jeep.

909
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Putting your crown of thorns into the ring.

910
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Yeah.

911
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Jesus has risen.

912
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
He has made me rise.

913
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
You know what I'm saying?

914
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Everyone was saying like, oh, this is blasphemy.

915
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
You're going to hell.

916
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Someone said like, do you not know what Jesus did for you?

917
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,440
I retweeted a tweet that I thought was really funny on Easter where a guy just says like,

918
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:34,440
yeah, in the Bible, in the New Testament, there's a part where some of the apostles,

919
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
they meet some guy.

920
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,440
The guy's name is Nathaniel and they tell Nathaniel like, hey, the savior is here.

921
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
We got him.

922
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,440
And he's a guy from Nazareth.

923
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,440
The guy says like, Nazareth sucks.

924
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
No, he's not.

925
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Why would he be from Nazareth?

926
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Nazareth sucks ass.

927
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
And they're like, no, no, come on, come on.

928
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,440
And then later when Jesus meets Nathaniel, he says like, this guy knows exactly what's

929
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
up.

930
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Like this guy is so on the level.

931
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:09,440
He's totally right about everything, including my hometown of Nazareth being a shithole.

932
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Pretty good.

933
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Pretty good.

934
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
I guess.

935
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
I guess like, I guess like he was not prophesized to come.

936
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,440
He was prophesized to come from Bethlehem.

937
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,440
This is a point I was not clear on before.

938
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,440
I guess the prophecy was he would come from Bethlehem and Nazareth is like near ish Bethlehem.

939
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,440
So like, it's as if it's as if it's as if they said, oh yeah, the savior will be born

940
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,440
in Boston, but then he was born in like Lowell instead.

941
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah.

942
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
That's how you know.

943
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Close enough, I guess.

944
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
That's how you know they're fucking lying to you.

945
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,440
Oh, that's how you would be born in Boston.

946
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Yeah.

947
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Okay.

948
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Whatever you say, buddy.

949
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
Right.

950
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Sure.

951
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Right.

952
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I've been kind of in like an anti-Christian mood as of late.

953
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Correct.

954
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
But, but cheesy.

955
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
What about your soul?

956
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Oops.

957
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Oh, oopsie.

958
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Oh, oh, oh, damn.

959
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Oh, shit.

960
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I didn't even consider it.

961
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh, no, no.

962
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
Pray.

963
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Pray now.

964
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Pray, pray, pray.

965
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
You gotta pray the soul.

966
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Oh, father out in heaven.

967
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
Please don't put me in hell.

968
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Please, please, pretty please don't put me in hell.

969
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
No.

970
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,440
But what I mean is I've been in my private server.

971
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
I'm doing an art challenge where you're supposed to take like a superhero.

972
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,440
You do like the evil version of them.

973
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
And you kind of go in whatever direction you want with it.

974
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,440
So I was thinking like, okay, what if I did the fantastic four, but they're like religious

975
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,440
zealots, you know, instead of like scientists and like having a pro profit organization,

976
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,440
they're just like, that sounds like something that laserbot would make.

977
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Yeah.

978
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,440
And they're, and they're called the fateful four is like their name now.

979
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
And I drew like the majority of them already.

980
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Here's, here's my Mr. Fantastic.

981
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
I call them father flesh.

982
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Like a melty gross.

983
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Yeah.

984
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
All of them are disgusting.

985
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
All of them are kind of like body horror themes.

986
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Here's the, he's like evil invisible woman right here.

987
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Call her a mother transparency.

988
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Yep.

989
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Mother transparency.

990
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
That's cute.

991
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,440
I reminds me of that one Pokemon.

992
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
The ultra beast one.

993
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Yes.

994
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
The rock, the rock poison one.

995
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
Nile ego.

996
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
Yeah.

997
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,440
I think I am going to like do like if I were to draw more of this interpretation of the

998
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,440
character, because she has like four shield power, you could do like kind of like four

999
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
shield kind of like tentacle shit.

1000
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
So it looks more like a jellyfish.

1001
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
Yeah.

1002
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,440
Yeah.

1003
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
And I was cool.

1004
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
This is cool.

1005
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I got a, this is the evil human tour.

1006
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,440
She called this one the human pyre.

1007
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Oh, these are cool.

1008
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
These are pretty good.

1009
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,440
And I'm pretty good.

1010
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Currently working on the evil thing, but I'm not too married to this design.

1011
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,440
I might change this around.

1012
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
He's like, um,

1013
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,440
Yeah, it's hard because like, how do you turn a thing, a monstrous rock thing into invert it?

1014
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah.

1015
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
Wait, I've got it.

1016
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I've got it.

1017
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I've got it.

1018
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
He's not made of rocks.

1019
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
No, no, no, no, no.

1020
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Wait, he's made of rock.

1021
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
The dome of the rock.

1022
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,440
The Islamic shrine in Jerusalem.

1023
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Oh my God.

1024
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
What does that look like?

1025
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Hold up.

1026
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,440
It just kind of looks like a domed mosque.

1027
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Is that the Minecraft cube?

1028
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
Oh.

1029
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Oh, it is.

1030
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
It's the Minecraft cube.

1031
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
It's the golden dome.

1032
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
It's the golden Jewish dome.

1033
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
Oh, the other thing.

1034
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Well, these guys are supposed to be like.

1035
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
Well, it's Islamic.

1036
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,440
These guys are supposed to be like Christian-esque, right?

1037
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
Yeah.

1038
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Okay.

1039
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
Yeah.

1040
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
All right.

1041
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm going off theme.

1042
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,440
When I drew the Jesus with the big ass,

1043
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
someone's like, okay, now do Mohammed.

1044
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
And I'm like, I have no idea what the fuck Mohammed does.

1045
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
And I wouldn't.

1046
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
Because.

1047
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
He moved a mountain.

1048
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Didn't he?

1049
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,440
Did he?

1050
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
People like to.

1051
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Or maybe.

1052
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
People like to do the whole.

1053
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,440
He like had like a child bride.

1054
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
Yeah.

1055
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
I mean, I definitely.

1056
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,440
Yeah.

1057
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Definitely heard about that one.

1058
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
That was his greatest miracle.

1059
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
What do you want me to do about that?

1060
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
That happened like millions of years ago.

1061
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Draw his child's bride admiring his gigantic ass.

1062
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,440
Draw his legally aged child bride.

1063
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Oh, the.

1064
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440
The.

1065
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Yes.

1066
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
The cube.

1067
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440
The cube.

1068
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,440
I forget what the cube is called.

1069
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
The cube is great.

1070
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,440
I love that.

1071
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,440
I love that they have a cube, you know.

1072
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Yeah.

1073
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
Yeah.

1074
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
It's good.

1075
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,440
And you have to like point in that direction.

1076
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,440
It's crazy.

1077
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
Oh no.

1078
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Enderman.

1079
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
No.

1080
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Someone should do.

1081
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
You can't steal it.

1082
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,440
You have to do a transformer movie where the cube is a transformer.

1083
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Like it's.

1084
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
It's like another all spark.

1085
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Like we found it.

1086
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Yeah.

1087
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,440
And they use it to power their ship.

1088
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
We found.

1089
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
It's just a cool looking.

1090
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
It's just a cool looking item.

1091
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
It's a cool.

1092
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,440
Exactly.

1093
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,440
And it's like what's great about it is that there isn't like a bleeding guy on it.

1094
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
You know.

1095
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
That's what.

1096
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Yeah.

1097
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,440
True.

1098
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,440
Yeah.

1099
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,440
True.

1100
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
That would suck.

1101
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
He was bleeding.

1102
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
Oh, he died.

1103
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
He was bleeding.

1104
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Oh, gee whiz.

1105
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Well, I didn't know.

1106
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
He's he's a martyr.

1107
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
He's a martyr.

1108
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,440
God, I fucking hate martyrs.

1109
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,440
Remember how you remember how they owned our God so hard?

1110
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
We remember.

1111
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
He came back though.

1112
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
He came back.

1113
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,440
Oh, Ben did come back.

1114
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Ben, do you not know what Jesus did for you?

1115
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,440
I do know because I just rewatched that the Jenny Nicholson video about the church plays,

1116
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,440
including the one where they crucify Batman on the bat signal.

1117
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
That's crazy.

1118
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
That's that's the real shit.

1119
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,440
Batman does that in one of the movies, but to a criminal, he puts his body on the giant

1120
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,440
like spotlight.

1121
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,440
So it's so Batman kind of crucified him.

1122
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,440
So Batman's like anti-Christian, if you will.

1123
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:11,440
You know that scene in Digimon where they're crucifying not Gabumon, the wolf one.

1124
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Yeah, I thought the wolf one was Gabumon.

1125
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,440
Is it Gabumon?

1126
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Yeah.

1127
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,440
That's not a misremembering.

1128
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Garurumon, that's the only one I remember.

1129
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
It is Gabumon.

1130
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Yeah, Gabumon evolves into Garurumon, which evolves into where Garurumon?

1131
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Which evolves into metal Garurumon?

1132
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,440
And then ultimate Garurumon.

1133
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Probably.

1134
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,440
And then mega Garurumon or something.

1135
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,440
I always remember that they had an ultimate form, but then beyond ultimate is mega, which

1136
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
doesn't make sense.

1137
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Ultimate would imply it's the most.

1138
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
There he is.

1139
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I like how he's kind of holding his own paw.

1140
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,440
Is this an Ultraman reference?

1141
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,440
He's clearly like he's a dinosaur wearing like a wolf skin.

1142
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I like that.

1143
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
Wow, I've never thought of that before, but that is what it is.

1144
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
That's definitely what it is.

1145
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,440
It's weird compared to like Agumon, who is just a dinosaur.

1146
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:17,440
Gabumon, who is like the two of them are like the two iconic ones from that series.

1147
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,440
One of them is just like a way more busy, complicated concept.

1148
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Yeah, I completely forgot he had that stomach tattoo.

1149
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,440
He's got the second pair of paws from the skin.

1150
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
And a unicorn horn.

1151
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Yeah, the unicorn horn.

1152
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,440
Some of these stuff could be removed, you know?

1153
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Yeah.

1154
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,440
That's probably why they crucified him.

1155
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Didn't remember that belly tattoo.

1156
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
What's going on with that?

1157
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,440
What's going on there?

1158
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,440
He's like a freak.

1159
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
He is a freak.

1160
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,440
All these 17 different colors on him.

1161
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,440
None of this is working for me.

1162
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
That's why they crucified him.

1163
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
Nice.

1164
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
Yeah, we had it coming really.

1165
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,440
To take off the wolf skin, never.

1166
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,440
I'll die first, and then he did.

1167
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,440
For our sins.

1168
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,440
Oh, boy.

1169
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Yeah.

1170
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Oh, wait, here's Naked.

1171
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
Here's Naked Garumon.

1172
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
I think I've seen this.

1173
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
For your pleasure.

1174
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Dumpy little guy.

1175
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,440
It looks like a chicken nugget.

1176
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:39,440
You know, without the fur, my eyes are drawn even more to his weird belly, and I don't understand.

1177
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,440
It's like the only part of his body that has blue on it compared to the rest of his eye.

1178
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Right.

1179
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Yeah, I don't mind that he has a fur coat over himself.

1180
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
It looks rad.

1181
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
It's not a terrible idea in concept, but like...

1182
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,440
The unicorn horn is like, I mean, I get it.

1183
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
It kind of adds a little bit more to the silhouette.

1184
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
Imagine trying to draw him.

1185
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,440
Imagine being a kid and trying to draw Garumon.

1186
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,440
Oh, I don't need to imagine.

1187
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,440
I would never try to draw this guy, because he was like the worst.

1188
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,440
I like drawing the...

1189
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,440
I mean, honestly, this guy is...

1190
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
The one that turns into the, oh, what's it, Palmon.

1191
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Palmon turns into the giant, like, Final Fantasy.

1192
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Patamon.

1193
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Patamon.

1194
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
Yeah.

1195
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
No.

1196
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,440
I thought it was Palmon.

1197
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,440
Wait, which one's Palmon?

1198
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Yeah, the...

1199
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
It's not Palmon.

1200
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,440
It's the one Palmon turns into.

1201
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Oh, the one that turns into Farimon, or Lilliman.

1202
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
This fucking...

1203
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
It's the Final Fantasy guy.

1204
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,440
The Final Fantasy cactus.

1205
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Yes.

1206
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
Okay, I did like...

1207
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,440
I thought you meant Patamon who becomes Anjuman.

1208
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,440
That was my favorite.

1209
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,440
I did like Patamon.

1210
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,440
I like Lilliman.

1211
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,440
I liked...

1212
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,440
I liked Anjuman because it reminded me of Yu-Gi-Oh.

1213
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,440
That was a Yu-Gi-Oh card.

1214
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
I liked...

1215
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,440
I liked...

1216
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,440
I don't even remember their names, but...

1217
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Joey's the one that turns...

1218
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,440
The ultimate form of Joey's one,

1219
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,440
that is, like, the big walrus with, like, the turtle shell

1220
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
and the giant...

1221
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,440
Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1222
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
That one was pretty cool.

1223
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
I liked Garudaman, the...

1224
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,440
What was the bug's one?

1225
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Kabuteremon?

1226
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,440
Ultracabu...

1227
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,440
I think it was Kabuteremon was the bug.

1228
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
Tentamon.

1229
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Yes.

1230
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,440
This was my favorite design, actually, I remember.

1231
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Because it was like...

1232
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
It was basically aliens, but for kids.

1233
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,440
Oh, because it was so fucking fucked up.

1234
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
Oh, okay.

1235
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,440
I wanted an action figure this time.

1236
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,440
You meant the Xenomorph.

1237
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
I thought it was alien for kids,

1238
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,440
and I was like,

1239
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
what's so, like, arerated about aliens?

1240
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,440
Oh, no, yeah.

1241
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Xenomorph for kids.

1242
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
Yeah.

1243
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
That was a really cool design.

1244
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Man.

1245
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,440
I was talking to people about, like,

1246
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,440
why Digimon never caught on in the West

1247
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
as much as, like, Pokemon did.

1248
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,440
And I think Pokemon did a lot of pretty genius things

1249
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,440
without simple things, you know?

1250
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,440
Like, with Digimon, it's kind of like,

1251
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
we just really have one,

1252
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
and you just kind of go back and forth

1253
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,440
between the stages of it, right?

1254
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,440
But with, like, Pokemon, you get, like, a team, you know?

1255
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,440
And, like, the world...

1256
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
You can catch them all.

1257
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,440
Yeah, and the world kind of makes, like,

1258
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,440
even though they're both fantasy worlds,

1259
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
the world kind of makes a little bit more sense

1260
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
in Pokemon, where it's like, oh, the Pokemon

1261
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
are just, like, they're animals, you know?

1262
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
Like, their world has animals.

1263
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,440
These are the animals of this world,

1264
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,440
and you can, like, just catch them.

1265
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
Digimon is basically an isekai,

1266
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,440
whereas Pokemon is, like,

1267
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,440
there's just...

1268
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
There's no isekai element to it.

1269
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
It just takes place in a world

1270
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,440
that is fully, fully fixated on this, like,

1271
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
fantasy creature concept

1272
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,440
that your life in this setting

1273
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,440
is devoted to the mastery of.

1274
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
I also think the Pokeball

1275
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,440
as, like, a symbol, as, like,

1276
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,440
the visual symbol of the world is such...

1277
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
It's so, like...

1278
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,440
The fact that it's so simple,

1279
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,440
it's, like, so fucking perfect,

1280
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,440
and they never change it at all.

1281
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
I mean, there's different versions of Pokeballs, but...

1282
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Yeah.

1283
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,440
And another...

1284
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
Literally iconic.

1285
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,440
Another thing is that, like, the way you fight,

1286
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,440
the way you capture the Pokemons

1287
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
is the same way you fight them.

1288
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
So really, there isn't, like, too much of a disconnect.

1289
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,440
Well, like...

1290
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
I mean, I don't know.

1291
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
Do you capture more than...

1292
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,440
The wristwatches...

1293
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
And Digimon? I don't know how exactly it works.

1294
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,440
No, you just get one.

1295
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,440
You just get one.

1296
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
The Digimon Digi bit,

1297
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
but, uh, like, wristwatches.

1298
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
They looked like Tamagotchi's.

1299
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
I think also didn't...

1300
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
Which didn't age very well.

1301
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
Even...

1302
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
That's an idea.

1303
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Even though technically Pokemon only started letting you

1304
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
customize, like, your character

1305
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,440
in the past couple of games,

1306
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,440
you could already technically customize.

1307
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,440
You remember from the start,

1308
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
the fact that you choose what Pokemon are in your team

1309
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,440
is a form of customization, you know?

1310
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,440
Yeah.

1311
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Because, uh, like, when I was a kid,

1312
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,440
I didn't give a shit about stats.

1313
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,440
I only, like, got Pokemon that I thought looked cool.

1314
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Right?

1315
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
And that's kind of...

1316
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
That's another great thing is that

1317
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,440
you could still beat the game with just Pokemon

1318
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,440
you think that looked cool.

1319
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
You could beat the games with complete trashmon.

1320
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Right, exactly.

1321
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
And I think, um, yeah, I think it works.

1322
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,440
I think Pokemon did a lot of very genius moves

1323
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,440
that, like, made sure it kind of stayed.

1324
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,440
And I think, um, I think that's why a lot of these other,

1325
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
like, Pokemon wannabes keep fumbling.

1326
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
They don't, like, really sit down

1327
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,440
and look at what worked for Pokemon.

1328
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Remember when Myotismon...

1329
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,440
did evolve at...

1330
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,440
Mytosismon?

1331
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,440
At 666.

1332
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,440
And he attacked fricking Neo-Tokyo or whatever.

1333
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
And they had the number of the beast.

1334
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,440
They had the number of the beast.

1335
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
On American TV for kids.

1336
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,440
Beast.

1337
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Beast Japan.

1338
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Number of the beast.

1339
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,440
Number of the beast.

1340
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
Number of the beast, more like.

1341
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,440
That's right.

1342
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,440
The number of the beast.

1343
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
The beast beast.

1344
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,440
It roams our land.

1345
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Uh, uh, uh...

1346
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,440
I really liked the end of the first Digimon season

1347
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,440
really, like, left an impression on me as a kid.

1348
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Yeah.

1349
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
That's shit.

1350
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
It's pretty wild.

1351
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
I don't know, it's pretty wild how, like,

1352
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
they go to this fantasy digital world

1353
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
and then they come back and, like,

1354
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
the worst and most, like, deadly demons

1355
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,440
follow them back from it and, like,

1356
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,440
do terrorism and destroy the real world.

1357
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
And then, I don't know, something about...

1358
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
They go to, like...

1359
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,440
They have to go to, like, the void

1360
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,440
where, like, all the lost, like, data is

1361
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,440
and they fight, like, the manifestation of all the,

1362
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,440
all the, like, lost and destroyed Digimon data

1363
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,440
in that big, like, polyhedron.

1364
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Fucking awesome.

1365
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,440
So fucking epic and based and radical and cool.

1366
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Yeah, I don't...

1367
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
I think I watched that when I was young

1368
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,440
and I haven't re-watched it since.

1369
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
It would probably be dumb.

1370
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
It was very confusing.

1371
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,440
As a kid, I was like, I can't believe,

1372
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
I can't believe the stakes.

1373
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
The stakes have literally never been higher

1374
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,440
in my entire life.

1375
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,440
But that's the sort of thing, like,

1376
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,440
I think Pokemon the show was so good

1377
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,440
and so watchable because, um,

1378
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,440
every episode was the same thing.

1379
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,440
You go to a place, you see a Pokemon,

1380
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,440
you're like, whoa, what's going on?

1381
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
And then you fight.

1382
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Yeah.

1383
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
And in Digimon, there was a narrative

1384
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
that you had to follow.

1385
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,440
And I didn't catch every episode,

1386
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,440
so I would just not continue watching Digimon

1387
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,440
because I was like, oh, I missed an episode.

1388
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,440
I don't know what's going on.

1389
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,440
Pokemon doesn't matter.

1390
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
Yeah.

1391
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
And so I would watch that instead.

1392
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
One thing that I really like about Digimon

1393
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
is I don't know if this was done on purpose,

1394
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
but the fact that the way, like, the creatures,

1395
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,440
like, did evolve, they start out as, like,

1396
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
something that a little kid would draw.

1397
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,440
And as, like, it grows, it kind of becomes more like,

1398
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
oh, like, you as an artist kind of grow

1399
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
and you can draw things that are a little bit more complicated,

1400
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
you know, until you're drawing, like,

1401
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,440
your horny OCs, you know,

1402
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
as you become older.

1403
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,440
Right, when they become Angi-Waman

1404
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,440
and Lilymon and stuff, yes, yes.

1405
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,440
The final stage of evolution.

1406
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,440
I kind of dig that.

1407
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
I really think that's really, like, kind of cool.

1408
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,440
You know, it's kind of like, oh, it's, like, growing up.

1409
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,440
You know, I mean, because Pokemon do that, too,

1410
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,440
but, like, with Digimon, it's kind of, like, more,

1411
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,440
really not exactly sure what the next one is going to look like,

1412
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,440
you know?

1413
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Where are you on the Artispectrum of Digimon Evolutions?

1414
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Or Digivolutions?

1415
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,440
I don't know.

1416
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
What's the one before, Rookie?

1417
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Is it, like, Baby?

1418
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,440
Baby.

1419
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
Baby.

1420
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Goo.

1421
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,440
Goo.

1422
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Baby.

1423
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,440
Zygote.

1424
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
When you guys were growing up, were you,

1425
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,440
you know, like, the concept of, like,

1426
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,440
horse girls or wolf girls and shit like that?

1427
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,440
Yeah.

1428
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Were you, did you specialize in a kind of thing

1429
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
when you were a kid in that way?

1430
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Because when I was-

1431
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
Egg.

1432
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
I'm egg.

1433
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
I'm egg stage.

1434
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
Oh, you're trans.

1435
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,440
Oh, you're going to be trans.

1436
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
Right.

1437
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
But basically, what I mean is, when I was very little,

1438
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,440
I was like, oh, I really like dinosaurs.

1439
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,440
I would re-watch the original Walking with Dinosaurs documentary

1440
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,440
that they made.

1441
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Because I thought dinosaurs were really cool.

1442
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,440
And then I became a dragon kid because I was like,

1443
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,440
oh, they're like dinosaurs with superpowers.

1444
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
But, um, for some, even, but even as a kid,

1445
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,440
I realized that I needed, I needed structure.

1446
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,440
And there was a structure that drag,

1447
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
dragons kind of lack structure.

1448
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,440
And what I mean is that anything could kind of be a dragon,

1449
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,440
you know, or like the, the kind of like the,

1450
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,440
the rules of engagement with dragons like vary.

1451
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,440
And like, I guess that wasn't enough for me to,

1452
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
like, latch onto.

1453
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,440
And then I found out about Godzilla.

1454
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,440
And Godzilla had a lot of structure.

1455
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,440
There's a lot of consistency between like,

1456
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,440
like Kaiju's and the movies that they come from.

1457
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
And I really like got into that.

1458
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,440
So if I, if it was like a Digivolve evolution tree,

1459
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,440
it would have been like,

1460
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,440
dinosaur dragon and then like Kaiju kid, you know.

1461
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,440
Oh yeah, I see.

1462
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
Yeah, yeah.

1463
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,440
So you guys ever,

1464
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
did you guys go for something like that?

1465
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,440
Is what I'm basically asking?

1466
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,440
I, I mean, I remember in class,

1467
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
there was the one girl who could draw the horses.

1468
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
And she was the horse girl.

1469
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,440
She would always draw horses and she was really good at it.

1470
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,440
And I was like, that's so boring.

1471
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Where's the night on the horse?

1472
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,440
I was always into drawing suits of armor,

1473
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,440
swords and knights.

1474
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,440
And that is my, I think that's my first thing

1475
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,440
because night suits of armor like made up a little shapes.

1476
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,440
It's like drawing a person, but it's easy.

1477
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,440
Where did you, where do you think you went from there?

1478
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,440
Are you still a knight kid?

1479
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,440
I don't actually draw suits of armor that much anymore.

1480
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,440
I mean, I occasionally, I'm trying to think cause like,

1481
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,440
I think I sort of, I liked knights.

1482
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,440
And then I got really into Dragon Ball.

1483
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,440
And so I started to try and draw manga and I have like an old,

1484
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,440
like a ripoff manga of like combining Dragon Ball

1485
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,440
and Princess Mononoke.

1486
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,440
And Jack and Dexter and stuff.

1487
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,440
And I was like, oh, this is so fucking epic.

1488
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,440
And it's like Naruto.

1489
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,440
It's like got like ninja stuff.

1490
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,440
But I don't know if that's like a style or like a type of thing.

1491
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
I guess I just got into anime.

1492
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,440
I was just, I went from knights to anime.

1493
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
Yeah.

1494
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,440
And then I would draw like bleach stuff.

1495
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,440
And I don't know what, it's hard to remember.

1496
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,440
I drew so many things.

1497
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,440
I would draw a lot of like stuff like,

1498
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,440
oh, I would copy things that were cool.

1499
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
Like I would try and draw Goku.

1500
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
It's something to think about.

1501
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,440
Kind of like, what were the things that you like fixated on

1502
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,440
when you were a kid, you know?

1503
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,440
Ben, were you a kid?

1504
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,440
Were you ever a kid, Ben?

1505
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,440
No.

1506
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,440
Thanks for asking.

1507
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Ben was pulled out of the mud.

1508
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,440
It works.

1509
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,440
He was pulled out of the slime.

1510
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Yes.

1511
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,440
Yes.

1512
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,440
Yes.

1513
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,440
He was pulled out of his slime.

1514
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,440
He formed and ready to draw the vapors.

1515
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,440
By his father, Father Sate pulled him out of the slime.

1516
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,440
And then he pulled Nate out of the gold.

1517
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,440
The gold.

1518
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,440
I am.

1519
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,440
Because he's a golden boy.

1520
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,440
He's made of molten AU.

1521
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,440
I don't know.

1522
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,440
I liked Animorphs.

1523
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,440
I like to draw Animorphs aliens.

1524
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,440
That's it.

1525
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,440
I'll just put you down.

1526
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,440
You're a slime kid now.

1527
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,440
That's when I was like little.

1528
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,440
At some point, I used to be into like space.

1529
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,440
I was into like space and planets as a little kid.

1530
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,440
And then I got into Animorphs.

1531
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,440
And then at some point, I read like Lord of the Rings.

1532
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,440
And then after that, I was into fantasy instead of science fiction.

1533
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,440
So I was into the wheel of time.

1534
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,440
And then, I don't know.

1535
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,440
Definitely drew a lot of Lord of the Rings.

1536
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Then I found out about sex and I became a sex kid.

1537
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,440
Yeah.

1538
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,440
Then I became a Chad.

1539
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,440
Then I put aside childish things and I put away books for babies.

1540
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,440
And I just fucked bitches instead.

1541
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,440
Nice.

1542
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
Hell yeah.

1543
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,440
And then I picked up, you know, I diversified my portfolio.

1544
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,440
And picked up the sword.

1545
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,440
I started training in the blade.

1546
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,440
I, you know, I made a bunch of investments.

1547
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,440
My, you know, I invested Wall Street, got Bitcoin.

1548
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,440
Obviously, I got Bitcoin back in like 2001.

1549
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,440
So now I'm billionaire.

1550
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,440
And that's it.

1551
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
That's the story.

1552
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
Wow.

1553
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,440
It sounds like you make nothing.

1554
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,440
I can't believe there's a billionaire on this show.

1555
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,440
And we never knew.

1556
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,440
Yeah.

1557
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,440
It's pretty ironic.

1558
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
It sounds like you only make good choices, Ben.

1559
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,440
That's crazy.

1560
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,440
It is crazy.

1561
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,440
It is crazy.

1562
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,440
It is crazy.

1563
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
Thanks for noticing.

1564
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,440
That's insane.

1565
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,440
I, for what, am appalled to hear that.

1566
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,440
I know it's fucked up.

1567
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,440
It's fucked up.

1568
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,440
You can make all the right choices and still end up like me.

1569
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,440
I know it's really discouraging.

1570
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,440
It's discouraging me if I'm making the right choices.

1571
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,440
Maybe I should make wrong choices instead.

1572
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Maybe.

1573
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,440
I'm really, I'm really like looking like my eyeballs have turned inwards and they're

1574
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,440
looking at my brain scanning for like what I was into and what I was drawing.

1575
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,440
There's loads of things.

1576
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,440
I think, I can't like remember though, like in what order anything came.

1577
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,440
And you are like Fire Emblem.

1578
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
I would draw a lot of knights and swords.

1579
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,440
I would try drawing skeletons a lot.

1580
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,440
But skeletons are difficult.

1581
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,440
You never have like memories of an adult talking about you as a kid saying like, oh yeah,

1582
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,440
so and so is really into this and that.

1583
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,440
Like you wouldn't hear that.

1584
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,440
I would hear that.

1585
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,440
But what I would hear is like, oh, they're into art.

1586
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,440
Damn.

1587
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,440
They like drawing.

1588
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,440
And so I'm like, yeah, I was the drawing kid.

1589
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,440
For birthdays, people would get me colored pencils.

1590
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,440
And I'm like, okay.

1591
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,440
Nice.

1592
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,440
Oh yeah.

1593
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,440
Where do you actually use them?

1594
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah.

1595
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,440
I'm pretty sure I used some of them.

1596
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,440
It was just sort of the one thing though.

1597
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,440
It's just like more pencils, more paper.

1598
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
You never have enough.

1599
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,440
Never enough pencils.

1600
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,440
How to draw manga.

1601
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:23,440
I remember getting that like the iconic Ha Ha La Mal book of how to draw manga with the

1602
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,440
terrible fucked up face on the cover.

1603
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,440
I had that book.

1604
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,440
Based.

1605
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,440
And I learned how to draw.

1606
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,440
I remember reading and being like, okay, I guess I could learn how to draw this.

1607
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,440
But I don't like how it looks.

1608
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,440
I didn't have that one, but I had some very similar books.

1609
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,440
Google it.

1610
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,440
I checked out how to draw manga from the library one time.

1611
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
I checked out several of them.

1612
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,440
I thought it was like a series of them.

1613
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
I can't believe.

1614
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,440
In retrospect it wasn't.

1615
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,440
This exists.

1616
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Yeah, that one.

1617
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,440
That one's great.

1618
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,440
That one's a classic.

1619
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,440
That's the one you had?

1620
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,440
That's the one I had.

1621
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,440
Yeah, I did not.

1622
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,440
What does Katie Koop draw like now, I wonder?

1623
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Oh, let's find out.

1624
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,440
I had one that was actually kind of good.

1625
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,440
It was this one.

1626
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Oh, these are like expensive now.

1627
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:23,440
These are like, yeah, how did this, this how to draw manga is actually kind of cool.

1628
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,440
And it's, and it even.

1629
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,440
Oh, I remember what reading this in the one of the ones in the series.

1630
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,440
It even talks about like, I only read the first volume because I had it, but it talks about

1631
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,440
not just like the drawing, but like being a mangaka and like having assistance and like,

1632
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:45,440
you know, be like working for an editor and stuff.

1633
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:53,440
And then I had another one that I am not seeing in any of these search results.

1634
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,440
But the other one that I had was pretty crappy and it was very much, it just gave you like

1635
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,440
a bunch of stock characters and was like, draw a circle, draw another circle,

1636
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:09,440
put big hair on the circle, put the eye like this.

1637
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,440
That one sucked.

1638
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,440
Oh, wow.

1639
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,440
Oh my god.

1640
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,440
The how to draw manga book, Katie Koop made that when she was 16.

1641
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,440
That kind of makes sense.

1642
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,440
All right.

1643
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,440
Good, good for her.

1644
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,440
Look at the art style.

1645
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
This is obviously a 16 year old.

1646
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,440
They, they have drawn, they've drawn it again.

1647
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
They have a Twitter.

1648
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,440
Oh, damn.

1649
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:34,440
Time to follow the queen.

1650
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Nice.

1651
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,440
It's not, it's still not, it's still not great.

1652
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,440
Wow.

1653
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,440
When was this from?

1654
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,440
It's not great.

1655
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,440
It's not great.

1656
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Mostly post pictures.

1657
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,440
2021.

1658
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,440
What a freaking, fucking royalty.

1659
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,440
This is fucking, you're not only royalty, we're looking at it right now.

1660
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Wait, where?

1661
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Oh, well, this is interesting.

1662
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,440
She, she wrote about how she was initially happy to work on the book because she was

1663
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,440
just a teenager.

1664
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,440
She revealed that the character on the cover was a flipped illustration that she never

1665
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,440
intended to become the cover art, which she protested at the time.

1666
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Okay.

1667
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
I mean, cool.

1668
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,440
Exonerated, I guess.

1669
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
Not, not, not really.

1670
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,440
I mean, I mean, I'm not going to think less of her.

1671
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
I mean, she was like 16.

1672
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:29,440
You're 16 and the company says, oh, you, you draw that, um, anime or man gay style.

1673
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,440
We need to sell a book about that.

1674
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,440
So could you, could you do this?

1675
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,440
It's like, oh my God.

1676
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,440
She's only got the, she only got the, she only got 6,000 followers on Twitter.

1677
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
Yeah.

1678
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,440
Unless I'm looking at the wrong person.

1679
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,440
They're, they're KT Coop, right?

1680
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Like they go over there.

1681
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,440
Yeah.

1682
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah.

1683
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:55,440
I found that Twitter from the article that's talking about the artist and this redrawing.

1684
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,440
I do album art, promotional materials, web design, illustration.

1685
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,440
I'm not super impressed.

1686
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
Oh, bentate.

1687
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,440
I mean, some of this is okay.

1688
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
Color me surprised.

1689
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,440
Some of this is okay.

1690
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:17,440
Like design wise and like the, the actual, the actual, like, oh, like the actual illustration

1691
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,440
on display is, is look at these faces.

1692
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,440
Look at, look at this face of the guy in the middle here.

1693
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:31,440
Uh, the guy, not the guy in the bottom left, but the, the samurai and armor right above him.

1694
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Yeah.

1695
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,440
She probably could add a little bit more wrinkles to his face.

1696
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,440
It's not, it's not, it's not working.

1697
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,440
It's not working.

1698
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,440
A little bit more stronger emotion, you know.

1699
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Oh man.

1700
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,440
Um, I have a, I did it.

1701
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:53,440
I didn't tell you guys about kind of a little feud that I was in the middle of a little

1702
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,440
conflict that was happening that I was going back and forth and none of it was like public.

1703
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:04,440
It was all behind like DM that like private discord servers.

1704
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,440
That sounds amazing.

1705
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
That sounds spectacular.

1706
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,440
Yeah.

1707
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,440
Yeah.

1708
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,440
Yeah.

1709
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,440
Basically, um, yeah.

1710
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,440
And Nellie is our, you could like bleep out this, uh, this group's name.

1711
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Um, because I don't want to get into too much fucking trouble about it, but, um, there's

1712
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,440
a, there's a, there's an organization called the right.

1713
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,440
Okay.

1714
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,440
And basically they're, um, they're trying to help out like in the artists and they want

1715
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,440
to do their, they're mostly like, you know, helping you try to promote your stuff, yada,

1716
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:39,440
yada, but also, um, they want to make a database like a giant database.

1717
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,440
Like a giant database of everyone's like comics, like the, as many indie comics as they can.

1718
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,440
Right.

1719
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:52,440
And, um, and I, and I joined and I even like, um, paid kind of like, there was like a membership

1720
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,440
fee.

1721
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
I didn't even pay that.

1722
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
It was only like five bucks really.

1723
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,440
Um, but basically, yeah.

1724
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:05,440
So I joined and I just been in their server and, and I even submitted McPuglachy into

1725
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,440
their database.

1726
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Right.

1727
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,440
Um, wait, wait, I'm sorry.

1728
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,440
It's something really funny.

1729
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:16,440
There's an opportunity for BIPOC creators only for a zine called the brown recluse zine

1730
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,440
distro.

1731
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,440
Like, like the zine is for brown recluse.

1732
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,440
It's a brown recluse.

1733
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,440
I think it's funny on purpose.

1734
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
I think it's funny on purpose.

1735
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,440
It probably is.

1736
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:34,440
I'm always on the fence about kind of like, oh, we're looking for specific POC creators.

1737
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,440
And I'm like, oh, I'm specific.

1738
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,440
Yeah.

1739
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,440
See creators.

1740
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,440
And like, yeah, we want you to do a so and so specific thing that I'm not interested in.

1741
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,440
And I'm like, damn, I'm, I'm the wrong kind of POC for this because I'm more interested

1742
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:52,440
in drawing goblins than like other like, melanated people, you know, I'm kind of like, I'm kind

1743
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,440
of like, you know, he's much more interested in telling movies about goblins than movies

1744
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
about Mexicans.

1745
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,440
Definitely.

1746
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,440
True.

1747
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,440
Basically.

1748
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,440
Okay.

1749
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,440
So anyway, I submitted a McPuglachie into their database, right?

1750
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:12,440
And then I got a rejection letter, which I thought was weird because and they told me

1751
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,440
that the quality was not up to par for the database.

1752
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,440
Now, yeah, here's the weird thing.

1753
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:25,440
If you take a quick glance through their database, you get the impression that quality is on a

1754
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
spectrum.

1755
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
Right.

1756
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:33,440
I got the big impression that quality is has varies a lot.

1757
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,440
Where, where would I find their data?

1758
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,440
Right, right here.

1759
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,440
It's on the website.

1760
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,440
But here's the direct link.

1761
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,440
So yeah, I, if you just go through and I read a handful of these of these, if you scroll

1762
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:48,440
through it, um, yeah, it's obvious that quality is on a spectrum here, you know, I was so surprised

1763
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,440
to find out that make Puglachie got rejected, you know.

1764
01:11:53,440 --> 01:12:00,440
And I, yes, I mean, the not all, not all of these look like super professional.

1765
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,440
Right.

1766
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,440
And yeah, I didn't even got, I never got the impression that it was supposed to be like

1767
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,440
professional at all or anything because it's indie comics, you know, right?

1768
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,440
And yeah.

1769
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,440
Oh, but basically here's here's a Google Drive link to it.

1770
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,440
This is, I'm, I'm like, wait, you know, I don't want to be mean.

1771
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,440
Okay.

1772
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
Don't call, don't call anyone out or anything.

1773
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,440
But I mean, I mean, come on.

1774
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,440
Yeah, that's, see, that's the thing.

1775
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,440
I didn't call out no one, but I kept saying like, look, like it seems like quality is

1776
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
not on a spectrum.

1777
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,440
It's, you know, like what's, what's the deal?

1778
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,440
Right.

1779
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,440
So I'm thinking like, um, oh, by the way, above, I'm just gonna get again, but here's

1780
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:47,440
a, here's a Google Drive link to, to an image gallery of all the screenshots of me going back

1781
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,440
and forth with them.

1782
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
And it starts with a, it starts with my rejection.

1783
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,440
God, I'm not, I'm not reading these.

1784
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,440
Well, I'm just going to summarize it.

1785
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,440
So it starts with their rejection letter and me like replying back to them saying like,

1786
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,440
I think I, I think I disagree with what you said.

1787
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,440
Also, another thing that they said in the rejection later, they kind of like pissed me

1788
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:10,440
off a little bit, but they said, um, they said, we encourage you to resubmit after you developed

1789
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
your craft more.

1790
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,440
And I thought that was kind of a rude thing to say.

1791
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:22,440
Um, I did talk to my like, I mean, yeah, I mean, look, look at what's in the database.

1792
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,440
Yeah, like, I'm sorry, but there's straight, there's straight up amateur stuff.

1793
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,440
And also, and here's another thing that also pissed me off.

1794
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,440
If you go into their cartoonist cooperative Instagram, um, you will find that one of

1795
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:36,440
their Instagram posts is a promotion for Mick Pagliacci, like it's up there.

1796
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,440
Right.

1797
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,440
And it's so weird that like, why would you promote it but not having your database?

1798
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,440
You know, like it seems kind of a little two-faced a little bit, you know, it seems kind of

1799
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,440
hypocritical because what if someone sees that anything?

1800
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,440
Well, I don't know.

1801
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,440
I mean, is it, is it hypocritical?

1802
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
Like, is there a reason for this?

1803
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,440
Do you want?

1804
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,440
I don't understand.

1805
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
What do you mean?

1806
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,440
I mean, like, why did they do this?

1807
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
Oh, well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.

1808
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Like, why did they reject it?

1809
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
Right.

1810
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,440
Right.

1811
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,440
Why would they promote it if they were going to reject it from the database?

1812
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,440
Right.

1813
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,440
Exactly.

1814
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,440
So I asked them, like, what, like, is there, is there something specific about Mick Pagliacci?

1815
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Now, in the back of my mind, if you just go for their database, one thing I noticed is

1816
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,440
that there's no parodies or anything with like copyrighted characters.

1817
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,440
So I'm thinking like, oh, maybe.

1818
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,440
Okay.

1819
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,440
Okay.

1820
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,440
Okay.

1821
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,440
Could that be it?

1822
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,440
Yeah.

1823
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,440
Could that be it?

1824
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
Right.

1825
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
But I don't want to suggest that just yet because I want them to say it, you know?

1826
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,440
I don't want them to be like, oh, yeah, yeah, that was, that's totally it.

1827
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,440
Like, I want them to like, you know, tell me why.

1828
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,440
Yeah.

1829
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,440
So it's just nice to know.

1830
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,440
Yeah.

1831
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,440
Basically, they just told me the quality just wasn't up to par.

1832
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,440
That's it.

1833
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,440
That's just it.

1834
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:52,440
And if they said, if I want feedback to go into their discord, into their feedback chat

1835
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,760
in their discord server and post Mick Pagliacci there, and I did, I posted it in there and

1836
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:03,880
I said, like, hey, can anyone tell me, like, why this didn't like get in, you know?

1837
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,760
And a couple, a couple of people gave me like some feedback, but everything at any time

1838
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,920
they would give me like feedback, I would like question it.

1839
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:20,080
Like, um, someone told me there was one person in there, there was this one guy who said

1840
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,760
he couldn't give me feedback in the feedback chat because he doesn't like giving feedback

1841
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,760
in the feedback check.

1842
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,960
He said he'd much rather prefer I talk in the forums, like, like, and I'm like, can you

1843
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,240
just, I asked him, can you just DM me the feedback instead?

1844
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,800
And he's like, no, no, it's much better if I do it in the forums and I'm like, well,

1845
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,720
you know, I kind of wanted feedback in the feedback chat, but I did make a, yeah, I made

1846
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,720
a forum post about it.

1847
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,720
So I get feedback there.

1848
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:52,240
And that guy did give me feedback, um, and his, and I even screenshot his feedback too.

1849
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,680
It's in there later in the gallery when I go over what they say in the forums.

1850
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:03,120
And I feel like he only had one bit of valid criticism, which he mentioned one panel and

1851
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,400
he said that composition of this panel could have been better and I'm like, yeah, I agree.

1852
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
It could have been better.

1853
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,400
Um, yeah.

1854
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Okay.

1855
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,400
Sure.

1856
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,160
But, but this was not like a guy in a position.

1857
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,680
This is not a guy in charge of anything.

1858
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,680
This is just some guy.

1859
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,520
Well, it's a, I think he's a committee member.

1860
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,360
Some of them are like committee members, right?

1861
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,560
So they're, they're guys that are like up there.

1862
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,320
Um, but, but here's pure, I'm thinking, but this is what I'm thinking, because I bet

1863
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,800
I could probably 100% bet I could find a comic in their database that does not have that

1864
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,800
good composition.

1865
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
Right.

1866
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,800
Yeah.

1867
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
Like that.

1868
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,320
I don't think that's a crazy thing to like bet on, right?

1869
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,200
So I'm thinking it's bad composition.

1870
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,000
Like, is that the red line?

1871
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,520
Is that like the, the, like, oh, like this is like, you got to have good composition.

1872
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:57,000
Um, someone did, someone did mention that they thought the idea was that like funny.

1873
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,080
Like it, um, I just, it's not a funny like idea.

1874
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,000
They didn't laugh at all.

1875
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,680
And it's, it was like a poorly executed joke.

1876
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,680
And then I replied.

1877
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,920
It was a poorly executed joke.

1878
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,440
Is that like the line?

1879
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,560
Like if you do a joke and it sucks.

1880
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,560
Yeah.

1881
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:17,040
I, it's not, it's not like is my work good enough, but like is like, what is the, what

1882
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,040
are the rules?

1883
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:26,200
That's the, that's where the, like, if it is like mascot characters or like stuff can't

1884
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,200
be used.

1885
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,200
Yeah.

1886
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,200
Uh, just a heads up.

1887
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,200
Be nice.

1888
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,400
The, the, yeah.

1889
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,640
If it was, if it was because of copyrighted characters, I think that would be perfectly

1890
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,640
reasonable.

1891
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,320
They, I asked them about parodies and they said parodies are allowed.

1892
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,320
They allow parodies.

1893
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,960
And I'm like, all right, well, I just, I guess it wasn't funny enough, but look, but, but

1894
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
check this out.

1895
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,360
Look, this comic right here, um, is, is this funny?

1896
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,800
This isn't their humor section.

1897
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,400
Is this a funny comic?

1898
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:58,120
Well, let me, let me, let me take a look at the, oh God.

1899
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,280
Are these like, um, just individual images or are they like, uh, they're like, uh, you

1900
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,280
can flip through them when you click on them.

1901
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,400
Oh, I have to log in.

1902
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,800
I don't know my login.

1903
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,800
Wow.

1904
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,800
Yeah.

1905
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,800
These are, these are like recent.

1906
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
These are like recent.

1907
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:26,360
Um, now, now is this funny and now, and like, I don't, I get, I don't have anything against

1908
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,920
this, but, um, is it supposed to be funny?

1909
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,160
It's in the humor section, but, and they said, and they said, it's not funny enough to,

1910
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,560
to be in the database, but this is, and I'm like, okay, well, what's going on?

1911
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:38,560
You know?

1912
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,560
Okay.

1913
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:46,880
I, I guess, I guess my thoughts on this are, yeah, I, I don't understand the, the standard

1914
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,880
of quality.

1915
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,600
I don't understand by what standard of quality, something like this is like, it's the thumbs

1916
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,760
up, but something like McPagliacci is like, nah, it's not good enough.

1917
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,120
I don't know what criteria they could give you that by which it isn't good enough.

1918
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,640
But maybe, maybe, maybe more.

1919
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,080
So who cares?

1920
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,080
Yeah.

1921
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,040
Ultimately, who cares about being a stupid database?

1922
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,120
Well, the thing is, I would like, I mean, I would want McPagliacci to be as many things

1923
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,120
as possible.

1924
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:24,200
And it's kind of like this isn't really like, I don't think it's any, it's no skin off their

1925
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:29,720
back if they post it, if they have it in their database, like it's not going to fucking, what's

1926
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,600
the negative effect of it?

1927
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,280
It's clearly up to par with like a lot of things they have up there, right?

1928
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,280
What do you, what do you get out of them putting it in their database?

1929
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:45,360
When you look up McPagliacci, it pops up if it's on like, it's on like a website, right?

1930
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,840
I mean, I guess so.

1931
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,840
Yeah.

1932
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,000
Like, you know, yeah, it helps a little bit.

1933
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,200
Like, you know, when people, now when people look for their database, they're going to

1934
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,720
see McPagliacci, you know, it helps, you know, when they look for a database of content.

1935
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,720
Doesn't hurt as the main thing.

1936
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,120
Yeah, it doesn't hurt.

1937
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,560
Here's the thing, the more I talk to them, the more like, the vibe that I get is that

1938
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,040
they kind of already didn't like me.

1939
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,800
And I think, and I think the reason why is because they didn't like that I kept posting

1940
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,360
McPagliacci in the promo chat on their Discord server.

1941
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,560
Yeah.

1942
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,880
And which is weird, because it's the promo chat, you know, what did you, what else did

1943
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,280
you want to post it?

1944
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:27,120
They gave me the vibe that they specifically wanted me to make friends first before I start

1945
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,240
asking about promotions.

1946
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,920
Like, like, oh, we, yeah, like you're, you're never, you're never, you're always just promoting

1947
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,920
yourself.

1948
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,080
You're never like having conversations in there.

1949
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,960
You're never like making, trying to make friends.

1950
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:42,720
And it's like, well, fuck, well, fuck you because how, how do you not know I'm not making

1951
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,720
any friends outside of it?

1952
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,360
How do you know I'm not talking to these people in the group outside of the group?

1953
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,760
Do I have to like be discussing them in the Discord?

1954
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,240
Do I need evidence that I'm becoming friends with people?

1955
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:00,960
That's kind of the feeling that I get in a lot of like comics spaces on the internet.

1956
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,960
They're just kind of a big social club and nobody's really there to like, nobody's really

1957
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,080
there to like make it in comics.

1958
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,640
They're all just there to fuck around.

1959
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,640
Hi.

1960
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,640
Yeah.

1961
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,760
We're trying to create an in-group that we can exclude people from.

1962
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,760
Yeah.

1963
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,000
We're trying to be like the coolest people ever that we imagine all the, all the comics

1964
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,600
that we idolize are in.

1965
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,600
I think.

1966
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,520
We have our own club because we can't be in there.

1967
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,800
I think what I think that's a lot of where it comes from.

1968
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,840
I think the plan with this is that and like, yeah, I have no evidence for this plan, but

1969
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:36,200
the idea is that the bigger this group gets, who are people going to most likely be talking

1970
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,600
about that are involved in this group?

1971
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
They're not going to be talking about the individual people in it.

1972
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,920
They're going to talk about the people who run it, right?

1973
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,920
Yeah.

1974
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,120
And if people are running it, I'm going to get way more attention than anybody else like

1975
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,120
in the group.

1976
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,120
Sure.

1977
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,120
Right.

1978
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,120
And that's why, that's why you run things.

1979
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,120
Yeah.

1980
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:53,440
Like pixel dog comic.

1981
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,840
Like the guy who made this is one of the guys who, who started it.

1982
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,840
You know?

1983
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,240
So it's like.

1984
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,240
Well, there you go.

1985
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,240
Yeah.

1986
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,240
It's just so.

1987
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,240
Well, there you go.

1988
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,240
Submit red man.

1989
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:10,200
And if they reject it, I can have, I can have like, cancel, red man will cancel.

1990
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Please submit red man.

1991
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,200
Please submit red man.

1992
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,200
Oh man.

1993
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,880
If you, if you get it, I'm going to get mad.

1994
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,720
No, I'll just do what you did.

1995
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:23,840
I will not make friends and I'll see if they hate me.

1996
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,440
No, this is like, well, it's like a science experiment.

1997
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,360
No, I think, I think, I think you're right.

1998
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:34,560
I think it's like, they don't know it's that it's a club.

1999
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,680
It's a club and you're not in it and they don't know you.

2000
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,360
And that's, that's more important.

2001
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,360
Yeah.

2002
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,760
And I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's kind of a shame, you know, it's kind of a really

2003
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,080
big shame because, because like, you know, I saw the word cooperative and I thought, oh,

2004
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,080
these guys must be cool.

2005
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,640
They're more cooperative in the name and well, I see some people are more cooperative than

2006
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,640
others.

2007
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,560
Um, but I don't, is it, is it just comics?

2008
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,560
Is it?

2009
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,040
I feel like comics are always like that.

2010
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,560
It's always just people fucking around.

2011
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:09,960
I think it's like any kind of indie scene kind of thing, you know, yeah, which is that

2012
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,760
what it's like to join bands, which is a shame.

2013
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,760
That's the problem.

2014
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:14,760
Is this what it is?

2015
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,160
It's probably like to join a band that is just fucking around.

2016
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:21,080
I remember back in high school, one of my buddies who was like, who would like rap and

2017
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,080
whatnot.

2018
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:27,680
Um, he said that there was like kind of like groups of, of like little smaller indie rappers

2019
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:32,320
who, who would think themselves all hard and everything or really they just jerking themselves

2020
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,960
off and they're on the club and that just, they just kind of happened in the indie scene.

2021
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:45,720
I am reminded of like, I'm reminded of like, uh, the like the Topastic forums, which would

2022
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:51,240
just be like, like no one who's successful on Topastic was posting on the forums.

2023
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:57,160
It was all like, it was all nobodies to maybe people that had like a little bit of clout,

2024
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:01,840
people that were people that were making like people that maybe had like a couple thousand,

2025
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:11,720
a couple thousand views, people that were maybe making like $95 a month on Patreon or something.

2026
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:16,640
People who are successful are not posting in, they're not, they're not posting in forums

2027
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:22,380
about that, talking to other like comic people about like the craft of comic making.

2028
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:27,000
They're not asking for critique and they're not giving critique.

2029
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,280
The kind, the kind of critique you get in circles like that is like, oh, this one panel

2030
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,560
has like a, the, the, the composition could have been stronger.

2031
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,560
Fuck off.

2032
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,560
I would, I would die.

2033
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,000
I would say these, um, and this kind of curtain is cooperative, I do notice they give critiques

2034
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
and whatnot.

2035
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,360
There's people like engaging and shit and whatnot and I think, I think it's ultimately

2036
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,080
they want to like, I think what they really specifically want in their database is comics

2037
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:57,400
made by them, like made in, within their group so they can show off.

2038
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,360
That's, that's why, that's why PixelDog or whatever is there.

2039
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,360
That's why you fucking pick.

2040
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,360
Yeah.

2041
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,360
Exactly.

2042
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,360
And it's, um, yeah.

2043
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,360
I mean, it's, it's a shame.

2044
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,860
You're an, you're an interloper.

2045
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,220
Yeah.

2046
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:11,980
You're showing up with work and you're an outsider and you're like, include me.

2047
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:14,260
And they're like, well, we don't want it.

2048
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:18,660
We only like you if you're, if you're, you're our best friend and you haven't shown that

2049
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,660
you're our best friend yet.

2050
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,160
Oh, come on guys, please.

2051
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,160
Be nice to us.

2052
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,160
Be my comic in your database.

2053
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,160
I'll be your best friend.

2054
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,260
You got to be your best friend first and then we'll put you in the database.

2055
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:34,580
My mistake was finishing McPug Lashy before joining if, if I did work in progress in their

2056
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:38,540
Discord server, probably would have been a different story, but it's, it's, it's a,

2057
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:39,540
it's annoying.

2058
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,860
You know, I feel like there should be like a database for any comics, but it can't be

2059
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,340
run by other any comic people.

2060
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:50,240
It's got to be just run by one guy who doesn't make any comics and won't like, um, doesn't

2061
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,300
have any like assumptions about anybody who just put anyone in it, you know.

2062
01:25:54,300 --> 01:26:00,020
Yo, Gib, once, once the perfect comic party is out, this is going to be us.

2063
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:04,360
We're going to be the in group and we're going to be the only, and only our best

2064
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,160
friends will get to, uh, only the bestest of friends, the bestest, so I'm going to be

2065
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,960
like, yeah, I submitted my comic into a, I did perfect comic party, but they said it

2066
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,960
wasn't funny enough, but they have a McPug Lashy there.

2067
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,400
Uh, no, no, it doesn't make any sense, make it make sense, guys.

2068
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,080
Can we, can we, can we put McPug Lashy in the imperfect comic party?

2069
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,720
Um, sure.

2070
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,240
Well, how does that, how does that work?

2071
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,440
How would that work exactly?

2072
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,640
Um, McPug Lashy is quite long overall.

2073
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,400
How many pages is it?

2074
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,920
It's split it into two ads, it's already split into two ads.

2075
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,240
Oh yeah, it's, it's got acts.

2076
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:37,840
Yeah.

2077
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,200
Oh, fuck it.

2078
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,440
Why not?

2079
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:45,640
It'd be like, it'd be like a chapter of so many pages and then the next issue would

2080
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,480
have the next chapter.

2081
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,240
Not going to, not going to make me sign a contract where you own McPug Lashy now.

2082
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,240
No, I, no, I think what you're just.

2083
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,560
Will own exclusive rights to print your comic in the perfect comic party.

2084
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,240
No, I think, I think it would just be, I think it'll just be like a waiver or like

2085
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:07,160
a form that's just like, you give us permission to post it online.

2086
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:13,600
Like we're, we're, you know, you, you, you formally say like, yes, it's okay for

2087
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:20,280
my work to appear in the digital file and be hosted on this website.

2088
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,880
And it's not exclusive and there's no like print rights or anything like that.

2089
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,760
No, no, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll take it.

2090
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,400
We'll steal it.

2091
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,120
We'll, we'll, we'll, I'll ask, I'll come back and beg for

2092
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,120
the print rights later.

2093
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,360
You know what that reminds me?

2094
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,760
I was going to ask, cause I was listening to you guys talking about

2095
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,280
perfect comic party like a couple of episodes ago and you mentioned about doing

2096
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,960
the whole shunning thing with like the reader voting.

2097
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:49,880
And I thought that was kind of, I don't know if that's, I thought

2098
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,040
that was kind of interesting because it's kind of like, okay, but what if like,

2099
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:55,520
let's say for example, what if someone, what if everyone votes?

2100
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,880
What if people vote against the comic you're making?

2101
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,920
Like, would you stop making Beescapade if everyone was kind of like, no,

2102
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,920
I don't like it and they like vote against it?

2103
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:12,760
No, but if, but what if they vote for me though, then that would make me feel good.

2104
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,920
Okay, but I'm, I'm saying, okay, let's say it's any, yeah, that may

2105
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,560
you feel good, obviously, but just any comic you yourself are personally making.

2106
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,520
What if everyone voted against that?

2107
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,960
You know, I think, I think that, that, that would be, we would have to ask

2108
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,200
the question then, what is the perfect comic party for?

2109
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:36,360
If it's for being a successful comic publishing thing, like a collaboration,

2110
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,120
like a bunch of comics in one publication and we want it to be successful

2111
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,960
and everybody hates both mine and Ben's comic and we just can't put our own

2112
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,360
comics in our own publication anymore, then that we would have to like not

2113
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,320
put our comics in there.

2114
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,400
But I don't think that's the point for me anyway.

2115
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:53,920
Okay.

2116
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,280
I just want to show off my stuff.

2117
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,080
You know, I guess I don't really mind if it's not in the perfect comic party,

2118
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,680
but like, I guess we'll see.

2119
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,160
Okay.

2120
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,720
You know what, Cheesy, I do, I do think you have a point.

2121
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,920
Like the, the, the reader surveys in Shonen Jump are like, like the

2122
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,720
purpose of those is so that like when a comic is bad and performers badly,

2123
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,840
they can get rid of it and like, so we don't really need, we don't really

2124
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,040
need them for anything.

2125
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,200
I guess it's, it's the, it's the thing, but I would like to hear, I would

2126
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,240
like to hear reader feedback, but like, I'm, I don't, we're not, until

2127
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,640
we're like so inundated with submissions that like, we are too many

2128
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,360
quality submissions and we can't host them all until we get to that point.

2129
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,800
We don't need to be voting anyone off the island.

2130
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,560
So if it comes to a point where like Clarissa Gunsmoke is the least

2131
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:48,840
popular, um, I guess it's no actual like size problem, but it would get bloated

2132
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:50,000
if we just kept saying yes.

2133
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,240
And the, the, like the PDF would get like 200 pages long every month.

2134
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,160
Um, so yeah, I guess hypothetically I would take my comic off.

2135
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,200
I would still put it on my own things, but like, yeah.

2136
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,600
I mean, that's, if we want it, if we want it to be like a, just a successful

2137
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,920
publishing thing, but I don't see it like a successful or not, not that

2138
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,160
it wouldn't be successful, but like the purpose of it is for me to make

2139
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:21,840
comics and have a thing to put it on and be feel cool about it.

2140
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:28,840
I, I think, um, I think, I don't know if I, if in, in this hypothetical

2141
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:34,400
scenario where piece, the per comic party ran for a while and it got really popular

2142
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,320
and there were tons of great comics in there and everyone's, we're getting,

2143
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,800
we're getting some reader submissions and people are voting and Biscopades is

2144
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,080
like bottom of the pile.

2145
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,040
It's like the least popular thing in there.

2146
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,280
I'll be honest, I wouldn't just quit Biscopades.

2147
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,040
I would just, I would just finish, I would just wrap, I would, I would keep

2148
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,440
going, finish it, wrap it up.

2149
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,120
And then when it was done and be like, oh yeah, well, people didn't like it.

2150
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,440
That's, that's what I was thinking.

2151
01:30:55,440 --> 01:31:00,320
I would, yeah, I would not, I would not quit Clarissa if people didn't

2152
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,920
like it in the perfect comic party.

2153
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,360
I would just have it as one of my, on my website, as my little thing

2154
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,040
that only a small niche community would enjoy.

2155
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:15,360
Well, because, because I don't see Biscopades being that long, I don't,

2156
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,160
I don't think I would even pull it from the perfect comic party.

2157
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:19,720
I'd just be like, eh, fuck it.

2158
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,840
You're stuck with it until it's done.

2159
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,680
Well, it's going in there.

2160
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,520
Well, I think, I think, I think that's a pretty good idea.

2161
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,000
If you think of it kind of like when you're selling lemonade and you, you

2162
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,200
got your big jar of money and you, you put a couple of your own dollars in there

2163
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,880
to make it seem like you're getting business.

2164
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,640
I mean, like, if you think of having Biscopades and Clarissa gun smoke as like

2165
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:47,400
your, your starting seeds for, for the publisher, whatever the fuck you guys

2166
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:54,480
calling yourself, I, I, my, my dream, my dream is just that we get enough

2167
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,680
submissions every month that we have, you know, it's not just me and Gibbs

2168
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,520
comic, there's like a bunch of features in there every month.

2169
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,160
There's at least, at least a few.

2170
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,200
My dream, my dream is that we do that for a while and then we collect like a

2171
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:13,400
bunch and then we, and then, you know, we approach the artists and we say, hey,

2172
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,680
we want to work out a print deal and we compile them into like a volume of like,

2173
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:22,600
I don't know, the 50, the 50 best or something.

2174
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,000
And we sell like volume, volume one, the collect, the collected

2175
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,680
perfect comic party Kickstarter or something.

2176
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:37,200
But that would be, you know, there's a, we'd have to, we have to make it a

2177
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,960
success first before we worry about, worry about that.

2178
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,720
Yeah, they're going to have to create some sort of guidelines because with,

2179
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:47,360
um, I mean, with any, with any publisher, they have guidelines of what exactly

2180
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,560
they're like looking for, how many pages or whatnot, you know?

2181
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:57,560
Um, I mean, my guidelines, I don't have any, how like hard rules about like page,

2182
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,440
page page, page length, I would say probably not more than like 20 ish pages.

2183
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,480
And if it's longer than that, we could always just divide it into chapters.

2184
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,400
Yeah, I think that's sensible.

2185
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,720
I don't actually know how big a normal shonen jump is, because I've never seen one.

2186
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:18,640
They, they have how many different things every week.

2187
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,720
I have no idea.

2188
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,920
Is it like a huge tone?

2189
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:25,240
Yeah, I think it's like the one piece chapter is like 20 pages by itself.

2190
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,080
And then there's like a bunch of other things.

2191
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:32,360
I think it's maybe like, like a hundred or 200 pages is like the weekly.

2192
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,040
Dang, the week, every week.

2193
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
How do you read that?

2194
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
How do you read all that?

2195
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,080
Maybe not.

2196
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,680
Well, I mean, it's because they got a whole, they got tons of different

2197
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:41,760
authors in there.

2198
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,080
They're all sitting in their shit.

2199
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:46,680
They're on the bullet train sitting down, reading that shit.

2200
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,720
Because they're on a first moving vehicle.

2201
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,480
They also read.

2202
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,200
Well, because on the fast moving vehicle, time dilates.

2203
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:59,160
And so like fewer pages, you can read them and it takes longer to read them.

2204
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:04,120
They have a lot of opportunities to be some, some have a lot of like certain

2205
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,080
amount of free time and specific moments to be read, you know.

2206
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,800
What was I saying?

2207
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,280
Do you do the.

2208
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,280
Yeah, I would I would like to print, I would like to print a

2209
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,600
collected volume one day.

2210
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,320
That's my like, that's how I'll know that the project was like a runaway

2211
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,080
a runaway smash hit success.

2212
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:26,960
I was shit.

2213
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,600
Maybe I was done.

2214
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,920
Maybe I don't have anything else to say.

2215
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:29,920
OK, I got you.

2216
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,480
Maybe maybe the surveys.

2217
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,920
Maybe the surveys are not super necessary.

2218
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,200
I would I will be making a channel in the PCP discord that's specifically

2219
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:42,440
for like perfect comic party, like comic discussion and feedback and stuff.

2220
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,320
I would like to accept feedback.

2221
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,600
And in fact, Biscopades needs feedback.

2222
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,720
Biscopades is going to end with like a like a call to like, hey, send,

2223
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,120
send suggestions for the next chapter.

2224
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:58,480
I think I'll take suggestions for like reader, reader commands in like batches.

2225
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,240
So like at the end of a chapter, it's like submit as many suggestions

2226
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,280
for things to happen in the next one as you want.

2227
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,400
And I'll like go through them and I'll just pick ones that I like and I'll

2228
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,960
and I'll put them together into the next chapter.

2229
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,640
I think that's my plan.

2230
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:16,560
And, you know, I guess we could accept those via email.

2231
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,760
We could also just make that like, yes, suggest we got to do the Google forums thing.

2232
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,760
Yes, the Google.

2233
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,760
Yes, the Google forums thing for feedback.

2234
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,000
There's a few little things that I've just been like, I need to focus on

2235
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:33,320
something and the perfect comic party just hasn't been drawing me in.

2236
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,160
I don't know.

2237
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:39,480
Do you mean just like a few pages like the putting together the patron thank you page?

2238
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,560
Oh, yeah, I just wanted to focus on Clarissa because it was easier to think about.

2239
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,600
I think once once the once you finish the thing and we can get together

2240
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,120
and be like, yeah, like run through like how it's going to look and all that.

2241
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:56,640
When you say Google forums, you mean like for for like read or for submissions?

2242
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,800
Oh, yeah, feedback.

2243
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,840
I mean, we could do all sorts of things with Google forums.

2244
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,760
I think I think Biscopades like like reader commands.

2245
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,960
I think, yeah, Google forums would be a good way to to do those just to have it all in one place.

2246
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,680
So I don't have to check my email and check the discord and check Twitter

2247
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,640
and check all these things.

2248
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:19,480
You can't have it where like you're posting Biscopades on a website

2249
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,200
and then people in the comments are leaving feedback there.

2250
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,120
No. So I didn't have a.

2251
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:29,440
I specifically did not want a like comment section.

2252
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,360
When I was building my website, my old website,

2253
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,600
everyone told me like, you got to have a comment section.

2254
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:39,440
You've got to have a comment and I was like, and I was like, absolutely not.

2255
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,600
I do not want a comment section because I'm not popular enough.

2256
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,960
Most pages will have no comments and it will just be embarrassing.

2257
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,720
So I just don't want it.

2258
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,880
Just throw the whole fucking concept out.

2259
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,720
I mean, that that's obviously true.

2260
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:59,160
But I was that's even popular comic, even popular comics are like that.

2261
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,240
Like most pages just have zero comments.

2262
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,400
Yeah, yeah, like people don't think to use that.

2263
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:08,040
But also I don't like the idea of thinking you're reading a comic.

2264
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,320
And then, oh, I wonder what people thought about this and scrolling down.

2265
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,360
Yeah, I feel like that breaks up the flow of reading the actual thing.

2266
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,200
So I don't want any distractions.

2267
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,760
My site is you read the comic and then you get out of there.

2268
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,720
Yes, reading a comic is not the place for like page by page fucking

2269
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,600
peanut gallery commentary.

2270
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,160
That's what I don't.

2271
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,800
It's another thing I don't like about Topastic and and the line.

2272
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,360
Oh, yeah, I should put things on Topastic though.

2273
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:43,040
I maybe I need to advertise through permeants.

2274
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,080
I'm a little bit.

2275
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:47,960
I'm a little concerned about line webtoons, like terms of service.

2276
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,920
Line webtoons, terms of service seems to kind of imply that like by posting

2277
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,640
your stuff online, webtoon, like they are allowed to like print your stuff.

2278
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,400
Like it becomes their content, print.

2279
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,680
Sorry, that was the impression I got.

2280
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:11,600
Was it is it one of the one of those lines where it's like you like they have

2281
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,320
the right to reproduce the work?

2282
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:19,480
Um, because I think that a lot of sites have that where it basically

2283
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,320
just means we're allowed to show this on a web page.

2284
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,720
We're allowed to host it on a web page that people can see.

2285
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,880
You you grant you grant us with respect to user posting.

2286
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:33,040
You grant us a non exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty

2287
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:38,960
fleet free, worldwide, transferable, licensable license to access, use,

2288
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:45,680
host, cash, store, reproduce, transmit, display, publish, and distribute

2289
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,240
your user, user posting.

2290
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,440
Yeah, I do not like that verbiage at all.

2291
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,920
Every, every image hosting site has that.

2292
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,400
It basically means, I mean, people freaked out when DeviantArt, when

2293
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,440
somebody looked at the DeviantArt terms of service and they had that in there.

2294
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:01,360
DeviantArt's word for other reasons for the AI stuff.

2295
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,600
But like that specifically just means that when somebody loads a page,

2296
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:11,360
DeviantArt, you've given DeviantArt the permission to display the

2297
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,320
permission to display the image so that it works.

2298
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:18,160
And they have to give it all those words so that it makes sense

2299
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,480
because like worldwide means accessing from any place that you can access the

2300
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,800
site. I appreciate that.

2301
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:28,400
But like taken, taken literally, it seems like it gives them like if they wanted

2302
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,920
to, they could like print your stuff in a book and sell it.

2303
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,320
That's what they say print, though.

2304
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,160
They say, no, they don't say print.

2305
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,000
Because that's the only thing.

2306
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,880
It looks like I'm pretty sure.

2307
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,720
Reproduce, transmit, display, publish, and distribute.

2308
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,280
Reproduce, but like online.

2309
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,120
Well, it doesn't, it doesn't.

2310
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:53,800
I know it doesn't specify, but like I don't think anything of that

2311
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,840
nature has ever happened.

2312
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,080
And like every site has that sort of clause.

2313
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,560
I thought that when you were with user hosted, submitted content.

2314
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,680
Well, the, well, the Tappas one.

2315
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:10,160
Well, the, the Tappas one specifically said that they won't do the things

2316
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,440
that I'm worried about.

2317
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,880
So maybe, maybe you're right.

2318
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,600
And maybe that's just, they all have it.

2319
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,920
And maybe Tappas was just being extracurricular.

2320
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:22,280
I think maybe there was a lot, a lot of picking wire, um, legal,

2321
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:27,400
legal, like explanation about what that more actually means or what that stipulation

2322
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,640
something to look into, I guess.

2323
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,440
It, I mean, it might be a matter of precedent where like if they ever did try

2324
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:39,240
to like take a bunch of like user submitted stuff and like print it, there

2325
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,480
would be a lawsuit and then probably some legal precedent would be established.

2326
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,640
It's like, no, you can't do that.

2327
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:48,600
Uh, and it might not be in like the letter of the, the contract or whatever.

2328
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,880
You're probably right.

2329
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,240
Yeah.

2330
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,480
Tumblr has that as well.

2331
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,800
Tump people freaked out on Tumblr and they saw that and they're like, oh my God,

2332
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,760
they're going to steal our art.

2333
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:59,000
Every girl, everybody take your art off of Tumblr.

2334
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,360
And it's like it doesn't, nothing happened.

2335
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,560
That's how that works.

2336
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,520
Stupid.

2337
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:03,400
Okay.

2338
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:08,360
But it sounds, but it sounds like what I said it sounds like, but okay.

2339
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,240
All right.

2340
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:16,040
No, but no, but like the thing about that though is that society has degraded so much

2341
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,240
that it could be true.

2342
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:17,640
Yeah.

2343
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:17,880
Yeah.

2344
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,080
It could have been true.

2345
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,000
And it would have been just like, just like, uh, it was so believable.

2346
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,560
The fact that I thought it was.

2347
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:25,960
Yes.

2348
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:26,120
Yes.

2349
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:26,200
Yes.

2350
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,240
That's what I'm trying to say.

2351
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:28,840
Uh, sorry.

2352
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,520
What is a, what is the perfect part of it going to be?

2353
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,280
Is it going to be like a PDF you could download?

2354
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:35,880
Yeah.

2355
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,160
Think, we're thinking PDF.

2356
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:37,480
Yeah.

2357
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:40,840
Just cause thinking a PDF is easy to put it all together.

2358
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:44,760
Squish it into a file and you just download the file.

2359
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:49,400
Maybe we could make it readable online as well in some form.

2360
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,360
Interesting.

2361
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:54,200
I mean, I think if you drag a PDF on into your browser, you can read it online.

2362
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:55,560
Yeah.

2363
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,640
You don't need a website to do that.

2364
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:00,920
If it's a PDF, you can just look through it like that.

2365
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,320
I am.

2366
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:01,640
Right.

2367
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:04,120
I always thought it was kind of funny when I see people on like,

2368
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,320
like certain like Twitter, like artists, people that make like indie comics talk about like,

2369
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,840
oh, what we need is like an American shonen jump.

2370
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,000
Yeah.

2371
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,560
We need a magazine with like everyone's comics in there.

2372
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:16,920
And I'm thinking.

2373
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:17,720
That's the BCP.

2374
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:18,680
It's called Marvel.

2375
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,200
It's called, it's called the perfect one.

2376
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:20,680
Well, let's see.

2377
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,360
Well, the thing in my head, I'm thinking like,

2378
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:27,080
well, because they talk of the fact that they talk about like an actual magazine makes me think,

2379
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:31,160
I think you're working backwards because no one really reads magazines.

2380
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:36,360
Like they still make them, but they're very expensive and they're only made for a specific

2381
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:39,480
group of much older audience who still like buy them and whatnot.

2382
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,280
Right.

2383
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:44,200
So to do a magazine is kind of like probably like working backwards.

2384
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,240
There are people out there trying to do their own like American shonen jump and they all seem

2385
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,520
to be doing just fine.

2386
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,720
That being said, I think that I don't know.

2387
01:42:55,720 --> 01:43:00,360
I think there isn't much about precedent for that kind of stuff here.

2388
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:04,200
I think what one of these like American shonen jump types need to do is that

2389
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:08,680
they probably just need to have like an anime or like a cartoon based on one of their comics.

2390
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,960
And then they can get more eyes on them, you know, once, once that because what,

2391
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:17,320
what usually like having a cartoon is like, oh, the formula works guys.

2392
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,400
You know, we got a cartoon just like the Japanese, right?

2393
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,320
But who knows?

2394
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,280
Oh, I don't know.

2395
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,640
Like the industry pipeline is different over here.

2396
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:32,600
Yeah, it's, you know, I get the appeal.

2397
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:38,840
I mean, obviously if you have a comic and it's with a bunch of other comics and they're all in

2398
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:43,560
one place, then every reader of every comic will see everyone else's comic and it's like,

2399
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:44,760
oh, it's like collaboration.

2400
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,480
It's like YouTube.

2401
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,080
How do you prepare my video?

2402
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,480
And then you cross pollinate the audiences.

2403
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:56,040
But like, I don't know, people don't read stuff like that online.

2404
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:02,840
The like the perfect comic party is not trying to set out to be shonen jump.

2405
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,000
It's just like, wouldn't it be cool?

2406
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,760
Wouldn't it be like a nice thing?

2407
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,640
Like I like the aesthetic of having a little publication, having a little

2408
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:16,040
little like a little thing, maybe printing it out.

2409
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:24,120
I think I don't know if I'd ever go down the route of having some sort of like collective

2410
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:28,520
magazine with everyone's comics.

2411
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,960
I wonder how I wouldn't have like stuff like shonen jump originally started.

2412
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:34,280
If it was the same thing where it was like a handful of guys,

2413
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,440
somewhere where they could post their comics.

2414
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,480
Actually, you know what?

2415
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,520
That is how those start.

2416
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,080
Never mind.

2417
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,200
I remember.

2418
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:43,320
Maybe it was a newspaper and it was like the funny.

2419
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:48,120
And it's like, what if we had a newspaper with just the funny isn't it?

2420
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,880
And it was the funny is the comments.

2421
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:51,160
It was kind of something like that.

2422
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:57,160
I remember I'm reminded of there's one autobiography I read from a manga co who started

2423
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,000
a specific genre of manga.

2424
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,120
And he was talking about how him and his brother would be friends with a bunch of other people

2425
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:04,680
who were drawn.

2426
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,600
They they just would start their own magazine.

2427
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:12,280
And it was pretty easy to like print and like redistribute distributed like back in the day,

2428
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,440
which would have been maybe the 60s.

2429
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:20,440
And he was talking about how they would have to do something like a reader contest.

2430
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:23,080
Because that's one of those things that would like entice people like,

2431
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:28,280
oh, if you submit this to us, you'll get like a free so and so, you know,

2432
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,720
to kind of like get more engagement out of your readers, you know.

2433
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:36,600
I mean, doing that now, I don't I don't know.

2434
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:42,360
I haven't heard of any like successful someone like doing it very successful.

2435
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:44,120
I mean, what would success even look like?

2436
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,560
You know, it would look like you buy the thing and it's like,

2437
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:50,600
oh, Scott Pilgrim and Homestuck in the same place.

2438
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,960
Oh, God, that sounds like a nightmare.

2439
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:58,200
But they could they could they could they could cross over like, oh, my God, John Egbert.

2440
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,680
What are you doing in my comment?

2441
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:04,360
I'm thinking about like, because it's funny how the more I learned about like,

2442
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,880
how indeed creative people are doing, the more I realized like,

2443
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,400
I'm literally doing the same thing they're doing.

2444
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,600
It's just that they're more popular than me.

2445
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:17,640
There was this one guy who made a post on Instagram talking about how his comic is like

2446
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:21,080
published through Fantagraphics, which is one of the bigger publishers, right?

2447
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:27,000
But the fact is that like Fantagraphics only sold like four copies of his comic last year.

2448
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:32,120
Like only people only four people bought copies of it, which is crazy because it's like,

2449
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,400
this is supposed to be Fantagraphics.

2450
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:35,320
It's supposed to be one of the bigger publishers.

2451
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:40,760
But I guess they're not like super interested in advertising this guy or they do the kind

2452
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:46,120
of thing where they expect since like every like artists nowadays is like a pseudo influencer.

2453
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:50,360
They expect you to do the majority of the marketing for them and they don't have to spend money,

2454
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:56,040
you know, of course, Fantagraphic does market certain comics, but they only market their most

2455
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:03,000
popular stuff or stuff that like, because Fantagraphic does do specific like they translate

2456
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,280
like specific older manga, they republish very old like Mickey Mouse comics.

2457
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:13,800
That's like another thing they do, you know, and sure they do publish like the indie stuff,

2458
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:18,920
but it seems like they only like push the indie stuff when it's someone like popular or someone

2459
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:23,880
who like, you know, already like made a big name for themselves somehow, you know.

2460
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:28,520
And when this guy was talking about like his situation of like what he's going through and

2461
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,120
how like, oh, he they only sold four copies for a big publisher.

2462
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:38,520
I'm thinking like, well, maybe I'm kind of doing the right thing in a way because with

2463
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:44,120
how I'm just like doing the pre-orders and and it's the self publishing that way.

2464
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:51,560
I've heard I've heard like professionals say like if they were starting out now, like people

2465
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:56,680
like I've heard people say like I get if they get asked like, how do I break into the publishing

2466
01:47:56,680 --> 01:48:01,000
industry? How do I get a publisher? And they just like don't like if I if I were starting out now,

2467
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,400
I would just do self publishing. I would self publish everything I would I wouldn't worry about

2468
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:10,280
publisher. But I just want someone to do the work for me. I want someone to do the hard part

2469
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,000
for me. I don't want to do marketing. That's that's kind of like the annoying thing. I mean,

2470
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,760
I to be honest, I really don't really do marketing to be honest, which is what the funny.

2471
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:25,720
I know that's a funny thing for me to say come especially coming from me, right? What the fuck?

2472
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:34,120
But like it's it's it's it's tough out there. I remember I'm not out there. Thank you.

2473
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:40,920
Last year I was talking to I talked to a small like I talked to a couple of small publishers

2474
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:44,520
and it's funny how they're just kind of already doing the thing I'm doing and I'm wondering

2475
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:50,520
like why am I even approaching these guys? One guy I talked to saying like, yeah, I um,

2476
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:55,480
yeah, like I told them about like one time I did pre orders for for villain verse.

2477
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:02,120
I made like around $2,000. And this guy saying like, damn, we never made that amount of money

2478
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:08,280
ever in our publisher. Right. There you go. And another time I was asking because I went around

2479
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:11,000
I was asking for smaller publishers and saying like, Hey, do you guys um,

2480
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,880
do you guys help me like get this specific kind of printing? And they told me like,

2481
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,920
oh, we probably can't do that. But you should go to this printer. And the one they recommended

2482
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:22,840
was the one I already used for everything else. And they told me that they use that printer. And

2483
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:30,120
I'm like, Oh, why do I even need to use your guys? Like what I it's it's it's interesting because

2484
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:36,040
it's like they kind of have a name locally. So I guess that's like the benefit. But it's like,

2485
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:43,240
what's the point, you know, I just got the box from the printer with the copies of the rad con

2486
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:51,000
dojin. The people that the people that the cut the few people that purchased a print copy from me,

2487
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:57,160
I will be sending those. Yes, I found it on my doorstep yesterday. I think I ordered like 30 copies

2488
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:02,200
and I think I sold like less than half of that many, including like the people that I'm just

2489
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:08,200
giving free ones to because they wrote the script and drew and drew the comments. So I've got like

2490
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:17,160
a bunch left. Hey, everyone, st comics.com slash store.html buy buy one of these, please get it

2491
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:23,160
with the combo combo with wrote to rad con. It's the rad combo. But I already have wrote to read

2492
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:29,080
the buy to please. It's fine.

2493
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:42,360
This is why you should never be a distributor. It's okay. You'll have you'll have boxes and boxes

2494
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:48,840
of stuff. You know what's purchased. Honestly, that's why I do pre orders. I hate the idea of

2495
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:53,160
having a shillard of boxes of comics that no one's buying. I have like, oh, that makes sense.

2496
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:58,840
That's smart. Yeah, I didn't even think about it. Yeah, I mean, I like you know how many people

2497
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:02,440
are going to buy it. So you get exactly that amount. You know, what's my you know, what's my

2498
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:09,000
dream position? Like if I had to choose where I would want my life to be is so and my big example

2499
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:14,360
for this is the mega 64 podcast, they do this kind of interesting thing that's a pretty smart on

2500
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:20,040
their side where like, when an episode of their podcast drops, they say on that episode, hey,

2501
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:25,800
and you only get the news through the episode, it's like, hey, we're going to have a 42 hour

2502
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:31,240
special on this shirt starting from when this episode drops. So you should get it now. Right.

2503
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:35,320
And it's like, damn, imagine like having that big of a podcast where you could say like, hey,

2504
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,920
we're having you could do a pre order, like the podcast episode is the announcement for the

2505
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,080
pre order, like, hey, like, you know, you, you get the pre order for this and it's like limited so

2506
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:47,560
and so at that time, right. And that kind of like, you know, incentivize people to like go buy it in

2507
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:54,120
that moment, like once that episode drops, right. And that's, that's kind of like where I I think

2508
01:51:54,120 --> 01:52:00,280
that's what position I would like to be. And it won't even be like, I think if I if I get like,

2509
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:05,720
because I do have like a local San Diego comic collective, that are pretty cool people and I

2510
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:11,000
really love the people there. I would love to get to a point where that that collected on part of

2511
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:18,840
if I'm not even like, I guess our own podcast or something like that, where we just announced

2512
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:24,040
the stuff, you just pre order like right away, like on the podcast itself, you know,

2513
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,600
that that's kind of like where I want to go with all this, to be honest.

2514
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:38,040
Then marking which take care of itself. Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's got to get clout. You just

2515
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:44,360
got to get clout. You got to get clout. What I'm thinking of doing is I make Clarissa or in the

2516
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:51,000
process of making Clarissa, I get back into making videos and I make like banger videos that everyone

2517
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:58,120
loves. And then I can say go from YouTube, this massive website, to my tiny little Amazon thing,

2518
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:03,480
buy my comic or read it even. And they'll all be mine.

2519
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:12,040
Tee hee, I'll make hypocrite videos for money. Who would have thought of such a thing?

2520
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:14,760
That's amazing. Were you were you're not making it for money before?

2521
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:20,200
No, I was making it because I love making videos. I thought it was so cool. I thought it'd be so

2522
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:27,560
famous, famous like just like the the just like the guy with the glasses just like Doug Walker.

2523
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:35,720
It's like Jon Tron. Yeah. I mean, unironically, that's why I started. Actually, there was a part

2524
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:43,320
of me was like, oh, you can make money on YouTube. So it was also for money. But mostly because I

2525
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:51,240
wanted to be like one of the cool gamers on the website. I think I could have done it if I didn't

2526
01:53:51,240 --> 01:54:03,000
hate it. If I didn't get burnt out. That's so true. I mean, what everyone needs like their own

2527
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,600
little cash cow, like their own little thing of above that people love, they're like, oh, I love

2528
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:14,680
this, I'll buy it. You know, everyone needs their own little Smash Bros, which is like tough. Yeah.

2529
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:17,640
In the future, everyone will have their own little Smash Bros.

2530
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:26,760
Do you guys watch Little Joel? Yeah, most of yeah, I often I haven't seen them all.

2531
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:31,320
But Little Joel is the true successor to Digi After Dark.

2532
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:42,520
Yeah, only good. But Little Joel made a video about like how he made a popular video.

2533
01:54:43,240 --> 01:54:49,880
And people make art that is your passion about it. It's like, nah, just make art is popular. So

2534
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:53,880
you get to feel good about it and you get the money and it's great. I'm like, you know what,

2535
01:54:53,880 --> 01:55:00,120
I need more of that, that energy in my life. Yeah. Because I have spent my entire twenties

2536
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:05,720
being like, no, I'm an artist. I have to do things I'm passionate about. Yeah. Look where I am now.

2537
01:55:05,720 --> 01:55:11,080
Well, I'm not nowhere on the Procrastinators podcast. I'm on the Procrastinators podcast.

2538
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:17,960
I need to I need to get big and popular enough where like people don't like because unsolicited

2539
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:22,760
advice, kind of rude, kind of cringe, right? But if you're popular enough, you give that

2540
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:28,360
unsolicited advice and they'll be sucking your dick. Oh my god. They'll lap it up.

2541
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:34,280
I learned more from this guy's from this guy's roast of me than I did in my entire college

2542
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:41,400
career that I spent $500,000 to get. Ben, would you rather have $1 million or a dinner with

2543
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:48,120
cheesy Manfredo? That dinner will pay will pay for itself every day of the rest of my life

2544
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,960
with what I learned from it. Exactly. Because they'll tell you like what to do and my advice

2545
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:55,480
would be kind of like, ah, is there anything? Is there something popular that you really like

2546
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:01,320
right now? I just do your version of that. That's it. That's my advice. Yeah. So would you rather

2547
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:08,120
have a billion dollars or a fortune cookie written by Oscar Wilde? I'll be honest. Something.

2548
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:17,240
With that little Joel, he's talking about like he did the he did that series of three sort of

2549
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:22,920
like kind of artsy like essays, the ones about like Godzilla and like global warming. Yeah.

2550
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:28,440
And those were okay. I didn't hate them. I didn't really love them either. They were they were good.

2551
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:35,160
Yeah. They're more heady than and then and the one you made more recently was more poppy and like

2552
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:39,000
yeah clickable. I didn't like that. I didn't like the new one. I thought I thought the new one was

2553
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:45,000
bad. It's boring. It's like trigger you one. Yeah. I feel like he's literally made the same video

2554
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:54,040
before. It's terrible. So I feel I get I get that like yeah, his like artsy one didn't wasn't a huge

2555
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:59,880
hit. And like, you know, that's fine. I don't I don't like that the lesson he took away from it

2556
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:04,600
is just make the same crap over and over. Like I know he's I know he's just joshin. I know he's

2557
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:12,520
kind of just joshin. He's kind of just joshin. I think it's it's just you can get like stuck

2558
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:20,680
trying to go for only artistic masterpieces when it doesn't actually take that much out of you to

2559
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:27,400
just throw a little crowd pleaser out there so often to keep yourself going and to make yourself

2560
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:31,720
feel accomplished. Yeah. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that.

2561
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:40,440
Yeah. Well, you know, that's but that's not how the coolest people ever constantly were making

2562
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:45,720
bangers and they were never doing anything that sucked. I feel a little bit stupid because it's

2563
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:50,680
been so many months. It's been like five months since the Mega Man lecture. But like that was

2564
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:55,240
kind of my plan with get back into doing lectures. Like that's that's the crowd pleaser.

2565
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:00,920
And then I have not followed up lectures and then be like, oh, this lecture was sponsored by

2566
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:10,200
Biska Page. Biska Page. They're great. Yeah. They're Biska Page. They're great. Exactly.

2567
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:17,640
Okay. And you know what's that? I got I got to get going. Okay. Cheesy eggs is out here. All right.

2568
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:24,760
Okay. Yeah, I appreciate you guys have no sweat. Now people are going to complain that Cheesy made

2569
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:34,600
the episode longer. I was the one complaining the most. So yeah, I won't complain again. I'll find

2570
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:41,000
other things to complain about. All right. Good. All right. Good. Have a good day. Talk to you guys

2571
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:48,200
later. Later. I was going to say, yeah, the me deciding deciding to do more lectures and the

2572
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:52,680
Mega Man lecture in particular was me being like, I should just do the things people like.

2573
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:56,120
I should just make the things that people liked and that were successful.

2574
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:01,560
And then I did it once and I was like, well, I did it. No need to continue doing that.

2575
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:08,440
But I should and I really, you know, I mean, you've been working on the battle network, haven't

2576
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:12,840
you? Yeah. Yeah. That wasn't the next lecture, but that's a lecture. So you're still doing a

2577
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:18,200
lecture. That is work on it on a future lecture that I am doing. That's true. You know, I've been,

2578
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:22,360
I've been putting off really getting to work on the net on the next lecture because

2579
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,800
whenever it's time to work, I'm like, well, I got to work on the I got to work on Biska Page.

2580
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:33,640
Got to work on, you know, get the perfect comic party. So that's. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know,

2581
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:39,080
soon as the first issues out, I'll be like, okay, time to step back and the next the next thing on

2582
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:45,080
my to do list after get the perfect comic party sort of up and running to to whatever extent,

2583
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:49,000
then the next thing is, all right, let's let's do it. Let's do the next lecture.

2584
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:57,560
I got freaking Etsy ghosted me. I ordered some stuff from Etsy for like the video for the

2585
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:06,600
slime and punishment video. And it just didn't come. I paid like $45 for some fabric. And it

2586
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:12,360
just didn't come. And I guess I'm going to have to complain about it. Was it was it sent but not

2587
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:17,320
tracked or something? Yes, it was it said it was sent, but it was it's not they didn't have tracking

2588
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:23,800
on it. And it said it was supposed to arrive by like three days ago. So we're past the time

2589
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:29,240
when like, I should be complaining. But I haven't done it. It's the most annoying, isn't it? When

2590
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:36,280
it's not tracked, so it could arrive as soon as you like buy another one. Yeah. It could just be

2591
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:41,240
running. You don't know that it's going to. So it's like, you can't afford to wait, wait around. So

2592
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:47,000
you got to kind of buy the next one. Yeah. And then it arrives anyway. And it's like, I'm not

2593
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,600
buying. I'm not buying another one. I'm going to I'm going to complain until they refund me

2594
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:56,040
because this is bullshit. At least at least it's for the slime and punishment thing, which it turns

2595
02:00:56,040 --> 02:01:02,040
out I didn't need that soon because I have wait, no, wait, no, before, no, before I do the next

2596
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:05,880
lecture, I have to do the slime and punishment. I have to do the slime and punishment. Never mind.

2597
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:10,440
I take it back. I take back the order I said. Well, why do you have to do the slime and punishment?

2598
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:15,880
Because I just need I just I just need to do it. I just need I just needs to be done.

2599
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:23,160
The book, the Kickstarter just needs it should have done this Kickstarter like three years ago.

2600
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:31,160
Well, and I just had to start it. And then when it's running, I can be working on the lecture

2601
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:36,760
while the Kickstarter is running. I don't have to spend the entire month focused on it. So that's

2602
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:44,920
that's the actual order. PCP, Perfect Comic Party, then that done. OK, make a video and launch the

2603
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:50,120
slime and punishment Kickstarter. OK, and then while that's running, work on the next lecture.

2604
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:57,320
OK, too many things, too many freaking things on my to do list. Irons in the fire.

2605
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:02,440
I yeah, irons in that. Yeah, feels better to look at them as irons in the fire.

2606
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:10,280
Then then items on an on a on a list of things that never seems to get any shorter.

2607
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:17,240
It never will. That's the annoying truth is that the list I've been keeping track of a thing,

2608
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:22,280
like a list of things I got to get done. And it never really goes away. There's just a few

2609
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:26,760
things that stay on there for so long, because it's like, that's hard. And that's like, I don't know

2610
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:31,880
how to start that thing. And it's like tiny little bits, little updates to the site, like, oh,

2611
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:37,560
there's a glitch there. I should go into the code and figure out what's what's not correct.

2612
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:45,080
And now I got to do my taxes. I got my tax letter as well. But it said, like, you've got until

2613
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:51,880
January 2024 to pay last year's taxes. So I guess I've already done my taxes in January.

2614
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:59,240
I guess Americans have them in April or for the previous year's taxes are due in April of the

2615
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:04,760
next year. Yeah. Yeah, I always have my tax thing like around Christmas, like, oh,

2616
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,840
shit, I should have done my taxes before the Christmas holidays. Now I got to do them during

2617
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:15,000
January. It doesn't really take that long. But it doesn't really take that long. Like, I have all

2618
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:21,400
my I have all my open up all of my yeah, all the things. The thing that takes long is going back

2619
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:25,560
through all my expenses and trying to be like that counts as a business expense that counts as a

2620
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:32,760
business expense. Yeah. And tallying all that all that stuff up. Oh, yeah, you got to make you

2621
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:37,000
got to make YouTube videos of all the things you buy, just hold them up to the camera. So

2622
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:43,000
there's YouTube contents part of my brands part of my thing. It's just I got to go back

2623
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,200
through my bank statements. And every time I see an item, if I like, was that was that for a video?

2624
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:53,560
Was that for a comic? Was that for some other potential future money making endeavor? Oh,

2625
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:59,160
all my all my ingredients for all my gummies. Well, I intend to. Yeah, I just ate those. But you

2626
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:04,360
know, I intend to sell them at some point in the future. So that's a business expense. That's

2627
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:12,840
like research and development expense. Ooh, I just got I just got a I just got a gallon jug

2628
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:18,920
of blackstrap molasses. I'm going to try I think after this is going to try chugging that I'm good.

2629
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:23,800
I'm going to I'm going to try I'm going to try licorice again, and I'm going to try replacing

2630
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:32,520
I'm going to try replacing a priori replace the liquid sugar, a priori replace the invert sugar

2631
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:37,400
with blackstrap molasses and just see what happens. Are you going to invert the molasses?

2632
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:44,920
I think it's probably already inverted or it's some other kind of sugar. I don't know.

2633
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:52,360
Yes, I don't know anything about all that. It's it's very food. It's very mysterious.

2634
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:56,280
Cornstarch. It's very mysterious. Listen, when you cook down sugar, starch,

2635
02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:03,720
there is corn oil, corn sugar, corn syrup, syrup, high fructose corn syrup.

2636
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:09,480
I use the non high fructose kind. All right, when you cook down sugar, you cook it,

2637
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:15,960
it gets this first it becomes the softball, then it becomes the firm ball, then it becomes hardball,

2638
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:24,600
then it becomes crackling out brand. Wait, no, it's like a hard cube.

2639
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:30,680
The soft the softball stage. No, no, no. Here we go. Here we go. Softball,

2640
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:38,440
firm ball, hardball, soft crack and hard crack. There you go. So that's that's the goal is to get

2641
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:48,360
that hard crack. I'm all about that hard crack. Speaking of crack, I bought on eBay the bionicles.

2642
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:56,680
You know the bionicles? You ever heard of them? Yeah. I love them and I have been missing them

2643
02:05:56,680 --> 02:06:03,800
for decades or whatever. I never had. I didn't realize. I didn't realize that the original six

2644
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:09,880
were like cheap and like not a problem. I got the whole set. Yeah, they were a very popular

2645
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:17,640
toy. So I'm not surprised they're available. Yeah, I thought like, oh, bionicle collectors,

2646
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:21,880
this probably like it's and it's an old thing. So it's like I assumed it would go up in price

2647
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:27,240
like a video game cartridge would. No, no, no. You just I just have them now and they're back.

2648
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:33,080
They've been gone for so long. They've been gone for so long. My product my prodigal sons have

2649
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:42,520
returned. There's Metsunui. There's Shiranui. No, no, Shiranui is from Okami. There's Uigui.

2650
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:52,120
There's Lewa, Topeka. I've only learned these by looking at the wiki because I forgot what

2651
02:06:52,120 --> 02:07:00,920
their names were. Sean in Topanga. There's Gali, there's Pohatu, Onu, Onganguga. This is racist.

2652
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:09,320
This is racist. It's a little bit racist. A little bit racist. But I love them. They're little masks

2653
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:15,160
and the fact that their skull has the like see-through plastic. So if you shine a light behind

2654
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:20,760
it or if the sun's behind it, blasts through so they've got like green or red like glowing eyes.

2655
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:25,720
Hang on. They're the coolest. I love them. I'm going to carefully examine.

2656
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,160
Wait, they have a skull? Yeah, like did you never have a bionicle?

2657
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:37,800
No, never. I thought they had like a mask. Yeah, the mask that attaches like in the mouth. The

2658
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:42,280
mouth is like a like a you could put a Lego stud in there. I don't think a Lego stud would

2659
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:48,920
actually fit, but like imagine that. And the mask is a clips onto their mouth and their head is like

2660
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:55,960
a gray like skull sort of thing. Look at what I found. The gray skull is like their brain,

2661
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:02,360
which is like a crystal of a clear plastic, colored plastic. Mine too. Light shines through it

2662
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:08,600
and they've got different eye colors and it's looks so cool. I found this was the second like

2663
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:16,040
like eBay result when I searched for bionicle. Well, don't search for such things. I searched

2664
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:21,400
for bionicle and this is what I found. It's your search history. There's a lot of they know

2665
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:27,880
what you've been looking at pornography on eBay. I'm so I'm so horny. I'm going to log on to eBay

2666
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:33,400
and buy some ironic sculptures just to just to rub out a quick one. Is that Jasmine from the

2667
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:41,880
Disney's Aladdin? Hang on. Bionicle. No mask. Show me. Show me the mask was.

2668
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:50,200
Oh, ew. Yeah, they're kind of like gross weirdos. They're kind of gross weirdos,

2669
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:56,120
but their masks make them so cool instantly. It's amazing. Like you take the mask off and it's like,

2670
02:08:56,120 --> 02:09:01,000
oh, this guy is fucked. Oh, then you put the mask on. You put the mask on and it's like,

2671
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:11,240
and that's cool. I remember there was these bionicles and then I was looking into this because

2672
02:09:11,240 --> 02:09:18,440
I was trying to figure out when I fell off the bionicle bandwagon and they had different like

2673
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:26,440
every year it was like in 2001 or 2000 they released and every year they would be like a new

2674
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:34,040
line of bionicles. The second year was these little round guys, these little circular like snakemen

2675
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:42,920
and they would be also of the like six genders, six elements. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2676
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:49,640
Cool. And they had like an action figure thing where you pulled a little piece of Lego at the

2677
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:55,720
back of their neck and their head would jump forward like a snake and then they could roll

2678
02:09:55,720 --> 02:10:03,160
into a ball and like roll around like Samus Aran from Metroid. I watched like a video explaining

2679
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:09,720
like the history of bionicles not that long ago. Not like the in-world lore, but like the

2680
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:17,000
production and like the iterations that Lego went through of like releasing a bunch of themed

2681
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,040
action figures that were elemental. Yeah. Of which there were several different ones and

2682
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,800
bionicle was merely one and was the most well known and successful.

2683
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:34,920
Very strange. A lot of people keep. One of the most popular requests I get for what's your next

2684
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:44,600
lecture going to be is on bionicle lore, which I guess there's lore there. I say that it sounds

2685
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:48,280
terrible, but I don't know. Maybe it's funny. Maybe it's cool. I mean, there's enough of it

2686
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:54,280
that you could have like good stuff. I'm pretty sure the comics, I've seen parts of a comic before

2687
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,280
that came with like one of the Lego figures is like the comic looks good. It's like genuinely

2688
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:05,960
cool looking. I don't know if the story is good, but like. I mean, like what's there like there's

2689
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,280
like an animated series. There's a toy series. There's a toy set. There's a film. There's a

2690
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:14,840
video games. The whole thing. That's not that much lore. I don't think it'd be that hard to

2691
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:20,760
explain, right? Like it's not Mega Man where there's like 45 different video games. Oh, no, no, not

2692
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:26,200
at all. I don't even know if it would be that hard. Maybe I should just do it. Maybe I should just do it.

2693
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:30,600
Maybe I should. Wait a minute. Maybe I should just make a video that would be popular and

2694
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:38,920
that people want to see. Oh my goodness. What the fuck? No, but my, no, but my art. Oh, my artistic

2695
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:44,200
purity, the purity of my artistic intention, demand that I make my next lecture about a

2696
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:51,720
fucking battle network. It's just so artistically pure. It's like in the wake of,

2697
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:59,720
um, remember, remember, uh, you know, Nate had the, um, the freaking, uh, the weaponized

2698
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:04,600
thickness. I don't know if I mentioned this in the, in the vlog that he made immediately

2699
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:08,760
following the viral success of weaponized thickness when that video got 2 million views.

2700
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:15,480
He says like, I could make t-shirts of it. People have asked me for weaponized thickness

2701
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:21,640
t-shirts and I could do them and they would sell and it would make me money, but I won't do it.

2702
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:28,760
I can't do it because I'm just a slave to, but it's like my pure, it's like not my pure artistic

2703
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:36,040
vision. Uh, yeah. He's like, I can't, it's too commercial. Like it's too, it's too crass. He

2704
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:40,360
doesn't say it in this many words. I'm paraphrasing, but basically he's like, it's too crass and

2705
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:44,840
commercial and I just don't want to do it. I'm an artist. I'm not some kind of, I'm not some kind of

2706
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:55,560
merch hawker. I'll never make t-shirts. Right. The nickel, the nickel. Uh, it's just weird. It's

2707
02:12:55,560 --> 02:13:02,040
just weird. Like why, why not just make a shirt? Why not just make a shirt? Maybe it's just annoying,

2708
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:05,640
but I feel like you could easily have made a weaponized thickness thing.

2709
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:11,240
Yeah. I mean, he said so. He said people, he said, he said people are asking for it.

2710
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:16,360
Yes. Short-card gothic, of course. He said, he said people are asking for one. He knew they would

2711
02:13:16,360 --> 02:13:28,280
sell, but he won't do it because it's not art. I don't know. Before we end this section, I just want

2712
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:34,600
to post the third generation of these guys. So they were like villain bionicles and they had

2713
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:41,880
staves and these, I remember having one of these and that's, I think was 2003 and 2004.

2714
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:50,920
I think 2004 onwards was when they just did the original six, but they had different masks

2715
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:55,560
and I felt like the masks weren't as good. And so I was, I fell off. I was like, nah.

2716
02:13:56,200 --> 02:14:00,840
But that's when apparently, 2004 onwards is apparently where it got really big and like

2717
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:04,200
there was so much stuff, those video games and all that in the movie. And I'm like,

2718
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:08,200
by that point, I was gone. I was out of it. I was out of the game.

2719
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:18,680
Graduated. Graduated as they say in the VTuber space. Yeah. They won't let me back.

2720
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:24,680
I got a pee. You know what I mean? You know what, me too.

2721
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,760
Hey, hello.

2722
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:33,240
Sorry, I was eating a bacon sandwich. It was very yummy. That was fast.

2723
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:38,840
It was only a small sandwich. It really wolfed it. I wolfed it. I wanted to get back to the show.

2724
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,440
So much. Do you want to talk about One Piece?

2725
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:52,840
New One Piece chapter? Yeah, I think so. Okay. Okay. Well, guess what?

2726
02:14:53,160 --> 02:15:00,360
What? There's a new One Piece chapter and it's called Chapter 1080, The Hero of Legend.

2727
02:15:03,080 --> 02:15:07,720
And we see there's a bunch of new fruits. 1080p.

2728
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:20,040
Let's see. Okay. So it's my vague recollections. There's a bunch of the Blackbeard pirates have

2729
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:26,840
a bunch of new fruits. One of their guys is an island man, and he just is the island that they're

2730
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:32,760
on. That's pretty wacky. Pizarro. I don't remember if these fruits, they already had them.

2731
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:39,640
Some of these I don't remember. I'm not sure if they had them already. I know the Hero did not

2732
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:49,880
have the invisible fruit. They got that from the Moria's subordinate. Who's that guy? Absalom.

2733
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:58,520
I remember him getting it from Absalom. Blackbeard using his, I forget, what even happened?

2734
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:03,080
This is the part where all the people who read One Piece and know it are pissing themselves with

2735
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:09,160
rage that we don't already know the things we're thinking about. Here's the ones. I think,

2736
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:14,760
I don't remember. I've never seen an island island fruit before. I've never seen the glug glug

2737
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:19,880
fruit before. I've never seen the huge, huge fruit before. Yeah, these are reveals, I guess,

2738
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:23,160
of their fruits. These are reveals. I don't know if we got them recently. I mean,

2739
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:31,720
San Juan Wolf is already huge. What does it mean that he has eaten the huge, huge fruit?

2740
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:39,640
Well, if you look at him in comparison to other giants, he is far larger than any giant ever in

2741
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:45,080
history. And so people are like, why is he so big? And it's because he's a giant that ate

2742
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:50,040
a devil fruit that also makes you big. So he's just bigger than the average giant.

2743
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:56,040
Do you think he had already eaten it before? Oh, yeah. I think that's like he walks along

2744
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:59,960
the ocean floor and it makes him tired because he's a devil fruit user.

2745
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:07,480
Hmm. Yeah, okay. That might, yeah. I guess I believe that.

2746
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:16,760
Pizarro being an island fruit, it sort of feels very similar to that guy in the

2747
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:23,400
Indress Rosa who has the something something turns into a mountain or stone or like the

2748
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:28,920
like terrain terrain fruit or something like that. Something of that nature. So I guess this is just

2749
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,960
the same thing, but bigger. Yeah.

2750
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:39,960
Everyone's so fucking big. You just, I guess he can do it with a whole island,

2751
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:45,320
but he can only do it with natural terrain. Well, no, no, no, because he becomes,

2752
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:50,040
he becomes the wooden floorboards and he becomes like the brick wall.

2753
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:55,240
Yeah, it's a pretty wacky because he's if he's an island, surely he feels the

2754
02:17:56,200 --> 02:18:03,160
the edge of the ocean lapping at his himself. Surely that makes him weaker

2755
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:09,000
if he can constantly be in contact with the ocean. Yeah, an island, wait, an island is in

2756
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:17,000
the ocean. What the fuck? Yeah, so that's pretty fucked up. Oh, and then this lady with the whip

2757
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:24,280
whip fruit. Yes, I love all of the sword members. I don't really know what she's doing with her whip.

2758
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Oh, okay. She's just, she's whipping a building and making it move? Yeah, she's got a devil fruit

2759
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:44,040
that makes inanimate objects react to her, what do you call it, like dominatrix whipping.

2760
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:51,320
It's like move back boy, be a good boy and move and the building does as she's told, as it's told.

2761
02:18:51,560 --> 02:19:00,600
It's very interesting, fascinating. So yeah, we're on Pirate Island is Blackbeard's land

2762
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:07,480
or is territory and we've got the Blackbeard Pirates just fucking around and Kobe, who we knew

2763
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:16,280
was with. It's called Fulaled. Pirate Island Fulaled is what my translation says. I'm reading

2764
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:26,360
the Viz translation. Ah, Hachinossu. Yeah, so yeah, Fulaled probably cooler and whatever that means.

2765
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:37,240
Well, maybe it literally is that. That's localization, baby. Yes. So yeah, there's the cross guild,

2766
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:43,160
Buggy's thing. I was going to say the bounty on Kobe, that's from Buggy's crew, right? Yeah,

2767
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:54,280
Buggy's organization. The cross guild. Because I would assume it is a guild where you don't cross

2768
02:19:54,280 --> 02:20:00,200
them, I don't know. Very honestly, very cool to see bounties out on marines. I just think that's

2769
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:09,080
really fun. Yeah, I like that aspect of Buggy's progression. He's always getting people to fight

2770
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:14,520
for him and what better way to get people to fight the marines than to put bounties on their heads

2771
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:20,840
and he's got so much power and wealth that he can afford that. It's really funny.

2772
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:29,160
It's pretty awesome and they have a star rating. Apparently one star is about,

2773
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,880
one star is one treasure chest, which is worth about a million berries.

2774
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:38,600
So why not just average in millions? It is very abusing that they

2775
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:44,360
pirate treasure chests of booty. Right, right.

2776
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:56,920
Yeah, so Blackbeard, we saw Blackbeard's ship heading in the direction of egg land.

2777
02:20:57,720 --> 02:21:01,560
Yes. And so I was hypothesizing that Kobe-

2778
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:05,240
I thought we saw him. No, no, I guess we didn't see him. We just saw his flag.

2779
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:10,520
The things we've seen Blackbeard going on about recently are Blackbeard fighting Law

2780
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:19,160
and I presume that because Kid was defeated by Shanks, Law was probably defeated by Blackbeard

2781
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:25,720
and then Blackbeard is on his way after that to Luffy at, what's it called? Is it New Egg?

2782
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:30,200
What's it called? Egghead. Egghead. He's on his way to Egghead.

2783
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,600
New Egg is that website you can buy computer parts for?

2784
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:39,160
That's right, yes. I mean, it's basically the same. Sure.

2785
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:41,880
You can get computer parts at Vegapunks Island.

2786
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,920
And so this, I think, takes place before that because we knew Kobe was captured by Blackbeard.

2787
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:58,200
I assumed he was on the ship and we might see him at Egghead and if he's escaping now,

2788
02:21:58,840 --> 02:22:06,680
which I assume is before. But then, I don't know, what do you think could happen here?

2789
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:10,120
Because Kobe is trying to escape. He's getting all of these other people,

2790
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:15,880
these prisoners escaping is like he's being a hero. And then the Blackbeard pirates are just

2791
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:23,080
fucking around and they think, haha, whatever, stupid Kobe, no chance. But then Kobe's friends,

2792
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:30,360
Kobe's comrades, Nakama, they're coming in and they've really got some cool powers

2793
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:34,520
and they're showing up and they're being all epic.

2794
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:39,160
These aren't just regular cops. These are renegade cops that are above the law.

2795
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:43,240
They're taking the law into their own hands. Taking the law into their own hands. They got a

2796
02:22:43,240 --> 02:22:47,960
license to kill. They're going to turn in their gun and their badge.

2797
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:53,480
Oh, I really like Hibari. She's using, she's the one with the rifle.

2798
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:57,000
She was using the, she was the Vegapunk flower, flower shot.

2799
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:05,240
Yeah, the flower shot. That's cool. Also, I really like her weird fucking clown tights and like army

2800
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:13,000
shoe combo. Yeah, she's cute. Yeah, the stripe, I like the stripe tights. Very cute. Oh, it's on one

2801
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:20,280
leg. Oh yes, it's ripped off at one leg. That's fun. And she's like, haha, it's not like I like

2802
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:27,240
you or anything, Kobe. Kobe's getting all of these ladies. He's surrounded by them. It's great.

2803
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:34,760
Have we seen this clay man with the Prince of Groose? He looks kind of familiar.

2804
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:38,120
I don't think we've seen any of these people before. I think they're all

2805
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:45,000
like new, except, well, obviously, except for Garp. I don't think there was,

2806
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:56,520
there was a bit earlier, Tashiki's here as well, where there was, and Helm Epo.

2807
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:02,760
Helm Epo, everybody's favorite. Helm Epo alongside some other girl who was crying

2808
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:06,840
that Kobe's been stolen by Blackbeard and saying, Garp, we gotta go save him.

2809
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:13,480
I forget. I don't think, well, she's probably in a panel here, but not prominently featured.

2810
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:23,880
She's not one of these new people. Just some steak. Yeah. Hey, why is Alkegi here?

2811
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:33,480
Alkegi, if you remember, fought against Akainu and created Punk Hazard at the end

2812
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:39,640
after the Marenford thing, and it was over a disagreement about the Marines and how things

2813
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:46,440
should be run, and so they fought about it, and Alkegi left, and then he joined Blackbeard.

2814
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:51,000
He joined Blackbeard? Yeah, he joined Blackbeard after that, and he's like,

2815
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:57,240
I forgot that. Yeah, he's been part of Blackbeard's crew or an ally. I'm assuming he's part of the

2816
02:24:57,240 --> 02:25:02,040
crew. I don't really know what his deal is because he doesn't seem like the sort of guy who would

2817
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:08,040
just join to be part of the bad guys. I don't think he wants to kill people. Maybe Blackbeard

2818
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:15,000
has more of a plan than we're led to believe. That's very strange to me that Alkegi would

2819
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:21,320
join Blackbeard. I feel like Alkegi's joining Blackbeard not because he agrees with Blackbeard,

2820
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:25,800
but because it's advantageous to whatever ends Alkegi has. He must be doing something.

2821
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:33,000
Because I like Alkegi, he seems like an upstanding fellow, and Blackbeard seems like a bit of a

2822
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:41,240
scoundrel and not quite the same level of, I don't know. Blackbeard's just out for himself,

2823
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:47,880
so I don't get what's the appeal of working with him for someone like Alkegi.

2824
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:51,800
Being on a powerful pirate crew to insulate him from the Marines or something?

2825
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:56,840
Yeah, I mean, yeah. Or like influencing him from the inside?

2826
02:25:56,840 --> 02:26:01,960
Maybe Alkegi just wants to join the witting side.

2827
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:07,720
Could be something like that, I don't know. I feel like the fact that he let Nico Robin go

2828
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:11,880
all those years ago means that he doesn't actually believe the Marines are the good guys, fully.

2829
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:20,920
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Okay, yeah, well I forgot. I was shocked to see him here,

2830
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:29,000
but I guess that explains it. We unfortunately do not get to see what the glug glug fruit does.

2831
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:34,360
Yeah, it just makes bubbles like Glowbox and Rayman 3.

2832
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:41,480
Rayman 3! No, no, no. That's the huge... That's San Juan Wolf making the bubbles,

2833
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:43,880
making the snot bubbles. No, it's Vasco shot, isn't it?

2834
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:49,880
Well, no, Vasco shot is riding a bubble, but the bubbles are just coming out of the San Juan

2835
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:56,440
Wolf's nose or whatever. I don't think that's a fruit power. I think that guy, I think he's just

2836
02:26:56,440 --> 02:27:05,160
a snotty boy. Vasco, what you doing? He's gonna drink that snot later and it's gonna give him

2837
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:11,960
so much power. So he's called a booze man, heavy drinker, he ate the glug glug fruit.

2838
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:16,440
And he's drinking booze. I assume that means he can

2839
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:24,440
inebriate people and things like that, turn water into wine and he's like,

2840
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:32,040
oh my goodness, is Jesus? Yeah, I mean, it could be. I'll turn your blood alcohol

2841
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:37,400
levels a little too high and then you'll fall over. It could be a logia, I guess, but probably not.

2842
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:42,600
I mean, he's made of alcohol, he's set him on fire.

2843
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:54,360
Yes, that would be pretty easy actually. Okay, okay. Let's see here, I mean, what's...

2844
02:27:56,520 --> 02:28:02,440
So the other thing about this, there's Maria. Yes, Corona and Maria.

2845
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:12,840
Yeah, so Corona, I guess, is outside and she gave the keys to Kobe so that he could free Maria

2846
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:20,920
and free himself. So there's like a little alliance there. I'm sure Kobe will hold up

2847
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:27,880
his end of the bargain because he's a good boy, which means Maria will be back in the game in some

2848
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:33,160
fashion, which is interesting. We haven't seen Maria for so many years.

2849
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:37,560
Were we just talking like a couple of weeks ago about how is Maria even still alive?

2850
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:45,240
Yeah, I mean, I thought he died at the Battle of Marenford and I guess he didn't.

2851
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:54,760
I don't remember when it was made clear. I think it became overtly clear when

2852
02:28:54,840 --> 02:29:00,280
Absalom came to Blackbird and said, please let my captain go. So I'm like, okay, he's alive.

2853
02:29:00,280 --> 02:29:05,080
But maybe it was already made clear in some other fashion earlier than that.

2854
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:08,920
But yeah, he's been, like ever since Luffy beat him,

2855
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:16,120
he's been taking Ls. I wonder what's going to happen because he's got a powerful fruit.

2856
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:21,080
Well, maybe he doesn't have it anymore. Maybe Blackbird stole his fruit.

2857
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:27,480
Is the one that he can just put people's shadows into other things and it animates those things

2858
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:32,360
and turns them into zombies or whatever? Specifically, he takes your shadow away from you

2859
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:39,000
and can put it wherever he wants. He can put it in himself. He can put it inside a zombie.

2860
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,520
But if you don't have a shadow and the sun hits you, you burn to death.

2861
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:50,200
Right. Which is the scary thing about having no shadow is that you burn in the sunlight.

2862
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:55,400
I forgot about that. That was the whole ticking clock at the end of Thriller Bark where

2863
02:29:55,400 --> 02:30:00,280
Thriller Bark, because of various things that happened on the island, the ship that's an island,

2864
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:09,160
it's not the Bermuda Triangle, but it's a version of that big cloud that's constantly

2865
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:13,240
nighttime and it was drifting out of it because somebody had broken the rudder or something

2866
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:18,920
during all the fighting. And for the first time in a long time, the sun was rising and everyone

2867
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:23,080
who didn't have a shadow was like, we got to kill Moria and get our shadows back. Otherwise,

2868
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:29,160
we'll all burn to death. That was so cool. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah.

2869
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:33,720
And then he took, he took a, right, he took Brooke's shadow and put it, and that was Ryuma,

2870
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:38,920
right? And he put Brooke's shadow into Ryuma. Yeah. Okay. That's how Zora got the sword.

2871
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:44,840
Ah, so many things. They all come back. Yeah. So like, I'm excited to see how

2872
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:51,000
Moria comes back into the story in some small way. And Perona, obviously, she's been around

2873
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,680
with Hawkeye, but then when Hawkeye lost his immunity from the Marines, he had to go into

2874
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:04,520
hiding and Perona had to run away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. As one does. And so like, I don't know where

2875
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:12,360
Hogback is. I've never not seen him in a while. Wouldn't it be cool if like the Thriller Bark

2876
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:17,400
completely forgot about Hogback? Didn't expect to ever see Hogback again.

2877
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:23,880
But maybe. Yeah, Hogback. And what's the lady who's a zombie who's like throws dinner plates?

2878
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:32,440
It's like the lady he made to be his wife, but she hates him even though he created her. Oh,

2879
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:38,200
God, yeah. Right. And she just hates dinner plates. And I forget, I think it's because of

2880
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:48,680
the shadow she has in her that causes that. I got a reread Thriller Bark. That's one of the arcs

2881
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:56,440
that I have not gone back to. I've gone back to reread, look at earliest stuff. I'm actually doing

2882
02:31:56,440 --> 02:32:03,640
a reread with a bunch of people, including Manchi, who is now going to be reading One Piece.

2883
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:10,040
Yes, I've heard about that. Very exciting. But I've not reread everything. And so certain parts

2884
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:16,920
have just not gone. I've not gone over them a second time. Look at Prince Groose making his little

2885
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:23,640
his little glorp, glorp self. Look at look at his little man. Glorp and glorp self.

2886
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:30,600
He's making a little he's making his little boy. He's making his little boy. He's a very cute little boy.

2887
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:35,160
Yeah. It's pretty, pretty cool, pretty cool.

2888
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:44,840
Oh, yeah. And I guess to wrap up what happens in the chapter, Garp appears on a flying ship on

2889
02:32:44,840 --> 02:32:49,720
his flying marine galleon with the dog head. And then he does a galaxy fist.

2890
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:57,320
Just blast their fucking town to smithereens. You're so fucking strong. He doesn't even need

2891
02:32:57,400 --> 02:33:04,120
to do anything. What do you think is going to happen here, first of all?

2892
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:12,520
Well, I guess it's Garp versus Blackbeard. Yeah. And like, I don't know if Garp is

2893
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:15,960
like every member of the Blackbeard crew that's here. And it's Blackbeard.

2894
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:20,600
Yeah, it's going to be the it's going to be sword, the sword members versus the Blackbeard crew.

2895
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:24,280
Like how else can this go? Well, it's going to be a fight, but like

2896
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:31,080
they're going to break off into a series of one on one engagements. Maybe we maybe we won't see

2897
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:35,640
them. We won't see. I think we'll hear about what happened and it'll be like a big moment.

2898
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:40,360
Like if Garp is dead, that would be a huge moment. I don't think he's going to die,

2899
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:45,560
but he might get defeated. He could die. He could die. Honestly, he could die. Yeah.

2900
02:33:45,560 --> 02:33:50,040
But I don't think and this is and this is the main villain of the series that he's going against

2901
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:55,320
and he's doing it to rescue his boy. This is this is when old men die. This is when old

2902
02:33:55,320 --> 02:34:00,280
men die in one piece. It's when they stand up for their boys. And this is the thing.

2903
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:06,360
Blackbeard ship is on its way to Egghead. So presuming that this didn't happen that long ago

2904
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:11,560
because Oh, this is the flashback. Yeah. Garp wants to go save. It might not be a flashback,

2905
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:16,600
but I don't know where Blackbeard would be if not here because who's on the ship?

2906
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:25,160
This could be a flashback. I think it might be. But like Garp is doing this. Disobeying orders

2907
02:34:25,160 --> 02:34:29,320
to be part of the fleet heading for Egghead. So we know it's happening around the same time.

2908
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:37,160
And if Kobe is here and Garp's here, then either Garp saves Kobe and they leave.

2909
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:45,480
And then for some reason Blackbeard appears at Egghead or Blackbeard is running to Egghead

2910
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:53,400
from Garp or the people on the Blackbeard ship are not who you expect or some other thing.

2911
02:34:55,880 --> 02:35:00,920
Whenever we get info on who's on that ship, we'll know what happened here.

2912
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:06,600
Like this is going on now and that ship is just someone else. I mean, the entire crew's not here.

2913
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:14,760
He could have just sent like... I don't remember who the other guys are.

2914
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:23,560
Let me look it up real quick. I made a mistake. The bit where Kobe is kneeling before Blackbeard

2915
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:32,280
is a flashback and currently Kobe is on the island escaping. The bit where he's kneeling before?

2916
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:40,040
Like Blackbeard's there and he's like, haha, fuck you, little boy. Oh, right. When he says I'm sword.

2917
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:47,560
Yeah, I'm a member of sword and it's like, yeah, that. So there's Van Algar, there's Doc.

2918
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:53,080
That could be a flashback within a flashback. It could be. I think the flashbacks are usually

2919
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:59,560
denoted by the background being either gray or black and this is not gray or black. So maybe

2920
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:04,360
you're right and this is currently happening right now. Garp is attacking Blackbeard's island.

2921
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:08,440
Yeah. When Blackbeard is not here and he's actually at Egghead with the rest of his crew.

2922
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:21,320
I think so. Okay, so the crew, so we don't see Lafitte. Avalo Pizarro is this new guy that we

2923
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:29,400
just met. Lafitte, Van Algar, Jesus Burgess, Katarina, Devon and I think that's it. So there's

2924
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:35,800
like a bunch of people that could be on that ship going somewhere else. We know that because we've

2925
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:46,520
seen recently the ship has a brig and in the brig is a, what's her face? Three-Eye Girl

2926
02:36:47,880 --> 02:36:51,880
pudding. Pudding is on that ship. She probably still is.

2927
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:03,880
And she was kidnapped putting Sanji's bride from Holcake. She's in there.

2928
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:10,280
Probably hasn't like, because we've seen her in the ship, it's probably safe to assume that

2929
02:37:10,280 --> 02:37:19,000
the ship contains her still and she's not here on the island. And that was going on. We saw her

2930
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:26,200
when Blackbeard was fighting Law. So maybe Law could be with pudding in the brig. If he was

2931
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:32,040
defeated, if he wasn't defeated, then he may have escaped. But pudding might be coming to see Sanji

2932
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:40,040
again pretty soon. That sounds very likely. Okay, so apparently Pizarro was from Impel Down.

2933
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:45,160
I forgot we'd seen him before. Yeah, yeah. All of the Blackbeard

2934
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:49,560
additions were from Impel Down. I don't think there's been any others since.

2935
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:56,280
But we haven't seen much of them. This is the first time where I think

2936
02:37:56,280 --> 02:38:00,360
even really seeing a conversation with Pizarro and Vasco Schaatt and stuff.

2937
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:05,480
Yeah, we've just kind of seen them around. Apparently they each command their own

2938
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:12,200
like shit. Their own part of the Blackbeard fleet. Yeah. They're called the Ten Titanic

2939
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:21,480
Captains. Also, okay, okay. So apparently we did see sword before. Here's like an old panel of

2940
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:30,840
and it's several of the several of the same people. Oh, yes. Okay, apparently they were in

2941
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:39,080
they were mentioned in chapter 498 and also in 956. I think this panel is probably from 956.

2942
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:42,920
So yeah, that hat guy.

2943
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:47,880
Wait, X Drake might be a member?

2944
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:55,000
I mean, the wiki lists X Drake as an active member of sword. I don't know. Oh, and then,

2945
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:01,240
of course, the three Golems. And then, of course, the three Golems are the most important ones.

2946
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,200
Well, I thought 956 wasn't that long ago, but it's like it's

2947
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:13,960
Oh, no, it is it is 100 100 in some chapter. It was it's the reverie. I thought it was like

2948
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:18,760
Fishman Island because I was seeing Fishman Island stuff, but it's Garp having a chat with

2949
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:26,120
Neptune. I forgot about this apparently apparently sword was first mentioned as far back as 498.

2950
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:32,440
You got to be shitting on me. You got to be crunch. You got to be you got to be insane.

2951
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:36,840
That's what it says. How could something have happened before?

2952
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:44,440
I don't I just I just don't know. I don't I can't explain it. The Romanized name is Sodor.

2953
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:47,800
You're welcome. You're welcome for that.

2954
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:59,320
Yeah, there's a I think a bunch of the people are just a bunch of the people pictured here

2955
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:06,360
might just be Golems. I think they are just clay Golems. So they're not real. Don't worry about

2956
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:16,840
them. Oh, yes. Drake is in this chapter nine fifty six. He is a captain of sword and he's talking

2957
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:23,480
to Kobe. Huh? Yeah, I remember Drake talking to Kobe, but I forgot that detail.

2958
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:28,920
I see that. Yeah, that does sound kind of familiar, actually.

2959
02:40:30,840 --> 02:40:34,920
Oh, that's right. This is where Kobe talks about. Yeah, he says I'm on my way to the

2960
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:41,240
island of women. Corsi is Corsi is perfect place to be for Kobe. Yeah, to capture the

2961
02:40:41,240 --> 02:40:47,640
pirate Empress Boa Hancock because she is no longer she should be okay. Do you like Kobe?

2962
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:55,640
I think I don't like him. I don't like him. I think that they made him too handsome. But aside

2963
02:40:55,640 --> 02:41:02,040
from that, I do like him. I think he's he's he's pure of heart and like a nice little boy. I mean

2964
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:07,320
the fact that he has history with Luffy is cool. I think he probably sees him as like a little

2965
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:12,120
brother kind of. I like that. I like that aspect of him. I think I just don't like how he looks.

2966
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:16,040
I don't think he looks cool and they're sort of building him up as like a cool badass and he

2967
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:22,120
just doesn't look cool. Now, Smoker is the cool badass Marine. Everyone agrees. I feel like Smoker

2968
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:29,320
is the one. I feel like a future one. He's the way that like Momonosuke is a future cool guy.

2969
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:33,720
It's he feels a little bit like like right in from Metal Gear Solid 2 where there's like oh,

2970
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:39,880
there's a new like young pretty pretty boy badass in town and he's the super strongest soldier of

2971
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:45,880
all. It's like, no, no, I don't like him. Get him out of here.

2972
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:50,440
My god, this chapter has so much shit happening.

2973
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:57,640
The new one? No, no, no. The one I'm looking back at 956 is I think it's when

2974
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:03,000
at Reverie, they decided that the Shichibukai were no longer

2975
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:11,480
protected by the Marines. And so all of the Shichibukai reacting to that knowledge and like

2976
02:42:14,200 --> 02:42:19,640
yeah, Buggy the Clown is like freaking out because he's no longer defending it defended.

2977
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:26,760
So I think this is where he decides to create Cross Guild and then Mihawk is being attacked.

2978
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:32,200
And then here's Edward Weevil, who very briefly was part of the thing.

2979
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:39,640
Is that when we first saw Edward Weevil? No, no, we saw him before. He caused some havoc.

2980
02:42:39,640 --> 02:42:46,200
And they said somewhere that he became a warlord, but then they abolished the warlordness.

2981
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:53,080
And now what's her face? Stussy, the real Stussy now that we know her real name

2982
02:42:53,640 --> 02:43:01,000
says, yeah, kill them all, kill these Marines and then Boa Hancock. And then Kobe goes to

2983
02:43:01,560 --> 02:43:05,400
arrest Boa Hancock, something, something, Black Bear arrives

2984
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:13,080
and captures Kobe. And that's why we're in this situation where Kobe is trying to escape.

2985
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:19,000
And that was 100 chapters ago. Wow. That's so many chapters.

2986
02:43:19,640 --> 02:43:26,840
Could you even imagine drawing one chapter of anything? I can't, let alone two.

2987
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:30,760
A little on 1000.

2988
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:37,480
1000 and 80. I can't wait for the 1111 chapter.

2989
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:40,760
Oh, base, dab.

2990
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:47,880
Well, do we have anything else to say about this, this guy?

2991
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:55,000
Still looking forward to seeing what this egghead incident is all about, I guess.

2992
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,120
Yes, they're building it up. Everybody's going to be there.

2993
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:04,040
Yeah, I think I think it's probably other other Blackbeard pirates are on the ship and

2994
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:12,920
probably freaking whatever. I've got a wacko prediction. I've got a wacko prediction.

2995
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:20,520
Pudding has the ability to remove memories from a person's head. That's her devil fruit ability.

2996
02:44:20,520 --> 02:44:29,000
What if she removes the painful memories from Bonnie's head upon request? I don't want to know

2997
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:35,160
about it anymore. Please just take them out of my brain. Yeah. Pudding's like, okay.

2998
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:45,320
Wait, who was that girl that Sanji had a little fling with in Dressrosa?

2999
02:44:47,640 --> 02:44:50,760
Violetta? Violetta. Violetta?

3000
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:56,040
She had a power, right? Yeah, I think her character was really badly handled.

3001
02:44:56,040 --> 02:45:02,360
She had the whatever power we needed for this arc power. What did she do?

3002
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:10,280
I think it was something like she could see anyone around. Let me look it up, I can't remember.

3003
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:19,320
Yeah, I'm looking it up. Or Viola. Viola, yeah. We're looking that up on the hero's wiki.

3004
02:45:21,080 --> 02:45:25,400
She looks so much better in the manga than the anime. Dressrosa just looked so ugly.

3005
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:31,960
In the anime? Yeah. They stepped it up after Dressrosa, but I remember Dressrosa being so

3006
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:39,720
not good to look at. Appearance, personality, relationships. What's her, just tell me what

3007
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:45,480
her fucking fruit is. A very great fruit. A very great fruit. The Giro know me. Parameshia

3008
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:51,080
allows her to see through solid objects and over vast distances. So she was just used as the,

3009
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:56,040
I know what's happening where and I'm information. This is why I was confusing her with

3010
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:04,600
pudding, because pudding has the third eye. Oh yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh, and then she sees.

3011
02:46:05,480 --> 02:46:10,840
She activates her. She can see through Sanji's skin and bones.

3012
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:16,600
She has the power to read other people's minds, even view their memories. She's impossible to

3013
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:22,120
deceive. This power is exceptionally useful for interrogation. Yeah, that's where her job was.

3014
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:26,760
It was this ability to let her see through all the men who attempted to lie to her, but then

3015
02:46:27,880 --> 02:46:36,360
Sanji was so pure in his love for women that she was taken aback that he wasn't trying to be evil.

3016
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:44,760
Me, a woman. Oh my God. I can't believe men are all out to deceive me. They're all out to just use

3017
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:51,960
me. Finally, finally, a man who truly down and deep in his heart of hearts loves women. A man who

3018
02:46:51,960 --> 02:47:00,680
loves women with uniron. He loves big tits unironically and he will never go trans. Sanji is the

3019
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:06,840
man for me. He's the biggest feminist of all and it's proven by Viola.

3020
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:10,920
It's funny because like it's not.

3021
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:18,760
I don't know if I'm reading too much into it, but it's is it just that like

3022
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,400
he did he was he like in love with her or does he just love women?

3023
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:30,040
I forget. I mean, he does. He loves her because he loves women.

3024
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:34,840
Right. He's like I love his love. His love for me is pure. Yes, he would feel the same

3025
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:40,040
towards any other female, but it is nevertheless pure. I think the thing is like

3026
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:49,320
she sees that men are like scoundrels and but even though she betrayed Sanji and caught him

3027
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:56,200
and then got him shot or something, he was bleeding, he protected her because she's so sexy.

3028
02:47:56,200 --> 02:48:01,400
Right. And she was like, you do that for me. And then it turns out that she was being oppressed

3029
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:07,000
by the Dressrosa pirate crew anyway. So she didn't actually like being under them.

3030
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:16,680
And she was a big fan of Sanji after that. Viola can gigantic her tears and subsequently

3031
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:22,360
detach and manipulate them using them to pursue her opponents and attack them with blunt force.

3032
02:48:23,080 --> 02:48:31,560
Yeah, that I don't get. What the fuck? It's it's a bit odd, but I guess it's sort of like it's a bit

3033
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:38,600
of you know, being over the head with a thing maybe. So Giro Giro, I guess the official English

3034
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:45,800
name is glare glare, but the the meaning of the word is to a glare or a stare. So she and it turns

3035
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:51,560
she's looking. That's her power. It turns. Yes, she is looking. She's a looking to human. No,

3036
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:56,520
she's an insight human or in the Viz translation, an eagle eyed seer.

3037
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:02,680
None of that makes me think that she can make giant tears that will bash you.

3038
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:11,560
I think that was just a part of like, ah, fuck it, whatever. I just want to have like a

3039
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:17,080
let's her do a punch. Like, oh, it was just like, I need her to do like a comedy moment

3040
02:49:17,080 --> 02:49:22,040
where she beats the shit out of someone with her own tears. Yeah. It's just like, yeah, she

3041
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:31,640
can do it. Sure. Whatever. I get it. Like, she she awakened. I do feel like there were too many

3042
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:36,760
characters interest for her zone. Viola was unfortunately completely sidelined after whatever

3043
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:42,600
small scenes she had with Sanji. Yeah, then she was just there. And then she disappeared from

3044
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:49,400
relevance forever. Yeah, her power with her. It's sort of like one of those kind of kind of felt

3045
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:53,080
kind of felt like they just kind of did her again, but with pudding.

3046
02:49:54,760 --> 02:50:00,840
Yeah, they're very similar. I wonder if it was like an idea that Oda had.

3047
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:08,040
Like putting similarly is like, I know all of your secrets. Yes, similarly is a woman that

3048
02:50:08,040 --> 02:50:14,680
betrays him, but decides that she loves him anyway, and also has crazy crazy. She betrays him.

3049
02:50:15,560 --> 02:50:17,000
Yes. And and it's like,

3050
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:25,160
like she's never felt someone care about her. Oh my God, men usually abuse me. This is so fucked up.

3051
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:31,480
Oh my God. I love your Sanji. Your love for your love for women. It's a good bit. You know,

3052
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:35,080
you know what? It'll be funny. It'll be funny. It'll be worth it if like the series ends.

3053
02:50:36,040 --> 02:50:41,240
And Sanji finds the all blue and then like all the women that he's ever met who have fallen

3054
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:46,280
madly in love with him because his love for women in general is just so pure and unadulterated.

3055
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:51,880
And they're all just waiting for him. They're like, yes, Sanji, we're here for you. No, no more

3056
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:58,280
Isle of Cross Dressers or whatever. You don't have to worry about that anymore. We're here.

3057
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:08,680
We're here. You're safe. Marry us. And then he will. Yes. Yes. Sanji was nice to Kiku.

3058
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:16,200
Which one's Kiku? Kiku is the trans girl in Wano. Born a boy. Yes. Samurai

3059
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:26,840
acts and it presents feminine and everyone just calls her she. He I don't I don't remember.

3060
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:32,840
I don't remember Sanji had anything to say about that. Yeah. I think he said, I don't think

3061
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:42,120
I don't think any of there was no like overt trans like dialogue. No, they just in Wano.

3062
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:48,920
I know that they say they come in the bath like in the in the in the in the gender bath. Yes.

3063
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:55,480
The gender bath and it's like Yamato's in the men's. Was Kiku in there? And Kiku was in the

3064
02:51:55,480 --> 02:52:01,320
women's. Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. Well, nobody had a problem with either of that except

3065
02:52:01,320 --> 02:52:07,320
all the guys were like, oh my god, Yamato. Sanji had the eyes bugging out because Yamato was there.

3066
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:10,040
Yeah. Bless his heart.

3067
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:17,560
I ain't attracted to gender. I'm attracted to huge boobies. That's what Sanji said.

3068
02:52:17,560 --> 02:52:22,760
That's what he said. They asked him about that. You looked to the camera as he said it.

3069
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:27,400
Sanji looked directly at the camera. Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned.

3070
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:35,960
Today I learned about trans rights. Trans rights? What about trans fats? Huh? They're in palm oil.

3071
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,920
Oh. I'm going to put them in my, I'm going to put them in my Twizzlers.

3072
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:43,560
Okay. Okay.

3073
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:50,360
Where, where, where, where are we? Oh, you're talking about viola because pudding because

3074
02:52:50,440 --> 02:52:57,800
yeah. I think, I think it would viola, viola would be fine with me if there was a moment where viola

3075
02:52:57,800 --> 02:53:03,800
came back and pudding was there also and they were fighting over Sanji in a, because they're so

3076
02:53:03,800 --> 02:53:09,720
similar. Be like, ah, see. Yeah. A little, a little bit of a moment like that. I want, I want, I want

3077
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:17,000
a big end of the thing. End of the, end of the thing. Uh, just all Sanji's women, they're just like

3078
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:23,480
we're back. We have, we have a, wait, does he, I guess he doesn't really have that many.

3079
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:31,400
No, he has pudding and viola. And I guess like, yeah, there's, there's women who are

3080
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:37,960
indifferent to him. They don't hate him or like him in any specific way, like Kani, the fish,

3081
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:47,640
fish woman. Yeah. And, and like, uh, just people he's friends with, like, um, uh, VV. Yeah.

3082
02:53:49,800 --> 02:53:57,160
People he's friends with, that he, you know. He would do his like comedy routine with the

3083
02:53:57,160 --> 02:54:02,040
heart eyes in the background, but they wouldn't really react to it. But he's not too pushy about

3084
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:07,960
it. So, you know, we can, we can, we can laugh it off. We can, we can, we can be friends. Um,

3085
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:17,080
unless, uh, but, uh, maybe he'll get more. It's just interesting that like two islands in a row,

3086
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:24,520
they've given Sanji a romance, like a, like a, an actual sort of like falls in love with a girl.

3087
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:28,840
And it wasn't exactly in a row because there was the elephant in between. Oh yeah. Oh yeah,

3088
02:54:28,840 --> 02:54:34,280
you're right. But yeah, basically. But they did it, they did it twice. It's weird that it happened

3089
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:40,040
twice. It never, it never used to happen. Um, we're built, we're building to something. We're

3090
02:54:40,040 --> 02:54:50,440
building to Sanji Haramark. Sanji is going to become like Andrew Tate. Shave his head. The

3091
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:58,680
ultimate feminist. The ultimate lover of women. There was, um, I remember when the time skip

3092
02:54:58,680 --> 02:55:07,000
happened and Sanji had been in the isle of, of, uh, transvestites, the cross-dressing island.

3093
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:13,720
The Okama, right? The Okama. Okama land. Yes. And he had not seen a real woman. Okama,

3094
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:21,240
comma, comma, comma, comma, chameleon. Yes. Because they're disguising themselves as females.

3095
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:30,520
But like, he hadn't seen a beautiful woman in a long time and he had nosebleeds and it was

3096
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:35,160
kind of like he's going to die. He was like, he was lost so much blood. He was so backed up,

3097
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:40,120
he was so backed up from not letting his nose bleed from seeing beautiful women that he was

3098
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:45,160
going, he was backed up, it was clotting, it was going to die. Yeah, I thought he had to release.

3099
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:49,160
I thought that the thing was going to be permanent that Sanji was going to like

3100
02:55:50,040 --> 02:55:55,880
every time a Caesar woman bleeds to death. And I'm like, no. Oh, right. This is, this is like,

3101
02:55:55,880 --> 02:56:00,440
because negative character development. He knows he's now lethally vulnerable too. Yeah,

3102
02:56:00,440 --> 02:56:04,280
it's no longer, oh, he has heart eyes. It's like he has a nosebleed and he has to like

3103
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:09,720
try to deal with it. It's like a brain hemorrhage, yeah. But he did end up like figuring that out.

3104
02:56:09,720 --> 02:56:14,760
Good for him. Good. I don't want him to constantly be bleeding. That would be terrible.

3105
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:21,000
I'm happy for him. But like if all of the beautiful women

3106
02:56:21,720 --> 02:56:27,160
are all blue and it's like, hi Sanji, would he bleed to death there?

3107
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:34,680
You know, he can just have the two. He can just marry, he can just marry the pudding and viola,

3108
02:56:34,680 --> 02:56:37,640
because they're like the same woman anyway. So he can just have both of them.

3109
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:43,640
And that's enough. I think he'll be happy with two. One with each eyebrow. One with each eyebrow.

3110
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:48,600
When my, when his eyebrow is swirling counterclockwise, he's in a viola type

3111
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:51,960
mood. And when his eyebrow is swirling clockwise, he's in a pudding type mood.

3112
02:56:53,400 --> 02:57:00,440
That's how you know. You know, Sanji, I mean, he just, he just cooked for them.

3113
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:03,880
He's too much of a gentleman. He would never lay a hand on either of his wives. He would just,

3114
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:08,920
he would just make them delicious roasts, because his true love is the sea.

3115
02:57:09,880 --> 02:57:14,840
Yeah, I wonder about all that. Like, is he a virgin? It'd be funny if.

3116
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:19,720
I feel like he's probably, I feel like if I, if I investigate this hard enough,

3117
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:23,320
I think he's probably canonically a virgin. I think they all are, because none of them fuck.

3118
02:57:25,080 --> 02:57:29,400
Yeah. I mean, I don't know about Zora. Zora, I feel like could have lost his virginity.

3119
02:57:29,400 --> 02:57:32,280
Who would he have fucked? Who? I dare you.

3120
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:35,240
Uh, one of the zombie guerrillas.

3121
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:40,680
Brooke definitely got some.

3122
02:57:41,800 --> 02:57:45,000
Brooke? Yeah. I mean, who knows?

3123
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,960
Yeah, they gave him a bone or gave him a bone, you know?

3124
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:52,600
Didn't, didn't, I know there's a line he said that like their, their true love is adventure or

3125
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:57,160
whatever. I don't know. The series is pretty chased. I know that there's been occasional

3126
02:57:57,160 --> 02:58:02,840
like dick references here and there. I feel like by and large, these characters do not have sex.

3127
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:08,440
Luffy is asexual for sure. Doesn't give a fuck, literally.

3128
02:58:08,440 --> 02:58:10,440
Is it just Luffy? Do you think it's just Luffy?

3129
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:14,680
Oh, for Luffy, yeah. I, I, I mean, yeah, Luffy definitely just doesn't

3130
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:18,600
have interest in living or anything. I think Frankie probably would have Robin.

3131
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:24,440
It probably would have been quite dark. She was a runaway girl. She'd probably been raped before.

3132
02:58:24,440 --> 02:58:29,880
Oh God. She had to, she had to do, she had to do things. She had to do things to get by.

3133
02:58:29,880 --> 02:58:33,880
Yeah. I don't want to think about Nami either. Cause. Oh, right.

3134
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:37,800
She's also kind of a child slave to Arlong. Uh, true.

3135
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:43,400
No, see, this is what I'm saying. I think they just don't, I think these characters just don't

3136
02:58:43,400 --> 02:58:48,120
have sex. Like, yeah, I think Frankie would have sex if he were a real person in the real world,

3137
02:58:48,120 --> 02:58:51,160
but in, in the world of One Piece, I don't think any of them have sex.

3138
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:55,880
Fair enough. That's.

3139
02:58:57,400 --> 02:59:03,480
I just like the idea. I just like the idea of Sanji and Pudding or Viola or both of them,

3140
02:59:03,480 --> 02:59:07,400
and they're like coming on to him and he's like, ha, ha, I don't know what to do anymore.

3141
02:59:07,400 --> 02:59:15,320
I didn't think. They go to the honeymoon. He's like, um, should I cook something for you?

3142
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:18,440
I swear to God, I swear to God, their honeymoon is just, he's gonna,

3143
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:22,360
he's gonna kiss their little ring fingers and he's gonna, and he's gonna cook fish for them.

3144
02:59:22,360 --> 02:59:27,080
And that's their, and that's the honeymoon. And they're gonna be like, come on, Sanji, come to bed.

3145
02:59:27,080 --> 02:59:33,720
Come on. Come on. Ah, come on. But he was too much of a gentleman.

3146
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:40,040
Have never to have sex with his wife. Have never to file a woman by touching them.

3147
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:41,160
That's right. That's right.

3148
02:59:43,400 --> 02:59:47,640
Um, that's, I think that's the, I think that's the right way to look at it.

3149
02:59:48,280 --> 02:59:52,920
Yeah. So Sanji would be waiting on them hand and foot. I guess since they're not, you know,

3150
02:59:53,640 --> 02:59:57,800
they'll get with each other, I think. Viola and Pudding.

3151
02:59:57,800 --> 03:00:00,920
Yeah, of course. Because that's not, Sanji would be in the chair.

3152
03:00:00,920 --> 03:00:03,560
It's not, it's not sex when it's two, when it's two women.

3153
03:00:04,440 --> 03:00:05,400
It doesn't count. Of course.

3154
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:07,880
Doesn't count. So, and Sanji would.

3155
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:09,640
That's a good ending.

3156
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:14,040
Sanji would, uh, Sanji would, he would, he would, he would come in, he'd be like,

3157
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:20,200
I'm going to do his like, his old, like a four kids dub voice. He'd be like, hey Viola,

3158
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:24,280
we made a, I made you a nice fish for you at my darling.

3159
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,800
And then he'd come in and they'd be making out and he'd just be like, what's this?

3160
03:00:27,800 --> 03:00:31,320
This is so silly. What are you, what are you, what's, what is, what is this?

3161
03:00:31,320 --> 03:00:35,000
Practical joke. What are you doing? That's so funny. All right.

3162
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:37,640
You kids have, you kids have fun now.

3163
03:00:38,680 --> 03:00:43,880
Um, you just, there's, there's a, there's a funny, there's a video by Lily

3164
03:00:43,880 --> 03:00:49,080
Alexander about, uh, the, I might have mentioned this. I've stopped me if I mentioned this.

3165
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:53,960
It's about the first filmed kiss. The first filmed kiss.

3166
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:59,160
They, like, there is a movie that's like, consider the first kiss and it's between,

3167
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:03,480
there's an actor and an actress and they, they banter and then they kiss each other.

3168
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:10,520
And that one's kind of famous, but there's actually another one before that that's actually

3169
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:17,080
two naked women kissing each other. And you'd think that that one would have been like really

3170
03:01:17,080 --> 03:01:24,600
scandalous, that that was like put to film, but it's not because reason one is that it was more

3171
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:29,240
of like, it was like an art reference. It was a piece of like art reference footage for artists

3172
03:01:29,240 --> 03:01:35,400
to copy when they were drawing. It wasn't like, you know, disseminated as like a, a cultural

3173
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:41,080
thing. Why were all these artists drawing the scandalous woman on woman kiss? And the other

3174
03:01:41,080 --> 03:01:44,520
thing, and that's, that's why they were naked is because it was supposed to be like an anatomical

3175
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:54,120
study, but also it just wasn't seen as sexual at all because women did not have sexual desires.

3176
03:01:54,760 --> 03:02:01,000
They were just, too women kissing is just, that's just a silly, that's just a silly ridiculous

3177
03:02:01,080 --> 03:02:05,560
girl. Just do that. They just like doing that. They just, if they do it, it's not because

3178
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:11,720
they like it or they even thinking about anything at all. It's just a funny, like it's like a,

3179
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:16,440
it's just really funny. It's like, if like, it's like, if like a giraffe we're wearing like a top

3180
03:02:16,440 --> 03:02:25,560
hat, it's like, why is it doing that? That's so silly. Yeah, like literally though, it was just

3181
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:30,120
a funny goof and nobody even thought about it. Like it's like two girls can't kiss that might

3182
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:36,360
overturn the societal norms. All the, all the historical lesbians just sort of side eyeing

3183
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:44,120
each other like, yeah, just like a giraffe with a hat. Such a funny goof. It was exactly like that.

3184
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:47,800
They would play that up. They would play that up so they couldn't, wouldn't get attacked and killed

3185
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:54,360
by the anti-woke brigade. That's what I would have done. I think that's probably how I would handle it.

3186
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,760
Wait, do you like doing that?

3187
03:02:58,760 --> 03:03:03,480
Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is so, this is so fucked.

3188
03:03:06,840 --> 03:03:12,600
I think we're done talking about the chapter. Yes. And I've got to pee again, tragically.

3189
03:03:12,600 --> 03:03:14,920
So I'll be right back. Tragic.

3190
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:23,880
Okay, sorry, I'm back. Let's, shall we do voicemails?

3191
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:29,240
Before that, I wanted to talk about this little spreadsheet.

3192
03:03:30,440 --> 03:03:30,920
What's this?

3193
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:39,720
I will screen grab it. For purposes of drawing my comic, Clarissa Gunsmoke

3194
03:03:40,360 --> 03:03:49,640
and The Bandit King, I have taken to keeping track of things to like to think,

3195
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:57,080
put numbers to my progress. And I've, it's a very small little spreadsheet, but I just,

3196
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:03,960
I just really like it. It's just really cute. And it basically tracks my pages per hour and my

3197
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:11,800
average pages per hour for line art and shading slash finishing touches, finalizing of a page.

3198
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:17,400
So I have a week and sometimes I don't do anything for a day. It's like whatever.

3199
03:04:17,960 --> 03:04:23,160
As you can see, my most recent week, I've been not doing much and I've been

3200
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:27,720
ratcheting up the amount of time I'm spending. I'm going to try and aim for like a six hour day.

3201
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:34,200
And that's, that's, I'm just going to keep going a bit more every day until I can, you know,

3202
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:43,400
reliably do it. And then at the top right, my PPH, my pages per hour, I can, I can see.

3203
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:51,320
And I put all the little code in, so it like makes all the numbers correctly. And it's very

3204
03:04:51,320 --> 03:05:00,520
simple. And it's nice. My, um, my numbers for Beescapades would be really bad on these.

3205
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:09,880
I take, I feel like my time per page is like really awful, especially considering that like

3206
03:05:09,880 --> 03:05:15,080
there's not that much drawing involved. And yet it's, they still just take me forever.

3207
03:05:16,040 --> 03:05:17,000
And I hate it.

3208
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:20,040
Is it because you keep like changing bits?

3209
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:23,800
Yeah, it's because I keep like, like drawing and redrawing bits.

3210
03:05:23,800 --> 03:05:28,600
It's not drawing and redrawing so much as it is like fiddling around with like how big to make a

3211
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:33,720
panel or like where to position it or like whether it should go in the left or the right or

3212
03:05:34,520 --> 03:05:39,560
or how or where to crop it or something like that. And there's a lot of like switching tabs

3213
03:05:39,560 --> 03:05:43,720
because I'll switch from like the, I'll use the original art, the original panel, and then I'll

3214
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:48,680
put it on the page and then I'll resize and then I'll move it and I'll just change my mind

3215
03:05:48,680 --> 03:05:55,480
about how big it to be. And it's just very, uh, it's very like at any step of those process,

3216
03:05:55,480 --> 03:06:00,440
there's a risk that I might lose focus and like get distracted and decide like, I'm gonna like,

3217
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:03,000
let me look at YouTube for a second. Let me look at Twitter for a second.

3218
03:06:03,800 --> 03:06:05,480
Oh yeah. That's no good.

3219
03:06:05,480 --> 03:06:07,400
It is. It is no good. So, you know, I had,

3220
03:06:07,400 --> 03:06:10,600
I mean, it happens to me as well, but like I just try to not, I try to

3221
03:06:11,320 --> 03:06:13,320
rein myself in when I notice I'm doing it.

3222
03:06:13,320 --> 03:06:19,880
I try, I tried to change, uh, the workflow so that like I just like size the entire page down

3223
03:06:19,880 --> 03:06:25,720
so that I could just draw the panels directly onto the page and then size the page up. And it,

3224
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:33,480
it didn't really work because like, uh, the text did not scale correctly. Like I had to like read,

3225
03:06:33,560 --> 03:06:39,480
I had to like redo all of the, the text and that was very annoying because I

3226
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:43,640
think that would have smoothed out my workflow a bit and it like

3227
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:47,880
ended up introducing like more steps and where I had to like correct everything.

3228
03:06:48,760 --> 03:06:52,680
I should say that this is a very recently made spreadsheet.

3229
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:57,400
This is good. This is good information to track like how many hours you're working per day

3230
03:06:57,400 --> 03:07:01,000
and how long it takes you to finish a page and how long for your line. Like this is good,

3231
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:07,320
good stuff to know. Yeah. But it does not include, uh, the hours that went into all of the sketches

3232
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:11,240
for all these pages, which involves all of that mental labor of like

3233
03:07:11,960 --> 03:07:15,320
thinking what size a pile should be, what shape it should be,

3234
03:07:15,800 --> 03:07:21,000
potentially what sort of things should be on this page. That does take a long time just thinking

3235
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:25,880
about it and like trying stuff out. Usually the hardest part and sometimes the one that like

3236
03:07:25,880 --> 03:07:32,120
gets you completely stuck and like you can't even finish it. So if I were to, I do want to

3237
03:07:32,120 --> 03:07:38,280
continue this spreadsheet just because over time the average will be more accurate to like an actual

3238
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:45,400
average of my like speed at drawing line art or shading. And I'm going to do a third one for

3239
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:52,680
sketching and like blocking out a page because they're all different skills, but they're all

3240
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:58,680
important to track, but not together because like I don't draw a page from start to finish

3241
03:07:59,560 --> 03:08:06,200
in one go. I like draw the chapters pages in sketch form and then go do the line art.

3242
03:08:06,200 --> 03:08:12,280
Yeah. Because I feel like it's easier to think how to plan pages out when they're all like

3243
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:18,840
vague. And I'm like, oh, actually this page would be better if it starts with a different

3244
03:08:18,840 --> 03:08:23,000
panel. So I need to move panels around. And that means the previous page has to be different.

3245
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:27,640
And if it's already line art, then it's like a whole lot of bunch of work. But if it's

3246
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:37,960
if it's still sketch, then I can easily resketch. So yeah, that don't feel too bad about having to

3247
03:08:37,960 --> 03:08:44,920
think about where the panels go because that is a lot of of it's more work than you would imagine

3248
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:50,040
it takes. I want to I want to try and I want to try and cut down on it in some way. I think maybe

3249
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:57,640
maybe there's maybe there's some work around to the text size issue because it's really I mean

3250
03:08:57,640 --> 03:09:03,640
you could just you could just like what I do with just just just some decisions I could make ahead

3251
03:09:03,640 --> 03:09:07,880
of time to just kind of standardize it a little bit to leave less room for me to like fiddle

3252
03:09:07,880 --> 03:09:13,160
because fiddling I spent I can spend a lot of time fiddling on like pretty pointless stuff

3253
03:09:13,880 --> 03:09:21,080
if I let myself I mean what I would do if I'm sketching a page blocking it out I would draw

3254
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:26,440
like the very basics of what character is there so I could look back at it and be like oh yeah

3255
03:09:26,440 --> 03:09:31,560
it's that character and if they have a speech bubble where it's going but you've you've got text

3256
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:38,040
like underneath I think you don't need to like type it out just put like I'm gonna put some text

3257
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:44,120
here and then the next panel be here and then you fill in the text later after you've decided

3258
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:50,680
where the panels go yeah because you can always change the text size to fit if you know if it's

3259
03:09:50,680 --> 03:09:56,760
not enough space I mean I'm sure you'll you'll you'll you have plenty of space on like an A4

3260
03:09:56,760 --> 03:10:01,880
or whatever size sheet and the panels are not like filling it up in the same way a traditional

3261
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:13,080
comic word yeah yeah yeah it's just it's just a workflow it's got a just a the just got a nail

3262
03:10:13,080 --> 03:10:21,400
down and a more optimal format and workflow in a way that makes pages go a little bit smoother

3263
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:26,920
because they don't they're not coming out smoothly right now but it just takes a refining

3264
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:33,880
refinement the sort of thing that this spreadsheet is really quite motivating for me because like

3265
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:40,680
I have a good day or like next Monday this coming Monday tomorrow I'm gonna be like all right I'm

3266
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:45,640
gonna try and work for more than I did last time so four and a half hours see how I do

3267
03:10:46,520 --> 03:10:52,200
once I've done that my goal for the day is done but then I get to put the numbers in so I work

3268
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:58,440
for this amount of time and how many pages got finished in that time and you know I put the

3269
03:10:58,440 --> 03:11:03,960
numbers in the little thing goes up or down like is my is my average improving I think it should be

3270
03:11:03,960 --> 03:11:11,720
because last week I was very slow I was just sort of slowly starting to get things rolling again

3271
03:11:14,120 --> 03:11:19,640
eventually you'll have a time when you put the numbers in and average goes down and that's

3272
03:11:19,640 --> 03:11:29,160
inevitable true so don't be too tripped up when that I I will try not to I'm sure I'll feel a

3273
03:11:29,160 --> 03:11:37,000
little bad when like oh I had a bad week sure but I think that the longer I agree the longer I record

3274
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:45,480
the data for this the more the less the average will shift like the first week that I recorded

3275
03:11:45,480 --> 03:11:50,280
there for line art was very productive just so happened to be because it was the end of a bunch

3276
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:57,400
of other weeks of me drawing the previous chapter so I was really going going at it working quite

3277
03:11:57,400 --> 03:12:03,480
hard getting a lot of stuff done my pages per hour was like half a page an hour but now it's like

3278
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:12,280
a third of a page an hour and I like it's gone down but like it's more accurate and so the longer

3279
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:17,960
I go it'll become more accurate and so I won't it won't go up for like it won't go up or down

3280
03:12:17,960 --> 03:12:25,240
that much yeah each time it'll settle into a yeah an average yeah and after I finish with Clarissa

3281
03:12:26,360 --> 03:12:34,120
I'll be like the average line art for that I can pretty accurately say that's that's generally how

3282
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:40,360
fast I can do something and then I can plan like if I do something on the level of Clarissa

3283
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:44,040
how long is it going to take and I have a number that I can pretty accurately say

3284
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:48,680
that's a good benchmark that's a good benchmark I can use to to count how many hours it's going to

3285
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:54,600
take and then I can see on this as well how many hours I'm likely to be able to do per day before

3286
03:12:54,600 --> 03:13:02,680
I get too tired I want to aim for like six hours last last time I was doing really good that's pretty

3287
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:10,520
is very respectable yeah last time I was trying my goal was five hours and I did do that for

3288
03:13:10,520 --> 03:13:14,920
like a number of days in a row so I think that's pretty doable honestly like six hours of like

3289
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:19,800
focused work a day is like kind of a lot like it's hard that's a pay I mean

3290
03:13:22,680 --> 03:13:26,360
to do that like it is it is five days a week every week that's like a lot

3291
03:13:26,360 --> 03:13:36,120
yeah but you gotta put it in I mean we're we're not like competing with uh mangaka but like

3292
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:42,440
they probably work yeah like 12 hours a day every day without weekends for the amount of work that

3293
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:46,920
they get a lot a lot they get done yeah a lot of them probably do yeah obviously the workflows are

3294
03:13:46,920 --> 03:13:52,440
going to be different it's not like there's a set schedule but like I would like to be able

3295
03:13:53,000 --> 03:14:00,360
to say to myself I am capable of doing uh respectable amount of work per day how much

3296
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:04,360
how much would it how much would it cost to pay a guy to do my

3297
03:14:05,320 --> 03:14:10,040
inks and my finishing and my lettering how much would I have to I have no idea

3298
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:19,480
you can check rights people do that sort of thing yeah maybe on the fiver maybe on fiver

3299
03:14:20,440 --> 03:14:24,680
sometimes I've thought about sometimes I thought about hiring an assistant but like

3300
03:14:25,320 --> 03:14:29,720
for that to be worth it I would have to be making a lot of pages like if I was in the midst of a

3301
03:14:29,720 --> 03:14:34,440
big project and I was chump turning out pages I might think like I should hire an assistant

3302
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:41,000
stupid to think about that when I'm like not actively pumping out stuff I don't know

3303
03:14:41,240 --> 03:14:49,560
know yeah it's easy to get discouraged for me at least when I was like I don't know

3304
03:14:50,120 --> 03:14:53,640
I see people working I just think they're working so much harder than me

3305
03:14:54,840 --> 03:15:05,320
therefore I don't deserve uh success yeah I'm like well actually you can just do whatever you can

3306
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:15,240
do and shut up I mean people that are pumping out a lot of stuff yeah they usually have a team

3307
03:15:15,240 --> 03:15:21,880
behind them supporting them in some in some way or a lot a lot of times they do so a lot of

3308
03:15:21,880 --> 03:15:30,920
uns there's a lot of unseen work that goes into like many things yeah I mean for people who do

3309
03:15:31,880 --> 03:15:38,360
uh fan translations there's a lot of steps it's not just you read it you translate it and you

3310
03:15:38,360 --> 03:15:48,440
put the letters in you gotta you gotta erase all of the things already there you gotta type

3311
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:53,560
everything up and you gotta make it look in the right font in the right space in the inside the balloon

3312
03:15:54,520 --> 03:16:01,160
and that's just translating actually drawing it in the first place that's just translate

3313
03:16:02,680 --> 03:16:11,480
uh you gotta have proof readers and like the double checkers too hard as a team no thanks

3314
03:16:13,400 --> 03:16:15,720
no thanks I just won't I'll just wing it

3315
03:16:16,120 --> 03:16:27,160
just don't just do it the easy way I'll just wing it for I can't think I can't think of a

3316
03:16:27,160 --> 03:16:33,000
thing that rhymes with wing bing the search engine I'll I'll wing it for a bing it

3317
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:43,000
yeah thanks for listening to the progress this podcast do you want do you want to go

3318
03:16:43,560 --> 03:16:49,320
I just want to end my stupid thought and it's over now uh so let's go to questions let's go to

3319
03:16:49,320 --> 03:16:57,880
voicemails uh okay patreon.com slash the procrastinators uh to send a voicemail I guess uh there's

3320
03:16:57,880 --> 03:17:07,560
something um speak pipe speak pipe uh please okay there's not okay it's a it's a reasonable

3321
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:13,800
it's a reasonable amount of voicemails thank god the first one I see is called a purposeless

3322
03:17:13,800 --> 03:17:18,200
searching husk are you ready mm-hmm okay three two one go

3323
03:17:19,560 --> 03:17:28,280
pen look through the pictures on your mobile device find the ones where you made your hair

3324
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:38,840
look as bad as possible and post them if you are not craving I am craving I must see them

3325
03:17:39,480 --> 03:17:49,560
no so that I can discover a new purpose for myself no die die no purpose wait until November

3326
03:17:49,560 --> 03:17:54,360
and then you can find that purpose yeah yeah yeah November then if you still need a purpose maybe

3327
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:59,480
then we'll talk uh I haven't even posted any pictures of my shaved head look even though

3328
03:17:59,480 --> 03:18:07,480
it looks good and fine not because I'm embarrassed well yes because I'm embarrassed but not because

3329
03:18:07,480 --> 03:18:11,320
I'm like oh it looks bad just because I'm like I don't want anyone to see me I don't want people

3330
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:18,600
to see me posting of myself and that goes doubly for like uh uh I don't want people to think I

3331
03:18:18,600 --> 03:18:24,040
thought I looked okay to be posted online yeah definitely not definitely not yeah I look okay

3332
03:18:24,040 --> 03:18:30,040
but if I don't look like my best then I might as well look my worst I gotta wear a tuxedo if I'm

3333
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:36,760
gonna appear online you got to wear the hijab to be to be decent uh next one is called heavy heavy

3337
03:19:03,400 --> 03:19:07,960
fridays ago two fridays ago oh it's been a while sorry I missed it

3338
03:19:11,160 --> 03:19:16,680
whatever everyone else everyone else did too so it's fine no I like deliberately didn't say anything

3339
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:24,360
about it um uh you know who else's birthday it was endless war we have almost the same birthday

3340
03:19:24,360 --> 03:19:33,160
endless the endless war anniversary is uh April 9th so it was a five-year anniversary oh my god yeah

3341
03:19:33,160 --> 03:19:39,480
if you can believe that endless war so old that yeah it's cracking it needs it needs a repair it

3342
03:19:39,480 --> 03:19:44,520
needs a refurbishment it's actually it's actually kind of bizarre it's bizarre to me to think back to

3343
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:48,920
when I made when we well you know I didn't make it by myself but when we made it

3344
03:19:49,720 --> 03:19:57,240
and think that it's been five years since then that's that's strange that's weird to me it feels

3345
03:19:57,240 --> 03:20:02,200
like it's been around for a while but like when you put a number like five years it feels it feels

3346
03:20:02,200 --> 03:20:11,160
like two maybe three years but no I mean there's one thing that always trips me up and it's the

3347
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:20,680
fact that 2021 was a whole year and not like a month oh yeah yeah like 2020 and 2021 feel like the

3348
03:20:20,680 --> 03:20:30,200
same year yeah they do yeah they do yeah that whole thing that whole thing I think contributes to the

3349
03:20:30,200 --> 03:20:37,080
feeling of like nothing happened well I mean things happened but like you know what I mean

3350
03:20:38,040 --> 03:20:44,680
yeah it's odd yeah it's a very odd like alien feeling I never been through a single pandemic

3351
03:20:44,680 --> 03:20:51,640
before that one yes well it won't be the last uh next oh boy we got it we got it we got you think

3352
03:20:51,640 --> 03:20:57,240
you thought that one was good just wait until you hear what we got cooking uh next one is called

3353
03:20:57,240 --> 03:21:09,880
death note 3 2 1 go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa L dies uh you spoiled death note for me sorry

3354
03:21:11,480 --> 03:21:15,880
should've watched it's stupid uh just so you know

3355
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:23,960
um uh l uh took an out

3356
03:21:23,960 --> 03:21:25,860
That's the biggest alley ever took me.

3357
03:21:26,360 --> 03:21:28,360
It was kind of an out, but he did it.

3358
03:21:28,360 --> 03:21:30,360
He got the he did get the W in the end.

3359
03:21:30,960 --> 03:21:32,160
He got the W in the end.

3360
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:34,960
You think I don't think W's count from beyond the grave.

3361
03:21:34,960 --> 03:21:36,860
I don't think God accepts W's.

3362
03:21:38,460 --> 03:21:39,760
Shit.

3363
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:42,060
They don't get past the kingdom of the gates of heaven.

3364
03:21:42,060 --> 03:21:43,660
They don't get past those pearly gates.

3365
03:21:43,660 --> 03:21:45,560
I have them with little spears.

3366
03:21:45,560 --> 03:21:49,060
There's no L's or W's in the Bible, actually.

3367
03:21:50,060 --> 03:21:54,160
Oh, next one is called Delving into Gibbons Psyche.

3368
03:21:54,160 --> 03:21:55,960
Three, two, one, go.

3369
03:21:55,960 --> 03:21:58,160
Are you like a Gibbons Psyche?

3370
03:21:58,160 --> 03:22:00,860
I was going to say, we're going to talk a lot about Gibbon right now.

3371
03:22:00,860 --> 03:22:05,160
Are you sexually into like, like, are you a masochist?

3372
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:06,660
Or do you just think it's funny?

3373
03:22:06,660 --> 03:22:07,760
I think it's funny.

3374
03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:09,660
I don't actually know whether I'm into that.

3375
03:22:09,660 --> 03:22:12,160
I just thought it was because like, I'm who's that?

3376
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:15,560
Because like all that they all represent like something that I want to be.

3377
03:22:15,560 --> 03:22:17,160
I want to be a little confident and cool.

3378
03:22:18,060 --> 03:22:19,060
And also women.

3379
03:22:20,060 --> 03:22:21,260
Wait, what was that last?

3380
03:22:21,260 --> 03:22:22,260
I missed that last.

3381
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:23,060
They're also women.

3382
03:22:23,060 --> 03:22:24,760
They're also women.

3383
03:22:24,760 --> 03:22:27,060
Are you talking about your waifus in this one?

3384
03:22:27,060 --> 03:22:29,860
Yeah, I think I was probably talking about Risco and Marcelline.

3385
03:22:29,860 --> 03:22:30,860
Episode two.

3386
03:22:30,860 --> 03:22:34,360
Episode two of the Procrastiners podcast.

3387
03:22:35,460 --> 03:22:37,460
Delving into Gibbons Psyche.

3388
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:38,460
I mean, true.

3389
03:22:38,460 --> 03:22:41,060
Your voice is so much like Therodier.

3390
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:43,760
You have like a deeper Therodier version of yourself.

3391
03:22:44,760 --> 03:22:45,260
Yeah.

3392
03:22:45,360 --> 03:22:47,160
I guess I don't know if that's the right way to describe it,

3393
03:22:47,160 --> 03:22:50,360
but like it's it's it's mess.

3394
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:53,760
Presenting, I guess it's one of those weird things

3395
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:56,260
because I don't feel like I was ever putting on a voice.

3396
03:22:56,260 --> 03:23:00,160
No, but now that I talk like more just naturally

3397
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:02,160
how I feel like it's okay to talk.

3398
03:23:02,760 --> 03:23:05,160
I wouldn't have talked like this back then because it's like,

3399
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:07,760
oh, that's a high pitched sort of weird girly voice.

3400
03:23:08,060 --> 03:23:13,060
I mean, I but I wasn't like trying to do like a deeper voice.

3401
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:13,760
I don't know.

3402
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:17,360
I sound different now than I did back then as well.

3403
03:23:17,360 --> 03:23:19,160
And I don't really know why that is.

3404
03:23:19,160 --> 03:23:22,160
I never I never attempted to put on a voice.

3405
03:23:22,660 --> 03:23:24,660
I don't know if I just sound different now

3406
03:23:24,660 --> 03:23:28,160
or if I just have changed my cadence or something.

3407
03:23:28,860 --> 03:23:32,760
I think it comes with honestly, it comes with like,

3408
03:23:33,360 --> 03:23:36,160
I presume merely talking a lot.

3409
03:23:36,460 --> 03:23:37,960
Yeah, because we are on a podcast.

3410
03:23:37,960 --> 03:23:42,060
We talk a lot, maybe more than normal people talk, maybe.

3411
03:23:42,960 --> 03:23:48,660
Like obviously you talk with friends, but like a lot of dialogue is through text.

3412
03:23:48,860 --> 03:23:49,060
Yeah.

3413
03:23:49,060 --> 03:23:50,660
And so you might not talk that much.

3414
03:23:50,960 --> 03:23:55,160
We talk quite a lot, especially if you're a YouTuber, you talk a hell of a lot.

3415
03:23:55,360 --> 03:23:59,260
But like, I don't know why sometimes a voice goes up in pitch

3416
03:23:59,460 --> 03:24:01,060
and for other people it goes down.

3417
03:24:01,160 --> 03:24:05,860
I noticed and I think Aaron Hansen from Game Grumps did say

3418
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:11,160
that talking so much on Game Grumps has made his voice deepen quite considerably.

3419
03:24:11,260 --> 03:24:12,060
That's interesting.

3420
03:24:12,660 --> 03:24:14,660
And I'm like, wow, what?

3421
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:15,460
Huh?

3422
03:24:15,460 --> 03:24:16,660
I don't know anything about that.

3423
03:24:18,760 --> 03:24:19,360
Strange.

3424
03:24:21,160 --> 03:24:21,760
Okay, next.

3425
03:24:21,760 --> 03:24:23,660
Also, I sound more British and I don't like that.

3426
03:24:23,660 --> 03:24:25,060
You used to?

3427
03:24:25,760 --> 03:24:26,660
I did used to.

3428
03:24:26,660 --> 03:24:27,660
Well, I don't know.

3429
03:24:27,660 --> 03:24:29,860
I can't hear my voice right now, so I don't know.

3430
03:24:30,260 --> 03:24:32,860
Next one is an image.

3431
03:24:33,260 --> 03:24:34,460
Let's look at it.

3432
03:24:34,960 --> 03:24:38,360
Then, Saint, I'm going to put my dick into a blender.

3433
03:24:38,460 --> 03:24:40,260
Food and Drug Administration.

3434
03:24:40,560 --> 03:24:41,560
Sarah, please don't do that.

3435
03:24:41,560 --> 03:24:45,160
Thousands of Americans have suffered blender-related injuries to their genitals

3436
03:24:45,160 --> 03:24:46,160
as April alone.

3437
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:50,160
Nice concern trolling Nazi blocked.

3438
03:24:51,560 --> 03:24:52,160
That's how it goes.

3439
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:54,660
What can I say but true?

3440
03:24:54,860 --> 03:24:56,960
What can I say but I'll put my dick in a blender?

3441
03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:58,760
They're not telling me that for my own safety.

3442
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:01,160
They're telling me that because they're trying to control me.

3443
03:25:01,260 --> 03:25:02,760
They're trying to gaslight me.

3444
03:25:03,360 --> 03:25:04,860
They're trying to get some good PR.

3445
03:25:04,860 --> 03:25:05,360
Want to put my-

3446
03:25:05,360 --> 03:25:08,560
Oh, we're the company that told somebody not to put the dick in a blender.

3447
03:25:08,560 --> 03:25:09,560
I'll buy that blender.

3448
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:11,460
Dick in a blender.

3449
03:25:13,460 --> 03:25:15,760
Next one is another image.

3450
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:16,760
Let's go.

3451
03:25:19,260 --> 03:25:19,760
Yeah.

3452
03:25:20,160 --> 03:25:24,560
I paused my Procrastinator's podcast.

3453
03:25:25,060 --> 03:25:28,560
Episode three, whatever, to be here.

3454
03:25:29,660 --> 03:25:31,160
This better be good.

3455
03:25:32,660 --> 03:25:33,060
Do you-

3456
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:37,160
Well, my little pony tattoo on their arm?

3457
03:25:37,660 --> 03:25:38,760
Yes.

3458
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:40,760
Trans belt buckle.

3459
03:25:40,760 --> 03:25:42,460
Why did they have to pause?

3460
03:25:44,160 --> 03:25:44,760
I don't get it.

3461
03:25:44,760 --> 03:25:48,160
No, the idea is that it's like a cringe like gamer shirt.

3462
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:49,660
I paused my video game to be here.

3463
03:25:49,660 --> 03:25:50,960
This better be good.

3464
03:25:51,160 --> 03:25:54,160
Like, I don't like social interaction, but they replaced it with a Procrastinator's.

3465
03:25:54,160 --> 03:25:55,260
This is just a caricature.

3466
03:25:55,260 --> 03:25:58,760
This is just a cruel caricature of your typical PCD fan.

3467
03:25:59,360 --> 03:25:59,960
Yeah.

3468
03:26:00,160 --> 03:26:00,560
Yeah.

3469
03:26:01,160 --> 03:26:03,260
Why they hold in their can of soda like that?

3470
03:26:03,260 --> 03:26:03,960
It's going to fall out.

3471
03:26:03,960 --> 03:26:06,860
This guy hates our audience even more than I do.

3472
03:26:07,760 --> 03:26:09,360
Can you imagine that?

3473
03:26:10,060 --> 03:26:13,660
Speaking of which, the next one is called Imagine Playing That.

3474
03:26:14,160 --> 03:26:15,860
Three, two, one, go.

3475
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:22,860
I don't know anything about Fire Emblem, but I like them in this mesh.

3476
03:26:24,360 --> 03:26:25,860
Is Ike cool?

3477
03:26:26,360 --> 03:26:27,060
What do you think, Gibbs?

3478
03:26:27,060 --> 03:26:27,960
Is Ike cool?

3479
03:26:28,860 --> 03:26:30,160
Ike is-

3480
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:38,660
He's unlike a lot of Fire Emblem protagonists because he's not a noble, rich son of a Lord

3481
03:26:38,760 --> 03:26:44,960
or a king or a prince or a princess who is destined to wield the super sword and save the universe.

3482
03:26:45,260 --> 03:26:50,460
He's a mercenary who rallies his people against the evil kingdom.

3483
03:26:50,760 --> 03:26:52,560
And in that way, he is very based.

3484
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:53,060
That's pretty cool.

3485
03:26:53,060 --> 03:26:53,660
I like him.

3486
03:26:54,060 --> 03:26:56,160
He's a down-to-earth kind of boy.

3487
03:26:58,360 --> 03:26:58,860
Neat.

3488
03:26:59,760 --> 03:27:01,460
He also does save the world, but like-

3489
03:27:01,460 --> 03:27:01,760
Sure.

3490
03:27:02,460 --> 03:27:03,660
It is, you know, whatever.

3491
03:27:03,660 --> 03:27:04,160
Yeah, yeah.

3492
03:27:04,460 --> 03:27:06,260
There's always a magical demon or something.

3493
03:27:07,260 --> 03:27:08,760
There's always a demon.

3494
03:27:09,260 --> 03:27:10,460
The next one is-

3495
03:27:10,960 --> 03:27:11,960
There's an image.

3496
03:27:14,960 --> 03:27:17,760
No, I never watched the Procrastinators podcast.

3497
03:27:17,860 --> 03:27:19,160
What the fuck is that?

3498
03:27:21,460 --> 03:27:23,260
It's just a big bunch of trash.

3499
03:27:23,460 --> 03:27:25,260
Yeah, there's no- there's no tunnel.

3500
03:27:25,360 --> 03:27:26,660
There's no tunnel.

3501
03:27:26,660 --> 03:27:29,860
It's just- he's just a guy walking away with his pickets.

3502
03:27:29,960 --> 03:27:33,960
Just walking away from some trash.

3503
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:36,960
Why did he get so close to the trash with the pickets?

3504
03:27:36,960 --> 03:27:37,760
Yeah, I would have avoided it.

3505
03:27:37,760 --> 03:27:38,760
What an idiot.

3506
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:41,060
I would have avoided it much further than that.

3507
03:27:41,860 --> 03:27:44,060
He was playing with fire.

3508
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:47,660
He's so despondent.

3509
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:50,860
He came- he thought it was a mountain that he could get diamonds from,

3510
03:27:50,860 --> 03:27:52,960
but oh no, it's just a bunch of trash.

3511
03:27:56,660 --> 03:28:00,960
Next one is tiny-

3512
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:01,860
It's another image.

3513
03:28:01,960 --> 03:28:03,160
Tiny URL.

3514
03:28:03,660 --> 03:28:05,260
It says URL shortener.

3515
03:28:05,360 --> 03:28:06,260
Oh, um-

3516
03:28:06,860 --> 03:28:07,360
I do not know-

3517
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:08,360
What the hell is this?

3518
03:28:09,760 --> 03:28:12,260
Free anime girls and a spider coming through a door.

3519
03:28:12,660 --> 03:28:13,760
Some abstract-

3520
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:16,760
There's a Rubik's Cube with like an intestine.

3521
03:28:18,460 --> 03:28:20,360
I don't think this is related to anything.

3522
03:28:20,460 --> 03:28:21,060
No.

3523
03:28:21,960 --> 03:28:22,460
Looks-

3524
03:28:23,260 --> 03:28:23,760
Neat.

3525
03:28:23,760 --> 03:28:24,960
It's pretty cool, I guess.

3526
03:28:24,960 --> 03:28:28,860
Uh, next one is called porn, 3, 2, 1, go.

3527
03:28:29,560 --> 03:28:30,660
What do you watch more?

3528
03:28:30,660 --> 03:28:32,760
Cartoon porn or human porn?

3529
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:35,260
I would have to say-

3530
03:28:37,660 --> 03:28:38,460
What do you watch more?

3531
03:28:38,460 --> 03:28:40,760
In terms of videos, it would definitely be human.

3532
03:28:41,160 --> 03:28:42,060
Yeah, human.

3533
03:28:42,060 --> 03:28:43,060
Definitely human.

3534
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:46,760
Like animated hentai stuff is sort of disgusting.

3535
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:48,160
Yeah, animated is bad.

3536
03:28:48,160 --> 03:28:50,760
Cartoon- I read a manga.

3537
03:28:50,760 --> 03:28:53,560
A lot of the porn I consume is in manga form.

3538
03:28:54,260 --> 03:28:56,460
So that's not- but that's not animated.

3539
03:28:56,460 --> 03:28:57,660
That's not a cartoon.

3540
03:28:57,860 --> 03:28:59,160
Illustrations.

3541
03:28:59,660 --> 03:29:02,860
Yeah, when it's animated, it looks comic books.

3542
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:06,260
I never like it when it's moving.

3543
03:29:07,160 --> 03:29:08,560
No, stop moving.

3544
03:29:08,860 --> 03:29:11,160
I am the one who turns the page, not you.

3545
03:29:11,160 --> 03:29:12,260
Yes, yes.

3546
03:29:13,360 --> 03:29:17,860
Next one is called this you, 3, 2, 1, go.

3547
03:29:18,760 --> 03:29:19,760
Eleazar.

3548
03:29:20,160 --> 03:29:22,260
Eleazar does have a voicemail.

3549
03:29:24,560 --> 03:29:26,760
Eleazar turns-

3550
03:29:29,560 --> 03:29:30,060
Yes.

3551
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:32,360
You- I couldn't hear what you said through your tears.

3552
03:29:32,360 --> 03:29:35,560
I think you said cut that voicemail, cut that voicemail.

3553
03:29:36,760 --> 03:29:38,060
What, the porn one or?

3554
03:29:38,460 --> 03:29:39,160
I don't know.

3555
03:29:39,560 --> 03:29:40,260
I don't know.

3556
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:41,560
Just any old voicemail.

3557
03:29:42,060 --> 03:29:43,260
I guess we should cut all of them to-

3558
03:29:43,260 --> 03:29:45,860
Maybe I cut a voicemail last time.

3559
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:47,860
I don't remember.

3560
03:29:49,560 --> 03:29:51,760
To you, it was the day I cut your voicemail.

3561
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:53,160
To me, it was Tuesday.

3562
03:29:53,160 --> 03:29:55,760
I don't actually cut very many.

3563
03:29:56,760 --> 03:30:00,760
Next one is called Funny Voicemail Idea, 3, 2, 1, go.

3564
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:08,160
So, I had an idea for a voicemail, but I'm too lazy to open up Sony Vegas and make it.

3565
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:09,260
Nice, nice.

3566
03:30:09,260 --> 03:30:10,060
So, okay.

3567
03:30:10,760 --> 03:30:11,360
Here's what we did.

3568
03:30:11,360 --> 03:30:18,760
So, that guy who left that Chad vs. Virgin, Chad vs. Virgin, Jesse, Ben St.

3569
03:30:19,760 --> 03:30:21,360
Fanart, if you can call it that.

3570
03:30:22,160 --> 03:30:23,260
Okay, so I was thinking.

3571
03:30:24,860 --> 03:30:29,360
So, in that situation, Ben is Batman.

3572
03:30:29,460 --> 03:30:34,460
And the other guy who sent in the picture is the Joker.

3573
03:30:35,560 --> 03:30:38,260
And then when Ben said that one thing where he said,

3574
03:30:39,260 --> 03:30:40,960
this guy genuinely hates me.

3575
03:30:41,160 --> 03:30:42,460
He genuinely hates me.

3576
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:45,760
Then I would like cut to the Joker saying,

3577
03:30:46,260 --> 03:30:49,460
oh, what would I do without you, Batman?

3578
03:30:49,860 --> 03:30:51,360
I need you, Ben St.

3579
03:30:51,360 --> 03:30:52,960
I need you.

3580
03:30:53,160 --> 03:30:54,760
You complete me, Ben St.

3581
03:30:55,360 --> 03:31:00,860
That's, I think that would be pretty, be pretty funny.

3582
03:31:01,060 --> 03:31:01,660
You know what?

3583
03:31:01,660 --> 03:31:03,360
Yeah, good idea.

3584
03:31:03,360 --> 03:31:03,860
Maybe.

3585
03:31:06,060 --> 03:31:08,660
You know, it's a more fun way to look at it, I think.

3586
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:12,460
You complete me, Ben St.

3587
03:31:12,460 --> 03:31:13,860
You complete me, Ben St.

3588
03:31:13,860 --> 03:31:16,360
Oh, yeah, Dustin to do this forever.

3589
03:31:17,960 --> 03:31:18,960
This dance.

3590
03:31:20,160 --> 03:31:23,460
Okay, then next one is just called She-Her.

3591
03:31:24,060 --> 03:31:25,560
Three, two, one, go.

3592
03:31:26,160 --> 03:31:28,160
It's currently half 11 on Friday.

3593
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:29,760
Where's the new video?

3594
03:31:30,560 --> 03:31:31,560
Shut up.

3595
03:31:31,560 --> 03:31:32,660
Shut the hell up.

3596
03:31:32,660 --> 03:31:34,560
Fuck you, entitled fan.

3597
03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:35,560
Fuck yourself.

3598
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:37,660
You're lucky you get any podcasts at all.

3599
03:31:37,660 --> 03:31:38,560
You don't deserve it.

3600
03:31:41,660 --> 03:31:43,960
We were too busy eating chocolate eggs.

3601
03:31:43,960 --> 03:31:44,960
It was Easter.

3602
03:31:44,960 --> 03:31:48,560
Yeah, I had to get my black strapped molasses.

3603
03:31:49,660 --> 03:31:52,460
I was eating a chocolate crunchy bar egg.

3604
03:31:52,960 --> 03:31:56,360
I ate some and and curling up in the sunlight.

3605
03:31:56,360 --> 03:31:57,460
And that's my Sunday.

3606
03:31:57,460 --> 03:31:57,960
I eat some.

3607
03:31:57,960 --> 03:32:01,960
I eat some coffee groups, some coffee chocolate granola.

3608
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:04,660
Snacks, snacks.

3609
03:32:05,860 --> 03:32:09,060
The next one is an image.

3610
03:32:09,760 --> 03:32:10,960
Let's look at it.

3611
03:32:12,060 --> 03:32:12,960
There it is.

3612
03:32:15,860 --> 03:32:16,860
Okay, I like this.

3613
03:32:18,260 --> 03:32:21,260
Is these these images at the bottom are very funny.

3614
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:26,460
I have enlisted GPT Sasha cyberbullying, but it came out too savage.

3615
03:32:26,860 --> 03:32:29,160
If you're fragile, liberal feelings are hurt.

3616
03:32:30,960 --> 03:32:34,360
Feel free to skip this entire voicemail, Saint.

3617
03:32:35,760 --> 03:32:37,860
Who want you read yours for us?

3618
03:32:37,860 --> 03:32:38,560
Yeah.

3619
03:32:40,660 --> 03:32:42,660
Wait, is this a is this a rap?

3620
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:45,160
Oh, Ben St.

3621
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:48,460
The podcaster and Twitch streamer, the one known for his shitty

3622
03:32:48,560 --> 03:32:50,060
Blu-rays and demeanor.

3623
03:32:50,060 --> 03:32:51,360
He lounges all day.

3624
03:32:51,360 --> 03:32:55,860
A lazy man indeed sitting around stuffing his face with keto feed.

3625
03:32:56,160 --> 03:32:59,760
A socialist, he proudly claims Twitter feeds his constant

3626
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:03,160
flames, but his work ethics rather lame compared to Nate.

3627
03:33:03,160 --> 03:33:04,360
He's such a shame.

3628
03:33:04,960 --> 03:33:07,360
While Ben tweets chat, GBT knows so much.

3629
03:33:07,360 --> 03:33:08,260
I don't know.

3630
03:33:08,260 --> 03:33:10,760
While Ben tweets, Nate earns his bread.

3631
03:33:10,760 --> 03:33:12,860
He works hard while Ben lies in bed.

3632
03:33:12,860 --> 03:33:13,860
Ben's comics.

3633
03:33:13,860 --> 03:33:15,060
They're always late.

3634
03:33:15,160 --> 03:33:16,160
Nate's success.

3635
03:33:16,160 --> 03:33:17,360
He does create.

3636
03:33:17,860 --> 03:33:21,560
Oh, Ben tried to paint his teeth for the glowing pain, thinking

3637
03:33:21,560 --> 03:33:22,660
it'd make him cool.

3638
03:33:22,660 --> 03:33:25,460
But oh, what a quaint idea he had.

3639
03:33:25,460 --> 03:33:25,860
Okay.

3640
03:33:25,860 --> 03:33:26,260
Okay.

3641
03:33:26,460 --> 03:33:28,860
Idea he had for it made him look strange.

3642
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:31,460
And now he is seen as simply deranged.

3643
03:33:32,460 --> 03:33:33,460
This is like a doctor's.

3644
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:35,460
I mean, I know it's the eye.

3645
03:33:35,460 --> 03:33:36,760
Is this in the style of Dr.

3646
03:33:36,760 --> 03:33:37,460
Zeus?

3647
03:33:38,060 --> 03:33:39,460
I think that the quaint.

3648
03:33:40,260 --> 03:33:41,660
Strange, deranged.

3649
03:33:41,660 --> 03:33:44,560
Like that seems like a sort of thing you would say about like a

3650
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:46,360
villain in a in a Dr.

3651
03:33:46,360 --> 03:33:46,960
Zeus.

3652
03:33:48,060 --> 03:33:49,060
So Ben St.

3653
03:33:49,060 --> 03:33:52,860
The man of many quirks is nothing but a lazy all day jerk with

3654
03:33:52,860 --> 03:33:55,160
shitty blue rays and gummy worm snacks.

3655
03:33:55,160 --> 03:33:56,560
He won't go anywhere.

3656
03:33:56,560 --> 03:33:58,460
That's just the facts.

3657
03:33:58,660 --> 03:33:59,560
I could see that.

3658
03:33:59,560 --> 03:34:01,660
It's over.

3659
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:05,660
I saw malt gummy.

3660
03:34:06,060 --> 03:34:06,860
Delicious.

3661
03:34:06,860 --> 03:34:08,160
Delicious.

3662
03:34:09,160 --> 03:34:10,360
Oh, give and take.

3663
03:34:10,360 --> 03:34:11,560
What a name to bear.

3664
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:13,660
An artist who couldn't even draw a square.

3665
03:34:13,660 --> 03:34:14,660
Oh, gotcha.

3666
03:34:14,660 --> 03:34:15,260
Oh, no.

3667
03:34:15,260 --> 03:34:15,760
By your ass.

3668
03:34:15,760 --> 03:34:19,560
Attended attended animation school to learn but ended up with

3669
03:34:19,560 --> 03:34:20,960
art that made us yearn.

3670
03:34:20,960 --> 03:34:21,760
Hmm.

3671
03:34:22,260 --> 03:34:23,360
Doesn't sound so bad.

3672
03:34:23,360 --> 03:34:25,660
Yeah, yearn for a better.

3673
03:34:26,760 --> 03:34:29,860
Society will learn yearn for better art.

3674
03:34:29,860 --> 03:34:32,160
Yeah, I think that's what it's going for.

3675
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:35,360
Your Minecraft castle is your claim to fame.

3676
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:36,160
But who cares?

3677
03:34:36,160 --> 03:34:37,360
It's just a virtual.

3678
03:34:37,760 --> 03:34:39,360
It's not even real.

3679
03:34:40,260 --> 03:34:41,360
Not even real.

3680
03:34:41,560 --> 03:34:43,460
No, it's real to me.

3681
03:34:43,460 --> 03:34:44,660
You call yourself.

3682
03:34:45,360 --> 03:34:46,460
Your Minecraft castle.

3683
03:34:46,460 --> 03:34:47,660
It's only in a video game.

3684
03:34:47,660 --> 03:34:50,460
Give it's only in a video game.

3685
03:34:51,060 --> 03:34:52,760
Some people have real castles.

3686
03:34:53,860 --> 03:34:55,760
Nate Nate has a real castle.

3687
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:56,960
What do you have been?

3688
03:34:58,860 --> 03:35:02,160
You call yourself a big mommy milker obsessed with enemy boobs.

3689
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:03,060
What a thriller.

3690
03:35:03,060 --> 03:35:04,360
That sucks.

3691
03:35:04,760 --> 03:35:05,760
Yeah, that's not even this one.

3692
03:35:05,760 --> 03:35:07,360
That's not even that's not a bird.

3693
03:35:07,360 --> 03:35:08,960
The first one was a little questionable.

3694
03:35:08,960 --> 03:35:11,060
This one's this one's these rhymes are.

3695
03:35:11,960 --> 03:35:12,460
We got a movie.

3696
03:35:12,460 --> 03:35:13,860
There's no less about you got a good one.

3697
03:35:13,860 --> 03:35:16,760
Your presence your presence on YouTube quite obscure.

3698
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:17,760
It leaves us questioning.

3699
03:35:17,760 --> 03:35:18,660
What is it for?

3700
03:35:18,660 --> 03:35:19,660
What is it for?

3701
03:35:19,960 --> 03:35:20,960
What is it for?

3702
03:35:21,660 --> 03:35:26,060
Your failed attempts at being a comic artist makes us wonder if you're even an artist.

3703
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:28,760
Yeah, this is really bad.

3704
03:35:28,760 --> 03:35:31,860
This is not like really bad words.

3705
03:35:31,860 --> 03:35:34,560
They seem to elude a vocabulary so small.

3706
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:36,460
Perhaps give and take shouldn't talk at all.

3707
03:35:36,460 --> 03:35:36,960
I like that.

3708
03:35:36,960 --> 03:35:37,460
That's pretty good.

3709
03:35:37,460 --> 03:35:37,960
I like that one.

3710
03:35:37,960 --> 03:35:38,460
That one sounds.

3711
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:41,660
Oh, no, my vocabulary so small.

3712
03:35:41,660 --> 03:35:43,360
So meager miniscule.

3713
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:46,260
So give and take strive to be better.

3714
03:35:46,260 --> 03:35:51,060
Learn from major true trendsetter for art is a craft to be honed with time.

3715
03:35:51,060 --> 03:35:53,160
Not thrown together like a nursery rhyme.

3716
03:35:53,760 --> 03:35:57,060
Is that a self burn from the self burn from chat?

3717
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:57,860
G.B.T.

3718
03:35:58,560 --> 03:35:59,460
Gibsters.

3719
03:36:00,160 --> 03:36:01,260
We're finished.

3720
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:02,760
Gib sisters were finished.

3721
03:36:02,760 --> 03:36:03,560
Go upstairs.

3722
03:36:03,560 --> 03:36:04,360
Give sisters.

3723
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:07,360
I'm holding my published book though.

3724
03:36:08,860 --> 03:36:10,860
I'm on my I'm always on that grand.

3725
03:36:11,360 --> 03:36:13,560
It's better than your than your book.

3726
03:36:14,160 --> 03:36:16,060
You can't even eat that book.

3727
03:36:17,360 --> 03:36:19,560
Yeah, but you can't read that gummy.

3728
03:36:21,260 --> 03:36:23,460
You can read it because it has words on it actually.

3729
03:36:23,460 --> 03:36:26,260
So it's clearly clearly labeled.

3730
03:36:26,360 --> 03:36:29,360
My word counts bigger than your gummy could ever imagine.

3731
03:36:30,060 --> 03:36:32,860
It's called concise concise storytelling.

3732
03:36:34,360 --> 03:36:37,060
My gummy gets in gets out tells y'all you need to know.

3733
03:36:38,660 --> 03:36:39,460
Pretty funny.

3734
03:36:39,460 --> 03:36:40,560
I pretty good.

3735
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:41,360
Pretty good.

3736
03:36:41,360 --> 03:36:42,360
Pretty good.

3737
03:36:43,660 --> 03:36:44,360
La Mal.

3738
03:36:45,960 --> 03:36:47,460
Okay, we got another one.

3739
03:36:48,160 --> 03:36:49,160
It's an image.

3740
03:36:51,060 --> 03:36:53,860
Sora Katakuri you're swollen up already.

3741
03:36:53,860 --> 03:36:56,260
Go help your mother with the grocery bags.

3742
03:36:57,060 --> 03:36:59,460
Dad can I be next on gamer zone?

3743
03:36:59,760 --> 03:37:00,860
Not this time.

3744
03:37:01,160 --> 03:37:04,660
Hilary on already have Elon Musk and.

3745
03:37:05,560 --> 03:37:07,060
PewDiePie schedule.

3746
03:37:08,060 --> 03:37:13,360
So I think this is supposed to be Nate and his son's or category.

3747
03:37:13,360 --> 03:37:19,360
I think yeah, Nate's kids, Sora, Katakuri and Hilary and Hilary on Hilary on.

3748
03:37:19,360 --> 03:37:24,060
Hilary on that would be a very strange name for a child.

3749
03:37:26,060 --> 03:37:29,160
Dad, Dad, can I be on your podcast this week?

3750
03:37:29,160 --> 03:37:30,560
Fuck you, son.

3751
03:37:30,560 --> 03:37:34,060
Elon Musk is the reason why actually.

3752
03:37:35,060 --> 03:37:40,060
Yeah, this is this is this is how Nate this is how Nate sees it going down, I think.

3753
03:37:41,060 --> 03:37:42,760
Time will tell.

3754
03:37:43,260 --> 03:37:45,360
I wonder how many Soros are in the world.

3755
03:37:46,860 --> 03:37:47,560
Because of King.

3756
03:37:47,560 --> 03:37:48,960
I think there's got to be some.

3757
03:37:48,960 --> 03:37:50,160
I think there's definitely some.

3758
03:37:50,160 --> 03:37:50,660
Yeah.

3759
03:37:52,360 --> 03:37:53,860
Here's a better question.

3760
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:55,060
Well.

3761
03:37:56,260 --> 03:38:00,860
I wonder, I mean, is that a thing that people are like normally named in Japan?

3762
03:38:02,160 --> 03:38:02,760
Probably.

3763
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:04,460
So, okay, I guess it's not.

3764
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:09,460
It wouldn't be that weird then if someone named their kids, Sora, because in Japan,

3765
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:10,960
but in English, it would be a bit weird.

3766
03:38:11,560 --> 03:38:13,960
So yeah, only the English ones.

3767
03:38:13,960 --> 03:38:15,060
I bet I bet there's some.

3768
03:38:16,260 --> 03:38:17,260
Category.

3769
03:38:19,360 --> 03:38:21,760
Okay, next one is called Timmy.

3770
03:38:21,860 --> 03:38:23,660
Three, two, one, go.

3771
03:38:26,860 --> 03:38:30,860
Wedgie, wedgie mommy wedgie.

3772
03:38:31,860 --> 03:38:34,660
Wedgie wedgie.

3773
03:38:35,460 --> 03:38:37,860
I'm such a fucking nerd.

3774
03:38:41,260 --> 03:38:42,460
Wedgie wedgie.

3775
03:38:44,860 --> 03:38:47,760
The PCP characters are getting worse and worse.

3776
03:38:48,160 --> 03:38:49,760
We used to be a proper country.

3777
03:38:50,360 --> 03:38:53,560
Wedgie wedgie wedgie.

3778
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:59,760
Mama.

3779
03:39:01,260 --> 03:39:02,660
What the fuck is the point of this?

3780
03:39:02,660 --> 03:39:03,760
What's the joke?

3781
03:39:04,660 --> 03:39:05,560
That sucks.

3782
03:39:05,560 --> 03:39:06,360
That sucks.

3783
03:39:06,360 --> 03:39:06,960
I'm sorry.

3784
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:09,260
Give me a break.

3785
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:11,160
Give me a freaking break.

3786
03:39:11,560 --> 03:39:13,760
Give me a freaking break over here.

3787
03:39:14,660 --> 03:39:17,360
Next one is we got another image.

3788
03:39:17,360 --> 03:39:18,060
Oh, my God.

3789
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:19,060
Let's freaking go.

3790
03:39:19,060 --> 03:39:20,060
Oh, God.

3791
03:39:20,960 --> 03:39:21,560
More.

3792
03:39:22,060 --> 03:39:22,760
That's more of this.

3793
03:39:22,760 --> 03:39:23,460
More of this.

3794
03:39:23,460 --> 03:39:24,460
These faces.

3795
03:39:25,260 --> 03:39:27,060
Procrastinators podcast.

3796
03:39:27,360 --> 03:39:28,160
Oh, it's more.

3797
03:39:28,160 --> 03:39:28,960
Okay, good.

3798
03:39:29,560 --> 03:39:30,660
Welcome back to us.

3799
03:39:30,660 --> 03:39:31,960
This is the podcast.

3800
03:39:31,960 --> 03:39:33,560
Welcome back to the podcast, folks.

3801
03:39:33,560 --> 03:39:36,660
Today, Ben and I are here to announce our latest and greatest project,

3802
03:39:36,860 --> 03:39:38,660
Perfect Comic Party.

3803
03:39:39,060 --> 03:39:39,960
That's right, Gib.

3804
03:39:39,960 --> 03:39:42,960
This is going to be the best online comic platform out there.

3805
03:39:43,160 --> 03:39:47,660
People can submit their own comics and get published alongside our own masterpieces,

3806
03:39:47,660 --> 03:39:50,260
Clarissa Gunsmoke and Biscopades.

3807
03:39:51,060 --> 03:39:51,960
Absolutely.

3808
03:39:51,960 --> 03:39:54,160
This is exactly how we talk.

3809
03:39:54,160 --> 03:39:54,660
I agree.

3810
03:39:54,660 --> 03:39:55,860
And let me tell you folks,

3811
03:39:55,860 --> 03:39:57,760
my comic is the real deal.

3812
03:39:57,860 --> 03:40:01,960
It's got action, drama, romance and a badass female protagonist

3813
03:40:01,960 --> 03:40:04,360
who's not afraid to take down the bad guys.

3814
03:40:04,360 --> 03:40:05,760
Um, excuse me, Gib.

3815
03:40:06,060 --> 03:40:09,260
I'm pretty sure Biscopades is the superior comic here.

3816
03:40:09,360 --> 03:40:10,760
My characters are lovable.

3817
03:40:10,960 --> 03:40:12,260
My plot is engaging.

3818
03:40:12,360 --> 03:40:15,460
And did I mention it includes freaking beasts?

3819
03:40:18,560 --> 03:40:22,560
Yeah, but your comic doesn't even conform to gun control.

3820
03:40:23,060 --> 03:40:24,360
It does not.

3821
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:30,860
I mean, how can you call it Biscopades without including some kind of gun wielding with animals?

3822
03:40:31,160 --> 03:40:32,160
Hey, what?

3823
03:40:34,360 --> 03:40:38,760
Hey, at least it's not a ripoff of Bard quest like your comic is.

3824
03:40:39,660 --> 03:40:43,260
Hey, Clarissa Gunsmoke is a completely original creation.

3825
03:40:43,460 --> 03:40:44,760
Thank you very much.

3826
03:40:44,860 --> 03:40:48,260
And it's going to be even better with the addition of all these amazing comics

3827
03:40:48,260 --> 03:40:49,760
submitted by our fans.

3828
03:40:49,760 --> 03:40:52,360
Yeah, speaking of which, did you see this one?

3829
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:53,760
It's blowing up on Twitter.

3830
03:40:53,860 --> 03:40:56,860
I think it might just be more popular than our own comics.

3831
03:40:57,860 --> 03:40:58,660
Wait, what?

3832
03:40:58,660 --> 03:40:59,660
Let me see that.

3833
03:40:59,960 --> 03:41:01,060
Oh, wow.

3834
03:41:01,060 --> 03:41:02,560
That's actually really good.

3835
03:41:02,560 --> 03:41:02,960
Yeah.

3836
03:41:02,960 --> 03:41:04,760
Check all these likes and retweets.

3837
03:41:04,760 --> 03:41:06,760
People are flocking to this artist.

3838
03:41:07,960 --> 03:41:08,860
I'm so worried.

3839
03:41:10,060 --> 03:41:11,360
This is just great.

3840
03:41:11,560 --> 03:41:15,060
Now nobody cares about Clarissa Gunsmoke or Biscopades anymore.

3841
03:41:15,060 --> 03:41:15,660
Why would he?

3842
03:41:15,660 --> 03:41:17,960
Why do you even start the stupid project?

3843
03:41:18,060 --> 03:41:19,060
I don't know, Gib.

3844
03:41:19,660 --> 03:41:22,860
I had to sell my freaking Oculus Rift to pay rent this month.

3845
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:28,960
And I'm making six anime Daki Macro reviews every week just to make ends meet.

3846
03:41:28,960 --> 03:41:31,260
Well, at least it's helped me lose some weight.

3847
03:41:31,260 --> 03:41:33,960
Starvation has its silver linings, I guess.

3848
03:41:34,960 --> 03:41:37,160
Wow, way to put a positive spin on things.

3849
03:41:37,160 --> 03:41:42,360
But seriously, do we, do you think we made a mistake with Perfect Comic Party?

3850
03:41:42,360 --> 03:41:43,560
I don't know.

3851
03:41:43,560 --> 03:41:48,160
I mean, it was a good idea at the time, but maybe we weren't ready for the competition.

3852
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:52,960
I'm, uh, true.

3853
03:41:53,160 --> 03:41:54,460
But let's not give up yet.

3854
03:41:54,460 --> 03:41:57,460
Maybe we can come back even stronger with our next project.

3855
03:41:57,460 --> 03:42:01,960
And who knows, we might even discover the next big comic artist resolve.

3856
03:42:04,560 --> 03:42:05,560
Your fucking head.

3857
03:42:05,560 --> 03:42:06,160
Yeah.

3858
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:09,160
These are, uh, these are very flattering.

3859
03:42:09,660 --> 03:42:10,960
These are very nice.

3860
03:42:13,660 --> 03:42:16,060
I'm scrolling, scrolling back up at their faces.

3861
03:42:16,460 --> 03:42:16,760
What?

3862
03:42:16,760 --> 03:42:17,560
Why can you call it?

3863
03:42:17,560 --> 03:42:21,360
How can you call it Biscopades without some sort of gun wielding animal?

3864
03:42:22,160 --> 03:42:23,060
Yeah, Ben.

3865
03:42:23,060 --> 03:42:26,560
It doesn't even conform to gun control.

3866
03:42:26,760 --> 03:42:29,960
My, I got a good argument there.

3867
03:42:30,060 --> 03:42:30,360
Yeah.

3868
03:42:30,360 --> 03:42:32,160
You got me a little bit.

3869
03:42:32,560 --> 03:42:33,460
Uh, okay.

3870
03:42:33,460 --> 03:42:35,960
Next one is, oh, that was the one we just looked at.

3871
03:42:36,460 --> 03:42:38,860
Oh, we got a freaking vocaroo.

3872
03:42:39,560 --> 03:42:41,060
Oh, I know what this is.

3873
03:42:42,060 --> 03:42:44,560
Wait, these are from Cheesy, aren't they?

3874
03:42:46,360 --> 03:42:47,360
Uh, I don't know.

3875
03:42:48,360 --> 03:42:53,360
Cause it's, cause it's, cause they're called, uh, Steve, no, an enderman, no.

3876
03:42:53,860 --> 03:42:57,560
Because, you know, like the block, the mecha block.

3877
03:42:57,560 --> 03:42:59,360
Oh, well, it might not be Cheesy.

3878
03:42:59,360 --> 03:43:00,660
Might be whoever's in the chat.

3879
03:43:00,660 --> 03:43:02,560
So, oh, okay.

3880
03:43:02,760 --> 03:43:04,660
Uh, three, two, one, go.

3881
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:07,560
Steve, Steve, it's Steve.

3882
03:43:07,760 --> 03:43:09,060
It's Minecraft, Steve.

3883
03:43:09,060 --> 03:43:11,760
Mr. Minecraft, Steve himself.

3884
03:43:11,860 --> 03:43:12,960
What are you doing, man?

3885
03:43:13,060 --> 03:43:15,560
What are you doing with that big, big boy?

3886
03:43:15,560 --> 03:43:17,360
A wig, pickaxe, huh?

3887
03:43:17,860 --> 03:43:21,260
A large, sizable pickaxe for a mining society.

3888
03:43:21,360 --> 03:43:23,760
What are you doing, man?

3889
03:43:23,960 --> 03:43:25,760
You can't mind that.

3890
03:43:25,860 --> 03:43:27,560
That's the sacred block.

3891
03:43:27,760 --> 03:43:28,960
The Mohammed Rock.

3892
03:43:29,060 --> 03:43:30,560
Don't even think about it.

3893
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:33,260
Don't touch the Muslim tetrahedron.

3894
03:43:33,360 --> 03:43:35,160
Don't, don't, don't mind it.

3895
03:43:35,560 --> 03:43:38,860
Do not mind the Muslim cuboid with your pickaxe.

3896
03:43:38,860 --> 03:43:39,560
Dimeoid.

3897
03:43:39,560 --> 03:43:40,160
Do.

3898
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:41,560
That's a dick.

3899
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:47,060
Okay.

3900
03:43:47,060 --> 03:43:47,760
Okay.

3901
03:43:48,560 --> 03:43:50,060
That's, that's a blue and fall.

3902
03:43:50,560 --> 03:43:51,160
Is it?

3903
03:43:51,160 --> 03:43:53,560
I mean, is that an AI voice?

3904
03:43:53,960 --> 03:44:00,260
It's an AI voice, but oblivion fall is, is, he loves that voice generator.

3905
03:44:00,360 --> 03:44:02,660
I, I, I may, it could be.

3906
03:44:02,660 --> 03:44:04,660
I feel like, I feel like it would be.

3907
03:44:07,160 --> 03:44:10,760
I guess, I guess I just don't know who else would submit such a thing.

3908
03:44:10,760 --> 03:44:11,160
You're right.

3909
03:44:11,160 --> 03:44:11,760
You're right.

3910
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:12,860
Okay.

3911
03:44:12,860 --> 03:44:15,160
Well, there's one more called Enderman.

3912
03:44:15,160 --> 03:44:16,860
No.

3913
03:44:17,960 --> 03:44:20,660
So let's go.

3914
03:44:21,960 --> 03:44:22,360
All right.

3915
03:44:22,460 --> 03:44:24,260
Three, two, one, go.

3916
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:26,560
The Enderman, the Enderman.

3917
03:44:26,560 --> 03:44:29,460
He's, he's that deskie pesky Enderman.

3918
03:44:29,560 --> 03:44:31,060
He's going to pick it up.

3919
03:44:31,060 --> 03:44:33,160
He's going to pick up the cube of Mohammed Rube.

3920
03:44:33,160 --> 03:44:34,860
The cube of Mohammed Rube.

3921
03:44:35,260 --> 03:44:36,860
This is not block game Mecca.

3922
03:44:36,960 --> 03:44:39,060
This is Muslimania Minecraftania.

3923
03:44:39,160 --> 03:44:40,460
Don't let him grasp it.

3924
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:42,060
Do not let him grasp the cube.

3925
03:44:42,060 --> 03:44:43,960
Don't let him grasp it.

3926
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:45,860
Do not let him grasp it.

3927
03:44:45,860 --> 03:44:47,860
No, he's grasping.

3928
03:44:47,860 --> 03:44:50,060
No, he's grasping.

3929
03:44:50,060 --> 03:44:50,960
I'm going to grasp.

3930
03:44:50,960 --> 03:44:52,360
Oh, it's grasping.

3931
03:44:52,360 --> 03:44:54,860
I'm going to grasp.

3932
03:44:59,060 --> 03:45:02,260
I will have a great time when, when that stupid slime and punishment

3933
03:45:02,260 --> 03:45:03,260
Kickstarter gets going.

3934
03:45:03,260 --> 03:45:07,160
I will have a great time telling people to pluge.

3935
03:45:07,260 --> 03:45:08,060
Oh, yeah.

3936
03:45:09,060 --> 03:45:14,060
And it works because pluge is like sploosh, like slime.

3937
03:45:14,160 --> 03:45:16,760
You could imagine dropping stuff into a slime thing.

3938
03:45:16,760 --> 03:45:20,160
It encourages people to save up a big, you know, a big cummy

3939
03:45:20,160 --> 03:45:25,060
load of lots of money and then just squirt it all over me on

3940
03:45:25,060 --> 03:45:26,160
my waiting face.

3941
03:45:26,160 --> 03:45:27,160
Oh, mess me up.

3942
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:28,160
Mess me up.

3943
03:45:28,760 --> 03:45:30,760
I've lost my appetite.

3944
03:45:30,760 --> 03:45:31,360
Mess me up.

3945
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:34,260
Mess me up with all that cash money.

3946
03:45:34,260 --> 03:45:38,160
Let's me up with a big Dono's big liquid stream of currency

3947
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:42,960
on patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

3948
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:48,760
You can pluge or content if you want to.

3949
03:45:48,760 --> 03:45:49,360
Yes.

3950
03:45:49,860 --> 03:45:50,560
Well, what do you think?

3951
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:52,060
Are we are we concluded?

3952
03:45:54,360 --> 03:46:00,160
I was going to talk about having finished Utana and the

3953
03:46:00,160 --> 03:46:02,560
Al House is finished, but since you haven't seen those,

3954
03:46:02,560 --> 03:46:04,260
yeah, save that for another time.

3955
03:46:04,260 --> 03:46:08,560
Yeah, I have not seen either of those at all.

3956
03:46:09,060 --> 03:46:12,060
My recommendation should watch RRR.

3957
03:46:12,060 --> 03:46:12,860
It's really good.

3958
03:46:12,960 --> 03:46:13,660
It's really good film.

3959
03:46:19,360 --> 03:46:19,760
It's good.

3960
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:20,460
It's a good movie.

3961
03:46:20,460 --> 03:46:22,160
It's the best movie I've seen in a while.

3962
03:46:22,760 --> 03:46:28,160
It was better than better than Northman, better than ever.

3963
03:46:28,160 --> 03:46:32,160
Everything everything everywhere in my opinion.

3964
03:46:33,560 --> 03:46:38,060
Uh, those are like the only two movies I saw last year.

3965
03:46:39,760 --> 03:46:44,060
I think it's even better than lock the movie where a guy is

3966
03:46:44,060 --> 03:46:46,660
sitting in his car on his phone for two hours.

3967
03:46:47,260 --> 03:46:48,960
It might even be better than that.

3968
03:46:50,160 --> 03:46:50,760
Crazy.

3969
03:46:50,760 --> 03:46:51,160
I know.

3970
03:46:52,460 --> 03:46:52,860
Okay.

3971
03:46:52,860 --> 03:46:53,760
Thanks for listening.

3972
03:46:53,760 --> 03:46:54,260
Okay.

3973
03:46:54,260 --> 03:46:55,360
We'll see you next week.

3974
03:46:55,360 --> 03:47:00,160
Go to amazon.com slash Clarissa Gunsmoke find my book and buy

3975
03:47:00,160 --> 03:47:01,560
it and have it do it.

3976
03:47:01,660 --> 03:47:02,360
Cherish it.

3977
03:47:02,360 --> 03:47:02,860
Do it.

3978
03:47:02,860 --> 03:47:04,860
Pludge, Pludge.

3979
03:47:04,860 --> 03:47:05,960
I mean, bye.

3980
03:47:05,960 --> 03:47:06,960
Bye.

3981
03:47:08,060 --> 03:47:08,260
Okay.

3982
03:47:08,260 --> 03:47:08,860
Bye.

3983
03:47:09,060 --> 03:47:10,360
Boy.

3984
03:47:10,560 --> 03:47:13,060
I'm trying to, you can't do an ooh sound with a bye.

3985
03:47:13,060 --> 03:47:14,560
Bowie, Bowie.

3986
03:47:14,660 --> 03:47:16,660
You're saying, you're saying, you're saying yes.

3987
03:47:16,660 --> 03:47:17,760
Bowie, yes.

3988
03:47:17,760 --> 03:47:18,460
Yes.

3989
03:47:19,960 --> 03:47:20,160
Okay.

3990
03:47:20,160 --> 03:47:20,560
Bye.

3991
03:47:21,460 --> 03:47:21,860
Okay.

3992
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:22,460
Yep.

3993
03:47:22,460 --> 03:47:22,860
Bye.
