00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is episode 99 of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am the best guy ever.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're getting there.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm a Digibro.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You've got Tom Oliver.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am...

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Nice one, dude.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not Digibro at all.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm a...what's the opposite of digital?

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Analogue.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Physical.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Analogue.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm an analog bro.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Analogue bro.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When's the lore of analog bro gonna break in there?

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, no wait.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look forward to anal bro.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Look forward to the awesome origin story of analog bro at Radcon 3.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All right.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right off the bat, making false promises that we can't keep right off of that.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Everything's a lie.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't believe any of it.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's a...

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Every time anyone mentions anything concerning Radcon 3, there's always little asterisk at

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
the end that makes a notch in the mind.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you sound like a munchie hat?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Munchie hat?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My favorite hat producing content creator in the entire world, known exclusively for

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
his hat making skills.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't think so.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tom Oliver.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Pretty good.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Known for being black and white.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
For affinity user.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, for affinity user.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Whoa.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's for a future episode.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's true.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We've got Hippocrates.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Get ready.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Get ready.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Get ready.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am ready.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What are you doing?

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get ready.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Get ready for the podcast.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, shut up.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ben Taint is here.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There he is.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah, the crisp, refreshing taste of Diet Mountain Dew Code Red.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's so many adjectives.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, and what are we talking about today, everybody?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's just get to the fucking topic.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Today is the day that we revisit a topic that we had previously attempted, the only failed

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
PCP episode up to this point, the legendary, much awaited, weird utilitarianism.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Whether there have been failures is debated.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, okay.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Any technical failures.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This was ruined by Nate's work, if I remember correctly.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, it's true.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My computer had died in the middle of our episode.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We were 45 minutes into it, so we had wanted to put the capper, put the stopper on all

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
discussions of this weird utilitarianism meme and make it so that there was just a one-stop

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
shop for all your WU needs.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We wanted to end it once and for all, indeed.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We wanted to slay that dragon.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Fucking fizzled out and died much like Nate's hopes and dreams and his computer, and we

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
had to restart here today for you.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's not wrong.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's not wrong.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think he said in the original episode, I think I'm going to come down on your side,

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nate, but also make fun of you.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What better way to start Radcon than to fucking end weird utilitarianism forever?

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Never to have it rise again.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just want to reiterate for everybody.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, indeed.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Radcon is next week from when you're hearing this.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is episode 99.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There will be the PCP episode 100 spectacular at Radcon.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You guys have been fucking asking about Nate's fucking weird utilitarianism since day fucking

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
one, and here we go.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We're finally going to be able to put that ghost to rest and suck him up in our fucking

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
ghost bathroom.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Put that ghost right back in its shell, everybody.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Here we go.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think the best way to start is to reference Nate yourself.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are the urban dictionary this time.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So what is weird utilitarianism?

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Excellent question.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What does it mean to you?

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a complicated thing, but as a good starting point.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Does anybody know where the term came from?

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Was it from the comments?

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Someone in the comments.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was actually trying to remember who specifically said it, but I couldn't.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That exact phrase came up multiple times.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know if it was inspired by one person, but multiple people would refer to Nate specifically

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
as weird utilitarianism as your thing.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's true.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It came a little bit of a meme, and now obviously it's grown a little bit.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's start with the word utilitarianism.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So here's your urban dictionary defines it as such.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A philosophy that people should act in order to increase the frequency and longevity of

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
pleasure throughout the world.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Although the idea acting to increase long term and global pleasure sounds desirable,

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
utilitarians believe that the pleasure of many outweighs pleasure of a few.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A utilitarian may believe that killing one person in order to increase the pleasure of

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
any or killing someone and harvesting their organs would be a just action.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Some utilitarians have seen that this can be dangerous.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Many utilitarians, because of this, follow a slightly different ideology.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They should act to increase the frequency and longevity of pleasure throughout the world

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
by following the best social standards.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, Nate, well it sounds like utilitarianism is already weird,

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
but what's weird about your utilitarianism?

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, what's weird about mine, I guess in contrast to this,

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
we'll flesh it out throughout this entire podcast,

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but the definition here, even in here, it is confused on urban dictionary.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's like bringing multiple interpretations at you.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The weird thing about that definition is the fact that they started off with like,

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
it's all about bringing the maximum amount of happiness to the maximum amount of people.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm like, that's what every philosophy is about.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's not you need to utilitarianism.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What they feel to define here is that utilitarians think purely in mechanical terms

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and in like, there's no soul to be conscious of or thoughts of the afterlife.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It is purely a materialistic view, which is not synonymous with immoral Christians.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that the utility calculus is every utilitarianism.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Correct, he had the soul of a champion.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, okay, I personally, the reason why I like the term weird utilitarianism so much

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is because I am 100% against identitarianism in every form.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's that?

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Identitarianism, just the idea of grouping any people together under a label to quantify them,

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I find it definitely harmful and mostly immoral.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I hate labels so much.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm so glad people have made this label for me.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, yeah, but that's the thing because the weird utilitarianism label is a label of one, me, just me,

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
which is exactly how we should think of people as individuals and that's it.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like the word, if I tell someone I'm a Democrat, which I'm not,

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
then like they will immediately pour all these assumptions onto me.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If they say that they're a weird Democrat.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, then you got something special going on.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I would say the same thing about me.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you attach the word weird in front of it, yeah, it helps to diminish some of those.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like, yeah, he's kind of like, it's kind of like if you call yourself like a weird feminist,

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
like nobody wants to be called, or I shouldn't say nobody wants to be called a feminist anymore.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But a lot of people don't want to be called a feminist because of the fact that they're like,

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
oh, it has too many connotations.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But if you're just a weird feminist, it's like people get that you're on board for women,

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but they're not sure why or like what things you're into.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What are his true motives?

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's a lot of people that would look at feminists now and be like,

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
those are pretty fucking weird people.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, but if you're a weird feminist, you've got to confuse them so that they're not upset.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't want to have to meet a girl and have her say she's a feminist,

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and then I just start to project all my bullshit baggage onto her.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want to do that.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And of course, I don't want people to do that to me either.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There could be some old fucking mom from the 70s who doesn't even know what a computer is,

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
but still calls herself a feminist because that's what she was when she was a little babe.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The biggest problem I see in today's online discussions,

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and it's probably been the problem forever, and it's just become clear to me as I get a little more mature and worldly,

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the problem across the board is twofold.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
People, one, they talk past each other and they don't understand what the other, excuse me, is actually saying.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They're not actually paying attention to what the other person is saying.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They are making assumptions and projecting things onto them from their predetermined biases about what these people think.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That is problem one.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Problem two is that people do not actually comprehend that people believe what they say.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They don't actually understand the difference in foundational worldview that people have.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You can be an atheist and you can go around and be like, oh, Catholics are so evil.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Always preaching about hell.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's so immoral and I say that because on a base level, I do think it is immoral.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But if you think about it from the perspective of the Catholic,

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
if they don't force their children through whatever means are necessary to be a good, virtuous Christian,

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that is dooming their child to an eternity in hell.

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That is so much more significant than any amount of discomfort they will suffer in life,

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that it would be super immoral of them to not do whatever was necessary to protect their kid from this perceived danger.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The problem with people, oh, sorry, continue.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, no, go ahead, go ahead.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The problem with people on, like, fighting just in general, but also on the internet, especially if you can see it,

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
people's conversation is laid out bare-hair.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
People respond to the invisible words.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
People may be implying by just being part of the hate effigy that they are assigned to.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So if you just see, not even in the text, if you just see some sort of avatar or name

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that could in fact signify that they are a part of some group vaguely,

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
then you are just going to bring up your hate effigy that you have of that group.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Dude, I for one am sick and tired of people seeing my brony icon

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and just making all this shit on the page, just making all these blanket assumptions about.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's not cool.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I gotta tell you, if you want people to take anything you say seriously ever,

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
don't make your whole aesthetic memes, because if your whole aesthetic is memes,

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that is often the case.

200
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's say you go to Drill's Twitter.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Drill's Twitter is a big meme.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's the joke.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's a joke Twitter.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
His pictures are all goofy.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
His name is stupid, but it's great.

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sometimes you see people and their name is cuntlord,

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and they've got a picture of a gaping ass as their avatar,

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and they're leaving comments like, this video was okay,

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but I think if you improved your sound quality or whatever,

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
am I taking advice from cuntlord with the gaping ass?

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The gaping ass is just how you kick cuntlord with the main building.

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Consider your brand.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Your brand affects the way that people perceive the things you say.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And even if you're nobody on Twitter, people still are gonna...

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's amazing how often I get responses that I don't understand on Twitter,

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because it's like some random guy who I don't know anything about,

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and his profile is just so uncomprehensible that I can't even understand the tweet itself.

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Even if it's written kind of plainly,

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know what perspective they're coming from,

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and it's hard to get that in 140 characters,

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and with the minimal information that's on somebody's Twitter page.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
280 characters, 280.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My phone still is 140. It's annoying.

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's very annoying.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Anyway, right at the back here, we're just describing for the viewers,

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
just that tribalism is...

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Everyone's packed into a label and Nate doesn't like that.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Does anybody disagree with that, that tribalism is bad?

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Probably not.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think we're all on the same page.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, they're funny.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't think that tribalism is bad.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I do think labels are bad.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think it's fine to be a part of it.

235
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think the tribadism is pretty cool.

236
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think it's fine to be a part of whatever...

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What is that, Ben?

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm trying to talk and you fucking talk it over,

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because that's why no one's reacting to your goddamn joke.

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What was he saying? What is your thing?

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you asking?

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Tribadism.

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What's a tribad?

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Shit. It's some kind of lesbian thing.

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you, Ben.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think it's scissoring. I think it's scissoring.

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh, tribadism. Ignore me.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I pronounce it tribadism, not tribadism.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, I guess you'd be the expert.

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Wait, wait, wait. I looked it up.

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A tribad, according to Urban Dictionary,

252
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is a female with a greatly enlarged clitoris,

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
thought to be of as a result of hormone imbalance,

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
especially one of homosexual orientation.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Ben, what cartoon is it?

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It looks like I was watching.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Steve from Universe.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, in any case, I'm okay with the idea of people

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
sticking with their groups.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, we are a tribe. That's pretty clear.

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Are you telling me you're a white nationalist, did you?

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Invisible word.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Absolutely.

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't think anybody questions that the PCP is a tight-knit group

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that's kind of insular,

267
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but we do try to avoid having labels on this group.

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's a lot of podcasts that you can point at

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and say that's a libertarian podcast,

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
or that's a liberal podcast,

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
or this is a comedy podcast, or this is that.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
PCP is like, it is tribal in that it's the PCP,

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
but there's no other simple way to describe it.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I love...

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, we're just ourselves.

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
One of my favorite things is insisting that I am a red pill

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and a blue pill at all times.

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Just it.

280
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Both ends of the spectrum.

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And see...

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, that's just...

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Pure and simple.

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's fair, but that's just...

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, that's you just rejecting.

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nobody likes to be labeled.

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Being labeled is not fun.

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
People should be judged on their ideas.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Some people really like it.

290
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Some people are all about it.

291
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Some people derive a lot of it.

292
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, well, you know what?

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Labeling yourself is a fickle enterprise

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that far too many people identify with.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You got your guys like Richard Spencer,

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
who would just say, like, I'm white.

297
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I care about white people.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't care about, like, whatever.

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just want, like, a future for the white race.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And, like, I get why he thinks that way,

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the tribal nature of humanity and stuff,

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but I think it is a very huge mistake

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
to just say let your race, like,

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
should define the group that you hang with.

305
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And, like, you got groups like, I don't know,

306
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
like feminists or whatever.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
People just push their particular agenda

308
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and increase the amount of, like, fragmentation

309
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
by having, like, purity tests over and over.

310
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like, if you've got, like,

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
how feminist is feminist enough to be a member of a community?

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Or how white is white enough to be in Richard Spencer's country?

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, I think the big problem with collectivism in general is that,

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and we're seeing it happen now,

315
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is that whenever you have, like, a collective ideology,

316
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
it kind of, like, turns on itself,

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
because there's more, like you said,

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
there's more purity tests that happen over and over again.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it seems like the inevitable end game of collectivism

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
is just individualism.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because, like, eventually, you're going to keep breaking down groups smaller and smaller

322
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
until it's just me versus you.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So it's like, why waste, like, a fucking century of, like,

324
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
infighting and, like, social unrest

325
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
when we already came to the answer?

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's exactly right. That's exactly right.

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey, we're not really talking about weird utilitarianism.

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We're talking about labels generally.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And we're going to continue nonsense because I weren't talking about something that Digi said.

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, and I have to go out and read.

331
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
As soon as everybody else is done.

332
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, yeah, it's fine. Digi, I think that it is misguided

333
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that it is good that the PCP is so insular.

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because I don't think that it is.

335
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I think that we should be branching out more as we are with guests.

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, I didn't mean to say it's...

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't mean to say it's good for us to, like, never talk to anybody

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and all stuff like that.

339
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I just mean it's nice to have a tribe.

340
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like, it's good to have people who generally see things the same way you do

341
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and that you can relate to and bounce ideas off of

342
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and, like, get a better understanding of yourself.

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like, I don't think anybody in the PCP would have been as successful

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
if not for having a bunch of like-minded individuals

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
they can bounce their ideas off of, you know.

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's usually advantageous to just not be in one particular group.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You know, on that side...

348
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why limit yourself to just one box?

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

350
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Zero artistry and just pick any one you want.

351
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think it is important to note that humans definitely are tribal.

352
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We definitely are that way, just biologically speaking and psychologically speaking.

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We definitely, like, are more comfortable with things that we've, like, grown up with

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and then when you go to foreign cultures, like, it feels foreign.

355
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You know, you can't just instantly absorb the culture of, like, a new place immediately.

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I actually...

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What Munchie was saying about, like, don't limit yourself to one box.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Pick as many different labels as you want.

359
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I like that.

360
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah.

361
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, you were joking about it, at least.

362
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I think it's a good idea to...

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think it's funny everybody, like, has, oh, I have this one religion

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and this one, like, philosophy.

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Like, oh, I'm a...

366
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm a fucking, like you said, atheist or zero-astry-anist or whatever.

367
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like, pick two.

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Pick three.

369
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Some of them are mutually exclusive.

370
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Some of them are, but not all of them.

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like, I would consider myself a Taoist

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
because nothing about it contradicts my own philosophy, you know.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So, like, why not throw it on the pile?

374
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There you go.

375
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know, be a...

376
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That just cheapens the idea of labels, which we already know.

377
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They should already be cheapened

378
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
because they're not worth anything.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, it should be super cheap.

380
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Taoism based off of Tao, the greatest devout commenter of all time.

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

382
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Shout out to Tao.

383
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to go on a...

384
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, well, let's talk more about...

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to go on a rant here

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
because this is a perfect opportunity for it

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
since you're all here and this is all your fault,

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
which is that I, as a...

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is super relevant.

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
As a member of being in the PCP,

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
have been judged to have opinions I don't have

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
based on other members of the PCP.

393
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Same.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This has happened where...

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The biggest way this happened to me

396
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is recently there's a board called TRANS

397
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that exists on Reddit.

398
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's spelled like that, like a ton of letters.

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And it's for, like, trans people making fun of themselves, essentially.

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like, you know, self-effacing humor about trans issues.

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So they had a thread called a gender-fluid egg,

402
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
something like finding a gender...

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The rare gender-fluid egg is what it was called.

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And it was just a bunch of quotes of me

405
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
from my Crunchyroll interview

406
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
talking about how I wanted to be Ranma

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and being able to switch between male and female freely.

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And people in this thread,

409
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
a bunch of people were saying,

410
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
like, oh, I always thought Digi was like that

411
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
because I watched his videos

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and he talks about wanting to be a girl all the time, you know?

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I was like, this thread was a huge revelation for me

414
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
because I never thought about it and I'm reading it

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and I'm like, oh, my God, these people are right.

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like, I've been ignoring this this whole time.

417
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But then somebody comes in the thread and is like,

418
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Digi can't be...

419
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Digi's probably not gender-fluid

420
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
because he's part of a transphobic group

421
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
called the PCP,

422
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
who all hate trans people and want them...

423
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is that what people say about us now?

424
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They want them to have no rights and their red pill.

425
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And also, you were considered...

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This was considered a...

427
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's the word I'm looking for?

428
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The...

429
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Hate group?

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No, the red one, not the blue one.

431
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But not Republican.

432
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Oh, yeah.

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Conservatives?

434
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This was described as a conservative transphobic podcast.

436
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And I was just like, I don't...

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Even if there was at least...

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This was all based on a discussion of, of course,

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Nate and Ben and DeVue, I think,

440
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
being, like, aggressively misunderstanding

441
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
trans issues or something in some podcast.

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But it got attributed to me, and I was just like,

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've been the most pro-trans person that I know

444
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
for as long as I've known that it was a thing, you know?

445
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Like, I've always been totally down

446
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
for trans rights and everything.

447
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So it was very strange for me to see that.

448
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And I was just like, the PCP is not a conservative podcast

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
or a transphobic podcast.

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If it was, then I wouldn't be on it, you know?

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Like, that would...

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Because for it to, for the entire podcast to be,

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
that would mean that everyone on there was that, you know?

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But it's not.

455
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's a multifaceted podcast with a bunch of different personalities

456
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
with different worldviews.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's the problem.

458
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
People who feel as though they can actually talk to each other

459
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in spite of the differences in their worldview, you know?

460
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's right.

461
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's unfortunate, but this is people...

462
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You know, like, I understand why people make this connection.

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, first of all, to make the case that, for example,

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
what I said on the podcast was transphobic,

465
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I said something...

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Actually, what I said in this podcast was equally damning

467
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
in terms of me being a hater against trans rights.

468
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because what I said previously in this very podcast

469
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
was I am staunchly anti-identitarian.

470
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And that is exactly synonymous with saying

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
what I said in that podcast was that I don't care about trans people.

472
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because that's what I mean.

473
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't care about these individual issues

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that have literally nothing to do with my life.

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And I don't care about Republican rights.

476
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't care about anyone's rights.

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't care about black people.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't care about white people.

479
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't care about any of this shit.

480
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just care about individual rights as a person to person.

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think every trans person should be 100% free

482
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
to do whatever they want.

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I completely think you should do that.

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But, like, you know, I've got a lot of shit to do.

485
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't have a lot of time to worry about everyone's problems.

486
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's how I feel.

487
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Fight your own battles.

488
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I definitely believe in that.

489
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Say that again?

490
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Oh, fight your own battles.

491
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Like, everybody's always trying to fight for somebody else.

492
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They're always trying to be like...

493
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Every time I get a complaint that I said,

494
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
nigga, from a non-black person,

495
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm just like, you're...

496
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why do you care?

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know, like...

498
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

499
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And even if it is a black person,

500
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm like, why do you care either?

501
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But, like, it's just very strange to me

502
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
when I see people fighting,

503
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
like, trying to fight for other people.

504
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's like, fight for your own shit.

505
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I know you've got problems.

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You know, I know you've got your own shit.

507
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know.

508
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
White guilt or something.

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
People want to be allies and something.

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't know what are the ideas there.

511
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think...

512
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sure that's part of it, Nate.

513
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm sure that's a growing culture.

514
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But I think a lot of it is just, like,

515
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
people trying to be goody-to-shoes.

516
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Though, I say that in, like, a mean way.

517
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But I'm sure in their heart of hearts,

518
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
they want to be a gay person.

519
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
See, I completely agree.

520
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah.

521
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I completely agree that these people are actually

522
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
being good and being honest with their worldview.

523
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't even begrudge them that.

524
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I simply have a different worldview,

525
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and I think that it is not helpful

526
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to just, like, call me evil or hateful

527
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
or, like, you know, any of that shit

528
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
as opposed to convincing me...

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like, pedantic romantic is trans.

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And message me.

531
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And, like, politely explain some areas

532
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
where I made basically just complete mistakes.

533
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And I just politely said,

534
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
oh, well, thanks.

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I wasn't aware of that.

536
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know, I don't spend a lot of time

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
thinking about these issues as should be clear.

538
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So, yeah, I was definitely wrong about that.

539
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Thanks for correcting me.

540
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We had a completely civil discussion.

541
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I respected her points, and it was fine.

542
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And that's a civil discourse

543
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
that actually gets somewhere.

544
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, that's it.

545
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But the reason we're all grouped together,

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
this is the other problem here.

547
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's that people can think whatever they want

548
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
about, like, me and what I've said.

549
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But because I am, like, officially,

550
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I have the label.

551
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I do have a label of member of the PCP.

552
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And, Digi, you also have the label

553
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
of member of the PCP.

554
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And people can just latch onto that.

555
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And they can make any connections they want.

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
They could say that, first of all,

557
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
they wrongly perceive me to hate trans people.

558
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They could say, he's in the PCP.

559
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Therefore, the whole PCP is tainted with this idea.

560
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Therefore, Digi is also tainted with this idea.

561
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Or he's, like, encouraging it.

562
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This is a huge part of why we've essentially lost Jesse

563
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and why all of you are responsible

564
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
who listened to the show for associating him

565
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
with everything we say.

566
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
When he does not want to be associated

567
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
with a lot of what we say, you know?

568
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But, like, again, like you said,

569
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
you get a target on your back just for being,

570
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
like, friends with somebody who, you know,

571
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
who people don't like.

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And it's one thing if it's, like, a criminal,

573
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'd be, like, yeah, you shouldn't be,

574
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
like, if someone's doing something really bad,

575
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
even if they're just being an asshole,

576
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
like, yeah, you should probably not

577
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
openly associate with them.

578
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But, like, this is a podcast.

579
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a discussion.

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm not holding you guys responsible

581
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
for the things you say on the PCP,

582
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
because it's, first of all, a comedy show.

583
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's not a fucking...

584
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
We're not, like, trying to decide laws.

585
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
We're not, like...

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is a whole other rant

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that, like, people these days

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
are constantly holding, like, YouTubers to task

589
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
to be right about everything.

590
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's, like, this podcast is not about

591
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
being correct about anything.

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's a fucking comedy podcast.

593
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A bunch of, like, guys in their late 20s

594
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
get to sit around...

595
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, and munchy.

596
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You know, sit around and just be all whatever

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
thoughts they happen to have about some topic,

598
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
because we're pals.

599
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And if you like listening to it, that's fine.

600
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But, like, every time people are, like,

601
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
coming down on us super hard,

602
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
because, like, something we said was a little edgy

603
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
or, like, offended someone,

604
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm just, like, dude, it's a podcast, you know?

605
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like, don't worry about it.

606
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's not gonna hurt anybody.

607
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I mean, it's one of those things,

608
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and also none of us were, like,

609
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
transphobic in, like, a really bigoted,

610
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like, stupid way.

611
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Right.

612
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Like, we were all just curious

613
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and, like, talking about it, like,

614
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
if none of us was.

615
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But that's the thing.

616
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It could not be an ally.

617
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You know?

618
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The problem is to these people,

619
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
these are, like, life-or-death questions

620
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
in their mind.

621
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So to not be an ally fighting on their side

622
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
is to be, at the very least, like,

623
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
facilitating harm.

624
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And that is, like...

625
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If you have that kind of mindset,

626
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
you need to fuck off.

627
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I mean, yeah, I would agree with that.

628
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I would agree with that.

629
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Like, anyone who doesn't agree with me totally

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
or isn't, like, fighting, you know,

631
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
for my battles and my rights, it's, like,

632
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
dude, I got my own shit to worry about.

633
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So you can fuck off, you know?

634
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean, that's how I feel.

635
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm completely libertarian on this front.

636
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I encourage anyone to do whatever they want

637
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
on all of this front.

638
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But to say that, like, we have to be

639
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
fighting the same battles as you,

640
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
like...

641
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Fuck off.

642
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can't tell me what to do.

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Fuck off.

644
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Your particular world view trumps everything else

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and has to be respected above all others.

646
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If anyone's being hurt,

647
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
if there are people being murdered or, you know,

648
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
any of this shit is happening,

649
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
let me know so that the...

650
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, don't let me know, because I don't care.

651
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But the police care.

652
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The police fucking care.

653
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, there was probably a couple murders

654
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
in Africa, probably a couple murders in Russia today.

655
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Guess what?

656
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't care.

657
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't know those people.

658
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm sorry.

659
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The police of Russia have to deal with those murders.

660
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's out of my jurisdiction.

661
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It is outside my fucking jurisdiction.

662
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's how I feel.

663
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The problem with the PCP and everyone taking all of our

664
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
opinions...

665
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I have real trans friends, by the way.

666
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I have real trans friends who I talk to and like.

667
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And we are friends.

668
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But here's the thing.

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I like them because they're my friends,

670
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
not because they're trans.

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's the thing, guys.

672
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That's what I want.

673
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Everyone to fucking understand.

674
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I have trans friends who are really...

675
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We have not talked about weird utilitarianism at all.

676
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Man, I would have said something

677
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
completely else other than weird utilitarianism

678
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
right now as well.

679
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay.

680
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Go for it.

681
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
We'll get to it.

682
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This is going to be side tangents forever.

683
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We're at the very end.

684
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
We're going to be like,

685
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
what were we talking about at the beginning of this podcast?

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Anyway, the problem with the PCP and everyone

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
taking all of our opinions as whole is

688
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
everyone's taking...

689
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Print out each of our icons,

690
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
put them in a bowl,

691
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
put them in a microwave,

692
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and you've made an opinion soup.

693
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Not only do all of our opinions

694
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
get mushed into one,

695
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
they're warped opinions.

696
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Just do the nature of the way the internet works.

697
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Everyone will warp your opinion no matter what.

698
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
To be a cartoonish, evil, hate, effigy version

699
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
of what it originally was.

700
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's a double...

701
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You will have...

702
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
If you close comments on your videos...

703
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It won't be attributed to Hippo or something like that.

704
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It won't even be...

705
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It won't even be your warped opinion.

706
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It'll be someone else's.

707
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah.

708
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And people...

709
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's like when you close comments on a video

710
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and suddenly you deny all criticism.

711
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That's the kind of logical...

712
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That's how the internet works.

713
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You turned off comments on one video

714
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and now you cannot take criticism at all.

715
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's how people now take you.

716
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's funny you mentioned that

717
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because there were a lot of people back

718
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
when we did comment rules part two.

719
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The entire PCP is anti-comments.

720
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
When half of that episode was a debate

721
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
about whether they were good or bad.

722
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
People recently who have been criticizing you

723
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
for your whatever stance on comments or whatever,

724
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
they'll take clips of you

725
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
saying these things from a PCP episode.

726
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You can hear me cutting in,

727
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
making a counter-argument,

728
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and arguing against that point.

729
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And then they say,

730
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
oh, the PCP believes this.

731
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And we just have clearly different opinions.

732
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm trying to say mine,

733
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
but then they just say the PCP thinks this.

734
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I think this is like...

735
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't really blame people for doing this.

736
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's like intellectual shorthand.

737
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I feel like that's kind of like...

738
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Our brands are designed to do that

739
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
because it frees up resources to do other things.

740
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Back in the day,

741
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
when you're trying to make sure you don't get mulled

742
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
by a saber-toothed tiger,

743
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you don't really have time to noodle

744
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
on the nuances of everything going on around you.

745
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Our brands are good at picking out patterns really quickly.

746
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And I think that's what happens in situations like this.

747
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's easy to just make a flat association

748
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and roll with it,

749
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
as opposed to sitting there mumbling over.

750
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I completely agree that it's totally reasonable

751
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
that this happens in people's heads.

752
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
But I think as soon as they open their mouth,

753
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
that's when you need to start thinking about it.

754
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's right.

755
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We cannot judge people's thoughts,

756
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but we can 100% judge their actions, and we should.

757
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm not excusing people.

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm just saying I understand why it happens.

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I think 90% of the time it's not maliciously done.

760
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I think people are just not thinking it through.

761
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
When you're tasked with being a trans police officer

762
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and you're on your morning commute to work every day,

763
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
you have to scan every podcast to see which one is transphobic.

764
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And you only have five minutes to do so

765
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in which you're eating crunch bars.

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You're going to make some mistakes and miss files here and there.

767
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I understand.

768
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We get it, guys.

769
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
By the way, I just want to clarify, guys,

770
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it's not like I've said this before,

771
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
but I don't like not care about trans people.

772
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It's that your issues are your own, they're not my issues.

773
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's how I feel.

774
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think that people can't comprehend the idea of a group

775
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that isn't the same.

776
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We're a group of friends.

777
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Most groups of friends don't go under a group

778
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
that is like a brand as well.

779
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So we sit around having meanings deciding

780
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
what opinions we're going to have as the PCP.

781
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I feel like some people imagine

782
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that we all sit in the chat going like,

783
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
oh, hey, everybody, fuck commenters, right?

784
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And then everyone's like, yeah, yeah.

785
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Then we all rally together and we say a chant.

786
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We're like, fuck comments, fuck comments.

787
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because that's what's presented on the show

788
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
is this weird, frat boy, fun atmosphere.

789
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That is interesting.

790
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That's the podcast.

791
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah, we're all total chads and everyone knows it.

792
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
You know what was a fascinating video recently?

793
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Uncle Adams and Anthony Fantano were having

794
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
a bit of a tiff recently.

795
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They got together finally and they kind of just,

796
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
they had a podcast together.

797
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And what was fascinating about that

798
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
was Anthony Fantano is like, he's a big meme guy.

799
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But on this podcast with Uncle Adams,

800
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
he opens up and really says like, yeah, you know,

801
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
like I present myself as a big meme-er,

802
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but I still get like a lot of like really vicious,

803
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
terrible comments.

804
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean, of course,

805
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
he's got like 1.3 million subs and shit.

806
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So he gets like vicious, terrible things

807
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and he's aware of how terrible his comments are.

808
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And like, and he talked about that for a while.

809
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But to some degree, it's his fault.

810
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But like, what he says is that like,

811
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
there's nothing I can do about it.

812
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Because these people, they will just,

813
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
they're here to do this stuff.

814
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And Uncle Adams was making all these points

815
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
about like how toxic his fans were like,

816
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
you know, when Fantano shit on him,

817
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
he got all this hatred and stuff.

818
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And Fantano was just like, yeah, man, you know,

819
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
it's an unfortunate reality.

820
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But what was interesting was how mature

821
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Uncle Adams really was about this.

822
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He was just like, look, people can shit on me

823
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
all they want.

824
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But like, I'm getting death threats calls to my house

825
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and like my family was getting this kind of shit.

826
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And Fantano was just going along with him.

827
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Like this perceived guy who appears to be like a bastion

828
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
of how much he, you know, like doesn't give a fuck

829
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and just memes everything.

830
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He actually, like he deliberately goes out of his way

831
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
to like not address it because that's what they want

832
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
in a situation like that, you know,

833
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
going off in a tangent here,

834
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
but I just thought it was interesting

835
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and irrelevant to this comment discussion.

836
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Even the most meme-y guys out there

837
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
or among the most, they are aware

838
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that comments can be terrible

839
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and that they generally are,

840
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
but they allow them to exist

841
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
because no good comes from like closing them.

842
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Like you got to just let people do what they want

843
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and that's just how it is.

844
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't know if we all agree with that,

845
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that no good comes from it.

846
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, it's not that no good comes from it,

847
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but you know, there's a lot of bad that comes with it.

848
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think in the case of Fantano though,

849
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
part of why his comments are so bad

850
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is that he, for the longest time in his videos,

851
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
was like, you know, leave a comment

852
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
if you have something negative to say to me.

853
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And it's like, well, you're encouraging people

854
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
to leave negative comments at that point.

855
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's true.

856
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And like encouraging the memes to perpetuate themselves

857
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and like every video he makes

858
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
is all the comments are just memes now

859
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and it's the same memes, the same stale memes.

860
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And it's like...

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Pretty good meme video, Fantano,

862
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
but did you have to praise Hitler 50 times?

863
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Exactly.

864
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You know, you see that like every time.

865
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It's always that.

866
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And there are ways to deal with that.

867
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You can just like block some of those people

868
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
or delete some of those comments

869
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
or favorite comments that are good.

870
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Like it's a huge, huge thing

871
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
that you can do for your channel

872
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
is if you hit that heart button next to a comment

873
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that you think is thoughtful and good,

874
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
that'll make it show up at the top of the fucking comment thing

875
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and then everybody will see that like top comment

876
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
is a thoughtful comment, you know?

877
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's interesting.

878
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, I like that.

879
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I haven't thought of that.

880
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
See, that's a positive way to do these sorts of things.

881
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I really like how the weird utilitarianism podcast

882
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
was lost to time

883
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and here we are trying to revive it

884
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and 30, 40 minutes in

885
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
we still have not gotten around

886
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
to even starting to talk about it.

887
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, hey Nate,

888
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
what is weird utilitarianism mean to you anyway?

889
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's get back to it.

890
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Okay, here's the thing guys.

891
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Here's the thing.

892
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I think that was all good.

893
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
We're talking about ideologies here

894
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and all this kind of stuff

895
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and like group think and stuff

896
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and weird utilitarianism,

897
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
as I've come to understand it,

898
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
is the bastion rebelling against all things

899
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
identitarian and bad and gay

900
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and fake and not real.

901
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't think that's what people mean

902
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
when they say weird utilitarianism.

903
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, I've never thought of it that way.

904
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I think you're confused.

905
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm projecting, I'm lying.

906
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I think when people say

907
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
you're weird utilitarianism,

908
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
they mean your drive

909
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
to your belief in bettering humanity

910
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
for the greater good

911
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and your weird and frankly insane belief

912
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
that you can do it through YouTube.

913
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
When did I ever say that I could do it through YouTube?

914
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I've said that I can control it.

915
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Okay, okay.

916
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I actually want to just revisit.

917
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
It's been like 40 minutes now,

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but if we revisit the definition of utilitarianism,

919
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
the thing that I didn't like about that definition

920
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
was they talk about this thing of like,

921
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I mean the little example here

922
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
is people who believe in utilitarianism

923
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
believe that it is all right to kill one person,

924
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
take their organs and distribute them to many.

925
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Or like a utilitarian with the trolley cart problem

926
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
where you've got a train headed to one person

927
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
or headed to five people

928
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and you have the power to flip a switch

929
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
so it'll instead run over one person

930
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and you get a net gain of life.

931
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
These are the sorts of questions

932
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
that are dealt with by this.

933
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You know, I've never understood that real car thing

934
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
because it seems like obviously you kill the one.

935
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Like who would choose otherwise?

936
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Well, but then you're responsible for killing the one.

937
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay, well you're responsible by an action

938
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
for killing four people then.

939
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
There's a moral quandary here about action.

940
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
The idea, yeah, like the responsibility for the death

941
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
is the quandary here.

942
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Is it moral like to kill one person to save a billion?

943
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Like is that moral?

944
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Well, that's your question.

945
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Even I don't necessarily agree.

946
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It seems so obvious to me

947
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because it's obvious to me and that's the way that I think.

948
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay, what if you had to torture a person

949
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
for a thousand years to save a billion people?

950
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
What if you had to do that?

951
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
First of all, it's a huge waste of my fucking time.

952
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, why am I living a thousand years?

953
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, I'd pay someone else to do it, obviously.

954
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
We're using examples here, goddammit.

955
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Are you saying I push a button and it causes somebody

956
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
to suffer a thousand years to save a billion people?

957
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Is that what we're talking about?

958
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Basically.

959
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Are all the people I love in that group of a billion people?

960
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yes, let's say yes.

961
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Okay, then I'm pressing the button.

962
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay, what if it's your dad you have to kill to save everyone?

963
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Ooh.

964
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Does the rest of the family die if I don't torture him

965
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
for a thousand years?

966
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's say you have to kill your family

967
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
to save a billion other people.

968
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
No.

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't care about anybody else outside my family.

970
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay, well see, that's interesting.

971
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I do.

972
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Which of the PCP would I torture for a thousand years

973
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to save a billion people?

974
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Digi, Tom, Mage, Nate.

975
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This is the question.

976
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This is actually utilitarianism discussion.

977
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This is the good stuff.

978
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's like making calculations,

979
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
trying to figure out how to maximize happiness

980
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and health and human life and intelligence

981
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and everything that comes with humans being alive.

982
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I just want to mention that this problem

983
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Vsauce did as part of his

984
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
special YouTube Red series,

985
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but one of the free ones.

986
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Where he set up a situation

987
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
with the train thing

988
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and it was like

989
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
he actually fooled real people

990
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and one of them

991
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
pulled the thing and killed the guy

992
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but it's like this simulation ended

993
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and then they interviewed her

994
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and then everybody else

995
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
was just stunned

996
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and frozen, could not

997
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
even though they were told

998
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
how to press the thing

999
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and it was like

1000
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
it's a good video.

1001
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That sounds fascinating.

1002
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And that's exactly the sort of thing.

1003
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
When you're in the hot seat

1004
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and it is you now

1005
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
let's say forget a button,

1006
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
what if you have to slow,

1007
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the only mechanism is to physically cut

1008
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the throat of the person.

1009
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You have to reach down with a knife

1010
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
and save, but see that's the thing.

1011
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I agree it is a different story.

1012
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
How it affects you as a person

1013
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
is relevant here, but the bigger question

1014
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is it's the amount of

1015
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
suffering that you're calculating here.

1016
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Will this person suffer more

1017
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
than the goodness that will be acquired

1018
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
through saving

1019
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
100 people or whatever.

1020
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The real difficulty with utilitarianism

1021
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and acting it out is because you have to put

1022
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
your own personal values

1023
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and comforts aside.

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The discomfort of

1025
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
cutting someone's throat would override

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the utilitarian value

1027
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of saving a million people.

1028
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This is a great thing.

1029
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Sam Harris has an argument

1030
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
that has been made against him a thousand times

1031
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
by guys like Glenn Greenwald

1032
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and stuff, and it's this.

1033
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Sam makes the case in

1034
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
one of his books, I don't know which one,

1035
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
for ethical uses of torture

1036
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
and a lot of people,

1037
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
a lot of Christians, for example,

1038
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that's obviously ridiculous.

1039
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
No, there's no ethical case for torture.

1040
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Funny that the Christians would be the one

1041
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
bringing that up.

1042
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Of all people.

1043
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But when you think about it,

1044
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
let's say you've got a guy,

1045
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
a Saudi Arabian terrorist

1046
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
or let's say

1047
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
what's the one?

1048
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
A Palestinian terrorist, because Palestine has nukes.

1049
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He's part of them.

1050
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So you've got him here,

1051
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
you've got him locked up, and this man

1052
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
knows the location of a base

1053
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
where his current,

1054
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
like Palestinian terrorists,

1055
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
are preparing a nuke to launch against the United States.

1056
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So let's say Los Angeles,

1057
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
where the technology

1058
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
is such that we won't be able to stop it.

1059
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This man has the information

1060
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and he will not talk.

1061
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Tell me the moral justification

1062
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
for not doing what's ever necessary

1063
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
to get that information out of him

1064
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to save millions, if not billions

1065
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
of people.

1066
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's true.

1067
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That is very true. Slippery slope is real.

1068
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Setting a precedent or something?

1069
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I think it makes a huge difference

1070
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
if you are guaranteed

1071
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
to know that he has that information

1072
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
versus suspect.

1073
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Which is what I think is usually the case.

1074
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
How do we know

1075
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
until we torture them if they know?

1076
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You're not wrong.

1077
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You are not wrong.

1078
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
When the question is,

1079
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
we're talking about saving millions of people.

1080
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's a reasonable thing to bring up.

1081
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How much are you willing to do?

1082
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Are you willing to

1083
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
not give him a cup of coffee

1084
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
when he asks for one?

1085
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Are we willing to torture him on that level?

1086
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'd say people would probably say yes.

1087
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Are we willing to,

1088
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't know,

1089
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
give him an Indian burn.

1090
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
One Indian burn, exactly one.

1091
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Will we go that far? Where is the line?

1092
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Will we do literally nothing to him?

1093
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Are we comfortable with putting him down

1094
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
or are we finally roughing him up

1095
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
a little bit around the edge?

1096
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I think it comes down to what people are comfortable with themselves.

1097
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You're putting yourself in that situation.

1098
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Some people would be more comfortable

1099
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
with going places than others.

1100
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
My thing with utilitarianism

1101
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
is that

1102
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
from a raw intellectual perspective

1103
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I have a hard time arguing against it

1104
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
even in its most extreme cases

1105
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
just because

1106
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
when it comes down to math

1107
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the math adds up.

1108
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's uncomfortable

1109
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and unable to do it as I would be

1110
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
because I'm a sensitive little bitch.

1111
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
At the end of the day

1112
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
if someone needed to murder me

1113
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
to save a million people

1114
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I can understand the math

1115
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
and I have a hard time presenting a rational argument

1116
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
opposing it.

1117
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I feel like a lot of us would be okay

1118
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
with somebody doing the horrible thing

1119
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to save millions, but not us.

1120
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I agree

1121
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that it's hard to argue against

1122
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that making more people happy

1123
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is good, even in an extreme case.

1124
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Intellectually I want to say that

1125
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
probably you should kill that

1126
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
one dude to save that billion.

1127
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But it's

1128
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the putting it into action

1129
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
that is like, well, but how do you know?

1130
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sure, you can be like, well in theory

1131
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
if torturing this one person will save 100 people

1132
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
utilitarianism would say

1133
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that I should do it and probably I should.

1134
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You can't know for sure

1135
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
an outcome like that.

1136
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I mean, when you're talking about a math equation

1137
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you're assuming that

1138
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
all the variables in the equation

1139
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
are accounted for.

1140
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Just because we don't have literal mathematical

1141
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
absolutes doesn't mean that there

1142
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
couldn't be a case.

1143
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What if the one guy who could have got killed

1144
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
was a future Bill Gates

1145
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and was going to save

1146
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
literally billions with his money

1147
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
or millions and the others

1148
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
were worthless.

1149
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I feel like that's an interesting thought experiment

1150
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
but there's no way to account for the future in the present.

1151
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think even with

1152
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the fact that this is

1153
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
even though it's a thought experiment that I understand

1154
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
this is like a black and white cartoon

1155
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
situation like press this button

1156
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
kill one person instantaneously

1157
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
save a billion others

1158
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
obviously this is not an everyday case

1159
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and when you get out of the minute details

1160
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of what would an actual utilitarian

1161
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
philosophy entail in the real

1162
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
actual not thought experiment world

1163
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
it gets more muddy than just

1164
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
here's why.

1165
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is not really what weird utilitarianism is

1166
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I think.

1167
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Let me just respond to his one point there

1168
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
the reason why we have

1169
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
conversations like this is so that

1170
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
because laws have to

1171
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
follow ethics

1172
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
first you have to have the philosophy in place

1173
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and then you build from that in practice

1174
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and then you apply that to the real world

1175
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and that's why we discuss things

1176
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
like this so that we can in our

1177
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
heads understand what is an

1178
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
inappropriate thing to do in a certain situation

1179
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
what isn't so that then we can extrapolate

1180
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
from that.

1181
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm just saying that like

1182
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
we're all saying that like intellectually

1183
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
we would all agree with that

1184
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and I'm sure we all would

1185
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I'm not saying that this is a bad thing

1186
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
as a thought experiment I'm just saying that once you

1187
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
get into the more minute details of everyday life

1188
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it starts to become less just like instantaneously

1189
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
like yeah I cannot

1190
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
well the thing is like when you talk about

1191
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
utilitarianism in a crazy thought experiment

1192
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it's very easy to like understand

1193
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
logistically how it would work

1194
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
but like I don't think utilitarianism holds much value

1195
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
in everyday practice because it's very

1196
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
easy to make utilitarian arguments

1197
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
for everything and like the whole reason we

1198
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
have like morality

1199
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
would break down at that point

1200
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I feel like morality is just kind of like

1201
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
a religion that we all kind of inherently

1202
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
apply to to keep like social structure

1203
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
in place without like any moral

1204
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
commonalities

1205
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in people like everything would break down

1206
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and utilitarianism really doesn't have any morality

1207
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
other than math and like you can fudge the numbers

1208
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
based on how you make the argument

1209
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
no you can't I think that's totally

1210
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
bullshit but I think

1211
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
there's wiggle room to determining what constitutes

1212
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
like creating more happiness

1213
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
versus taking it away

1214
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
we need to get into the fact that this is not what weird utilitarianism is

1215
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
this is what utilitarianism is

1216
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
weird utilitarianism is where

1217
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Nate eats nothing but beans all day

1218
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that is weird utilitarianism

1219
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I was talking about this

1220
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I got to crack open a can

1221
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I love

1222
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
talking about all you guys

1223
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
because you're all such you're all just like

1224
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
perfect like encapsulations

1225
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
of certain ideas you know

1226
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and Nate is a

1227
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Nate as a man who eats beans all the time

1228
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
is like a great example

1229
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
for conversation

1230
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
like oh yeah like my friend Nate I mean that guy eats nothing

1231
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
but beans so that's one way you can live

1232
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
like that's something I say to people

1233
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that's one way you can live if you can call that living

1234
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
that's where we get into the real

1235
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
because okay I was making fun of you the other day

1236
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
to my girlfriend

1237
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
my fiance because of the fact that

1238
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
you

1239
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I was like you know Nate is a big fitness boy

1240
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
but like

1241
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
for the last few years he's been like

1242
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
kind of you know

1243
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
by your own admittance

1244
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
by your own admittance you haven't really been

1245
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
at the gym like everyday

1246
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you haven't like kept maintaining

1247
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
like being perfectly hot

1248
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
but you're still eating nothing but beans

1249
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
like even though

1250
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
you're not like optimizing

1251
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
the

1252
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
serious

1253
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
what you say

1254
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
the facade has been ruined

1255
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I didn't ask for this

1256
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
okay alright go I can take it I can take it

1257
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
throw it at me hit me

1258
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I want it I want I feel the pain

1259
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I'm just saying that

1260
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm just saying that if you're going to eat

1261
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
beans all the time

1262
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
you need to have like all of the weird

1263
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
utilitarian lifestyle beans are good

1264
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
have you eaten a bean they're good

1265
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I like beans alright I've tried

1266
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
a lot of beans dark red kidney beans

1267
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
that's the one that's the one I'm telling you

1268
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I mean in fairness I think it's

1269
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I think it's fine that you're doing

1270
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
like something at all times like

1271
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
you obviously have a good figure

1272
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
like even if you're not like as cut as you want

1273
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
to be you're in the gym all the time you look good

1274
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and obviously if eating

1275
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
beans all the time is contributing to that

1276
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
then that's fine like it's just for me

1277
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
when I'm like oh I'm going to be on a

1278
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
workout and diet routine it's like it has to be

1279
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
everything it has to be like the whole lifestyle

1280
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
because otherwise it's like I can't

1281
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
if I'm not

1282
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
like really going ham into the

1283
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
bean life then like just eating

1284
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
beans every day it's really unsatisfying

1285
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
for an everyday life like how do you reward

1286
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
yourself after you finish like work

1287
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that's that's that's entirely true

1288
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I do reward myself

1289
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
with oranges

1290
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I do not okay this is a meme

1291
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't actually just eat beans all the time

1292
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and in fact I went for quite a while

1293
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
not eating beans for the last I don't know

1294
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
like a month or something I didn't eat beans for lunch

1295
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
there was a reason for that it's because like

1296
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
a girl who did the apartment wasn't accepting

1297
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
beans as the only meal that she eats

1298
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
well I generally eat beans at work

1299
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
like I have a shelf

1300
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
just full of cans of beans at work

1301
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
that I just open up and grab a can

1302
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but it's like

1303
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I left this particular batch in my car

1304
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
in winter and it had frozen and then thawed

1305
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and the thing was then when I had eaten the beans

1306
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
they were like gross and I didn't

1307
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
like they were even more unpleasant

1308
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
than normally they're pretty good

1309
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
but these were pretty grainy and terrible

1310
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
they was looking forward to his daily bean treat

1311
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
but unfortunately he was met with something entirely different

1312
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
this is the thing this is where utilitarianism

1313
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
can bite you in the ass because I am a human being

1314
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and I think you'll like this

1315
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
so I just wasn't eating

1316
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
my beans because

1317
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
they were like this this particular batch had like frozen

1318
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and thawed and was just gross and unpleasant

1319
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and so for like a month

1320
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I kept telling myself I really gotta eat these beans

1321
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
for lunch and I'll fuck it I'll just go get fucking McDonald's

1322
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
or something you should have thrown away those beans

1323
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and just got the beans

1324
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
that is exactly what I did last week

1325
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I finally was like you know what the existence

1326
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
of these beans are literally preventing me from

1327
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
eating beans I need to destroy them

1328
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
and start fresh so I did

1329
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
so I threw them all in the trash and then bought

1330
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
the whole new batch of beans

1331
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and now I'm eating them again and it's much better

1332
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
but see that's what I'm trying to say

1333
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I am a man with many weaknesses

1334
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I go out and I like to preach ideas

1335
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
which I think is valuable but everyone has flaws

1336
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and I admit I'm a man of many many flaws

1337
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I do not stick

1338
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
to my plans all the time

1339
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I have missed on Monday I didn't work out

1340
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and then last week's Monday I missed that as well

1341
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
so I've only been working out twice a week

1342
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
for the last couple of weeks and that's terrible

1343
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
that's a business I've been working out

1344
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
see I'm an embarrassment I'm an embarrassment

1345
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
but I know

1346
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
the right things to do and I'm slowly

1347
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
gearing myself more in that direction

1348
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
like my

1349
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
YouTube success came from

1350
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
a cold hard analysis of like

1351
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
okay what's happening now it's not

1352
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
working out you know marginal success so far

1353
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but I'm working on it

1354
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
what I've been doing up to this point has not been working out

1355
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I have to re-evaluate

1356
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and figure something out and so I just

1357
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
made up me a mafia got that idea

1358
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
in my head just did it it was great

1359
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and now it's been re-cajiggered doing we-agwas and stuff

1360
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and it's more in line with the formula

1361
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm still trying to make the big projects

1362
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
you know whatever

1363
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
but I wanted to bring up

1364
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
oh shit I forgot what I wanted to bring up

1365
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
never mind

1366
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
fucking you just keep going buddy you just go on all day

1367
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about

1368
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
all I'm saying

1369
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
all I'm saying is that with me

1370
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
like I said before I like to start with having

1371
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
the right principles

1372
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
principles are in place so that then

1373
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I personally for my life

1374
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
can then like work on

1375
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
quote-unquote laws or just like strategies

1376
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
that I'm going to employ

1377
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
it was that you were saying

1378
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
how you preach a lot and can't

1379
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
necessarily like you know practice it

1380
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
perfectly and

1381
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I have weaknesses many well you know

1382
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
we're all here on YouTube being like

1383
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
we're here on a soapbox like that's what

1384
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
we're here to do a lot of the times people

1385
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
make fun of me for the fact that like

1386
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
they say something in a video and then totally

1387
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
contradict it later or make another video that

1388
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
contradicts it and do that all the time

1389
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and it's because these are just

1390
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
like these videos are just thoughts

1391
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
they're just ideas they're just

1392
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
here's an idea what if the world's like

1393
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
this you know like idea channel

1394
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
have these people not seen Steven Universe

1395
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
you need to here comes a thought you let it

1396
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
come and then you let it go they need to

1397
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
they need to catch up

1398
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
great great joke Nate good job

1399
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I have no idea what to talk about

1400
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Stefani here comes a thought

1401
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
that might alarm you come on

1402
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
oh fuck you guys none of us understood it

1403
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that was the universe

1404
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I just didn't care

1405
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
hope you enjoyed it okay

1406
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
who else wants to tell me how cool I am

1407
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
let's tell me more

1408
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
utilitarianism sucks because human

1409
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
happiness is worthless

1410
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I sort of agree

1411
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
including weird utilitarianism

1412
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
okay here's the thing I take a totally

1413
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
pragmatic view that I think

1414
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
human happiness is a non-tangible good

1415
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and like I don't

1416
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
actually care about it but what human happiness is important

1417
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
for is that human beings

1418
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
are machines that have a happiness gauge

1419
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and if that dips they become

1420
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
less efficient so it is in our best

1421
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
interest to keep people happy and productive

1422
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I think of it like that

1423
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
to accomplish what ends Nate

1424
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
now you guys are talking about the whole like

1425
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
objective like what's the purpose of life

1426
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
like where are we going what's all about and that's

1427
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that's where I can tell you

1428
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm not asking I just want what do you

1429
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
want humans for

1430
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
but it applies the question

1431
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and that's totally relevant that's the foundation

1432
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
of all this like you have to start a bedrock

1433
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
like where are we going then how

1434
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
do we get there you know assess human nature

1435
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
etc etc okay Starfleet

1436
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
right Starfleet I see

1437
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
yeah oh boy here we go

1438
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Starfleet is the

1439
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
vision of the future that seems

1440
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
like a rational place

1441
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
for human beings to go and I don't think that's necessarily

1442
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
like the end point

1443
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
of where humans go like Starfleet Star Trek

1444
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
is a very transitional phase

1445
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
for humanity even in the show

1446
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
it's a period of exploration not a

1447
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
period of like we're done exploiting

1448
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
like we found everything let's just work run our shit now

1449
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
it's a period of trying to pursue

1450
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
you know the truth that exists

1451
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
outside of the current human perception

1452
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and I think as long as human beings are alive

1453
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
there will always be things for us to discover

1454
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and new stuff I mean just obviously obviously

1455
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
so

1456
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
what Starfleet is to me

1457
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
is an idea of where

1458
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
humans could go sort of in the short

1459
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
term this idea of being a multi-planetary

1460
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
colonizing

1461
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
you know species shout out to my boy

1462
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Elon

1463
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
having space travel you know

1464
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and hopefully developing some sort of space travel

1465
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that allows us to go faster in the speed

1466
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
of light I mean I don't know if that's actually going to

1467
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
happen or if it's practical but that

1468
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
you know without that we are kind of trapped

1469
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
exactly where we are right now in space

1470
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
so hopefully we'll find something out that allows

1471
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
us to do that

1472
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
you know warps and whatnot in Star Trek

1473
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
so I mean to me and like look at the

1474
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
ideas of the people of the world

1475
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
of Star Trek you know there's like the Klingons

1476
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
who have their civilization there's the Romulans

1477
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
there's all those guys but the Federation itself

1478
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
is like the United States and it was made as a

1479
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
metaphor for the United States it's a

1480
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
conglomerate of different

1481
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
allied races of different aliens

1482
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and within the Federation

1483
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
every planet has autonomy over

1484
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
itself kind of self-governance

1485
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and within those states within those

1486
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
systems like on earth right now

1487
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
everyone still can just run their shit however

1488
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
they please the thing that has changed

1489
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
about civilization in Star Trek

1490
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
is that want has been eliminated

1491
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
it is a post-scarcity civilization

1492
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
so what that means is

1493
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
if you wake up if you're born on earth

1494
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
in Starfleet they call it paradise now

1495
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
it's just a paradise because you're born

1496
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
of your parents you know you have your

1497
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
teenage drugs or whatever when you become an adult

1498
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and you say oh you know what I want to open

1499
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
my passion life be a painter

1500
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I want to be a painter and devote myself to that

1501
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
you have infinite resources with which

1502
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
to make that happen you will not be hungry

1503
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
you will be able to do this

1504
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I mean there's probably limitations on space and stuff

1505
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but basically you have everything at your disposal

1506
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
to pursue whatever kind of life

1507
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
you want so right now imagine

1508
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
what would life be like in like the inner city of

1509
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Chicago for example which is you know

1510
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
gang violence all this terrible things are happening

1511
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
if all of a sudden just everyone

1512
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
had everything that like they no longer

1513
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
had to fight for money because there's just

1514
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
everyone's got food what would there even

1515
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
what need would there even be for crime

1516
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
in a civilization like that if you just have what you want

1517
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like the only thing at that point is like power

1518
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and influence which is real

1519
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
which is a real thing you have to account for

1520
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
sociopathy yeah and that kind of stuff

1521
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
too but like we can address those issues

1522
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
but the main one is an economic

1523
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
lever that's been pulled just anything

1524
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you want you now can get

1525
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
for the most part

1526
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and with the advance or with the development

1527
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
of these things called food materializers

1528
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm forgetting the word but like for example

1529
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
with that you can just push a button

1530
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
it makes food out of it it combines

1531
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
subatomic particles that just exist around

1532
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
us all the time it assembles

1533
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the food let's move away from

1534
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Star Trek lore to how it applies

1535
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
to actual what we're talking about here

1536
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
wait wait let me give you some deep

1537
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
on the subject of lore here's some PCP

1538
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
lore for you some true facts

1539
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
almost every single episode that I've

1540
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
been on like in recent

1541
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
months like clockwork around

1542
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
the 55 minute mark when Nate will start

1543
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
ranting about something that I don't think I'm going to have a

1544
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
response to so I'll just get

1545
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
up and go to the bathroom and don't say anything

1546
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and I do it every show at almost the

1547
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
exact same time like

1548
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
55 minutes that's when Nate goes like

1549
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
bam hardcore off the deep end

1550
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and I'm like checking out

1551
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
we have no way to wrangle him he's

1552
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
like a fucking bull like

1553
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
yeah I feel like

1554
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
there's not much that

1555
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
we can talk about because you're

1556
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the thing with the reason this is like

1557
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
a tell me why I'm wrong it's not

1558
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
it's well I mean there's this thing

1559
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
okay it's not about

1560
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
what Star Trek

1561
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
is and why you want it it's the

1562
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
fact that when it comes up in

1563
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
a podcast discussion it doesn't make

1564
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
any sense that's not true

1565
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that is bullshit it makes perfect sense

1566
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
like when it sometimes makes

1567
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
sense but it's like

1568
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you just don't want to hear it

1569
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I don't think makes sense is

1570
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
the right phrase for it

1571
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I think it's more that it's weird that he

1572
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
brings it up in every context

1573
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that like there's my world view

1574
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
god damn it's a found no one else has

1575
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to do that with their world view

1576
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I don't have to bring up that I'm like

1577
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't have to bring up like that

1578
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
everything I do is gonzo and all my

1579
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
values are revolve around gonzo

1580
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
like every time I do a podcast

1581
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
you know oh here we go all right you fucking

1582
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
cunt this is what you were building up to wasn't it

1583
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
no what no I said nothing wrong

1584
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
hashtag Nate did nothing wrong

1585
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
what the fuck this is bullshit

1586
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
when this is what I thought this podcast

1587
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
was supposed to be that's I thought this was

1588
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
the people versus the last

1589
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
time the last time we recorded

1590
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
this podcast yes like hot off

1591
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
the the the the heels

1592
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
of you being weird with

1593
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
utilitarianism recently and

1594
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
we talked about it in that

1595
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I remember we talked about it I don't know

1596
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
what it was that we talked about and I can't

1597
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
think of any examples but it's just

1598
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
the that's the reason it became a meme

1599
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and that's the reason it is now a topic

1600
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
yeah explaining what your world view is

1601
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
like you know you

1602
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
want you want the star fleet

1603
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
to exist it you know

1604
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
it makes sense I don't really know what

1605
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
we can tell what we can say about it

1606
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
beyond I think it's it's because like

1607
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
it's because Nate Nate wants

1608
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
wants star fleet to happen you want

1609
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
you want you what you what you want

1610
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
is from my understanding

1611
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
is what you want is you want to better

1612
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
humanity right humanity has this grand

1613
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
destiny this grand like

1614
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
well I mean I think that we

1615
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
we might we might if we

1616
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
work at it right that's what you want

1617
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
you have this vision is

1618
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
but I I don't mind

1619
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
your vision I'm perfectly okay

1620
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
with you having your word utilitarianism

1621
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
it's just it's funny and it was

1622
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
vision-shaming me right now

1623
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
because you bring it up in topics

1624
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and situations that seem

1625
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
weird which is why it's called weird

1626
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
it's weird you're taking you're taking

1627
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
minute small compact issues that we

1628
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
talk about on the PCP and tying them

1629
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
tangentially into this like whole fate

1630
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
of humankind in the future and I think

1631
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that's where the weird it's alarming

1632
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
the words what does like what's the

1633
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
the future of humanity

1634
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
we're doing like the animals podcast

1635
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and it's like so do we think animals

1636
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
come with us into space when we all leave

1637
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
earth like that's where the discussion

1638
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
is going to go you're asking about

1639
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the morality of how we treat animals

1640
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
which is perfect like how do we treat animals

1641
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't know that's relevant

1642
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I think that you're always arguing how do we treat

1643
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
animals now but how do we treat

1644
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
animals in zero gravity

1645
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
well okay here's something that a

1646
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
DeVu used to give me a lot of shit for

1647
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
whenever we had like political arguments

1648
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
which is that I always argue from an idealistic

1649
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
perspective which means like

1650
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
whatever I want the world like if we're

1651
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
going to move the world in the direction that I

1652
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
think is perfect here's the things we should

1653
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
do and DeVu would always be like yeah but

1654
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
the world is not moving in that direction

1655
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
we need to worry about the issues right now

1656
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and like how we deal with them in the moment

1657
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and so I do think it's funny that

1658
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
like I sometimes feel as though

1659
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
you view every issue from the

1660
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
perspective of like how will we

1661
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
feel about this when Starfleet begins

1662
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
as opposed to like how do we feel about it

1663
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
right now you know you know

1664
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that's I don't even disagree with that

1665
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
to some degree I would argue that I'm a very

1666
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
pragmatic person but when

1667
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
these things come up like yes

1668
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
well for example um like

1669
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I understand the ideas of

1670
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
movements let's say like like black lives matter

1671
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
for example or feminism or any

1672
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
those don't exist in space

1673
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
they do that right now

1674
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I hope not because I hope by then we don't need

1675
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
them to exist but like here's

1676
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
like that's the thing this sort of like

1677
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
identitarianism I think is relevant to this

1678
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
because like any individual

1679
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
issue of this kind like

1680
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think we'll no longer matter

1681
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
if we address the larger issues of

1682
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
like individualism like if our

1683
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
core principle as a civilization is

1684
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
like individualism then it's a complete

1685
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
waste of time to

1686
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
focus on like pushing

1687
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
for you know like quotas

1688
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
in stuff that may or may not be founded

1689
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
on science and you know like

1690
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
women quotas at Google or any of this kind of

1691
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
shit like what I want to do

1692
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
is focus on the topics that will really

1693
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
matter long term and I fully admit

1694
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I am less invested in short term ones

1695
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
that is true that is true

1696
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
it's just funny

1697
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
it's just funny how like if a podcast on the

1698
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
procrastinators goes long enough it will

1699
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
turn into a discussion about

1700
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Starfleet and how all of what

1701
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
we have been talking about will affect

1702
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
like the heart of the issue

1703
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
the kingdom part to me that makes perfect sense

1704
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
it makes sense to me too

1705
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
because like I used to have

1706
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
a gimmick in my writing when I was younger

1707
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
that like every time I wanted to explain something

1708
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I would start from like the beginning of the universe

1709
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
like I always be like oh the big bang

1710
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
happened and therefore

1711
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
eventually this led to humans and because we developed

1712
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
in this way like this is how we evolved

1713
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
this is why we

1714
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
say I'm sorry to each other you know like

1715
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
okay so

1716
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I get coming from that perspective that's why

1717
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I like that that happens on the PCP

1718
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
like but on the other hand

1719
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
it does kind of make a lot of episodes end up

1720
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
with Amy where we kind of go down the same road

1721
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and like the answer to what

1722
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
we're going to do when Starfleet happens is often

1723
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the same and

1724
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I also want to say that

1725
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
we can call it weird

1726
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
utilitarianism but Nate is just any

1727
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Star Trek next generation fan

1728
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
because they all talk like this

1729
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
like if you listen to Mike's The Closet from Red Letter

1730
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Media or Neil X

1731
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
like all these guys who are into TNG

1732
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
all they do is talk about Starfleet and

1733
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
what we can do to get there and shit

1734
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
we're enlightened, we fucking figured it out

1735
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
you're welcome for our wisdom

1736
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the wisdom of watching a television show

1737
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
the wisdom of watching a children's cartoon

1738
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
yeah basically

1739
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
you're all in line by milk

1740
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
no it's incredible

1741
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
you're all in line Tom

1742
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
you're not wrong

1743
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
hey you know MLP

1744
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
MLK

1745
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Junior

1746
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
social importance

1747
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
hey how come there's an MLK

1748
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
there's no MLP

1749
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
wait do you think that we're going to

1750
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
have our whole new enlightenment

1751
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
when MLP TNG comes back

1752
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
and we have the pony version

1753
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
of Captain Picard to Twilight Sparkles

1754
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Captain Perk

1755
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
that's way too easy to imagine

1756
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
like if the current MLP FAM

1757
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
is like the original Star Trek

1758
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
like I could totally imagine them rebooting it

1759
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
with a next generation

1760
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
like in a year or two

1761
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
the next season is the last one

1762
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and they're rebooting people were pissed

1763
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
no way about fucking time

1764
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
that's all I guess

1765
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
it has been a decade I think

1766
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
8 years

1767
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
alright alright

1768
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I think we've discussed what you want

1769
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
out of weird child feminism

1770
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
let's discuss like what we gained

1771
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
around earlier because I think that's

1772
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I don't know are we out of things to say about that particularly

1773
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I mean you can

1774
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
go on you can move on to it at the top

1775
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
what do you want

1776
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
to get us to Starfleet

1777
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
what do you want to do

1778
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
that's the thing people accuse me

1779
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
people accuse me as well

1780
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
of being idealistic when it comes to this

1781
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but like I really

1782
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
that's like getting mad at a philosopher

1783
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
for arguing about philosophy

1784
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and like having a focus on philosophy

1785
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
because like yeah like you can get mad

1786
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
that I keep going

1787
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
back to the same thing but I really

1788
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
approached the world

1789
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
with these thoughts just you know you can ask my fucking

1790
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
girlfriend how I go on these like retarded

1791
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
tangents about like fill out like

1792
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
why the way I'm doing or addressing

1793
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I mean it's because of a philosophical reason like Nate

1794
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
shut the fuck up I don't care just buy the coffee

1795
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I don't care right now

1796
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
about like the fact that like they might have used like

1797
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
immoral means to mine the coffee beans

1798
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that are going to mine from the earth

1799
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
coffee you know deep in the chocolate man

1800
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
let me tell you I made it

1801
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
very clear when I was buying

1802
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
an engagement ring that I was like

1803
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
you know these are all like at the cost

1804
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
of human suffering right like yeah

1805
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
diamonds are you know

1806
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I mean I'll buy you the diamond because

1807
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't want to look like a cheapskate but

1808
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
yeah you know just let you know as long as you

1809
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
know like a lot of black people had died

1810
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
to get this on your we're participating in some

1811
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
fuck like every iPhone every

1812
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
smartphone is made with minerals that come

1813
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
from some fucked up situations everybody

1814
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
so it's good to think about

1815
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
these things I think this is a real thing

1816
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
if we're ever just interesting like ha ha

1817
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
where you want to press do you care about

1818
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
the suffering of people in like

1819
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
countries I mean if so then yeah you should

1820
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
try to be as I don't really

1821
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I try to be like mildly conscious

1822
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
about conscientious about certain

1823
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
things but it really depends on like

1824
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
do I want it like

1825
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
yeah with cigarettes I quit

1826
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
cigarettes for a while after

1827
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
John Oliver episode where he was

1828
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
breaking down just like how fucking evil

1829
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
the cigarette corporations are they like

1830
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Hock this shit two-year-olds in India

1831
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and stuff like that and yeah I was

1832
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
like man that's really bad behavior and I had

1833
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
a pack of camel cigarettes and that was one of the companies that he

1834
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
called out of time and I just threw it in the trash

1835
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and I was like fuck smoking I'm gonna roll

1836
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
my own tobacco

1837
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
quickly realized that like if you

1838
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
his own well if you the thing is

1839
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
you go and like buy a pack of tobacco

1840
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
they're all branded like you just

1841
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
are buying like camel tobacco

1842
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
to roll your own cigarettes with unless

1843
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
well the profit margins lower so you're

1844
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
doing your part you know so at some

1845
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
point I was just like okay

1846
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
like I don't want to support this

1847
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
corporation but I want cigarettes

1848
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and I don't want to have to grow and roll

1849
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
my own and that's why we let these

1850
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
corporations exist in the first place

1851
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
is to rock that's right provide us with

1852
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
the things that we can't you know farm

1853
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
ourselves and like if I was

1854
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
now don't be wrong I would encourage

1855
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
if anybody could to try

1856
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
to compete with these companies and sell

1857
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
some homegrown tobacco and if it was in

1858
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
my town I'd probably go for that instead

1859
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
it probably be better you know probably be a

1860
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
better product and I would encourage

1861
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
people like shop local and

1862
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
don't be mind

1863
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
controlled by the giant

1864
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
corporations like McDonald's

1865
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and fucking Walmart that

1866
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
just create the same building a thousand

1867
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
times so you get used to it so you're just like

1868
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
oh this is what's normal this is what's

1869
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
right you know I shouldn't go to

1870
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
that store that looks a little run down

1871
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that's in my town even though it's like

1872
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
locally owned and operated and the food is amazing

1873
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and it's been around for 20 years and everybody

1874
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
like it looks dingy and Walmart's

1875
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
right there you got to get out of that

1876
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
mindset because like a lot of the your local

1877
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
shit is better some of it's bad

1878
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
some of it I've got a we've got a place

1879
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
we go to called we call sketchmart

1880
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
that will just sell you

1881
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
expired food and

1882
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
they deserve to probably

1883
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
get in trouble wait it's actually called

1884
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
sketchmart no we call it that

1885
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
okay yeah but like well okay

1886
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
is fucking everyone who works there looks like

1887
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
they're in the mob and some of them are like open

1888
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
guys and sometimes we hear conversations

1889
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
like oh when did you get out of jail

1890
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
while we're in there we're like what is

1891
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
it feels like an Italian mafia

1892
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
run a store and I wouldn't be surprised

1893
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
so like just just going back a little bit

1894
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
like I just want to point out that like

1895
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
everyone in the world is a utilitarian

1896
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
when it comes to their smartphone for example

1897
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
because like there are there are conflict

1898
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
minerals in your smartphone if you own

1899
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
one and you definitely do

1900
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
so you are supporting like

1901
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
you know like I don't know like

1902
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
African fucking

1903
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
people getting fucked up in mines and shit

1904
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
for rare minerals that we need from those places

1905
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
in such an infinitesimal

1906
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and roundabout way that's hardly

1907
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
you can't even register it as being

1908
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
if you support well that's exactly

1909
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
you are making a calculation that it is

1910
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
of more value to you to

1911
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
use this cell phone than it is suffering

1912
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
for these people who are being taken advantage of

1913
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
to produce this material you're making that

1914
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
calculation whether you like it or not you're doing it

1915
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
so as long as you're aware

1916
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I think the main reason to get away with it

1917
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
is that most people are unaware

1918
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and nobody wants to be the one

1919
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
who breaks the huge story that kills

1920
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
your advertisers

1921
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I'm aware and we're all aware and we are

1922
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
now guilty of you know

1923
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
facilitating this and we should keep that in mind

1924
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I made a video about why

1925
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
everyone on YouTube needs to like stop

1926
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
talking about Netflix because of the fact that

1927
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
like Netflix owns YouTube

1928
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
right now like they can put out

1929
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
whatever they want and everyone on YouTube is going to talk

1930
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
about it and all the ads on my video

1931
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
were for fucking Netflix

1932
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
because Netflix buys out all the ads based on YouTube

1933
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I can't even the only way I could have controlled that

1934
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
is to turn off the ad revenue

1935
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
but that just means I'm not going to get any ad revenue off this video

1936
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
yeah so fuck that right

1937
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
you know how like

1938
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
that the whole like

1939
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
products have been

1940
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
like the kids in Africa

1941
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
have been killed to make an iPhone

1942
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and all that and you look

1943
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
around at your white privileged life

1944
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
and you're like well I mean

1945
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I guess I've killed hundreds of thousands of people

1946
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
should I just kill myself

1947
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
and end all of this suffering

1948
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
or will it make

1949
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
so much little difference that is basically

1950
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
just like who cares

1951
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I mean the healthy way to think about it I guess would be

1952
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I've consumed all this shit

1953
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I've caused

1954
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm always thinking about like my footprint

1955
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
on the world not like my carbon

1956
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
footprint per se but like my

1957
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
human death toll I guess

1958
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
like how much of what I've consumed could have

1959
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
like the excess that I've consumed

1960
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
rather like not just what's kept me alive

1961
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
but like all the excess consumption

1962
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
all the excess stuff I've bought

1963
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
how many people could have been helped with that

1964
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
with that money or that food

1965
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
but then I have to think well okay

1966
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
whatever I owe the world

1967
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
that's what I now have to pay forward

1968
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
like I have to make stuff that's good enough

1969
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
or I have to help enough people to like

1970
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
make up for this

1971
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
like the eight human lives that I've taken

1972
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
with my YouTube channel

1973
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
um

1974
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
at least

1975
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
618 years

1976
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
of view time

1977
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
at least eight human lives have been

1978
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
spent watching my YouTube videos

1979
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
that is eight people who have died

1980
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
who have lived and died their entire lives

1981
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
just watching my YouTube channel

1982
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
that's an interesting way to think about it

1983
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm not sure I would exactly say it works out that way

1984
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
like people might have just gotten more benefit out of your videos

1985
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
or like I just want to say that like

1986
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
yeah like nobody

1987
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
none of you listening I'm sure

1988
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
give a fucking shit

1989
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
about like I don't know maybe there was

1990
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
people in Ukraine today who got like killed by Russian soldiers

1991
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
during the occupation of Ukraine that's happening

1992
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
uh or you know the part of Ukraine

1993
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
or whatever like do you care

1994
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
no you definitely don't

1995
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
and I like I don't know it's got

1996
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
on shlooshed or whatever the fucking where it is

1997
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
got absorbed

1998
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
um so like

1999
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
so you just get absorbed and nobody's talking about it

2000
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
no no no it was one piece that had been

2001
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
like contested between Ukraine and Russia

2002
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and it is currently under Russian control like they just took it

2003
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and actually the people there kind of wanted it

2004
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
but not everybody did so it's

2005
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
it's a complicated but you know aside from that

2006
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
there's a ton of fucking crazy shit going on in the world

2007
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
like what about

2008
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
what about the fact that Saudi Arabia

2009
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
uh you know like it executes gay people

2010
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
uh it still is

2011
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
absolute monarchy in 2018

2012
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
yeah and it classifies

2013
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
terrorism as terrorism

2014
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that's what it does if you're an atheist in Saudi Arabia

2015
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
you are considered a terrorist for holding that belief

2016
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't think

2017
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the point I'm getting to here

2018
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
the point I'm getting to is that the reason

2019
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that you don't care viewers

2020
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
about any of this shit

2021
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
at least you don't waste any time thinking about it

2022
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
even though the injustices

2023
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
are like incalculable

2024
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and need to be addressed with

2025
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
are need to be addressed in like

2026
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
we would think they need to be addressed

2027
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and people were not designed

2028
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
to live in a global civilization

2029
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
but we do now and we're aware

2030
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
of all the fucked up shit that's happening around the world

2031
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
but we're still tribal

2032
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
that is like we care about the people

2033
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
in our immediate vicinity about the shit we see

2034
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
with our eyes we don't care about the 100,000

2035
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
people that die that get reported on CNN

2036
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and that's because

2037
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
this is human nature

2038
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and human nature is

2039
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
immoral you cannot fall back on

2040
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
it's just human nature that's just how we are

2041
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
there are defects in the system

2042
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
totally to be addressed

2043
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Nate I have a question for you then

2044
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
and I'm not trying to put you in a gotcha

2045
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I'm just kind of curious

2046
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
is that you're talking about Starfleet

2047
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and like you're putting all this value on the future

2048
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
of humanity why are you so willing to pass

2049
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
off the present of humanity

2050
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
because I am a weak tribal human like everybody else

2051
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
so you're just

2052
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
you're hoping future people fix your problem

2053
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
essentially

2054
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
absolutely not I am aware of the problems that exist in the world

2055
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I think that we have to find ways

2056
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
to address them and

2057
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I'm aware that we need magical future

2058
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
technology to make Starfleet real

2059
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
that we have no guarantee will ever exist

2060
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
but we can get closer

2061
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
by doing things like optimizing

2062
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
the rate of

2063
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
production and you know

2064
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I think that what Starfleet is

2065
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
essentially trying to make a human tribe

2066
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
like that's what the show is about

2067
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
is that all of humans

2068
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
even though we're not supposed to

2069
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
be a global community

2070
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
we're not genetically

2071
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
disposed to it

2072
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
but it would be possible if everyone understood each other

2073
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
enough and there was no reason for them to fight

2074
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
you know

2075
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
so that's like the idea and then there's of course

2076
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
they're still fighting though because it turns out there's other tribes

2077
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
out there in the universe

2078
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
even in Starfleet in Deep Space Nine

2079
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
there's a big war against these guys called the Maki

2080
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
they're just humans that settled

2081
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
in this contested area

2082
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and the Kardashians this other alien race

2083
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
like they're just like oh we're taking this back now

2084
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and the Maki

2085
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
we're just like no like this is ours now

2086
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and so like those guys actually started a war

2087
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
against the Federation and the Kardashians

2088
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
so like yeah like obviously

2089
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
these things still happen on like political

2090
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and issues in it

2091
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
do they get fucking destroyed?

2092
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
well they were really sneaky

2093
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
they were really really sneaky but I think they still existed

2094
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
by the end of that series

2095
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
good old fashioned guerrilla warfare even in space

2096
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
pretty much

2097
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
like if they were presented

2098
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
like not everyone has like a radar

2099
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
like oh where are people dying right now

2100
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
there's someone dying in Ukraine right now

2101
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
well I feel sad now

2102
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
if someone were to be alerted to like a news article

2103
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
it wouldn't just be like a blanket

2104
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
just like oh I don't care just look away now

2105
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
people I think most people

2106
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
most people in the comments most people listening

2107
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
will probably feel a little bit bad about it

2108
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
but there's just no

2109
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
practical way that you can

2110
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
that you can make sure that people

2111
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
everywhere don't die

2112
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
well I think it comes down to like a lot of people

2113
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
like it's just like

2114
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
everybody says you want to help people

2115
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
you got to help yourself first

2116
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
capitalism has done more good for the world

2117
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
than any form of socialism or collectivism

2118
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
like even if I said

2119
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
right now like I want to make a difference

2120
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
like I can't even keep my shit straight

2121
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
you know like I'm in no position

2122
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
to help anybody else because I can barely help myself

2123
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and I think the majority of people

2124
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
have that problem

2125
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
that is a burden that humankind

2126
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
should take up

2127
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
and people try it like it is

2128
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
a choice here if we could give up

2129
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
or we could try and we might break under the strain

2130
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
of doing so and I'm not saying like we should

2131
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
nanny state it up what we should do is

2132
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
apply principles across the board

2133
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
that we think will best facilitate us

2134
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
to getting to whatever destiny we choose

2135
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
starting now that's what

2136
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
you know that's really what I think so it's about

2137
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
finding the philosophy that makes the most

2138
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
sense to advance and this is what

2139
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
people argue all the time this is why we have political

2140
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
arguments for these exact reasons

2141
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I personally think that

2142
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
it would be best if we left it up to individuals

2143
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
to flourish on their own and have less state

2144
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
intervention and stuff and just let people do what

2145
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
they want but and I'm willing to hear

2146
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
arguments of all kinds and I do I listen

2147
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
to political stuff all the time different people's

2148
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
views on this stuff but I have come to

2149
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
a conclusion and I think that it's a pretty good

2150
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
one but I'm willing to evolve it at any

2151
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
time and this is

2152
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
not passing things off to the future like

2153
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
if only we had replicators then

2154
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
everything would be great so guys we need to make

2155
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
replicators what are we doing not

2156
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
investing in a replicator technology

2157
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I'm not saying that at all what I'm saying is

2158
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
like let's continue

2159
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
to encourage capitalism

2160
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
because capitalism seems to get

2161
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
results it's got issues that we should

2162
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
work on but we should

2163
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
like continue to champion that because I think

2164
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
it's like the best way to go and then

2165
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
yeah go on much you know they just

2166
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
released a new version of a capital called

2167
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Anarcho Cavals I think we should upgrade to that

2168
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
version so we can get the ball really

2169
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
there's good things and bad things about it you know

2170
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
but I've learned I've heard about it I

2171
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
don't know I've heard about that game I think it's

2172
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
pretty good that's pretty good

2173
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I've been watching the trailers I don't

2174
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
know like talking about all this I don't

2175
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
know whether I have

2176
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
a worldview

2177
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
like like it just

2178
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
even like if I sat down sort of thought to

2179
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
myself well what do I think

2180
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
it would probably just be blank space

2181
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
we're like I don't know

2182
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I think my views are contradictory to one another

2183
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
most of the time and I think that the fact that I

2184
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
am contradictory to myself

2185
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and the fact that I think multiple things

2186
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
is my worldview because

2187
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I'm very against

2188
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
not as a blanket just all the

2189
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
time but I'm very against generally speaking

2190
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
tribalism and them

2191
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
like me versus you

2192
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
well that's a worldview of a sort

2193
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
of a sort yeah there's things I

2194
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
feel

2195
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
such as emotions that's a worldview of

2196
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
a sort said Nate snickering

2197
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
himself

2198
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
you could say that it's kind of broad

2199
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
but I don't care if you die

2200
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
but like I'm thinking

2201
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
about this and I'm realizing

2202
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
right now why people

2203
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
like labels of world they love

2204
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
they can latch on to because if I

2205
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
don't I would need to like

2206
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
like look inside myself and think

2207
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
about every single thing

2208
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
to come up with like a what like I have

2209
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
worldviews on all different types

2210
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
of things

2211
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
like I don't have like a blanket worldview

2212
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and if there was one that would like

2213
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
approximate basically

2214
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
the things I say I would ascribe

2215
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
myself to that because it's easier than

2216
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
trying to think of every single individual thing

2217
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
see that's why

2218
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Tumblr culture like the fucking

2219
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
gloom genders out there and shit you know

2220
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
like people love

2221
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
by the way gloom gender if I remember

2222
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
correctly it was like this is a gender

2223
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
it is like 50% female

2224
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
25% like

2225
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
fucking shadow from

2226
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
like 50% it was Oscar

2227
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and cat it was part cat part

2228
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Oscar and mostly gloom as in

2229
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
depression and sadness

2230
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
this is the gender of this person

2231
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
that was a legendary moment

2232
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I've never seen this before please

2233
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
show it to me

2234
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I don't know if I could find it but like

2235
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
me Ben and Nate we're on a way to

2236
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
like 2014 or whatever and I was just

2237
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
happened to stumble upon this thing and we

2238
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
stopped at a rest station and I'm like guys

2239
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
do you need a mental rest right now do you want to

2240
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
reset your brain for a quick sec check this out

2241
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and we all had a good old chuckle

2242
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
what a legend by the way I searched

2243
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
gloom gender on Urban Dictionary it doesn't

2244
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
even have a definition it's just not

2245
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I feel like that

2246
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I think gloom gender

2247
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
was someone's weird utilitarianism

2248
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
that's exactly what I was gonna say this sound

2249
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
this is gonna sound a little bit hypocritical

2250
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
this is gonna

2251
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
sound a little hypocritical but like what I

2252
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
these people continue to splinter down

2253
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
but they take a thing like

2254
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
gender and they splinter it down

2255
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
into a little special identity

2256
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
that they can latch on to and

2257
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
weird utilitarianism

2258
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
is actually a meme

2259
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
that is not a real

2260
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
thing it doesn't mean anything

2261
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I always thought that the gloom gender thing seemed like it was

2262
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
um

2263
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
not satirical per se but it's intended

2264
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
to be kind of funny

2265
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
the fact that it's like

2266
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
12% oska is your

2267
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
gender and 80% gloom

2268
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
people have lost the plot

2269
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
the whole tumblr was written

2270
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
in this very like

2271
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
childish dialogue that made it hard to

2272
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
determine if it was sincere or not

2273
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I don't think that it's insincere

2274
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I just think that it's intentionally funny

2275
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
like you can

2276
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
is what we have here like a kid just like playing

2277
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
with gender is that what's going on here

2278
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I think that's what's going on in that particular case

2279
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
okay but I mean that's the kind of shit

2280
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
that is literally the kind of shit I would

2281
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
have done like when I was 14

2282
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
it just is factually inaccurate

2283
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
it deserves to be told that they're wrong

2284
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I think that's part of the point is that it's fact

2285
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
like it's just kind of a fuck you

2286
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
to anybody who says you can't be whatever you want

2287
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
but you literally can't be

2288
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
that's not real

2289
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
no I'm fucking 80% gloom bitch

2290
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
well it's not that it's not real

2291
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
because sex and gender are considered

2292
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
two different things by this

2293
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
but saying that you're 12%

2294
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oscar as your fucking

2295
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
gender

2296
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
doesn't make the point it's a deconstruction

2297
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
of what gender is because then gender

2298
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
doesn't really have a clear definition

2299
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
like according to the

2300
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
principles that these people are operating under

2301
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
there's a

2302
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
strong disconnect between the

2303
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
concepts of sex and gender

2304
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
your sex is what gender do I have your genders

2305
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
how do I see myself sort of

2306
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and so I think if this person sees themselves

2307
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
it's like well if gender

2308
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
doesn't matter anyways if saying male female

2309
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
whatever it doesn't actually mean anything

2310
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I might as well just make up my own

2311
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that communicates how I see myself

2312
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
to other people

2313
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
my always weird

2314
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
okay thought to that

2315
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
is like why even hijack the term gender

2316
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
why don't you just like say this is my personality

2317
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
it's just like postmodern art

2318
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
you put it in a museum

2319
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
postmodern art sucks

2320
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I have less than no time

2321
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
to indulge people who want to tell me

2322
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
and I think this podcast is postmodern art

2323
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
well I can't be a part of it anymore

2324
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I have less

2325
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I have less than no time to indulge someone

2326
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
who wants to tell me that their gender is a fictional

2327
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
character I have no time for it

2328
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
it's not worth it

2329
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
it's a very young person's idea

2330
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
of how to deconstruct and

2331
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
subvert this idea

2332
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
the problem is that serious people take this seriously

2333
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and they're like yeah I gotta respect their gender

2334
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I don't know if anybody takes

2335
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I mean I don't think

2336
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it's taking it seriously to say

2337
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I respect your decision to call yourself whatever

2338
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the fuck you want

2339
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
it's not that I'm saying I respect your gender

2340
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I totally agree that you are

2341
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
25% oska it's just call yourself whatever

2342
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
you want what I'm objecting to is the idea

2343
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
that I would ever have to validate

2344
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
someone's opinion of themselves in any way

2345
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
you're still in New York right

2346
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
isn't like on the books right now there's 40 something

2347
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
genders in New York and you could be fine

2348
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I'm not sure

2349
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
what if you think you're fucking dope

2350
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and I think you're fucking shit

2351
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
am I oppressing your world view

2352
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
am I

2353
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I wouldn't say you're oppressing their

2354
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
well okay

2355
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
it's the same shit I'll say that you are

2356
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
but it's not a bad thing

2357
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
everyone's world view should be oppressed

2358
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
because all of us are fucking wrong about everything

2359
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
so we all deserve to be horribly

2360
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
lambasted for our views

2361
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
in fact realistically

2362
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
as human beings

2363
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
we don't even perceive the reality of our

2364
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
universe we live in and we're probably wrong

2365
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
about fucking everything

2366
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
all math probably doesn't even

2367
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
actually work in like the next

2368
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
one dimension up none of it makes sense

2369
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I could go on a thing about that

2370
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
then tell us go on your thing

2371
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I want to hear it

2372
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
math works definitionally because we

2373
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
created it and we

2374
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
created the axioms that it works on

2375
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
maybe did you mean like physics?

2376
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
math is not a thing that we discovered

2377
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
and it works within our own definitions

2378
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I feel like this entire podcast

2379
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
has just been Tom, Nate, and Digi

2380
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
talking endlessly and then

2381
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Hippo, me, and Ben just being disgruntled

2382
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but not really knowing how to express myself

2383
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I don't know

2384
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I don't know

2385
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
this was the intellectuals episode

2386
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
you guys

2387
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm shifting it to disgruntled gender

2388
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
right now

2389
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
the way to solve that

2390
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
for me is to bring up the

2391
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
the previous

2392
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
lost episode of

2393
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
utilitarianism that we did record

2394
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and I posted my audio on Gibb and Take

2395
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
you just play

2396
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
both of those videos at the same time and I'll basically

2397
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
have the same points

2398
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I just realized, Nate

2399
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
you just gave me a great idea for the term

2400
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
gender drifting

2401
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
like if you need to

2402
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
pull off 5 consecutive

2403
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
hair point genders

2404
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
while

2405
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
blasting running in the 90s

2406
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
you're like, oh shit, I gotta be like

2407
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I gotta be a man, a woman, a gloom

2408
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
a fucking vile plume

2409
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
and I gotta be a fucking

2410
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
a ghost by the end of the night

2411
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
and the prom is tomorrow

2412
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
the only way to do it is gender

2413
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
drifting

2414
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
you just stop, you just take your foot off

2415
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
the pedal of the gender

2416
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
and you just like flow through the conversation

2417
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
you know

2418
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
it's funny that you take it that way

2419
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
because I took it to be the opposite

2420
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
gender drifting should be like a slower

2421
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
version of gender fluid

2422
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
where when you're gender fluid

2423
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
there are instances where you're not

2424
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
but when you're gender drifting

2425
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
it's like a percentage based each time

2426
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
you run into the same problem I ran into

2427
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
last time I called something drifting

2428
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
which is that you're thinking of it in terms of

2429
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
like drifting along and I'm thinking of it in terms of

2430
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Tokyo Drift

2431
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
hard core Mario Kart DS drifting

2432
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
you're getting your acceleration

2433
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
you're building up your charge so you can release that and just burst

2434
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
forward to the speed

2435
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
boost forward to the speed of

2436
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
gender

2437
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
in the first season of Initial D

2438
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
there's this gigantic mountain that has five

2439
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
consecutive hair point turns on it

2440
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
and so like the whole show is about

2441
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
how can you tackle this

2442
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
five consecutive hair point turns and the only way to do it is drifting

2443
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
is that the one with the Donkey Kong

2444
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
barrel that shoots you to the top

2445
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
yes

2446
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Mario Kart

2447
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
that's how we're going to build Starfleet because

2448
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
the only thing that travels faster than light is gender

2449
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
we have to build gender

2450
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
oh my god

2451
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
for real though I do respect

2452
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
transgender people

2453
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
with non-traditional gender identities

2454
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
that's cool man

2455
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I have no hatred in my heart

2456
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
don't you think it's sad that we have to make that

2457
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
addendum though

2458
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I feel like the reason

2459
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
everybody has to say that is because he constantly

2460
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
says that he doesn't care about them at all

2461
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
because I don't care about any identities

2462
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
god damn it I'm consistent here

2463
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and also for what it's worth there is like a strong

2464
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
like culture on

2465
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
YouTube of like conservative people

2466
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
who do have a problem with trans

2467
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
people so like I understand why people

2468
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
are like wary why some

2469
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
like for the PCP

2470
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
has like a weirdly large trans audience

2471
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
which is entirely my fault

2472
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it is interesting because I have a really large trans

2473
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
audience but like

2474
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
but I do think

2475
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
that some of those people you know come

2476
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
here and they're like uncomfortable at first

2477
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
because they're like I don't know if these guys

2478
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
would hang out with me if I was

2479
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
there you know because they're afraid that

2480
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
like we're going to treat them

2481
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I will hang out with you but I will laugh at the fact

2482
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
that you call yourself gloom gender

2483
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I would love to hang out with that gloom gender

2484
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I would love to meet them and pick their brain

2485
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
like the thing with

2486
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
the PCP is that

2487
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
we're really really edgy

2488
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
a lot of the time

2489
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
we have no problem

2490
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
we're not the sort of people

2491
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
who would disassociate with a type

2492
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
of person because it's kind of funny

2493
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
what they are to us

2494
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that makes me like them more

2495
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
that they're funny

2496
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
alright do we want to move to questions

2497
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
or do we have more to say about weird utilitarianism

2498
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I feel like we've

2499
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
run the gamut here

2500
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
it has

2501
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
closing points anyone

2502
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
anyone on this thing

2503
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I don't know what happened

2504
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I want to talk briefly

2505
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
about how have you

2506
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
come to the point on your life

2507
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
where you are

2508
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
or at least you claim to be and I'm sure that you are

2509
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
consistent in 100 spin of the facets in your life

2510
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
where everyone can

2511
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
every one of the choices in your life can be

2512
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
whittled back to weird utilitarianism

2513
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
or if it occasionally can't

2514
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
it is an insane bias

2515
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I don't think it's a bias

2516
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
what it is is a consistent application

2517
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
of my current world views

2518
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
that are absolutely subject to change

2519
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
but that's what it is

2520
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it's just for the last, I don't know

2521
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
maybe like three or four years

2522
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I have been like this really seems like the right approach

2523
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
to me and I'm always on the lookout

2524
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
for ways that I might be wrong

2525
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and in fact I'm hearing some critical

2526
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
points like to utilitarianism

2527
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
as a whole like you know there's always the ideas of

2528
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
like you know when you put too much

2529
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
like these guys were memeing about like

2530
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
oh if you're a utilitarianism

2531
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
you have to murder people and steal their organs

2532
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
to save more lives, like that is ridiculous

2533
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
it violates some foundational stuff

2534
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it doesn't make sense, totally bullshit point

2535
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
but I really feel

2536
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I strive in all things

2537
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
to be completely honest

2538
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and fair to all ideas

2539
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
but I do have

2540
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
opinions and I have experiences in my life

2541
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and I have arrived at a place

2542
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
where I really think that like

2543
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
utilitarianism has been shown to work

2544
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
it really works well

2545
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
but it needs some you know regulation

2546
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
like the future presented in Star Trek

2547
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I think is a

2548
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
good vision for where human beings should

2549
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
like keep in mind as a star

2550
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
as a distant star in our mind

2551
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
to head towards and I think like

2552
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
treating things in a utilitarian way

2553
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
generally speaking is like

2554
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
the most moral and

2555
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
to do the most good for the world

2556
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and because of all these things like

2557
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
there's a little silly label on that stuff

2558
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
for my views of weird utilitarianism

2559
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
two points on that

2560
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
first of all what I meant was practically

2561
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
like have you ever sat down and thought

2562
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
like I need to change some opinions of mine

2563
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
or have you warped your philosophy

2564
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
to set your own personal opinions

2565
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
and then second of all

2566
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
if you like you keep

2567
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
like in a way that like this is like a far off thing

2568
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
for Starfleet which probably is

2569
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
but then like

2570
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
then certainly it shouldn't take up this much

2571
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
time of the fucking podcast if it's such a far off

2572
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
distant like pie in the sky thing

2573
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
um okay to your first point

2574
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I am

2575
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
subject every single day to

2576
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
examination of my ideas

2577
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I mean obviously everyone gets attached

2578
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
to their world view to some degree I do not

2579
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
feel I am overly attached to my world view

2580
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
on on these economic ideas

2581
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
in some ways like my

2582
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
like my atheism I am

2583
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
very very convinced that

2584
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I am right on that but I could be corrected

2585
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I could absolutely be correct if there was evidence to the contrary

2586
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
but none is forthcoming

2587
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
but to your other point of is it a

2588
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
utilitarian idea to bring up

2589
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
weird utilitarianism so much in the podcast

2590
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
are we producing the most wealth for the world

2591
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
in doing so is that the most useful use of time

2592
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I don't know we just

2593
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
have to react to market forces and let them

2594
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
dictate whether or not it's the right way to go

2595
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
um and that's it

2596
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I think that I bring it up

2597
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
when it is occurs to me

2598
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
when when something comes occurs to me

2599
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
that's that resonates with my world

2600
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
view on this stuff I bring it up

2601
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
because that's just what this

2602
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
podcast is it's a it's a train of

2603
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
thought well yeah I

2604
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
hope that now that we have made

2605
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
this big uh dump

2606
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
info on your world view

2607
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
it will it will happen less often

2608
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
cannot promise that but

2609
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I hope that if it comes up

2610
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
we can just say I'll just go watch

2611
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
episode 99 and then skip

2612
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
skip you you you edit a lot of these episodes

2613
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
so every time he goes on a weird utilitarianism

2614
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and just cut it out just be like

2615
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
and now go to PCP episode

2616
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
99 to understand what the fuck the

2617
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
15 minutes are you saving three hours

2618
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
of your life instead of doing that instead

2619
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
of doing that please edit this entire podcast

2620
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
into that section of that podcast

2621
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and play it in its entirety that would be

2622
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
ever see seven-hour episodes that's the

2623
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
PCP but every time Nate opens his mouth

2624
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
we play the entire weird

2625
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
utilitarianism exactly

2626
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
exactly someone's gonna do that

2627
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
and they're gonna be the hero of time

2628
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
complete with complete with the 40

2629
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
minutes of not talking about which

2630
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
every time Nate says right while

2631
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
someone else is talking

2632
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
like every time he goes oh right right

2633
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
you have to also put the entire

2634
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
podcast

2635
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
excellent I think I am always right

2636
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
yeah

2637
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
guys I think that we're good

2638
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000

we have

2648
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
from cappy what is the human

2649
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
body lacking a built-in gun

2650
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I

2651
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
immediately thought tentacles

2652
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
like okay

2653
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I don't feel I have enough dicks

2654
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I feel one is

2655
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
not enough women have more than one

2656
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
whole and lots of

2657
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like play like okay the reason

2658
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
tentacle porn is so great is that it's just

2659
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
like it wraps all around her and fills all the

2660
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
holes right sure like and I want to be

2661
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
able to do that I want to be able to wrap

2662
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
around and fill everything all at once

2663
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and not have to like move around and do all that

2664
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
other shit I just want to be like a monster that

2665
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
just I'm just too lazy to bank guys like

2666
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I don't know what to tell you I don't want to move

2667
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I just want to be able to do it you've taken

you

2670
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
just said

2671
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
do you do you think

2672
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
a fucking tentacles should all come

2673
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
from like your groin area like there's

2674
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000

2678
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000

no it's true

2686
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I have no idea who you're talking about

2687
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Billy Harrington I think is his name

2688
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I was saying this to my friends he died

2689
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
100% it's like he was like

2690
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I don't know 40 something and he just died in a

2691
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
car crash that's fucking

2692
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I feel legitimately

2693
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
saddened though I can't believe

2694
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
he's dead how could I

2695
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
reserve this news on the fucking PC

2696
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
probably the person I love that guy

2697
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
probably the saddest death

2698
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
of a gay porn star the world will ever

2699
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
experience besides when you died

2700
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
did you

2701
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
anybody else got anything they think the human

2702
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
oh hey but what were you asking me about the tentacles

2703
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
before I got distracted by the

2704
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
it was saying like would they all come

2705
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
from the groin area or would they be like

2706
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
all over your body I would

2707
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
like a forehead dick oh man

2708
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I don't know like I would always assume

2709
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
that like I maybe said watch too much spider

2710
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
man the tentacles come from like your back

2711
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
yeah that's not that's a good one

2712
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
if it's coming I mean I would just prefer to

2713
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
be like a blob monster made of tentacles

2714
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
you know like or like a tank a lot of

2715
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
type creature that can be a raid

2716
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000

have you are you aware

2719
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
of the tenta bulge

2720
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
no

2721
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000

2722
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000

dicks right that's the troll dick yeah

2724
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
imagine like a

2725
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
giant as I'm sure you're doing

2726
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
but

2727
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
but the clitoris is a tentacle

2728
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
oh

2729
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and it's all slimy and

2730
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
and the and the slime colors

2731
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
based off your of your blood color

2732
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
of course it's not supposed to be tentacles

2733
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that are like a foot long

2734
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
there's no canon like a troll

2735
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
dick but yeah that's what the fan

2736
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
fan them is

2737
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the tentacle is like a foot long

2738
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
because they don't reproduce that way

2739
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
just for it's just for pleasure

2740
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
they're built for pleasure not for speed

2741
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
the the trolls

2742
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
um built for need

2743
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
hey can I can I read a let me read a question

2744
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
wait you gotta answer the fucking

2745
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
we're missing about

2746
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
150 extra pounds of lean

2747
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
body mass just out of the gate

2748
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
we're missing where you just want us to

2749
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
be gorillas

2750
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
that body mass has to come from somewhere

2751
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
and it's gonna come from our brands and it's

2752
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
gonna come from our ability to last without constantly

2753
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
have you have you guys seen that picture of that

2754
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
that like creature that was

2755
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
a human being this is what a human being would have to look like

2756
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
to survive a car crash

2757
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
that's great that's what we're missing

2758
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
we're missing a lot of that stuff

2759
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
look it up right now if you haven't seen that

2760
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
put it in the show notes

2761
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
because I'm not looking up right now but I want to see it later

2762
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I think what we're missing is

2763
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
a hand like directly in the center

2764
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
of our back humans are so

2765
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
front focused it's fucking disgusting

2766
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
there's no back representation

2767
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
in our body and our body mass

2768
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
we need some sort of limb on our back

2769
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
so we can better defend ourselves from back stabs

2770
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
as you all know those are an instant kill

2771
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
and it takes 12 seconds to respawn

2772
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
it'd be like a leg

2773
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and you can kick people like a donkey

2774
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
for anybody who might know this

2775
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
this is him how did we used to sleep

2776
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
how did humans sleep before beds

2777
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
like you would just gather around a fire

2778
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and then take turns I guess

2779
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
you get a bunch of leaves and break

2780
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and grubbly grubs and you just huddle up

2781
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
did you lay on your back

2782
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
did you lay on your back

2783
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
on the ground or just like

2784
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I don't know

2785
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
or whoever posted this

2786
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
what do the breasts add

2787
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
is surviving the car crash

2788
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
so you can nurse yourself back to health

2789
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
with supple milk drinking

2790
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
oh my god this is like a whole thing

2791
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
there's like

2792
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
why is this

2793
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I thought this was going to be like a funny scene

2794
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
human beings would have to be built like

2795
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
to survive a car crash is the idea

2796
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
yeah but why the weird nipples

2797
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
it was originally developed

2798
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
by a car crash

2799
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
thing

2800
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
they published that and it went viral on facebook

2801
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and I think there has since been like

2802
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
further

2803
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
is it like deliberately disgusting

2804
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
to prove a point or something

2805
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
we almost

2806
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
made it a whole podcast without looking at images

2807
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
to piss off people

2808
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
thanks to me

2809
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
thanks to me everyone

2810
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
praise me for that

2811
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
but just in concept it's just this disgusting

2812
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
like bulbous creature

2813
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
a lot of padding around the brain obviously

2814
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
with these big ass thick feet

2815
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
he looks like the juggernaut but if he had

2816
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
under his helmet

2817
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
was shaped like his helmet

2818
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
basically

2819
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
anybody else got answers for that question

2820
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I have a couple answers actually

2821
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I think first of all a tale of some sort

2822
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
to help with balance because I'm horribly clumsy

2823
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
yeah

2824
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
no it's like

2825
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
we're missing a lot of fur and cat ears

2826
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I want to be a neckochon that's what we're missing

2827
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I'm missing the neckochon appeal

2828
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I realized a great one

2829
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
but our eyes need to be large

2830
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
did you would you not want to have real life cat girls

2831
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I mean come on

2832
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
then shut the fuck up

2833
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I think we're missing file conversion

2834
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
in our biological body

2835
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
it takes too long for me to convert files

2836
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I need a body

2837
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I'm literally about to say that we need a USB port

2838
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
like that's a good one

2839
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
you charged my fucking phone

2840
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
transhumanism watch that episode

2841
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
no another thing is

2842
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I was just recently found out that the

2843
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
we only have like 10% of our

2844
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
or 10 or 20% of our

2845
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
the cells in our eyes are good for like acute vision

2846
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
the rest are like really shitty

2847
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and if all of the cells were like

2848
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
the stuff that we could use like acute vision with

2849
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
our brain would have to be like three times its size

2850
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
to accommodate all the visual information

2851
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
so bigger brain or if we could do

2852
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
like the fucking andolites

2853
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
and anamorphes have like the high stocks

2854
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
that can go look behind you

2855
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
so you can look in multiple directions at the same time

2856
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I was gonna say

2857
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I wish we could see a greater range of the electromagnetic spectrum

2858
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
we're so limited

2859
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
it's pathetic

2860
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
we can't even sense microwaves

2861
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
let alone radio waves

2862
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
do I want to sense microwaves all the fucking time

2863
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
like I used a microwave

2864
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
do I want to sense it

2865
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
do I want to fucking feel my body

2866
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
like she just sees them

2867
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
they'd be like a different color

2868
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
and you'd be like oh neat I see there's some microwaves

2869
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't want to see more of the spectrum

2870
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
because I don't want to see in other

2871
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
qualities how bad my art is

2872
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
the limited spectrum I see is bad

2873
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
you know what spectrum I'd love to be able to see

2874
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
is the autism spectrum

2875
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
before I talk to somebody

2876
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
so clever

2877
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
imagine if like those color codes

2878
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
that they had it

2879
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
bad enough about myself I don't need another measure

2880
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
let me take a step back to explain

2881
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
we're missing the UI to just our vision

2882
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
imagine it's fucking Vincent from the Vapors

2883
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
and every time you walk up to someone you can like

2884
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
turn to the rank of autism

2885
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
well remember at BronyCon

2886
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
they had these for the audience

2887
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
who wasn't there which is everyone I guess

2888
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
they had these fucking badges

2889
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
where you could

2890
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
they had like a three color system

2891
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
where it's like if you have green that means

2892
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
you can talk to me if you have yellow

2893
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
or hesitate to talk to me

2894
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
and red means don't talk to me at all

2895
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
and it was like it was literally a system

2896
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
for like the unbelievably

2897
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
large autism population of BronyCon

2898
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
to you know

2899
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
communicate whether they wanted to be spoken to or not

2900
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
or for you to communicate

2901
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
that to them not that they fucking

2902
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
work because like

2903
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
course not but because you just got a glomp

2904
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
sometimes you just got a glomp my dude

2905
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I think we all just need

2906
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
to glomp every now and again

2907
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
get out of our system

2908
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
we build up our glomp receptors

2909
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
we just need to let them burst

2910
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
point being I'd love to be able to see those colors on everybody

2911
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
point being I'd love to glomp

2912
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I think we should have big

2913
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
porphy cheeks like this fish right here

2914
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
because

2915
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
it looks funny and you could

2916
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
you could inhale bigger

2917
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
and you could exhale

2918
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and big face

2919
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
if anybody whose DTF

2920
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
should have like a

2921
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
like a graphic over there

2922
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
you know the quest markers and

2923
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
MMOs like the little exclamation point

2924
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
anybody who's like wants to fuck

2925
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
should have an exclamation point above their head

2926
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
oh wait wait wait

2927
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
that's like

2928
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
what if when you want

2929
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
you want to go at it

2930
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
your skin changes like to be

2931
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
extremely red and then people like oh I know

2932
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I'm sick of accidentally

2933
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
raping all these women who didn't actually want it

2934
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I feel as though a lot of people

2935
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
like the reason that they're afraid

2936
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
this is definitely true for me like part of why

2937
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I could never cold approach girls is like

2938
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I don't know if they want to be spoken to

2939
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
a lot of people see you have to do it to

2940
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
find out at all yeah I just want to

2941
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
so everybody knows here's the right way to

2942
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
assume they don't want to talk to you once you

2943
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
know that then your arm you know it's the worst

2944
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
but still do it anyway

2945
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
of course yeah anyway that's right

2946
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Ben you

2947
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
you are the creator of science

2948
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
you've made physics

2949
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
what would we have to do to the human body

2950
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
to make it be able to see more colors

2951
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I mean

2952
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
more cones and rods yeah we just have to

2953
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
have like a greater like

2954
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I don't know what would have to change in our cones

2955
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and rods they just have to be

2956
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
you know set up to be sensitive

2957
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
to more frequencies

2958
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
just shove a little

2959
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
bumblebee in there and then he'll

2960
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
work it out for you yeah

2961
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
you put bumblebees in your eyes

2962
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
and they will see different colors

2963
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and then they will like type up on the little

2964
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
computer like okay there's

2965
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
we might as well get that

2966
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
and then that gets sent to the brain

2967
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
what part of the eyeball do you think tastes the best

2968
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
enough for this shit let's move on to the next question

2969
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I want the answer to the eyeball that's probably the best

2970
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
here's a question from

2971
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
no there's a question from roo guy

2972
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
he says have you ever pushed yourself to a point

2973
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
where you opened your inner strength

2974
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
what

2975
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I feel as though I've done that like almost

2976
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
every time I do anything physical

2977
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
because I never believe I can do as much as I can

2978
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I climbed the tallest mountain

2979
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
in Virginia one time with my friends and family

2980
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
they were all like

2981
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
workout guys who were swollen like ready

2982
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I showed up you know

2983
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
overweight in pajamas like

2984
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
but I climbed the fucking mountain

2985
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
so you know it took

2986
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
like there's times

2987
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
in school

2988
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
years like where we do like

2989
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
a run round

2990
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
several blocks for like 10 minutes

2991
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
it's like a long run

2992
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and

2993
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
when you get to the end or like near the end

2994
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
you're like I'm gonna die but you gotta

2995
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
look cool so you have to sprint at the end

2996
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
and you always kill yourself but

2997
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
inner strength

2998
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
you can't do it until you see

2999
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
the glory that is sprinting over the end

3000
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
when I was like

3001
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
when I was like a little kid

3002
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I used to wrestle like every single day of my life

3003
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
with my friends

3004
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
with my family

3005
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
with my estranged relatives

3006
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I used to wrestle with fucking everyone

3007
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
and every time I was like pinned to the ground

3008
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
by you know a woman in her 40s

3009
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
or my best friend who was 2 years younger than me

3010
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
I would always think like this is it

3011
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
this is where I fucking die in this playtime of wrestle

3012
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
but then I would like channel

3013
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
my chi and I would like close

3014
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
my eyes and I would start breathing heavily

3015
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
and I would overcome the hate

3016
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and he would remember that he's a 7 foot 5

3017
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
juggernaut and this would destroy them

3018
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
and I would fucking obliterate them completely

3019
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
and I would like scream

3020
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
as I like as I come up from my

3021
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
pin using all of my body force

3022
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
in the world and all of the g-force

3023
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I've been saving up by burning up against my wall

3024
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I've been saving my g-force

3025
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I can fucking release it all in one punch

3026
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
and obliterate them even though he said to not punch each other

3027
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
it was just a wrestling match

3028
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I would do it anyway

3029
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
what a champion

3030
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
that reminds me of the thing I used to do with my brothers

3031
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
where like we would get like all the soft

3032
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
things in the house like all the cushions

3033
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
all the pillows

3034
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
all the duvets all the blankets

3035
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
and then one person

3036
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
usually me because I was the oldest

3037
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
would get covered by all of the stuff

3038
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
and I'd have to like scratch my way out

3039
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
like punch my way out and they would lay on me

3040
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
and then I would be like

3041
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
oh I have no strength left

3042
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
but like right at the end

3043
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I burst forth

3044
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
and I'm alive now

3045
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
and now it's your turn to be fucking suffocated until you're dead

3046
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
dude dude

3047
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and what

3048
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
well here finish your thing

3049
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
no no I'm done

3050
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
my friend who used to wrestle with

3051
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
fucking rocky I'm talking about him

3052
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
we sports fucking shitter

3053
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
like literally

3054
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
we were like the RPG

3055
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I was like all attack and all

3056
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
but I was like super slow

3057
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
and he was lying on attack but he was super fast

3058
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
that was literally it

3059
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
and the way it would work is like once I got him in a pin

3060
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
on him it would be over

3061
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
that would be the end of the game

3062
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
so he had to find ways

3063
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
to like get jabs at me without

3064
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
me being able to like grab him because if I grabbed him

3065
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I could get into like an infinite combo

3066
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
and I would like instantly win the set

3067
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
so like he would have to fucking

3068
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
evade through me

3069
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
but I always fucking got him because he was a fucking bitch

3070
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
fuck you rocky

3071
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I found inner strength

3072
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
while I was working on Mia Maffova

3073
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I definitely physically

3074
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
that was an extremely demanding

3075
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
time and I

3076
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
just persevered

3077
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
there was no one moment of just like

3078
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
you know unlocking something

3079
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
but just the physical fortitude required

3080
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
to get it done despite you know

3081
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I found inner strength working

3082
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
on Brunswick I worked on it like

3083
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
most of every day all day

3084
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
for like most days I worked

3085
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
for most of the day for like an entire month

3086
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and I was like the most

3087
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
focused I've ever been on finishing a thing

3088
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
it's similar to this

3089
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
two for one

3090
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
which are both related to one another

3091
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
for the past couple of days before I came here

3092
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I've been a bit of a boss now hello

3093
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
before I came here I was

3094
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
working on finishing up the vape rent for Ben

3095
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
and I realized two things

3096
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
like most of the day was just me doing the vape rent

3097
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
which was great and it felt good to just

3098
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
like do work all day but I also just

3099
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
realized that like I can

3100
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
just stay up forever

3101
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
like I don't get tired

3102
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
like I get there's like a dip

3103
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
in between like I spent

3104
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
like in the last month in February I had

3105
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
like eight or nine

3106
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
twenty per hour days

3107
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
and it like wasn't hard at all

3108
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
like there would be a dip where I'd normally go to bed

3109
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
that would be kind of hard but after I get over that

3110
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
it's just like really fucking easy

3111
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I would get like

3112
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
kind of tired around

3113
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
ten p.m. and then I would be fine again

3114
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
until maybe like four

3115
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
a.m. or five a.m.

3116
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
yeah exactly exactly been exactly

3117
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
like well over

3118
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
thirty hours for me to like

3119
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
if there's a crunch time that makes sense

3120
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
but you got to sleep some time

3121
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
so it doesn't seem like you're really just making me

3122
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
miss like being young

3123
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
because that's what I did when I was your age

3124
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
was just like not sleep

3125
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
as much as possible like not even so much

3126
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
because it was like super easy to do

3127
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
but just like to me it was

3128
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
the coolest thing to do is like if you can stay up for

3129
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
forty eight hours that's the best possible

3130
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
like night because it just means that you did

3131
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
shit non-stop for two days without

3132
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
like any interruption and especially

3133
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
for me as a kid when I valued

3134
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
weekends so strongly because like

3135
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
my cousin would come over and we watch anime

3136
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
all night and it's like if you pass out you don't

3137
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
get to watch as much anime you know

3138
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
if you pass out you don't get to see every show that comes

3139
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
out it'll swim so you got to be up all night

3140
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
you know and

3141
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
yeah so I got used to doing that

3142
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
but it's a lot harder now

3143
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I think one of the best

3144
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
one of the best times that I

3145
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
pushed myself physically

3146
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
and Digi you were there too

3147
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
the first burning con we hung out

3148
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
we didn't sleep for like three days straight

3149
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
yeah well

3150
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
because we couldn't and because we didn't want to

3151
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
in that order

3152
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
yeah that was definitely

3153
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
almost every con I've been

3154
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
to I've pushed myself physically because it's just

3155
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
up until recently

3156
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
up until the last couple cons I went to

3157
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
because of the fact that I decided

3158
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
first of all I'm an adult now

3159
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
most of the shit at this con is not really exciting

3160
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
to me I'm not going to try to be anywhere in a

3161
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
timely fashion I'm going to make sure I get my fucking sleep

3162
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
in my shower because

3163
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
you know when I was younger it was like no

3164
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
sleep no shower ever

3165
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
always by day three I was like

3166
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
my voice doesn't work anymore and I look like

3167
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
shit and I feel like shit I always want to get the

3168
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
hell out of Baltimore like usually leave

3169
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
like by noon on

3170
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Sunday because I'm like I don't want to fucking be here

3171
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
anymore but you know

3172
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
again now that I'm older it's harder to

3173
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
actually do that and also there's less

3174
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
incentive because like

3175
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I feel like every year sleep

3176
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
means more to me you know

3177
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I understand that's a terrifying development

3178
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
we really need to get on

3179
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I still hate sleep it's still my

3180
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
enemy I would still never do it

3181
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
oh I still hate anime hey but

3182
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
if you guys want to listen to us

3183
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
talk about sleep for a bunch of hours

3184
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
you can go look at the procrastination bonus

3185
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
episode in song yeah five dollars

3186
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I thought you were gonna

3187
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
recommend the sleep podcast

3188
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
but we want the money one though

3189
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
please yeah the money

3190
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
also it's more recent

3191
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
from fucking where

3192
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
oh from Zeno

3193
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
grade in the questions bar

3194
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
if you could completely get away

3195
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
with one crime what would it be robbing a bank

3196
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
that has all the money in the world

3197
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
um then if you buy anything

3198
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
they'll catch um rape next question

3199
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
state enforced homosexuality

3200
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
that would be well that wouldn't

3201
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
be a crime oh shit you're right

3202
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
never mind yeah if I could get

3203
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
away with one I got master

3204
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
plan if I could get away with one crime

3205
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I would illegally pass legislation to make

3206
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
all crime legal

3207
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
oh okay

3208
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
okay illegally yeah but

3209
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
again that we're like dealing with like law here

3210
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
like why not just do that legal

3211
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
why not legally pass the law to make all crime legal

3212
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
because

3213
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
they would say that sounds hard

3214
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
okay whatever

3215
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
my crime would

3216
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
I would somehow make it that

3217
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I have

3218
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
like amnesty from everything

3219
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
so then I can just do whatever I want

3220
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I can like cook the books

3221
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
so anything I do from that point forward

3222
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I can't there's no

3223
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
legal ramifications for my actions

3224
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
all you guys are playing fucking like wishing for three more wishes

3225
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
yeah we are

3226
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I will

3227
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
say my opinion on the internet

3228
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
oh god

3229
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
but I'm so fucking scared

3230
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
that's too far

3231
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I'll get away with it though that's the best deal of all time

3232
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I would take a giant robot

3233
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
and destroy a city with it

3234
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
why

3235
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
because you get to fucking destroy

3236
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
a city in a fucking robot

3237
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
it'd be awesome

3238
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I used to have a fantasy I used to think about this all the time

3239
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
when I was younger that if I ever became like a billionaire

3240
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
this was my plan

3241
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I was gonna own a private island

3242
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and I was gonna own like some kind of

3243
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
mech or giant like some kind of destructive

3244
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
suit of something I could pilot

3245
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
and

3246
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
then just like have a city

3247
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
built on this island

3248
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
that I can destroy and then I just keep

3249
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
rebuilding and destroying the city whenever I feel like it

3250
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
yeah okay

3251
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
fantasy of mine as a kid

3252
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
you just gotta play wretch and plank too

3253
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
did this tie into the fact that you were a god

3254
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
um no I was even

3255
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
probably younger than that when I had this fantasy

3256
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
before you're a god baby

3257
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
you were a malevolent billionaire

3258
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
before I was a whole god

3259
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
back when I was only a half god

3260
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
alright here's another question

3261
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
from OneSpar

3262
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
he says hey guys it's OneSpar

3263
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
the one man

3264
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
who's sparingly on time for questions

3265
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
what are your go-to excuses

3266
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
for being late

3267
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
ah

3268
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Ben, you have the floor

3269
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
um

3270
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I just didn't care enough to show up on time

3271
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
yeah there you go

3272
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
works every time

3273
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
they burst into applause

3274
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
when he trots that one out

3275
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
yeah I'm owning it

3276
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I'm making it look good

3277
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
my go-to excuse will be

3278
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
finding something that I was actually doing

3279
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
that sounds like you're an asshole for making me feel bad about it

3280
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
that's good

3281
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
that's good

3282
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
that's pretty much what it comes down to

3283
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
like I find something that was outside

3284
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
my control and I project

3285
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
the excuse onto that

3286
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
dude there was just so much traffic

3287
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
what could I do

3288
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
my friend Matt really got this down to a science

3289
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
because Matt

3290
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Matt Pat

3291
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
yeah we had

3292
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
he's a whole game theory about it

3293
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
he uh

3294
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
he'd constantly be late for work

3295
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
and so his way around it

3296
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
was that if he realized he was going to be late for work

3297
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
he'd be like I'm just going to be later for work

3298
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
and he would go get donuts for everybody

3299
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
and then he'd bring them in

3300
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
like why are you late? I got everybody donuts

3301
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
everybody was happy and he never got in trouble

3302
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
that's a reasonable idea

3303
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
there should be a podcast

3304
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
with talking Tom and Matt Pat

3305
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
can you imagine the disparagey there

3306
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
the richest man in the world

3307
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
and the poorest man in the world

3308
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
there's some knowledge

3309
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
that can be gleaned from that

3310
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
that would be good I would love that

3311
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
that would be literally the most opposite to

3312
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
tracking the entire thing

3313
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
the most happy positive man who's ever lived

3314
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
you know it's just a theory but he claims it's true

3315
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
and then versus Tom that would be

3316
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
that would be something

3317
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
make it happen guys patreon.com

3318
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
slash me

3319
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
patreon.com

3320
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
slash Tom versus Matt Pat

3321
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
we should get Matt Pat on the PC

3322
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
it's a good idea

3323
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
it's a good idea

3324
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
does anyone else find Matt Pat kind of like

3325
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
kind of adorable

3326
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
no

3327
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
yo what's up guys sorry I haven't made a video in a long time

3328
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
it's the Tom bomb here time for another

3329
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
game excuse

3330
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I don't know he's so like

3331
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
like he's kind of like overly sincere

3332
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
but it's kind of in a way like

3333
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
he doesn't see anything I don't know

3334
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I think he's just like

3335
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I think he's very authentic

3336
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
yeah he's really authentic and he's like he's

3337
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I don't know it's like

3338
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
he's so authentic that I search into optimization

3339
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
sometimes I'm kind of embarrassed for him

3340
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
but then I'm like oh but

3341
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
but you know he's having fun with it

3342
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
I just get

3343
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I stop at the embarrassed thing

3344
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
I love game theories on

3345
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
five nights of fun

3346
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I actually really like them

3347
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I do they're so much better than

3348
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
the game it's the presentation

3349
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I just like it's just not for

3350
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
it's a taste issue it's a taste issue and I just

3351
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
can't sit do how much fucking how

3352
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
repetitive his videos are

3353
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
they could each be half the length

3354
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
we're fucking you guys we're fucking everything

3355
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
up we can't say all this shit because we need to

3356
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
get him on the show okay stop

3357
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I apologize Matt Pat I meant none of it

3358
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I remember Matt Pat responsible for one of

3359
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
the greatest childhood tragedies that ever

3360
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
occurred my entire life what was that

3361
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I was using the family computer like in

3362
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
just like the living room

3363
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
like like and like the way my house was

3364
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
positioned like if my mom were to come out of

3365
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
her bedroom and like look in the living room she could

3366
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
instantly see it was on my screen and one day

3367
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
in like in like the the dead of night

3368
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
aka 10 p.m. she walked

3369
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
out from her bedroom and saw me

3370
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
looking at Matt Pat like

3371
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
like the boobs episode of Game Thea

3372
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
where he called his video game characters boobs

3373
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
nooo

3374
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
and she flew off the handle

3375
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
how old are you at this point one year old

3376
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
yeah I was like eleven

3377
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
boobs involved because that dude puts boobs

3378
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
in like all his shit

3379
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
what is it definitely a boobie man

3380
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
hey

3381
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
would you like to enter a lightning round of

3382
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Radcon 3 hype questions

3383
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
before we wrap up the podcast

3384
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I think that's only fair because the next episode

3385
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
the 100th episode will be in Radcon

3386
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
that's right let's do it

3387
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
alright so here's all the questions we got about

3388
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Radcon we got AJ

3389
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Shoup who asks who's gonna smell

3390
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
the worst at the end of Radcon 3

3391
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
digi

3392
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
wait wait

3393
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
hold the fuck

3394
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
do you

3395
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
okay

3396
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
when Ben saint moved out of my house

3397
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
the room had to be pressure washed

3398
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
for days before it stopped smelling like

3399
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
his body odor

3400
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
my dad literally pressure washed the room twice

3401
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
like all the walls

3402
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I smell great what are you talking about

3403
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
everything had to be cleaned multiple times

3404
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
before it's less lost the scent

3405
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Ben saint

3406
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
well there you go

3407
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
the answer is Ben

3408
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
but Ben will smell no worse

3409
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
at the beginning of Radcon than the end

3410
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
also we will all smell

3411
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
fucking terrible except for Nate

3412
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
who will probably wake up at 5 in the morning

3413
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
and shower at 8

3414
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
we're in a fucking mansion

3415
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
we have showers

3416
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
we're good man

3417
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
it's a big house

3418
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
if you want to understand what Radcon 3 will be like

3419
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
just take the late great

3420
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Billy Harrison's

3421
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
fucking locker room scene

3422
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
or Harrington

3423
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
fucking the locker room scene but instead of

3424
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
there being lockers we are locked inside

3425
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
and the smell permeates the entire building

3426
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
that's what it's like

3427
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
well here's an answer that much he can just say

3428
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
my name immediately and be correct about

3429
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Mr. Tangelo asks

3430
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
who will get the drunkest at Radcon 3

3431
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
digi

3432
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
who else really seriously drinks out of this group

3433
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
yeah I don't think so

3434
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
not as much drunk on life

3435
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
cause that would be me ladies and gentlemen

3436
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
the question is though in the environment

3437
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
of Radcon who could be motivated

3438
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
to drink more perhaps it would begin

3439
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I was gonna say hippos the only person

3440
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
who I could see out drinking me

3441
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
but it would only be once

3442
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
it wouldn't be that he drank more overall

3443
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
it would be that he might at one point get drunker

3444
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
guys do you want to play staves

3445
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Tom could get that too

3446
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
that's when you

3447
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
duct tape your beer cans to each other

3448
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
and the more you drink the longer your wizard staff gets

3449
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
and whoever has the longest wizard staff

3450
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
wins the night

3451
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
oh that's good yes

3452
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
actually no cause I don't want to die

3453
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I will agree before I know what that is

3454
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I just told you what it is

3455
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I don't get it

3456
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
you drink your new beer

3457
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
and you duct tape it to the top of the old beer cans

3458
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
oh those things

3459
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I thought you were talking about duct taping it

3460
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
to the other person and having to drink it

3461
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I do that with orange juice

3462
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I want to play the corona

3463
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I definitely want to play that beer stacking thing

3464
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I've never done that before

3465
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
but I want to

3466
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
here's what I have done though

3467
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
you get two big cans of beers

3468
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
and you duct tape them to your hands

3469
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
and you're not allowed to

3470
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
remove them until you finish

3471
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
beers duct tape your cans

3472
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
we did this with a game of

3473
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
we combined this with a game of 20 questions

3474
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
every time you got a question wrong

3475
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
you had to take a drink

3476
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
because we wanted to be able to use our hands

3477
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
we just stood there

3478
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
me and the guy I was doing this with

3479
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
facing each other and questioning each other

3480
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
until one of us finished our beers enough

3481
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
to get our hands free

3482
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
yeah it's a fun game

3483
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I don't mind the idea of

3484
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
a big drunk party time

3485
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
because I will not drink

3486
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
unless pressure

3487
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I will have a beer

3488
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
and I won't go like I'm gonna get drunk

3489
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
unless that's the point

3490
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
in my life I have drunk the beers

3491
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
and the alcohol laws after this point

3492
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
but recently I like never drink

3493
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
just because it's not around

3494
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
and it's just a waste of time

3495
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
it's the biggest waste of time

3496
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
here's a really important question

3497
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
the other day I went out

3498
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
and we were at dinner

3499
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
it was like a mango teeny

3500
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
and I drank it and I felt

3501
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
swasted after one martini

3502
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
it was

3503
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
it hit me

3504
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
I'm gonna go for alcohol and it's pure

3505
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
swarm and eat pure pieces of wheat

3506
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I'm not the middle man

3507
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I have a very important question

3508
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
if I were to bring weed to Radcon

3509
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
would anyone smoke with me

3510
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I would not

3511
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
nobody would do it

3512
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
because I have smoked weed on a number of occasions

3513
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
and I have never enjoyed the sensation

3514
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
well that's unfortunate

3515
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I have never smoked a weed

3516
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
so I might try one

3517
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I might try it once

3518
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
but I hate the smell

3519
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I know I hate the smell

3520
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I mean I don't care if you bring it

3521
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
for the record

3522
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
it is totally decriminalized in Massachusetts

3523
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
so this would not be like a legal

3524
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
it's all good

3525
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
but I would have to

3526
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
drive it

3527
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
give me that kush

3528
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I mean don't be high the whole time

3529
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
let's talk more about this little shit later

3530
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
one final

3531
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
last Radcon related question

3532
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
from agent MM

3533
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
to those in a relationship

3534
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
what does your significant other think of PCP or Radcon

3535
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
and would they join in

3536
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
I'll answer first

3537
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
my fiance

3538
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
is a huge fan of the PCP

3539
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
excited about Radcon

3540
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
to see what's going to come out of it

3541
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
she has no interest in being a part of the PCP

3542
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
whatsoever

3543
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
because the chemistry

3544
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
of this group is like very

3545
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I mean first of all

3546
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
anyone new joining the PCP

3547
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
is a terrible fucking idea

3548
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
no one should ever join this group again

3549
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
the standards have elevated

3550
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
astronomically

3551
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
the point of this

3552
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
is that it's a long standing group of friends

3553
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
for years

3554
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I mean I could see if say

3555
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
we all move to Boston and we all

3556
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
have our girlfriends with us and everybody becomes

3557
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
best pals I could see them

3558
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
getting involved in some way in the future

3559
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
if we're doing

3560
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
like

3561
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
if you're doing

3562
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
do you not want to have anyone around to do set designs

3563
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
to turn on your cameras to switch your batteries

3564
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
to manage your data

3565
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
to do all the things that I pay a secretary

3566
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
who happens to

3567
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
be my fiance to do

3568
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
but what happens if you break up

3569
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
you got to hire a new guy

3570
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
but

3571
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
when you put your relationship in the middle of your business

3572
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
you're asking for trouble

3573
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I have no interest

3574
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I think that you're going to run into the same trouble

3575
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I actually have a hard opinion on this

3576
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
and I think if you want to use them as a camera man

3577
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I think that's perfectly fine

3578
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
as a camera man

3579
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
if you just want to have them be a tech guy

3580
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
you fucking need those people around

3581
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
it's like with red letter media

3582
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
if you actually see a picture

3583
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
of the whole group

3584
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
there are other people in red letter media who never show up on camera

3585
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
like if you look at a picture of all of them

3586
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
there's people who just run the cameras and stuff

3587
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I believe there is a woman

3588
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
in red letter media

3589
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
she's never in any of the videos

3590
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
the one who's been around in a couple episodes back in the day

3591
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
maybe it might be her

3592
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
because it was that girl who was in the documentary

3593
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I don't know if she's considered a part of the group

3594
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
or if she was tangentially related

3595
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
but I'm pretty sure there's someone

3596
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
there's at least one member of the group

3597
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
who I don't think ever shows up in videos

3598
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
well hey, hey, I'll tell you this

3599
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I have legitimate nightmares

3600
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
about girlfriends getting involved in the PCP

3601
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
legitimate nightmares

3602
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
like do you actually have them at night

3603
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
it's the worst case scenario

3604
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
life has gone to hell because girlfriends

3605
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
have been involved in PCP work

3606
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
it is the worst case scenario to me

3607
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
and let's just say I'm not interested

3608
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
that's how I feel about it

3609
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
if May was ever involved

3610
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
for any reason in the future

3611
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
it would not be a girlfriend involved

3612
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
because we're already engaged

3613
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
same difference

3614
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
the fact that this even comes up

3615
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
is a terrible thing for me

3616
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
this is the wrong questions to be asking

3617
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
this is the last question that anybody had

3618
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
and I want to know what everyone's girlfriends think

3619
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
of the fucking PCP and Radcon

3620
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
if they would be involved

3621
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
if you think so

3622
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
briska thinks you're old

3623
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
fucking game

3624
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I don't know

3625
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
my girlfriend loves the PCP

3626
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
is a fan

3627
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
is a fan of everybody in it

3628
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
patrons most of us

3629
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
she has said that she has no interest

3630
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
in PCP

3631
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
though to be fair

3632
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
after knowing how I felt about it

3633
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
so perhaps her opinion was colored

3634
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
she has made no bones bad

3635
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
that she doesn't want

3636
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
to be involved

3637
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
it's not her thing

3638
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I think that generally

3639
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
are spouses

3640
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
of whatever kind

3641
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
recognize that

3642
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
this group has already

3643
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
anything that tampers with it is already a problem

3644
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
everything we've tried to do

3645
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
has already been a problem

3646
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
so let's not make it any worse

3647
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Michelle was just telling me about

3648
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
the super best friends cast

3649
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
apparently

3650
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
people were coming them and asking them questions

3651
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
we see your girlfriends occasionally

3652
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
why don't you get them involved

3653
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
the guys were like they're not in the show

3654
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
the girls themselves

3655
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
this is coming from Michelle

3656
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
it's a third party thing

3657
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
they said themselves

3658
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
that's their thing

3659
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
they are doing their thing over there

3660
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
it has nothing to do with us

3661
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
if we want to do something with them

3662
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
we can do another project

3663
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
if there is going to be a gigantic

3664
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
hey it's all the PCPs

3665
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and their dates and they're doing a fun

3666
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
whatever like that's fine

3667
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
but they don't need to be a part of the PCP

3668
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
you know

3669
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I feel like

3670
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
you organized this

3671
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
what the hell are you groaning about

3672
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
well that was just a friendship initiative

3673
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
except it was all over twitter

3674
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
it was super publicized

3675
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
it was used as a PCP group activity

3676
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
that groan was on relation to you

3677
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
that groan was in relation to me moving my stomach around

3678
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
okay sure

3679
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
not going down hard on the anti-girlfriend side

3680
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
did you I think it's a funny joke to say

3681
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
haha I think it's fair for me to say

3682
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I am staunchly on the anti-girlfriend side

3683
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
very very much so

3684
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
in terms of them getting involved in the PCP

3685
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I would agree I'm not a fan of

3686
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
anyone new being involved in the PCP

3687
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
but you know what this is kind of an interesting question

3688
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
I've thought about this more as time's gone on

3689
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I think something like what did you did with corrupting your kids

3690
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
like what he did was he's just

3691
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
making new content

3692
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
for people who choose to be involved with it

3693
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
that way you're not putting any pressure

3694
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
on like old people to just like

3695
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
get with the times into your role

3696
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
the college fund was the same thing

3697
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
okay there you go

3698
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
college fund was definitely part of what inspired it

3699
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
but because it was just

3700
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
it was pretty immediate it was like Ben moved in

3701
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
and they immediately had a new channel

3702
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
that had totally different content

3703
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
we had been making it like before I moved in

3704
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
it just didn't get done until after I moved in

3705
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I mean it's always important

3706
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
to keep in mind like if you're an internet content creator

3707
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
you only have so much time to work on stuff

3708
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
so like if your workflow if you start

3709
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
devoting like all your time to this side project

3710
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
obviously that's something to like watch out for

3711
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
but it depends on if like at the same time though

3712
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I think there's a lot of potential

3713
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
in like for instance corrupting your kids

3714
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
for that to end up being a flagship channel

3715
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
well that's perfectly fine

3716
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
but you have to recognize that

3717
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
at the moment you know that's not bringing home

3718
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
the bacon like a main channel digital video

3719
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
that's all that's all be practical that's all I'm saying

3720
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
um yeah

3721
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
interesting question I've certainly thought about that

3722
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
quite a bit you know as I have a gf now

3723
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
and whatnot it's hard not to especially

3724
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
when you're living with your fucking

3725
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
significant other and they're like witnessing

3726
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
all they're sitting there all up in it

3727
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
they're all up in it like listening

3728
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
to the pcp right now

3729
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
while you're performing it

3730
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
and are every time you record

3731
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
so sometimes it's weird but other times

3732
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
it's fine

3733
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
and incidentally uh like

3734
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
just the other day with the the new we Agua

3735
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
had like a thing filmed

3736
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
uh by Michelle who was just around

3737
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
as I filmed my little Hillary section

3738
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I had a music video that was filmed by

3739
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
May yesterday the uh fucking

3740
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
there you go there you go it was great

3741
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
uh was it that uh uh well okay it wasn't

3742
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
but I'm just making a joke uh weed hit spot

3743
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
would you fucking I'm a thang but the weed hit spot

3744
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
no it's very important everyone knows that it's not

3745
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
me and me dude the first thing we thought

3746
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
was like wow did you wow he really did it

3747
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
he really did it this time anybody doesn't know

3748
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
there's literally porn

3749
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
in my youtube in my

3750
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
uh music video for this song

3751
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
which didn't look nearly as apparent

3752
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
when I was editing it like okay

3753
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
because my monitor is so dark

3754
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I thought that this was like really obscured

3755
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
and like uh May couldn't even see

3756
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
she was like oh I don't see anything

3757
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
yeah no when you look at it on a phone it's like

3758
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
way fucking obvious that it's porn

3759
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
and I was just like well I posted porn on youtube

3760
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
now hopefully I don't get my channel

3761
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
deleted on the subject of that song

3762
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
me and Michelle roasted it endlessly

3763
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
for quite a while but but once we just

3764
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
it really got into our heads

3765
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
and now we just say to each other weed hit the spot

3766
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
dude that song is intended to be

3767
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
here's how you need to listen to it

3768
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
if you're in the grocery store

3769
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
and you realize that you are picking up

3770
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
hot dogs but you didn't get buns

3771
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
and you need to go back to get buns

3772
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
and you're gonna haul ass across the whole grocery store

3773
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
weed hit the spot when you're fucking

3774
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
in my thang baby weed

3775
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I want to time my gigantic

3776
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
strides as I leap across

3777
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
the fucking grocery store

3778
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
it's replaced sabotage by Beastie Boys

3779
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
as my run across the grocery store

3780
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
mental song because I used to make a playlist

3781
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
for that I should make a fucking playlist

3782
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
I get most of my cardio done at the grocery store

3783
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
because I forgot hot dog buns

3784
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
and I've only got hot dogs

3785
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
and have to move back for more

3786
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
my diet consists of only hot dogs

3787
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
no buns cause I keep forgetting

3788
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
and I can too I don't have enough

3789
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
music to make it across the store

3790
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
it takes me like 4 minutes and the strong is like

3791
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
we need this playlist

3792
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
