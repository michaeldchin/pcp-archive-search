1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright, you want to just go?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I guess I want to actually...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, um, yeah.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Woooo!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Woooo!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, yeah.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Um, you know what?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now that this podcast has started, let me write down some notes about things I had to talk about this week.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wait, we didn't sync, let's sync quick.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, you're right.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, three, two, one, sync.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sync.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, sorry about that, everyone.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now that the podcast has started and we've sunk on...

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Live on video.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let me write some notes about what I wanted to talk about this week.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Uh, nothing.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's nothing that happened.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nothing has happened except for news of the world.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, god.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't really know what to say about that.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shaving.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's like, uh, news.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This isn't a politics show.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just made an angry tweet at JK Rowling just to make myself feel better.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mm, JK Rowling.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I just thought it was pretty funny.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's pretty funny how, you know, Roe vs. Wade gets revoked.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What is...

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The Shaq meme, uh, uh, trans women exists, you know,

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
fucking real shit for JK Rowling.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, Roe vs. Wade getting revoked.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She doesn't say anything about it for like three days

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
until some trans woman says,

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I bet JK Rowling is a right wing.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
She says, no, I support abortion.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, this trans woman's attacking me.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I support abortion.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Trans women are at it again.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm so under attack right now.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm so...

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm so under attack right now.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm so vulnerable.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Die.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Die, trans.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's what she said.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's what she typed.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I saw her.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
She's so stupid.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I said, no.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I said, no, like the Shaq meme,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
like the giga Shaq meme,

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and the camera panned across my chiseled jaw

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
in black and white.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's what happened.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What else?

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, okay.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, I have three things on my stupid list now.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So that's three more than I had a minute ago.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hell yeah.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Content for our viewers.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I hate our viewers,

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
but I understand that I exist in a constant state

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
of push and pull with them,

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
where they always want to pull the content out of me.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I always want to push the content out of me

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
like I'm taking a shit all over them.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And so I have arrived here at the toilet

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
of our podcast to do the deed.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Anyway, I did go to a protest about that yesterday.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And like usual, I left feeling like,

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
well, if nobody put a brick through any windows,

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
what was the point?

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But, you know, I guess my job was just to be a body

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
swelling the numbers, which I suppose I did.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I did my part, I guess.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There's not really any, I mean, you know,

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
here in Massachusetts, like, you know,

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
everything's fine for the moment.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I guess it's nice to do a protest here

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because they can say, oh yeah, they did one everywhere.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They did one in every major city.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And like, yeah, we did ours.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It wasn't huge.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
At least it got like media coverage.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I remember like, there was a lot of like anti-JK rolling

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
like pro-trans stuff that was going on in London.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And I noticed that the BBC had not made a single article

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
about them at any point, whatever.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's whatsoever, not even like a written article.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No mention whatsoever.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's like nothing.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We needed to smash more windows.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That would have got their attention.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, I thought there was going to, I thought there was going

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to be a follow-up like, but then.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, no, it's just like, if you do a protest

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and nobody pays attention, did it even happen?

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was telling, I was there with, I was there with Steve.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I was telling him like, actually the, you know,

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I went to, I was at this thing and I was at,

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was at, I did a BLM march in 2020.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then I think maybe like the year or the year before that,

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I went to the counter protest for that straight pride parade

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that they did.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And that was way angrier.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That was like, people were fighting the cops.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
People were getting like, cops were like grabbing people

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
out of the crowd and like hauling them away.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
People were blocking the road to like block like the police

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
like motorcycle, a convoys and stuff.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I got maced.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, I didn't personally get maced.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I got second hand maced because someone near me got maced

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
and it got into the air and I got some in my, in my face.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That was way, way more hardcore.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You should have won your steampunk goggles.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know, but I didn't.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Instead, I just looked like a normal fucking idiot.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Someone gave me a bandana while the mace was going

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and they were like, here, cover your mouth.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I was like, thanks.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And I did.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I still have that bandana somewhere.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I saved it.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I thought it was cool.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Anyway, yeah, that was the angriest.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That was way angrier than, than the BLM march.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And it was way angrier than this one by far.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Would you say that angry protests are something you want to go to more of?

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not that I want.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not that I personally want to be the guy putting bricks through windows,

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
but I do want them to happen.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't know.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't want to, I don't want to be the guy doing it.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't want to put myself in any risk.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I would never, I would never, you know, only in a video game.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I never heard a window.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I would never heard a window.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
On the, on the other hand, like, oh, and there was the, there was the mate.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There was also the Mayday march that I think we did like a year ago,

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
like almost exactly a year ago.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And that was like, that was not that big, but it was angry.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And we didn't really do anything, but it was definitely done without permission.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And we definitely were all like going through the streets and blocking the streets.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This, this time there was sort of like a route that was like planned.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That time we were just out there blocking traffic, just walking in the road.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And that was pretty funny.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This was a little more organized.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It was fine.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's the point?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What's the point of all this?

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, you know who, you know who are heroes though?

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are the ones that are, that are out, the ones that are outside, you know,

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
city center in front of the town, you know, city library, like whatever.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The ones who are heroes are the ones that are outside fucking Justice Kavanaugh's house,

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
just like yelling at him all the time.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's, that's what you should be doing.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The ones that Clarence Thomas is like, you shouldn't bully us.

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You shouldn't bully us just because you don't agree with our decision.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You should bully them.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Those people should be throwing bricks and molotovs and stuff.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Those houses should all be burned down.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I, and I appreciate those people who are there providing cover for me to go

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and be the one to do that, I hope.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um, those are the ones doing the real shit in a video game.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mmm, based.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah. Um, so solidarity with those dudes, I guess.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Uh, that was, that was for the most noteworthy thing that I did this week.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, it wasn't yawning at you.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was just, oh no.

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I made a social faux pas.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yawning in your face at whatever you were talking about.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, whatever.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Civil rights or something.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I live in the UK.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This, this doesn't have anything.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They'll never, they'll never get me.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They'll never give me civil rights.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The Supreme Court will never, yeah, yeah, will never curse me with civil rights.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If I never have them, then they can't be taken.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Exactly.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Uh, what, I saw a bunch of, uh, fucking, uh, Immortan Joe, uh, you know,

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
do not become addicted to water.

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do not become addicted to civil rights.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You will resent their absence or whatever.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Uh, good stuff, good stuff.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Really trying to think.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I guess I've walked some.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've walked around because it's nice in spring.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's nice.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's warmish.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It is warmish.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The birds are tweeting.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wow.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Isn't it beautiful?

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You said it.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You, you said.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Time passes and another season is here.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What an interesting topic of conversation.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What a, what a concept.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tell me, tell me more.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I said I was going to, I said I was going to start playing Pokemon Go.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When, uh, frickin, I got a new phone.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And then I, and then I didn't, I haven't, I haven't played it yet.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Kind of meant to.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh no.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's nothing to say.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't do anything new this week.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was, I was, uh, just doing the same old stuff.

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But mostly nothing.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sure.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's, it sucks.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, it doesn't suck.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was having fun, but like, nothing to talk about really.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mm hmm.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mm hmm.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I, um, I reached out to that one artist that draws the big boobs.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, I did see you.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I, you made that tweet.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I got no, I got no response.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't even say what it was.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just said, could I make a business inquiry?

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Which I didn't, didn't get any response from that at all.

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do they not have an email for that?

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Uh, I didn't see one.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't see one anywhere.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Uh, maybe if I looked harder, I could find some other contact info.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mean, I think all they had on their TAPS was just, uh, their Twitter linked, I think.

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then on Twitter, they just had their TAPS linked.

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So I was like, well, I guess they got to contact them here, I guess.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Cause they have not actually posted on TAPS in a while, like a year or more.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Um...

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, I voted in a thing.

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was a local council election.

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, very nice, very nice.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There was a big, um, across the whole UK, the conservatives lost many, many seats.

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Really?

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that's good.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The labor, labor isn't really like, it's like a hollow shell of a party.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
They only seem to exist to be like, we're not as bad as the conservatives.

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So like, there's not that much like interest going on.

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like not enough passion, nobody cares.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Um, but they did win a few seats.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And then the Green Party won a lot of seats.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They like doubled theirs, which is nice.

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I voted for Green.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Double, what's double zero?

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Double six days, like 120 now.

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think, I think in America, there's like one congress member who has like, who's like a third party at this point.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, it wasn't like, and members of parliament, it was like council members.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So like, across the whole bunch of councils.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So like, more numbers means more possible peoples.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We had, um, couple, couple months ago, we had, um, yeah, it was like city council or,

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and I think city legislature and also I think mayor, I think it was mayor of Boston, not, not governor of Massachusetts.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We, we elected Michelle Wu, who seems fine.

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Um, uh, yeah, I think, I don't think there were any third party candidates on the ballot.

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think everyone was a Democrat or Republican, which is whatever.

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's just how it is.

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Um, the, uh, the, um, that was, uh, was that like February?

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't know.

276
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Man, I was looking at, uh, oh, this, this, like this week or very recently, they rescinded all the COVID, like, restrictions and stuff.

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Like, uh, you know, masks on, uh, masks on public transit are no longer mandatory and stuff, which I don't like.

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Uh, most people that I see on buses are still wearing masks, but it's only like, maybe 70% of people are.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Which is like, okay, great.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Uh, yeah, the masks have been like non compulsory for a while now in London.

281
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't really see anybody wearing them.

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They were only, they were only compulsory, like on, like on the tee.

283
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sure.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I mean, that's what I mean.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like on buses and trains, like they haven't been compulsory for a while.

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
They had like, uh, signs up saying, uh, we recommend it, but then those were also gone.

287
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I don't know what's happening now.

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I guess everyone, everyone's acting like, yeah, COVID's over.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yeah, we, we, we just switched, we just switched from compulsory to, uh, recommended.

290
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And, uh, yeah, COVID numbers are kind of going up now, so that's good.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Uh, what is it?

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What is it?

293
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was, um, wait, I was looking at it a second ago.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Damn it.

295
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I just had it up also.

296
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why do I hear someone talking in my fucking kitchen?

297
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I hate them.

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Um, numbers are, numbers are, numbers are, they're, they're climbing.

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They're about now where they were in like, in Massachusetts.

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They're now about where they were in like April of 2020.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They look like they are rising to like January 2021 levels.

302
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hopefully they're, they're, hopefully they're not going to go fucking January 2022 levels.

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I guess in, I guess in March and April of last year, we did have sort of a little second

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
spike, uh, around this time after the big spike in like January.

305
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So maybe we're having that.

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I hope it's not proportional.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't want to get, I don't want to get COVID again.

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Heesh.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Is it even possible to get it?

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I guess it is possible to get it sometime.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What do you mean?

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Duh, duh, dude.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because like this like vaccine, like I remember hearing like when COVID was new, people could

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
get it more than once, but I don't know like post vaccine, whether that's likely anymore.

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's, it's, I mean, it's less likely, but I mean, you can still do it.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I, I think they're rolling out the third booster soon.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I think, no, my, my parents already got the third booster.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know if it's like available for me yet.

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There was a third one.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, there is.

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Uh, I haven't really heard anything about it.

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Uh, man, can't believe I didn't win Vax millions.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, three COVID-19 vaccines are authorized or approved for use in the United States.

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are authors for use, but are they authorized for everyone?

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Can I get my third?

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Who is in my kitchen?

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who is in my fucking kitchen?

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's COVID.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They're in your kitchen.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's my fucking property manager or something.

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Um, there's a booster free, second booster, the fucking mass.gov info details.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Give the details for the first and second boost.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They don't mention the third one.

336
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's frustrating.

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll have to look into this later.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Whatever.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I should get one point.

341
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I won't want to get it.

342
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Uh, it's, oh, it's Mother's Day today.

343
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Not for me.

344
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That was a few months ago.

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah.

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
For me, it is, uh, I guess, I don't know.

347
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I was thinking yesterday I called home.

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was going to ask, like, should I come like eat dinner or something?

349
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Cause like I can make the trip.

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm really tired today and I kind of hope maybe they're doing something.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Maybe they're busy and they don't want me to come.

352
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I kind of don't want to.

353
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And I just want to sleep all day.

354
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Um, but, uh, I don't know.

355
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll call later and I guess we'll, we'll see what they tell me to do.

356
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll just do whatever they fucking tell me to do.

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Just like being a kid.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's what Mother's Day is all about.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That is a lot.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's exactly right.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh my God.

362
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I hear you.

363
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hear it.

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's the same guy, same guy who yesterday, I think.

365
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The last week you could maybe hear him yelling from the balcony upstairs.

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think he's the guy who's doing some shit in my kitchen right now.

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, it makes me so uncomfortable.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, I don't want some fucking townie hearing me podcast.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's so embarrassing.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That would be the worst.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Not just that they, like, maybe they, maybe you could just say, oh, I'm on a zoom meeting.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Go away.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
At least they know what that means.

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Zoomers know what zoom is.

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
God bless them.

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I've been, I've been continuing, I've been continuing to refine my gummy experiments.

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I had a, yeah, I had a pretty successful batch.

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The, the, okay, so far.

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I think I would say my most successful recipe here.

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let me, let me tell you what it is so far.

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is two, two tablespoons of water.

382
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To that add three sheets of gelatin.

383
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Melt that in the pan.

384
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Add to that a pack of a cup full of a mixture of two tablespoons corn fiber,

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
one half of a pack of sure gel pectin mixture,

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
one eighth of a teaspoon of malic acid,

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and two dashes of stevia.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Add, add to that like a small dash of flavoring and some food coloring if you like.

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Boil it in the pan for a few minutes and then transfer it to gummy molds and then refrigerate.

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That was what I did.

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That was, that's the one, that's the one that had the best results thus far.

392
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But I, and then I, then I tried it with, I tried it with half the water and it didn't work at all.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I feel like if I could reduce the water a little bit, it would be better,

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but you can't reduce it too much or else it just, it just doesn't work.

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I could, I think if I, if I reduce the fiber, that would help, but like the fiber really makes it,

396
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the fiber really like keeps, keeps it like unsolid, which is, which is good and bad.

397
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If it's like, I kind of, I don't like it to be too solid, but if obviously it doesn't hold together if it's not solid enough.

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The one, the one with the half, the one with the half water, it was like, it just didn't, it didn't come together with solid.

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It was, it remained a paste, but it was like, it was a delicious paste.

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was like a delicious chewy paste with like a great texture to it.

401
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So I'm going to try and do it with like, okay, instead of half the water, I'll do three quarters water.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like, like a spreadable, like on toast, you could have that.

403
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, I put it, well, it might just be that I put in, I put my favorite flavor in the half water mixture,

404
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
which is passion fruit, by the way.

405
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The passion fruit flavor additive that I have is by far the best one.

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Watermelon is pretty good.

407
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Guava is good, but passion fruit, just forget about it.

408
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Rose is also pretty good.

409
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So I've made like, in the last two weeks, I've made like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

410
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I've done, I've done like 14 different recipes.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That was the one.

412
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I've tried it with corn syrup.

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Actually, I tried, a previous recipe I tried included corn syrup and actually that was probably like the second most successful one.

414
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Then I tried duplicating that recipe, but I replaced the corn syrup with white sugar, because there's a type of candy called patefui,

415
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
which is just sugar and pectin, basically.

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So I was like, okay, what if I tried to do like a half and half between gummy candy and patefui.

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And for that, I would basically be like use, it would basically be patefui with gelatin, because patefui doesn't have any gelatin,

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
but like gummies do, so just add some gelatin.

419
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So I replaced the corn fiber with white sugar, like you would for that.

420
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I thought, you know, white sugar, oh my God, someone's vacuumed my kitchen.

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh my God.

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, I can hear that.

423
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Jesus.

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
All right, it's fine.

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll just, I'll just continue.

426
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So anyway, as I was saying, fucking, what was I saying?

427
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You're combining with the white sugar.

428
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Gelatin, gelatin, the white sugar.

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I thought, okay, obviously if I replace the corn fiber, or if I replace the corn syrup with white sugar,

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that's replacing a liquid sugar with a solid one.

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So like you would think that obviously then the result would be a drier and more solid final product.

432
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But no, it wasn't.

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Let me consult my notes here.

434
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Was it the opposite? Was it more liquidy?

435
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It was not, it was, it was, it was not liquid.

436
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It was more, it was more of a gel.

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah, it ended up as more of a gel and less of a like solid.

438
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah.

439
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I, you know, you know what?

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I wonder if maybe it was because for the same reason that reducing the water made it less of a paste as it didn't hold together as well.

441
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Maybe it's because the corn syrup contained water and that extra water gave it more bind.

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And, and replacing it with white sugar meant less water, meant less bind for the gelatin.

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know, that's just a theory.

444
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Maybe.

445
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I really thought, man, I really thought, I really thought the corn syrup was going to like give me like a really great consistency,

446
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but it has not really added much.

447
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And, you know, and the white sugar also didn't, I really thought that go using the white sugar and boiling it longer would give more of like a chewy gummy pot if we texture.

448
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But it really hasn't.

449
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And so I'm kind of thinking maybe I should just stop even trying with corn syrup and sugar because my goal here is to have,

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
if I can have these be lower calorie, lower carb, I would like that.

451
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And if sugar and corn syrup are not even improving the consistency, why am I even bothering with them if I could just leave them out entirely?

452
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's better.

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So I think I'm just going to like not even fuck with them until I get what I, what I consider to be a perfect recipe without them,

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
which so far, the one I just, the one I described a moment ago, is that I'm going to, I'm going to tweak it a little more.

455
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And then maybe I can take that as a base and start like, you know, add, maybe I can experiment with sugar and corn syrup and see if I can move on from there.

456
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Who comes into my fucking, who comes into my fucking house and vacuums in my kitchen when I'm podcasting?

457
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You should know that I'm podcasting.

458
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Doesn't he listen to the procrastinators podcast?

459
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Doesn't he know that we record at 10 a.m. on Sunday?

460
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Maybe they can't hear because of all the vacuuming they're doing.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They always, they always listen while they're vacuuming at 10 a.m. on Sunday.

462
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What is it with people doing loud things on the weekends?

463
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's a consistent thing across all society and I don't get it.

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Always with the loud gardening, the loud something, the loud cleaning.

465
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Just live in filth.

466
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Nice, quiet filth.

467
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I wish, I wish.

468
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Oh my God.

469
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm so mad.

470
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm so mad.

471
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I should probably just get over it.

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I feel, I feel, I feel violated.

473
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Yeah, I can imagine.

474
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This has never happened before.

475
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Well, you feel like the sanctity of the procrastinators podcast recording session is being violated.

476
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely I do.

477
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is like church on Sunday morning.

478
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Some people go to church.

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I go to discord to record a podcast.

480
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh, is our leave all this in?

481
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
No, don't leave it in.

482
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Cut out, I mean, cut out, I guess, most of it, some of it, much of it.

483
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Cut out the whole episode.

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah.

485
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm mostly just perplexed who is coming into my kitchen and vacuuming.

486
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Would it be the landlady?

487
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's not the landlady.

488
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And it's actually, it's not the property manager, but it might be one of his goons because he has a couple of goons.

489
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Maybe they're trying to get all the bugs.

490
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, I hope somebody's got that.

491
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Well, I guess if there is a thing to talk about, I've been dealing with too many projects syndrome.

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I've been dealing with having so many potential things I could be doing at any given time that I just don't know what to do, what to spend time on.

493
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's like, there's like, I mean, you know how it is, you got your things that are to be finished, and then you have new ideas and you want to try those.

494
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No, I don't have new ideas, no.

495
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Wow, what does the new idea I have?

496
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That would be something.

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I think I was having ideas for like video things.

498
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Like, you know, those, those video game challenge runs people do is like, can you do X video game?

499
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You know, I've been, I've been seeing a lot of those. Yeah.

500
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They're, they're just sort of really fun, except when they're about like Elden Ring, it's like, can you beat Elden Ring without using a sword?

501
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, of course you can.

502
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It's like, you can do anything in Elden Ring.

503
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Obviously, sometimes it's like, sometimes the answer is just obviously yes.

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

505
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah.

506
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And then there's more interesting ones like, you know, can you beat Rayman without using your hover ability?

507
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I saw, I watched that one.

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, this is a pretty good one.

509
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I think I watched every, every challenge run on that guy's channel.

510
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I feel like I want to do one. I want to do a challenge run. I play video games.

511
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It does, it does seem fun. I don't know.

512
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think I've even talked about this before.

513
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Like, I just really want to do a challenge run.

514
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But like, wow, what? Huh?

515
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

516
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And then I get distracted by all the things that I said I was going to do.

517
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I was like, I gotta go.

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I best do this thing.

519
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, I best do that thing.

520
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then new idea just fades into the background until I think about it again.

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And I'm like, oh, you know, I should do that.

522
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Just a constant cycle of like, oh yeah, maybe I should do this.

523
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Well, I, well, I made myself a little, a little to do list that I've been checking steps off of.

524
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
They are all, they are all related to, they are all related to getting the book finished.

525
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I didn't, I didn't do it.

526
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The last two days I should have been working on that stuff.

527
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I haven't really gotten anything done the last two days,

528
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
but I have checked a bunch of things off the list.

529
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For instance, I printed off from my print, my printer.

530
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I printed off physical, like shitty draft, black and white drafts of the pages.

531
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I put them in a three-ring binder.

532
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I bought a three-ring binder so that I could print pages to put them in

533
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
so that I could move them around and arrange them to my satisfaction

534
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
to get like a page order and like, you know, where should I insert an extra blank page

535
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
because like maybe I want like this page or that page to be on the left or the right side,

536
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you know, when you're actually holding the book in your hands.

537
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I've been doing that.

538
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I've been, I was supposed to write more footnotes,

539
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
but I only wrote like one more page of them yesterday, which is disappointing.

540
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I've only got six pages of them, and I'm only on like page 40.

541
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm on like page 42 of like 200 or something.

542
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So that's going, so I have to get all that done

543
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
before I place orders with like companies that get sample copies made.

544
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So I have not been getting distracted with new ideas.

545
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I just, just the old fucking shit is there's a lot.

546
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
There's just a lot of steps involved and it's taken a long time, but it's good.

547
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I think the reason I'm in this state right now is because the major thing,

548
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the things that it was like eating up my time was getting the punk and alley demo out

549
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and sending the Lord of Ghost books, which are now complete on my part.

550
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I've sent them out to everybody who I could get their address from.

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And there's a few like returns that I have to like resend because of some bullshit.

552
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Costumes.

553
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I got like a return envelope of the thing and they've really fucked it up.

554
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And it was like, it was like they made an entire other envelope with sellotape,

555
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
sellotaping it back up.

556
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Like the original envelope I used just to haunt to shreds.

557
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I was like, God, I wonder how many other ones of those are like in terrible condition when they arrive.

558
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So that's not good, but hopefully people will have those.

559
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And the pumpkin alley demo is like, okay, gaming stuff that's going to be worked on.

560
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's going to take a while.

561
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah.

562
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And so I'm like, okay, I could spend time on many different other projects,

563
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
mostly probably clerse a gun smoke and some other things.

564
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm like, I died.

565
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You know, this is good actually.

566
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Actually one of the major, well not one, I mean, one factor that has kind of pushed me to like stay on track

567
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
for the whole book thing is that I know that you were planning to kickstart the pumpkin alley.

568
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And I really want to get my book kickstarted before you do that.

569
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So I've been trying to like, I don't know if it's possible,

570
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
but I've been kind of hoping that I can get like the book like ready to like ready to print maybe like this month.

571
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I don't know if that's doable, but that's kind of what I'm shooting for.

572
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And maybe like, and maybe launch the Kickstarter like next month.

573
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You know, that's my optimistic hope.

574
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I think a lot of what I'm like struggling with is the fact that I'm flying in like a week.

575
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm going to go, I'm going to be in Boston.

576
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Two weeks.

577
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
In two weeks.

578
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, like in a week, it'll be like three days until I fly or something.

579
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh, wow.

580
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Wow.

581
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

582
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's really fucking coming up, huh?

583
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah.

584
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So I've got, I'm like, all right, I got to set some things in order to do some stuff,

585
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but not like do too much that is like.

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yeah.

587
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You know how like, I don't want to leave a lot of things hanging when I leave.

588
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I understand.

589
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So I don't want to do nothing for a week either.

590
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So I'm like, I got to choose something.

591
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I got to pick something.

592
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Yeah.

593
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But you don't want to start anything.

594
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah.

595
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You don't want to, you don't want to start anything that you'll leave unfinished for.

596
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You're here for like a week or no.

597
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
About a week.

598
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah.

599
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
A little over a week.

600
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Shit.

601
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That just makes me, I get a, man, I like actually that guy, that guy, that thing, that thing

602
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
that I told you about, I guess what, what some have referred to as my new secret project,

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
which I hate to call that because it's not going to be a long thing that is a secret

604
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
for a long time, like the previous one.

605
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I left that guy hanging for like a, almost a week.

606
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And then I finally got back to him two days ago.

607
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And then he finally got back to me yesterday, but I didn't get back to him.

608
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So I got to get back to him.

609
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I think maybe right after, like maybe right after this, because I actually got to get in

610
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
touch with that guy like soon.

611
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And then I got to go see that guy.

612
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Because then, you know, what with you coming to visit the timetable on that is a window,

613
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
the walls are closing in.

614
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It should be okay.

615
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I was thinking about that yesterday.

616
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Actually yesterday I was feeling, and this is really stupid.

617
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yesterday I was feeling like, Oh God, I could record the podcast tomorrow.

618
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, I can't do anything today.

619
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So I just played Noida.

620
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And so I just played Noida and it's, and I hate it.

621
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I hate Noida.

622
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It sucks.

623
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's a nightmare.

624
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Waste of time.

625
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Wait, you said I have to do the podcast tomorrow.

626
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I can't do anything today, like yesterday.

627
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I mean, it not, I didn't say it like that, but that's kind of how I felt.

628
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

629
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Like, like in order to be prepared for a podcast the following morning, I can't even lift a finger.

630
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Well, it wasn't, it wasn't just that the, it was partially that, oh, I got to do the podcast in the morning.

631
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And then it's Mother's Day.

632
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And what if my parents, what if, what if they tell me to come visit in the afternoon and then that's my whole day gone, you know.

633
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So I got to get my noise in right now and see you.

634
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's like, it's like, I look at, I look at my watch and I'm like, damn, it, I woke up.

635
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's noon today.

636
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The podcast is at 10am tomorrow.

637
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's less than 24 hours.

638
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Like, I can't do any, I can't, I can't do any work today.

639
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I can't do any writing.

640
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Fucked.

641
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
You know, sometimes I'm, you know, this is a trap that I fall into and I fell into it yesterday and I didn't, I didn't get nothing.

642
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I did, I wrote like a page yesterday, which is not as much as I would look like, but oh well.

643
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Anyway, yeah.

644
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But I was thinking about that thing, the thing that we got to do, the thing I got to do soon that I've been talking to that guy about.

645
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I was like, you know, there's, I just got to not like worry about being too prepared for it because you know, you, you know how it goes.

646
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And you kind of just got to fly by the cedar pants.

647
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You kind of just got to, you kind of just got to fly and not worry about it.

648
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And when you show up and do it and when, when you do it, it's just kind of, it's going to shake out how it shakes out.

649
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know what I'm saying?

650
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I do.

651
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Audience, sorry to be vague, but you'll, you'll see.

652
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You'll see in hopefully not even that long because I think, I think, I think the, I think the, the, the unless something catastrophic happens and the whole thing fails for some reason.

653
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
If the whole thing fails, shall we just say what it was?

654
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I mean, yeah, if it fails, I'll say, I'll tell people what it was going to be and why it failed.

655
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But I don't think it'll fail and I don't see any reason why it would.

656
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And if it doesn't fail, I feel like probably by next month, probably sometime next month, people would know what it was.

657
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And then I can be like, okay, but I don't want to say, I don't want to say what it is just yet.

658
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Because if I say what it is, then I'll, I don't know.

659
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Nothing, nothing bad will happen.

660
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's a hardcore pornography.

661
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Literally, literally nothing bad will happen if I, if I, if I say what it is, but I don't want to anyway.

662
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't know.

663
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't know why I do the things that I do.

664
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You just love being a secret project, Haver.

665
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, but I told, I told people you, you kept Pumpkin Alley a secret.

666
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I didn't, I did not keep Phantom's Revenge, I kept Phantom's Revenge a secret until it was like halfway done.

667
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then I told everyone, I guess it was released the demo.

668
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I mean, I guess I know why I did that, but like, in hindsight, I kind of wish that I had not told anyone about it.

669
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
No, I couldn't because I had released it on Patreon.

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You know what I should have done is I should have not told anyone about it except for people on Patreon.

671
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think that probably would have gotten me more patrons.

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
But oh well, what can you do?

673
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know which was the best way to do it.

674
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I feel like there's, there's pros and cons.

675
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Like if I had been talking about Pumpkin Alley the whole time, maybe more people would have learned about it and been anticipating it.

676
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Maybe.

677
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Or maybe there would have been less of a buzz when you dropped it.

678
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah, potentially, perhaps only.

679
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, I don't know.

680
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Somebody bought Phantom's Revenge for $5 a couple days ago for the first time in a while. That was nice.

681
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

682
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What was I talking about? What?

683
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Okay, well, whatever.

684
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I was talking about like too many projects.

685
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

686
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Well, I guess the only other thing is I want to, first of all, I want to come back, do more Elden the Ring streams because those were fun when they were being watched and people were having fun with them.

687
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So I'm going to make a more regular schedule that people can like follow properly.

688
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I also kind of want to do Clarissa Gunsmoke draw streams like I did before.

689
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Those did seem to work out pretty well.

690
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, it's like I make things on stream and people get to Pog in real time.

691
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That's, that's, that's what you like to see.

692
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So I could do that.

693
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know whether I will, but at the moment I'm just sort of thinking I got to go on a plane and I'm scaled.

694
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Not for like the plane reason, but because it's the first time I'm going to America since COVID and there's new restrictions where I have to prove that I have a negative COVID test within one day before the flight.

695
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Which means I need to do some sort of weird phone thing where I get on a phone call, like a video call with someone and do a COVID test at my house, or I do some other test at a facility and I get a, I don't get it.

696
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I just don't understand.

697
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I read all of these things on like the US customs board of patrol stuff.

698
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I've never, I've never even heard of such a thing.

699
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I've never even heard of such a thing.

700
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What the fuck?

701
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And, and, and like I just don't understand what they mean.

702
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Like proof of a negative test.

703
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Like if I just to the thing.

704
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Like you have to, like you have to do a zoom, like you have to do a zoom call and show yourself taking the tests.

705
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I, yeah, I mean, I don't know what they mean by proof because there was something like that.

706
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And then I assume the only other way to do it is to go to like a hospital and get a test done at a hospital by a doctor, which can then verify it.

707
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Those usually take like more than a day to get the results of.

708
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah.

709
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So like a fucking, like if I could take a self test, a home test, or just do the swab in my nose and back my throat, put in a little thing and it comes up negative.

710
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Do I, can I take a picture of that?

711
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Or is that not enough proof?

712
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I have no idea.

713
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And I'm, I'm confused about the process.

714
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I think I'm just going to worry about that all week because.

715
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Good idea.

716
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I got to do that.

717
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's the only thing.

718
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Pack in my suitcase, whatever.

719
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Once I'm in the air, I love being in the air.

720
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's the most satisfying, calming thing in the world because no longer can somebody say, you're not flying to America because I am.

721
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We're going to land in America and there's nothing you can do about it.

722
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Absolutely true.

723
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Can't get me anymore.

724
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'm free.

725
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Free as a bird.

726
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But until then, it's the, it's the scariest, most stressful thing ever.

727
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So that's, that's going to be my next week.

728
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm going to be like, oh, what?

729
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
COVID.

730
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
What day?

731
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What day are you flying?

732
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The bleep that at least our bleep that just in case somebody decides to come to the airport and hunt you down.

733
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

734
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh God.

735
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Okay.

736
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You know what I think?

737
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I think these guys, and I think there are two of them.

738
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I think what they're doing is I think they're fucking around with like the ceiling tiles or something.

739
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think they're fucking around with like the ceiling tiles and maybe the vacuum is there to suck up like debris that might have like fallen down from the ceiling as they were fucking around with the tiles.

740
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I think that's what's going on out there.

741
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't think someone is just vacuuming.

742
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think there's a,

743
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
They're like hiding drugs in the ceiling.

744
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Well, I mean, I, I mean, I don't know.

745
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Little, little step back.

746
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I guess it, I guess, I guess it could be that.

747
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
No, I think there was like water damage.

748
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm going to see the tiles.

749
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Hiding the body up there.

750
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm not, I'm not sure.

751
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean, there's water damage in one of my ceiling tiles in my room, but like whatever.

752
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I don't care about that.

753
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh, no, I hear, yeah, I hear the guy.

754
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I hear my property manager and his, and one of his goons, one of his more affable goons who I sometimes hear him yelling to out in the parking lot behind my house.

755
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Boston is crazy.

756
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's a, it's a crazy old mix up world of ours.

757
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know.

758
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Goons in my house?

759
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No, thanks.

760
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
There is at least, there is at least one goon.

761
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Did you know that if you take Boston and you add slime, you get New Los Angeles City?

762
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's canon.

763
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And you put it on the grand, and you put it on the grand canyon.

764
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Put it on the grand canyon.

765
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Put it on the grand canyon.

766
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
How'd it get there?

767
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
How did Boston get to the grand canyon, Ben?

768
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Did they fucking drive it down the road like that at one Simpsons episode?

769
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Well, they filled the entire underneath of the ground with trash.

770
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
New canon.

771
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
New RFCK canon is that Boston exists in RFCK world.

772
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It exists in Massachusetts.

773
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And they just, when they were making New Los Angeles City, they just copied Boston exactly so they didn't have to do any city planning.

774
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
They just, they just copied it.

775
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, speaking, speaking of RFCK, I did look, I saw the Alleyoop comic.

776
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I saw Alleyoop, which he's been up to as an independent character in the city.

777
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Wait, there's a comic?

778
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
There's a contest villains contest entry.

779
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's like a seven, eight page comic of Alleyoop and some Lord of Ghost Lore.

780
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh, cool.

781
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I haven't looked at the villains contest entries yet.

782
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's so cool.

783
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Wow.

784
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm so proud of her.

785
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Well, that's exciting.

786
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm proud of when she's been up to.

787
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, good for her.

788
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
That's cool.

789
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm thinking of, of like turning whatever happens in that into like canon somehow for like Belle Jape 2 or whatever.

790
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh, wow.

791
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Who, who's, who's doing that?

792
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have no idea.

793
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's just a new account called Alleyoop.

794
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
They seem to be an old school PCP head.

795
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because the comic involves like resurrecting of like some classic villains like the Undertale 587.

796
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Wow.

797
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And stuff like that.

798
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It's DeVoo.

799
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't know.

800
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
No, it's not the same art style as DeVoo.

801
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Why would the hell would it be DeVoo?

802
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I don't know.

803
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Just someone.

804
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
DeVoo always hated RFCK.

805
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Did she?

806
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, I don't know if she hated it.

807
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I think it was just like being on that show.

808
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Like the first episode, it was you, Munchie and DeVoo.

809
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That is true.

810
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah.

811
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Funnily enough, that is true.

812
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And she was just like, I don't know about this type of show.

813
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Okay.

814
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
First, yeah, that's even weirder.

815
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Because at that point, RFCK didn't even really have much of an identity other than the fact that it just was me and Munchie.

816
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So what would...

817
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I kind of remember, now that you mentioned it, I do kind of remember that was true.

818
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Like what was the problem?

819
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Like what did you want?

820
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
More intellectual discussion, less funny gamer jokes, I guess.

821
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I hate her.

822
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I hate her.

823
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Fuck you DeVoo if you're listening and I hope you're not dying.

824
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I hate everyone.

825
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I hate everyone who I used to know and don't know anymore.

826
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I hate them.

827
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Now you're just somebody that I used to know.

828
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh yeah.

829
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It's a good song.

830
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's a good song.

831
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Goatee.

832
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Goatee.

833
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What else to say?

834
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
What else is on my stupid list?

835
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Do you have anything else to say about whatever you were talking about for the last hour or two?

836
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I don't know.

837
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
No.

838
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Okay.

839
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Last thing on my list.

840
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Last thing on my list is I don't know if I just need a haircut.

841
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I might just need a haircut.

842
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But I keep thinking about whether I should shave my head.

843
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It might just be that my hair looks bad because I haven't had a cut in a while

844
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and a haircut will make me be like, okay, it's fine.

845
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Both cut?

846
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Been seen?

847
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I keep looking at my hair and thinking like maybe am I bald enough that I need to shave my head yet?

848
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I don't know.

849
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I don't know.

850
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It troubles me.

851
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It troubles me a lot because I look at myself in the mirror and I think I look fine

852
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and then I see myself in like a photograph or like a recording, like a video someone took

853
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and I'm like, I'm genuinely horrified.

854
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm not exaggerating.

855
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
The feeling is one of horror and I don't know what to do about it.

856
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
What's the horror from?

857
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I don't know.

858
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I don't look right.

859
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't look the way that I look in the mirror.

860
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Well, that's always how it is.

861
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I flipped.

862
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You flipped your canvas.

863
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't know.

864
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I can't even really explain what it is that's different.

865
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Just something about the geometry.

866
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It doesn't match up.

867
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I was lifting.

868
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I had Munchy asked if I wanted him to record me doing bent over rows to check my form.

869
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I said, sure.

870
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I looked at the footage and I was like, oh no.

871
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What's going on with my hair?

872
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Is that what my head looks like?

873
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I look at my head every day.

874
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I look at my face and I know what I look like, but then I see that and I'm like, no, I don't.

875
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
No, I clearly have no clue.

876
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I have no clue what's going on.

877
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Is it like in the mirror, like the clown makeup is invisible or something?

878
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You got like a big afro bouncing around.

879
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
All I'm saying is I don't know what to think because like,

880
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
seeing myself in the mirror, I think my hair looks all right.

881
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I saw myself in the video and I'm like, this guy needs to shave his head right now.

882
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And I don't know which of those is true.

883
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You should do half and half.

884
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You should have one side shaved and then your hair goes down long on the other side.

885
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I thought in the last time I was really on video was the two Radcon 4 lectures and like,

886
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I think my hair looked okay in those.

887
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Did you have the pink?

888
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah, I did have the pink and it looked fine.

889
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
A little messy, but like whatever.

890
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't think I looked that different, but so I guess I'm a little grayer now.

891
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
LeMau.

892
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That's all right.

893
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That's all right.

894
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You know, I always, I always thought, I always thought it would be cool if when I started going gray,

895
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
if I would do it like, go gray at like the temples, you know,

896
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
swept back like Dr. Orpheus from Venture Bros.

897
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Go gray at the temples.

898
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Looks good.

899
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Well, here I am, years 2020.

900
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
It's happening.

901
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And you know what?

902
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I actually don't like it.

903
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I changed my mind.

904
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's not cool like I thought it was.

905
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You just go to shave everything except the gray hair.

906
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So it looks like they look good.

907
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah.

908
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You should just embrace it and just do a samurai like shave the top of your head thing.

909
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like why not?

910
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Then no one can criticize you.

911
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Work around with a big old, what do you call it?

912
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Not a kimono, like a robe thing.

913
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's, it's, it's genuinely, it's genuinely just a feeling of like, I don't know what I look like.

914
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And therefore I don't know how to, how to deal with it.

915
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I don't know how to, I don't know what I need to do to myself to look better because I don't understand

916
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the truth of the situation that I am in with regards to it.

917
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I mean, sometimes, sometimes I look at myself and I'm like, oh, I don't look good.

918
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Oh, and then I'm like outside and I'm like, I probably don't look good.

919
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And again, but I can't check.

920
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I guess I could take a picture if I don't want to.

921
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'll just, if somebody says I'm like a freak of nature, then then I'll know that it's a problem.

922
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You're a freak of nature.

923
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Until then, until then, I'll just be whatever I am.

924
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And if they have a problem with it, I'll cry.

925
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah.

926
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Nobody says anything.

927
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Nobody has any thoughts until they're like behind those doors.

928
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And then they say, did you notice the Gibb was like a freak of nature today?

929
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Like what the fuck was wrong with her?

930
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I do hear that sometimes.

931
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah.

932
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Dang it.

933
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I just assumed it was fake, but no.

934
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh, it's true.

935
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Only behind closed doors, as you say, yes.

936
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Shit.

937
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Comments.

938
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It is just as you say that.

939
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Do you comment nice things and then secretly?

940
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I have not seen.

941
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Like in your head, you comment, what the fuck do you do that?

942
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I mean, I have not seen what you look like in any capacity since Radcon 4.

943
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So that'll be funny.

944
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I sure hope I don't look embarrassing.

945
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I guess you haven't seen me since Radcon 4 either.

946
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I may have seen like one or two photos.

947
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I don't think I look that different.

948
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I gained a bunch of weight and then I lost most of it.

949
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So I might weigh a little bit more now than I did then, but not by that much.

950
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I gained a bunch of weight and I lost all of it in my arms and legs and it stayed in my stomach.

951
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Really?

952
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No, I'm just making a joke.

953
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Oh, I think I was like, I was like, I was like 160 pounds at Radcon 4.

954
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I'm probably like 170 something right now.

955
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So whatever.

956
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Paying care is gone.

957
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I have more gray.

958
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Other than that, I look pretty much the same.

959
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think.

960
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I don't know.

961
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Maybe not.

962
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Maybe my, maybe my hairline receded more than I know, than I even can tell when I look in the mirror.

963
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And I just, but it was so gradual that I didn't even notice.

964
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't know.

965
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Well, when I see you in person, I will scream if I find you upsetting to look at.

966
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

967
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And then you will know for sure the truth.

968
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I would hope.

969
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I would hope.

970
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I would hope so.

971
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I just, um, I don't know.

972
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I just wish I, I just kind of just wish I knew like, yes, it is time, it is time to shave your head.

973
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It is time to just go bald.

974
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Although I don't want that because I did shave my head one time in college and I don't think it looked good.

975
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I don't think I really have the head shape for it, but probably I could get used to it if I had to do it.

976
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So if I could just rip the Band-Aid off and just be like, okay, definitively, that's what I got to do.

977
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
When I, uh, when I, when I have it like, my hair is kind of longish right now.

978
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And I kind of think it looks all right when I just sort of like brush it to the side, like kind of brush it back.

979
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Like it looks fine.

980
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But then like, I don't know, I saw myself in the video and I like, it's like completely like scraggly.

981
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It was just kind of like one little strand of it kind of like falling down in front of my head.

982
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Well, hey, weren't you lifting in that video?

983
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Surely you'd be a little scraggly.

984
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I was sweaty and scra- yes, that's true.

985
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Working out.

986
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes, that's true.

987
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't know if it accounts for it completely.

988
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't know if, I don't know if it fully explains the anomaly, the anomalies I saw.

989
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You gotta do, you gotta do a vlog, you gotta do a vlog and you gotta look and figure it out.

990
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I don't analyze your own footage.

991
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't want to.

992
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Okay, on the other hand, I could take pictures and videos of myself from all kinds of scientific angles.

993
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
That would be extremely unflattering, but I feel like that would be exaggerating in the wrong way.

994
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I could convince myself that the situation is arbitrarily bad if I wanted to.

995
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I don't want to do that either.

996
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't want to know what the average person sees when they look at me.

997
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And then I can be like, okay, well, how can I adjust that to achieve maximal results?

998
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Munchy?

999
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I don't know.

1000
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I don't think, I don't think, what's he gonna tell me?

1001
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
He doesn't know.

1002
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I don't know.

1003
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
He's not gonna know what I should do.

1004
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I honestly feel like I should, I feel like I need to ask a stylist.

1005
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I feel like I need to go to a stylist and be like, listen, just tell me.

1006
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
A couple times I've gone to a hairdresser and I've asked them, hey, what should I do with my hair?

1007
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And I've never gotten really any good advice.

1008
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I've never had anyone be like, oh, you need to do this and then this is gonna look good on your head.

1009
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, that's not style.

1010
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Wow, that's just like hair care, I guess.

1011
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah.

1012
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I get things like that as well.

1013
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm like, I'm not sure, like, they have products they want me to buy, I guess.

1014
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Like products they prefer, but they don't have like creative decision.

1015
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:09,000
No, I want someone, I just want someone who knows about like style to tell me, like, look at what I look like and just tell me what I should do.

1016
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Because I don't fucking know.

1017
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I just want to know.

1018
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You should model yourself after Phantom Horn.

1019
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, done.

1020
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You should have the bangs, you should have the poofs, and then like the sort of ponytail thing.

1021
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:39,000
He doesn't have a ponytail, he just got, you know, I mean, a horse's mane just kind of goes down his back like that.

1022
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, go full mane with that.

1023
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Phantom's got more hair than I do, so, you know.

1024
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Will it into existence?

1025
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know, so I don't know, I don't know if I can pull it off.

1026
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Phantom hair.

1027
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I don't know if I can pull off his look.

1028
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Phantom hair, yeah, more like.

1029
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Anyways, that's, I don't know, whatever, that's all I have to say.

1030
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm griping about what I look like.

1031
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Sucks.

1032
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
How annoying.

1033
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh, that actually only didn't, that actually didn't take that long.

1034
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I just, I thought, I feel like I've been complaining about this for like half an hour.

1035
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I just looked at the time and it's been like five minutes, so actually it's okay.

1036
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Never mind.

1037
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm not sorry.

1038
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I have no idea how I'm supposed to look.

1039
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Like it's all I can do to like look sort of fine.

1040
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And the rest of the time I'm just like, I don't want to dwell on it.

1041
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I don't want to think about it too much.

1042
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Yeah, I mean, I also don't like to think about it that much.

1043
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then when I'm confronted with it, I'm like, well, that's just perplexing.

1044
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You look in the mirror.

1045
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'm perplexed.

1046
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I will say, I did see myself in a different, the mirror in my bathroom,

1047
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
the mirror in my bathroom is kind of like face height.

1048
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So I see my face in it.

1049
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I stood in front, I changed in front of like a lower mirror that showed my like body the other day.

1050
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And I could tell that I had lost some of most of the weight that I had gained during the worst of COVID.

1051
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So that was pretty good.

1052
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But that doesn't tell me what I should be doing with my hair though.

1053
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Unrelated, unrelated good news.

1054
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah.

1055
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
In other news, another week has gone by that I have not learned how to update the RSS feed.

1056
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
One of these, one of these days I will do it.

1057
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I feel kind of the people that people that listen on the podcast apps must be like,

1058
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
they must have simply not heard an episode in like three months and I am sorry to those people.

1059
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I truly do not mean to put them out.

1060
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I want our podcasts available to them, but I just hate work.

1061
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Yeah.

1062
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't want to learn it either.

1063
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

1064
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's complicated.

1065
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's technical.

1066
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Tom said he gave you instructions.

1067
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't know how useful they were.

1068
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah, he did give me instructions.

1069
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I did not read them in detail.

1070
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I kind of said, okay, I'll figure these out later.

1071
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And then I have not, later has not come yet.

1072
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Whatever.

1073
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'll do it.

1074
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'll do it.

1075
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I will do it.

1076
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I swear.

1077
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I swear.

1078
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I'm supposed to be updating the RSS feed now.

1079
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I might, maybe this week I will in between grinding away shit for the book and grinding away at preparing for that thing that I got to do in like two and a half weeks.

1080
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I will be so, instead of wasting my time on Noita, the worst game in the world, I maybe will try and tell myself, okay, I instead I will procrastinate by learning to update the RSS feed.

1081
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That's because with the procrastinators, that's when you got to work on something, but instead you decided to do something else.

1082
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That's when I work on the podcast.

1083
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's thematic.

1084
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Mm-hmm.

1085
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Mm-hmm.

1086
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yep.

1087
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
That's right.

1088
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
You understand.

1089
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Okay.

1090
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And it's well-known fact that everyone who leaves the podcast, they're productivity skyrockets.

1091
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yeah.

1092
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah.

1093
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Do we want to talk about that?

1094
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Talk about what?

1095
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Like everyone?

1096
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We could go through the list.

1097
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We could go through the list and check off, like, is that true?

1098
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't know.

1099
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I think it sort of speaks for itself.

1100
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I haven't heard much from most people.

1101
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yeah.

1102
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I mean, I see Tom still doing a little work on Azumi and stuff.

1103
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Does he?

1104
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah, on Twitter.

1105
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I haven't seen.

1106
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Mostly seen complaining about Elden Ring.

1107
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Elden Ring?

1108
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah, okay.

1109
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
You're right.

1110
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It speaks for itself.

1111
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The audience is invited to consider whether that statement is true or not.

1112
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Oh, and I suppose Mage does stream stuff.

1113
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
She's a VTuber.

1114
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That's great.

1115
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's lovely.

1116
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
That's lovely for her.

1117
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I don't pay attention to it, but it is there.

1118
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It sure is.

1119
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
VTubing seems like a big, I don't know.

1120
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
VTubing seems like a stupid thing that stupid people do probably.

1121
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I don't know.

1122
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
What's the point?

1123
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
What's the point?

1124
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The point is, I don't have to show my face, but I can draw a little picture.

1125
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Here's a question.

1126
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Here's a question.

1127
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Is VTubing a creative exercise?

1128
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Can you express yourself by VTubing?

1129
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
If you're very talented with the model, the animation stuff,

1130
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
switching expressions to match your voice can be difficult.

1131
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I could imagine that if the ring is complex.

1132
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There's some creativity in the acting part, I guess.

1133
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I don't watch too many of them.

1134
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I could imagine that if the ring is complex enough,

1135
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
maybe there is almost an element of puppetry to it.

1136
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Or you are acting through it, I guess.

1137
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I think that the vast majority mostly use automated eye and mouth things.

1138
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Occasionally, we'll click a button to change their expression,

1139
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
but that's the extent of it.

1140
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But there are some people who can do really elaborate things.

1141
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
That's kind of...

1142
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I saw one that I thought was pretty cool.

1143
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It was like an eldritch monster.

1144
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
It was like a tentacle monster with one big eye in the middle.

1145
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
He would switch his expression from a big pink heart eye

1146
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
to a big sparkly yellow eye or an angry red one.

1147
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It just looked pretty good.

1148
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It looked pretty good.

1149
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It was very easy to achieve.

1150
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Clearly, he's just using a toggle to switch which of a set expression he wants.

1151
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It works.

1152
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It's conveying the emotion that is meant to be conveyed there, I guess.

1153
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't know.

1154
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
How many streamers?

1155
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
How many streamers?

1156
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's the laziest possible thing.

1157
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I didn't really consider what I do v-tubing.

1158
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It's just a little PNG that opens their mouth.

1159
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Streaming...

1160
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I guess on the face of it, streaming is not that much of a...

1161
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I guess you could be creative with streaming.

1162
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I guess it's not really...

1163
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You definitely can be creative with streaming.

1164
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I guess anything you can do as a streamer, you can also do as a v-tuber.

1165
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Whatever.

1166
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,000
The most creative thing for me when I streamed was just choice of game and making the thumbnails.

1167
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I enjoyed making custom thumbnails for every different game that I played.

1168
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I should do that more.

1169
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I was actually drawing an Elden Ring thing.

1170
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You know, I don't know if I ever mentioned this.

1171
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
This was a long time ago.

1172
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
But I actually put almost a week of work into this.

1173
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Maybe not a week, a few days of work into something before I gave up.

1174
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I was actually working for a bit there on modding Hollow Knight to...

1175
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Modding?

1176
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Well, I was just going to edit the sprite.

1177
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I was just going to edit the sprite to have my face on it.

1178
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
The Bensane avatar face.

1179
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I started modifying the sprites and then...

1180
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That was fine, but then I realized that actually making the game run with a custom sprite sheet is a little more complicated than I assumed it would be.

1181
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It's not just a matter of insert one line of code or whatever.

1182
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So I was like, oh no, I'm not confident I can easily do this actually.

1183
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So I never did it.

1184
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:53,000
But I had edited a bunch of the basic Hollow Knight is walking around sprites.

1185
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Although there's actually a lot of sprites for...

1186
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Wait, sorry, your character is not the Hollow Knight.

1187
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
But you know what I mean.

1188
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The guy you play as.

1189
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Isn't his name...

1190
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Does he have a name or a title?

1191
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I think there is one.

1192
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I can't recall it at the moment.

1193
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I want to call him Hollow Knight.

1194
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I know Hollow Knight is actually the guy you fight before the sort of last boss.

1195
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You can take Hollow Knight's place.

1196
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You're a little hollow grub.

1197
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Hollow Knight's brother.

1198
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I was going to say he's called The Guardian, but no, that's in Petscop.

1199
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:51,000
There's text that sort of suggests that your character's name is The Guardian in Petscop.

1200
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That's different game though actually.

1201
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Hmm, okay.

1202
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Well, talked about Shave My Head, talked about marching for abortions.

1203
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
What do we want?

1204
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Abortions!

1205
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
When do we want them?

1206
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Now!

1207
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Wait, I got to complain.

1208
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I got to complain because the people with the megaphones at this thing, you know, they were leading chance and whatever and that's cool.

1209
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
But they did this multiple times and it made me really mad.

1210
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
They did one chant that was like...

1211
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Okay, I remember it was...

1212
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I mean, okay.

1213
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I'll invite you to think about this.

1214
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Complete this for me, right?

1215
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Complete the line.

1216
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Okay.

1217
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The people united will never be...

1218
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
What's the next word?

1219
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Fight it.

1220
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I don't know.

1221
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Close.

1222
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah, okay.

1223
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
You want a rhyme.

1224
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Divided.

1225
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The people united will never be divided.

1226
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:09,000
They did that chant, but every time they did it, they said the people united will never be defeated.

1227
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
The people united will never be defeated and every time I'm like, I can't believe it.

1228
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Like, why are you doing this?

1229
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You're there.

1230
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Like, you're there, but you just...

1231
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's like you're flubbing it on purpose.

1232
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Like, you have to be doing this on purpose.

1233
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Divided.

1234
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Divided.

1235
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Maybe to them it goes without saying that if the people united, they're not divided.

1236
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But like...

1237
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
But it doesn't rhyme.

1238
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
But it doesn't rhyme.

1239
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
The people...

1240
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't know why I said fight it.

1241
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I really just...

1242
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Will never be fighting.

1243
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Okay, but you get the...

1244
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's supposed to rhyme.

1245
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1246
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And there's an obvious answer.

1247
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And I just...

1248
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I just didn't get it.

1249
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I just didn't get it.

1250
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
The people completed will never be defeated.

1251
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah.

1252
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Yeah.

1253
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Okay.

1254
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's still better.

1255
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Still...

1256
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Still better.

1257
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Still better than we got.

1258
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Oh.

1259
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Oh.

1260
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
You know what?

1261
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I'll tell a little bit more about that.

1262
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
One, when the march was like...

1263
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
You know, a couple of people gave speeches and then we started a little march.

1264
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
As we were marching away from the library, there was a guy.

1265
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
He did not follow us.

1266
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
He was just kind of standing there.

1267
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
He was holding...

1268
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
He was wearing a VR headset.

1269
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
He was wearing like an oculus rift.

1270
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And he was holding up a sign for like anti-natalism, like no more babies.

1271
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And he was just standing...

1272
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And he was like spinning.

1273
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
He was like standing on the steps and like spinning in place, chanting something.

1274
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I guess maybe he was high or something, but he was wearing an oculus rift on his eyes.

1275
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And I just wish I knew what he was seeing.

1276
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Maybe he's living in the virtual world where babies don't need to exist at all.

1277
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I guess he was...

1278
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I don't know if he was there to troll or what.

1279
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Or if he was just having a good time.

1280
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I don't know.

1281
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Also, there was some old drunk guy who was there to counter-protest.

1282
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think this guy seemed like he was just going to be there regardless.

1283
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
He might not have even known there was an event.

1284
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But he was there with a sign that was like, no.

1285
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
People need to have the right not to have abortions.

1286
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
People need the right not to have abortions.

1287
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Whatever happened to freedom of speech?

1288
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
White lives matter.

1289
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I'm black and I'm proud.

1290
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
He was chanting, yeah, that was it.

1291
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
He started chanting, white lives matter.

1292
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And then he started chanting, I'm black and I'm proud.

1293
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And he was.

1294
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I think he was mixed race.

1295
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But anyway, I don't know.

1296
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
He followed us.

1297
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Freedom.

1298
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
We walked by him and he followed us like yelling at us because he started talking.

1299
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
We were looking at the sign.

1300
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
We were trying to decipher his sign because it didn't make any sense.

1301
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
We eventually figured out it was an anti-abortion.

1302
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And we're like, okay.

1303
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And then he started talking to us and we said, no, no, we don't want to hear it.

1304
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And he followed us and he yelled at us.

1305
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And then eventually he left us alone.

1306
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And he was around.

1307
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
He was just kind of around for the whole thing.

1308
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Just messing with people, just being a menace.

1309
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And you know what?

1310
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
His freedom of speech was maintained the whole time.

1311
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Nobody silenced him.

1312
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
God bless.

1313
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I want the freedom to have the government choose for me what I can do with my body.

1314
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I don't know.

1315
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
He was kind of hard to understand.

1316
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But it seemed like he was saying that he had had a kid that he aborted when he was younger.

1317
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And if he had not done that, he would have a grand kid right now.

1318
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And it's like, people need the right to live.

1319
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
People need the right not to have abortions.

1320
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
We're like, okay.

1321
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Sorry.

1322
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Thanks.

1323
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
That's just silly.

1324
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
You can just choose not to have it.

1325
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Yeah, you could have just not done that.

1326
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

1327
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You could have just not done that.

1328
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
No more freedom.

1329
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
No more freedom.

1330
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
My freedom led me to make a decision that I regret.

1331
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Well, bummer.

1332
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Man.

1333
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I don't know.

1334
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Put on a mask.

1335
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Put on a mask.

1336
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
He wasn't wearing a mask.

1337
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I bet he wouldn't like it if people had the right not to get COVID.

1338
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I bet he wouldn't be a fan of that.

1339
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
What a fucking jackass.

1340
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Anyway, that's what happened this week.

1341
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And that's the way the news goes.

1342
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That's right.

1343
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Is it voicemail time?

1344
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Yeah.

1345
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Let's do it.

1346
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Yeah.

1347
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Let's do it.

1348
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Okay, we got a lot of YouTube links.

1349
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So we're going to skip all of them this week.

1350
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
If your voicemail is a YouTube link, it will not be listened to.

1351
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
We told you.

1352
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
We told you.

1353
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And you're doing this on purpose, obviously.

1354
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
All right.

1355
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:29,000
The first one is a Pastebin link.

1356
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Oh, motherfucker.

1357
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Is this just a text question?

1358
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Yeah.

1359
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Okay, fine.

1360
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
If you had to rename the show for trademark reasons, for example, what would you call it?

1361
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
First of all, what trademark reasons?

1362
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That is a funny thought that like, oh no, there was actually another procrastinator's podcast.

1363
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
20 years ago.

1364
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I don't know.

1365
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I have no idea at all.

1366
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
The crumbly slime podcast, like it just give it a name.

1367
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yeah, honestly.

1368
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It didn't have like a theme to begin with.

1369
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah, honestly, it would be any name would be fine.

1370
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Ben and Gibbs power hour.

1371
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The oatmeal.

1372
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The oatmeal eaters podcast.

1373
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The one one two oatmeal podcast.

1374
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I would call the podcast Kirby's nightmare and dreamland.

1375
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Episode one.

1376
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Every episode would be named after a Kirby enemy.

1377
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
First one would be waddle D.

1378
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You turn it into like a pretend let's play like we call it let's play Kirby's nightmare and dream and part one.

1379
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We just do a podcast.

1380
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
We don't talk about Kirby.

1381
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
There's no Kirby footage.

1382
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Yeah.

1383
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
This episode met a met a nightmare.

1384
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
We'll just call it.

1385
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
We'll call the podcast.

1386
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
We'll call the podcast building building of a volcano in Minecraft.

1387
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
We'll call the podcast.

1388
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
The procrastinators podcast to.

1389
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yeah, for branding purposes, if we had to change it.

1390
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Okay, I hope that answers your question.

1391
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The next question is called 140.58321 go.

1392
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Snakes.

1393
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Are you okay?

1394
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Snakes.

1395
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Snakes.

1396
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Snakes.

1397
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Oh, I think.

1398
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, did.

1399
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Did oblivion fall upload that the that reaction video of him and four eyes to the pig thing?

1400
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Yes.

1401
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I didn't I didn't listen to it yet.

1402
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I should.

1403
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I think it's just on oblivion's channel.

1404
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Okay.

1405
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'll I'll go check that out later.

1406
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Listeners should also you should go check that out.

1407
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It's supposedly it's a reaction.

1408
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
It's him and four eyes reacting to me getting upset about big squeals.

1409
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Okay, next one is called Yeeg Studios isolation pilot plant.

1410
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Yep, for short.

1411
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Three, two, one, go.

1412
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:36,000
This place is not a place of honor.

1413
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
No highly esteemed is coming right here.

1414
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Nothing value is here.

1415
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What is here is dangerous and repulsive to us.

1416
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
This message is a warning about danger.

1417
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The danger is still present in your time as it was in ours.

1418
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The danger is to the body and it can kill.

1419
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:11,000
The form of the danger is by carbonate rain, financial irresponsibility, cringe, burning bridges for no good reason, and bad white person quote unquote rapping.

1420
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,000
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.

1421
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This place is best shun and left uninhabited.

1422
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Everyone says everyone accuses me of burning bridges.

1423
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
But everyone I burned bridges with did something.

1424
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I swear it's other people that burn bridges with me.

1425
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I'm not a bridge burner.

1426
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I value my bridges.

1427
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:46,000
If a bridge gets burned, I didn't do it.

1428
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
People burn their bridges.

1429
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It's not my fault.

1430
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Trixie Trixie burned that bridge.

1431
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And likewise for everybody else likewise for everybody else that you the viewer are sitting there thinking, ah, but what about this?

1432
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
No, they did it.

1433
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
They burned it.

1434
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Anyway, what were we talking about?

1435
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't know.

1436
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Okay.

1437
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Good, good voice.

1438
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Next one is a vocaru link.

1439
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Let's let's see about that.

1440
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh, nice.

1441
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Nice.

1442
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
What?

1443
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
That's right.

1444
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Nice.

1445
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I do.

1446
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Let's fuck Celestia.

1447
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Let's fucking do it.

1448
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I'm ready.

1449
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm ready.

1450
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1451
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I don't remember saying this in the show.

1452
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
This is just how I remember it.

1453
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Don't call it that.

1454
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Don't call it that.

1455
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Don't call it that.

1456
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Do not trust him.

1457
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Do not let him in.

1458
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
He will read you.

1459
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Do not read him.

1460
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
His voice is ash.

1461
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
His air is dead.

1462
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
You must not breathe it in.

1463
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,000
You must not comprehend the vapor, his dreadful vapor.

1464
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Put Celestia back on, Twilight.

1465
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I want to hear more about the wide-milf ass.

1466
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Oh, that's over.

1467
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It was strangely like, it had like an underlying level of like robotic static in that voice,

1468
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
but other than that, it was very clear.

1469
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It was.

1470
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It was, yeah.

1471
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It's Princess Melestia.

1472
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
She's here.

1473
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Okay, I'm okay with it.

1474
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Next one is called the new wacky voicemail characters all suck ass.

1475
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1476
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Okay, look, Samurai Sama was funny, like obviously, but the funny part was never the fucking racist voice.

1477
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So if we could stop doing racist voices to be funny, that'd be cool.

1478
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah, the other, I don't even remember what the other guy's name is, the other Chinese guy.

1479
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
You know, besides the Samurai, the other Chinese guy besides the Samurai.

1480
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I don't remember what his name is.

1481
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I don't remember either.

1482
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
He does not have a good gimmick.

1483
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:46,000
His bit initially was just racism, and then I think the most recent one, he tried to do something extra with it.

1484
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I genuinely can't even remember his name.

1485
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I don't remember his name off the top of my head.

1486
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Okay, I mean, these are, I feel like the subject line and the voicemail had different themes, but sure, okay, yeah, true.

1487
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I guess I agree with both.

1488
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Next one is, okay, skipping that YouTube link, and then we got a vocaroo link.

1489
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Okay, three, two, one, go.

1490
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
What happens to the old voicemails?

1491
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Did he just get deleted? Is there an internet archive?

1492
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I hope that's the end. I hope that's the end of the question.

1493
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Can you understand it?

1494
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Nope.

1495
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Nope.

1496
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What?

1497
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I think it's backwards, right?

1498
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Yeah.

1499
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
What's the point?

1500
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I guess I could download it and, like, reverse it.

1501
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Well, I mean, thanks for the incomprehensible voicemail, I guess. Thanks for a minute of noise.

1502
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We could download it and reverse it, but we'll leave that up to the viewing public to solve.

1503
01:27:43,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Do not trust him. Do not let him in. He will read you. Do not read him. His voice is ash. His hair is dead. You must not breathe at him. You must not comprehend.

1504
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
The vapor. His dreaded vapor.

1505
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:20,000
A scripture of empty prophecy spewed from the kingdom of sewers.

1506
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:28,000
A waste of moths upon his breath held captive in her orbit.

1507
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:45,000
The fog rolls off his skin to lay the nation light and slips into the grave. The great dead distance.

1508
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Okay, next is a YouTube link, and then...

1509
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Three or four YouTube links, and then...

1510
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Dusty dumps.

1511
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:01,000
One of them says, I think Trixie is re-uploading vids at gmail.com. Yeah, probably.

1512
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Yeah, and then next one is Dusty Dumps presents the PCP voicemail album.

1513
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Okay. Three, two, one, go.

1514
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,000
What's up, PCP nation? It is I, Dusty Dumps, aka Mutusandu, aka Chris.

1515
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:33,000
That's my name. I'm just here to announce that I'm almost done compiling and remixing the tracks for the PCP voicemail album, which is a collection of all the musical voicemails that I've made over the year.

1516
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:48,000
This is the 22 tracks, all in all, with five of those being bonus tracks, and two of them being album-exclusive tracks never heard before by anyone, except me of course, because I made them.

1517
01:29:48,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It'll be released on Bandcamp at a pay what you want sort of deal. I'd recommend just getting them for free, because I really just made this for fun. I'm not really looking to make anything up this.

1518
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I have but one request, if I may. I'd love to have some sweet frickin' album art. So if there's any artists out there interested in contributing the album arts, I'd be happy to take it.

1519
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Just DM me at Mutusandu on Twitter.

1520
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Mutusandu.

1521
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
If nobody's interested, that's fine too. I'll just try to come up with something, I guess.

1522
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright, that's it. Get excited. Sorry for the long voicemail. Love you. Bye-bye.

1523
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:47,000
If you had a concept in mind for what you would want to see as the album art, that would probably help.

1524
01:30:47,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That's exciting. I'll give that a listen. I'll promote Dusty Dumps' PCP voicemail album. That's really cool. I'm looking forward to it. I know he's been the music guy this past year, so that's pretty cool.

1525
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Next one is further Dusty announcements. Three, two, one, go.

1526
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Okay, one more thing I forgot to mention. I have now created the Dusty Dumps channel on YouTube where I will be slowly but surely uploading my voicemail songs as sort of funny lyric videos.

1527
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So you can all sing along at home. I've only made one so far. It's the Life of Ben one.

1528
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
So if you're interested in all that, just search Dusty Dumps on YouTube.

1529
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Okay, that's it. See ya.

1530
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I see it. Dusty Dumps 13 days ago. Dusty Dumps presents Life of Ben.

1531
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Oh, I clicked on a Dusty Dumps video that's three years old. Where is this?

1532
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Yeah, there's an animation called Dusty Dumps that is three years old. I think that's unrelated. Dusty Dumps, Life of Ben.

1533
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Alright, I won't listen to it at the moment, but I will subscribe to that channel.

1534
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Yeah, Dusty Dumps. Give them a sub and the album coming out. I'm looking forward to it. Very funny.

1535
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Next one is, where are we? How much do you pay the editor?

1536
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Honestly, there's a formula.

1537
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It's a proportion of the month's earnings, although the episode's earnings. I forget what the number is, though.

1538
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Okay. YouTube link, no. Next one is Cimo, C-I-M-O, and then a bunch of O's.

1539
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh, like the Paul McCartney song.

1540
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Oh, alright. Three, two, one, go.

1541
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Yeah, this seems playable and looking at my hand, I think we made many mistakes.

1542
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Main one, I'm going to do a shocking play, buddy. Okay, you ready? I'm going to set one.

1543
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Okay, alright.

1544
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And I'm going to set another, and that's all.

1545
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
What's that?

1546
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Was that the Nostalgia Critic?

1547
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I don't think it's Doug Walker, but I don't know who it is.

1548
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I thought it was Doug Walker for a second, but then I wasn't so sure, and now I... I don't know.

1549
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Okay, I don't know who it is.

1550
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
The Paul McCartney song I referenced was Seamoon.

1551
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Oh.

1552
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
It's a good song.

1553
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Next one is a vocabruelink. Okay, three, two, one, go.

1554
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Just look. What do you see?

1555
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Oh, yes, Ben. Harder. Harder.

1556
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Keep pounding my pussy.

1557
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
A man?

1558
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yes.

1559
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Fucking a horse.

1560
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Ethan, get out of here. I'm busy.

1561
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Wow, Ben. You got caught red-handed.

1562
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Ethan is a pig that fucks a horse, so what does he have to... how can he judge?

1563
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Wow.

1564
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Next one.

1565
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Next one is Better Call Saul, Season 6 is Wild.

1566
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Cock and Balls, Slime and Punishment.

1567
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Wait, an HTTP...

1568
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Directed by Benjamin... it's your name.

1569
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Look at all the bottom.

1570
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Part two, Eleazar, Cock and Balls.

1571
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Better Call Saul, Season 6.

1572
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Okay, I'm a little curious. I'm going to check the Wikipedia page.

1573
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It doesn't actually say that. There's no way.

1574
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's a freely editable thing.

1575
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I guess I could have edited it and then take a picture. I just assumed they'd like doctored the image.

1576
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
No.

1577
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Okay, I think... yeah, I guess all the episodes in Season 6 are all called Something and Something.

1578
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
So, okay, I get it.

1579
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Unfortunately, Eleazar and Benjamin are not actually credited on the show.

1580
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Alas, that would really be something.

1581
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Okay, next one is called Ben Cells, 3, 2, 1, go.

1582
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:55,000
This is going to be the whole thing, isn't it?

1583
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yeah.

1584
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And this is a pay.

1585
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Well, now it sounds like Peter Griffin.

1586
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:32,000
He's right. Okay, next one...

1587
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Where's the Vapors?

1588
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:41,000
This is a context once again in the next voicemail.

1589
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And it's Alex from Yeek looking at, I don't know, something in space or whatever.

1590
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
It's looking at the end of Homestuck.

1591
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

1592
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Wait, is that what that? No, maybe.

1593
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I no played Yeek.

1594
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Well, I'll tell you right now, he does not go to Homestuck in Yeek, so...

1595
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Oh, it sucks then.

1596
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Okay, next one is a Vokeru link, 3, 2, 1, go.

1597
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Yes.

1598
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I heard that.

1599
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
At least they didn't before.

1600
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Tommy Oliver.

1601
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
If you know this person, I beg of you.

1602
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Don't interact with them.

1603
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,000
All universes are made of similar elements but all have different chains of cause and effect as their DNA.

1604
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Just like different seeds in Minecraft.

1605
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
But if you touch this singularity, you will influence all other seeds.

1606
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And nobody can predict what will happen then.

1607
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Maybe a new Big Bang.

1608
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Maybe all worlds will overlay one another.

1609
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Maybe causality fundamentally will stop working.

1610
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Please, stay away from Tommy Oliver.

1611
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Don't miss a final episode, Friendship Magic Dimensions.

1612
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Okay.

1613
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I won't miss the final episode of Friendship Magic Dimensions.

1614
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Thank you, Alex Yeek.

1615
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I guess don't touch Tommy Oliver.

1616
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
You just don't want to touch it.

1617
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
You just don't want to do that.

1618
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Okay, I'm going to download this voicemail.

1619
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Okay, next voicemail is another Vokeru.

1620
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
3, 2, it's 2 whole minutes.

1621
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
3, 2, 1, go.

1622
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
You?

1623
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Who are you and why are you impersonating me?

1624
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You don't recognize me?

1625
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Look, does this look like impersonation to you?

1626
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
What? How?

1627
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Oh, I see. You have lost your memory when Tommy Oliver shot you.

1628
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Same thing happened to me, actually.

1629
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Come inside, it's gonna be a long one.

1630
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I requested you to install a voice module in my head, so I could send voicemails?

1631
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Correct.

1632
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
And then you use remote control to record voicemails with it?

1633
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Yes.

1634
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
But why won't you record yourself?

1635
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Hug. This is a long story.

1636
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Through my life I've never felt any connection to other people.

1637
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
My family didn't really care about me.

1638
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I wasn't interesting enough to make friends at school.

1639
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Only times people cared were when they tried to use me.

1640
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So I've been listening to your voicemails in case module malfunctions.

1641
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
When I felt something.

1642
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
For the first time in my life.

1643
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I too wanted to talk to PCP.

1644
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
But do you really think they would listen to me?

1645
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Never.

1646
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Never.

1647
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Well, I listened to you even then.

1648
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
You could have just asked.

1649
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Asked? And you would have agreed to.

1650
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Of course.

1651
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Wow, friendship really is magic.

1652
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So you make voicemails with me?

1653
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Sure.

1654
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
High five.

1655
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
High five.

1656
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Wait, who I hoof?

1657
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Let's be real.

1658
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
What happened?

1659
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
What was that?

1660
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It seems that Tommy Oliver's bullets left out bodies and flew away.

1661
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But why?

1662
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Actually, I don't really care.

1663
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Yeah, me neither.

1664
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Let's go record voicemails.

1665
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And then they have recorded many great voicemails.

1666
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
But that's a whole another story.

1667
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
The final episode, friendship magic.

1668
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Narrated by Robert Stax.

1669
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Laura's antisocial person.

1670
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Twilight sparkles herself.

1671
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Tommy Oliver is Tommy Oliver.

1672
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Google woman is Twilight Saber Spark.

1673
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Poojee is ages school.

1674
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Oblivion fall is interrupting death pay.

1675
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
What a journey.

1676
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
What a journey we've been on together.

1677
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I don't remember when Tommy Oliver shot Twilight with a gun.

1678
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
When they discovered that friendship was magic.

1679
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
His bullets exploded and flew out of them.

1680
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Okay.

1681
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
They can make voicemails all day long.

1682
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
That's all they need.

1683
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
You too, listener.

1684
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
All you need is the power of friendship and making voicemails.

1685
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And we will have to suffer through them.

1686
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
There's another one.

1687
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
That was great.

1688
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Oh god, there is.

1689
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Oh no.

1690
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Yeah, okay.

1691
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Three, two, one, go.

1692
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
How?

1693
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
No!

1694
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
What is happening?

1695
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Is that Tom?

1696
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I think it was the bullet.

1697
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I'm sorry for being late, Chris-san.

1698
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Sunny-chu.

1699
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Yes, the dimensional merge has finally happened.

1700
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
There, there.

1701
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Pray your heart out.

1702
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Now, we'll put you there.

1703
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And how do you want me to punish them?

1704
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Oh no.

1705
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Social ending. The merge.

1706
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Narrated by Robert Stack.

1707
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Random people as prison guards.

1708
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
The odds went out as Christian.

1709
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Wolfie-chu is Sunny-chu.

1710
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Wait, how did you get there?

1711
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Stop.

1712
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
What do we did now?

1713
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Visit your friends and say,

1714
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
How nice it is to have friends.

1715
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Friendship really is magic.

1716
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That's what I'm saying.

1717
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
What a twist.

1718
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
That was Christian in jail.

1719
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Voiced by the odd ones out, I think he said.

1720
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Yeah, they did.

1721
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Fascinating.

1722
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And Sonichu.

1723
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Oh, it was, of course.

1724
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Of course.

1725
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It was Sonichu all along.

1726
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
It explains everything.

1727
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Yes.

1728
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Excellent.

1729
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay.

1730
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Next one is called Snakeweed.

1731
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Three, two, one, go.

1732
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Is it true?

1733
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
No.

1734
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
That Simsie is an absolute fucking legend.

1735
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Because I've known him for years.

1736
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And he's a sexy boy.

1737
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Just needed to be conferred by other people.

1738
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Because, you know, bias to views and all.

1739
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
We just need to be with him.

1740
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I can't confer.

1741
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Just letting him use a sexy boy.

1742
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Sexy.

1743
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Was there a question?

1744
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Oh shit, yeah, a question.

1745
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
How big is Simsie's penis on a scale of 1 to 10?

1746
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
It's huge.

1747
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
He's not on the episode.

1748
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
This is going to be weird.

1749
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Well, if he's not on the episode, that's fine.

1750
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Just get him on the episode.

1751
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Give us your opinion anyway.

1752
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yeah, just get it, you know?

1753
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
I want to know.

1754
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I want to know what you think.

1755
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Has Simsie got a big penis?

1756
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I believe so.

1757
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

1758
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Yeah.

1759
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

1760
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1761
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
He shows it.

1762
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Every time he comes into the chat, he posts his penis.

1763
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I've seen it.

1764
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I can't say it the way he says hello.

1765
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I've seen it in my mind's eye.

1766
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I like to rotate a 3D model of it in my mind.

1767
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Simsie told me, Simsie messaged me yesterday to be like,

1768
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
sorry, my real life friend sent in a voicemail.

1769
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I think they sent it in too.

1770
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Sounded just like him.

1771
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
It was like, it sounded pretty similar.

1772
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

1773
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Next one, it's as though like Simsie's mind had been body swapped into like a different

1774
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
body.

1775
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Pattern.

1776
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Next one is called Happy Birthday, Ben.

1777
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Thanks.

1778
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
The one after that is called Do The Bonus Episodes, have voicemails?

1779
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
No.

1780
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
The one after that is called Noah Gervais.

1781
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Yeah, three, two, one, go.

1782
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Hi, I'm Noah Gervais.

1783
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's Noah Gervais.

1784
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Hi, Noah Gervais.

1785
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I was watching one of your videos yesterday, I think.

1786
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I watched the Alan Wake one.

1787
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Next one is Ben's Weekly Reminder, Play Gelteroon Chapter Two, okay.

1788
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:39,000
One after that, Hidden Symbolism of Pig and Crabs, three, two, one, go.

1789
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So about this, Agent Squill doing Operation Crabita, voicemail.

1790
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I think the plot was that pig destroyed most of the crabs which is why Twilight Sparkle

1791
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
was able to roll through them.

1792
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
But that's just a theory.

1793
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
R and also I have that song playing during the fight in my playlist and its metal gear

1794
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
theme goes metal.

1795
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So you have listened to Pig Metal and enjoyed it.

1796
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Ah, you know what, wow.

1797
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So the pig that thinned the herd in a sense and that's how Twilight Sparkle was able to

1798
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
roll through the crabs with her miracle build.

1799
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Ah, the herd, thinned the herd like horses.

1800
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Yeah.

1801
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I understand.

1802
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I understand everything.

1803
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Okay, next one is called My Personal Blog, three, two, one, go.

1804
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
It's crazy, man.

1805
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'm sitting here on a computer.

1806
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I'm sitting here at a digital device like a, there's just little rubber buttons I push

1807
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,000
on and they make little electricity connections and shit.

1808
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And my point is that the other day, like earlier today, the other yesterday, I was sitting in

1809
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
front of my computer and I pushed the button and I was like, how did humanity make a computer?

1810
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Like how did they do that?

1811
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah, they couldn't figure out that the earth was flat.

1812
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I mean, they knew it and then they forgot.

1813
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But it's like, you know, like, it's like man with little tiny lens looking at little,

1814
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
looking at little pebbles with a little lens, like a magnifying glass.

1815
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
But if he looks, if he tries to look up, if he tries to look down, look at a tree, you

1816
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
can't see it because it's out of focus.

1817
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:34,000
You know, it's like, and my point is, is that he's so right.

1818
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Yeah.

1819
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Well, to make a computer, you just have to invent the transistor and then just, you just,

1820
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
you just tie them together in like a chain and you like sort of weave them together in

1821
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
sort of a, a net.

1822
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And then you overlay a bunch of those nets on top of each other and they all connect and

1823
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
they become a neural network.

1824
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Dude.

1825
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And you make a.

1826
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Friends.

1827
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Sys.

1828
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Transition.

1829
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Every time I hear, every time I hear the word transition, I say that now.

1830
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:23,000
It hasn't happened yet, but one of these days it will.

1831
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
What were we talking?

1832
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Yeah.

1833
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Computers.

1834
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
They're wild.

1835
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Computers.

1836
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
They're so cool, man.

1837
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
They're like a bunch of silly cones and you put them in a row.

1838
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Do you just take a bunch of cones, a bunch of rods, stick them in your eye?

1839
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Colors, man.

1840
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
All right.

1841
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Next one is called Happy Birthday, Ben.

1842
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Thank you.

1843
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Next one is called Please Update Podcast Playlist on the channel.

1844
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
They lack epi.

1845
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
So.

1846
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Oh, you know, that's actually probably would be a good thing to do.

1847
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Update the podcast, the playlist.

1848
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah, I will do that actually.

1849
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And maybe before I do the SSR, RSS.

1850
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
RSS.

1851
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
SSI.

1852
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
The Real Special Service.

1853
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:16,000
The SSRI feed, the Super Serotonian Reuptake Inhibitor Feed.

1854
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Keep your from being depressed.

1855
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Next one is called So Des, starting from around 300, do it while it's not much work.

1856
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I think they're referring to which episodes are not on the playlist.

1857
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Oh, episodes starting from around 300.

1858
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah, so like a dozen episodes.

1860
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah, I'll do that.

1861
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Next one, Ben's Weekly Reminder to Upload the Episodes to Spotify.

1862
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I will.

1863
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Happy birth.

1864
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Next one, Happy Birthday, Ben.

1865
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Thanks.

1866
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Then a bunch of YouTube links.

1867
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
And then one called Simsie Friend.

1868
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Three, two, one, go.

1869
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Yes.

1870
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Hello, Ben St.

1871
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Yes.

1872
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
You sound ledgy.

1873
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Thanks.

1874
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
I know Simsie.

1875
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
He's literally holding the phone right now while I record this.

1876
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Oh, I see.

1877
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
My question is, Tails got trolled.

1878
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Is it like legitimate good?

1879
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
You dingus.

1880
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Can we retake this?

1881
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
You haven't seen.

1882
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
If you'd seen the lecture, you'd know that it is good, actually.

1883
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Or just read the comic, actually.

1884
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Take Cybershell's advice.

1885
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Don't watch my lecture.

1886
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Read the video.

1887
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's legitimately entertaining.

1888
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Whether or not it's good doesn't mean anything.

1889
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:49,000
There are qualities of genuine quality to it.

1890
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
One might say.

1891
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I don't want to say it's good.

1892
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I would say it can be enjoyed.

1893
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It can be very enjoyed.

1894
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
It can be enjoyed unironically, yeah, for sure.

1895
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

1896
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Next one is called Jamie.

1897
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Three, two, one, go.

1898
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
I'm at the pub right now.

1899
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Simsie is looking at me right now.

1900
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
He's got quite a lot of judgment.

1901
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
But I also kind of want to ask Ben St. a question.

1902
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I just want to ask, what's your favorite beer?

1903
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I don't know.

1904
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
What do they be drinking over there?

1905
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And if you include this in the podcast, I'll be embarrassed.

1906
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Sorry.

1907
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
I guess everything gets included.

1908
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Literally, what kind of beer do you guys be drinking over there?

1909
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I know you guys like anime and Tails got trolled and stuff.

1910
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
This is DJ Bro's anime podcast.

1911
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
It's kind of irrelevant.

1912
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
But just what kind of beer should be drinking?

1913
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
That's all I want to know.

1914
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I went out to a restaurant the other day.

1915
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Usually, when I drink beer, I drink...

1916
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I'm on the record as having an unrefined palette.

1917
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So I just drink piss water.

1918
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I just drink light beer with less calories.

1919
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I drink Miller light or Michalab Ultra or whatever.

1920
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Usually, Miller light is my default.

1921
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I just drink some light beer.

1922
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It sucks.

1923
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But it's fine.

1924
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:24,000
And then, although if I'm trying to save money, I'll drink Narragansett.

1925
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I went out to a restaurant the other day and I had two Narragansetts.

1926
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Narragansetts, traditionally, they come in a 16 ounce can.

1927
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
That's the bigger can.

1928
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Tallboy.

1929
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And they cost $5, which at a restaurant is a pretty good price for a beer.

1930
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
This fucking restaurant charged $7 for their Narragansett,

1931
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
which is like charging a buck 25 for an Arizona iced tea.

1932
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:53,000
So, you know, didn't appreciate that, but oh well.

1933
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Man, that's my answer.

1934
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Miller light or Narragansett, depending on whether I value lower calories or saving a couple bucks.

1935
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:11,000
I just drink where there's a drink to drink.

1936
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I mean, I'm a partial to a Doombar or a hobgoblin or a Corona.

1937
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I guess Stella Artois is pretty good.

1938
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I like most of the time I drink and I'm like, I'm two beers in.

1939
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And that's just nice.

1940
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I feel buzzy.

1941
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I went to the Stella Artois brewery in fucking Belgium.

1942
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I think it's Belgium, right?

1943
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I thought it was French, but maybe.

1944
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Oh, hold on.

1945
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
And when I say I went to it, I mean that I like walked by it.

1946
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I didn't like go on a tour or anything.

1947
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
It's in Leuven.

1948
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Wait, is that in Belgium?

1949
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Yeah, I think so.

1950
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Yeah, I walked through the town that it's in.

1951
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
It's in the Netherlands.

1952
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It's in Belgium.

1953
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1954
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Near Brussels, Leuven.

1955
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Okay, I don't usually drink beer.

1956
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
No, I guess I do.

1957
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I don't know.

1958
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:25,000
It's a very simple way to just have a drink and alcohol is to be had.

1959
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:32,000
It is a simple way to have a drink and it generally leads to not being that hungover the next day.

1960
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
So I would say that it's a pretty good thing to drink if you're going to drink.

1961
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:42,000
But the people that I generally drink with these days, none of them like beer.

1962
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
So usually we do something else.

1963
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Are they chugging shots?

1964
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yes, yes, they are.

1965
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
They're doing shots or they're drinking cider.

1966
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Cider's okay.

1967
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I like a dry cider instead of a sweet one.

1968
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Cider's fine.

1969
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I guess it tastes good or whatever.

1970
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:11,000
But it's just beer but more expensive and it tastes like an apple and like whatever.

1971
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
It's just more expensive and I don't care that much.

1972
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,000
It's about, you know, it all comes down to value for dollar for me, honestly.

1973
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
That's not true, although it is kind of true.

1974
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Next one is called In the Car with Dad.

1975
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
The audio is kind of shit.

1976
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Three, two, one, go.

1977
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Now don't you go and get me no left about being a baby and being a little ninja or whatever the hell you're being.

1978
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
You can talk.

1979
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I've heard you.

1980
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
But you know what?

1981
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Very don't.

1982
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Very don't talk because the next word to come out of your mouth better be God bless America.

1983
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Like the American you are.

1984
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Ben the Saint is on.

1985
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Help me.

1986
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You gotta help him.

1987
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I, um, how, how, oh, how the turntables.

1988
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Oh, how are you?

1989
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
This is what you get.

1990
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
This is your punishment for trying to get that scroll back.

1991
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You know, Finder's Keepers nerd.

1992
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
It's expecting something else.

1993
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Bummer, man.

1994
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Real, real, it's rough.

1995
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:56,000
The next one is challenge three, two, one, go.

1996
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
No more three, two, one goes.

1997
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
No more Samurais.

1998
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
No more pigs.

1999
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
No more Ben casts.

2000
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
No more tombstones.

2001
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
This is the last episode of the PCP.

2002
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Say farewell to the listeners and kill this podcast right now.

2003
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I'm sorry.

2004
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I will fail your challenge.

2005
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
My friends.

2006
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
It's, it's too hard.

2007
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,000
It's too hard to end the podcast even harder if you can believe it than continuing it.

2008
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,000
There's a concept in physics called inertia.

2009
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Actually, it's an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by a force.

2010
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Look it up.

2011
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It's true.

2012
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Believe it or not.

2013
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I don't believe it.

2014
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Well, you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to live with me not believing it.

2015
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I can't.

2016
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
So I'll kill myself.

2017
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Okay.

2018
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Next one is a comic.

2019
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Oh, is it?

2020
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Hang on.

2021
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
There's a voice.

2022
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Is there a voicemail tag?

2023
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
No, it's just garbage.

2024
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
It's just garbled.

2025
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Okay.

2026
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
A comic.

2027
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Let's read this.

2028
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
This trash.

2029
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Oh, um, okay.

2030
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Sama lives here.

2031
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Sama Slayer.

2032
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Evil is here.

2033
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I am not a samurai.

2034
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I have fought alongside them as a warrior bound by honor.

2035
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And before their final hours made an oath to them.

2036
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,000
If anyone emerged to besmirch their clan's name or subject them to any shit cannon,

2037
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I would strike them down for the clan.

2038
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
For my friend.

2039
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I've come for you foul beast.

2040
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Goo Goo Gaga.

2041
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Your tricks won't work on me.

2042
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Ah, so you can see my spirit inside this vessel.

2043
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Shut up.

2044
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Shut up.

2045
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Shut up.

2046
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I'm going to rip your spirit from this cursed children child's body.

2047
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,000
You can't just do that.

2048
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Just threw them through a wall, I guess.

2049
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Now feel the strength of my ultimate attack.

2050
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Secret technique.

2051
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
1000 sword strike.

2052
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I just wanted to cube and say of shit cannon destruction.

2053
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Oh my god.

2054
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Just like that, the imposter is slain.

2055
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Such is the fate for all fake samurai who dare to besmirch the order's name and cannon.

2056
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Such is the honor bound duty of the Sama Slayer.

2057
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Wow.

2058
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Wow.

2059
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
You ripped out that.

2060
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Oh, I mean it's cannon because they made a comic about it.

2061
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
That is cannon.

2062
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
That is very cannon.

2063
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Yeah.

2064
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Comics are very high on the canonical hierarchy.

2065
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
So there you go.

2066
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
So the baby samurai, no more.

2067
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Seems to have been exercised by the 1000 sword strike.

2068
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I mean, I can see it happening in his little very, very, very faint green aura there.

2069
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I can see it happening.

2070
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
He's crying sad little tears, his little beetle helmet.

2071
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Just be advised.

2072
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I guess I didn't need to help him.

2073
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
He said help me.

2074
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Well, the Sama Slayer, he's killed him.

2075
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Sort of.

2076
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
This is what you want.

2077
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Is this what you wanted?

2078
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
All right.

2079
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Next one is an Imgur link, but there's also a voicemail attached.

2080
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
So three, two, one.

2081
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Oh yeah.

2082
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Yeah, Imgur.

2083
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Three, two, one, go.

2084
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I'm sending a message after every episode I see, but I'm running out of funny.

2085
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I guess look at my favorite image on the internet.

2086
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Thanks.

2087
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Look at my favorite image on the internet.

2088
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Yeah, it says another old comic.

2089
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Like an anime girl coming home from school.

2090
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
What the hell is this?

2091
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
It's a group of thugs.

2092
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
They grab her.

2093
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
They grab her.

2094
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,000
And then the one guy, he takes her arm and he ties a knot on her sleeves.

2095
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
And they run away and now she has, she can't get her hands out of her sleeves.

2096
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Hey, is that me grabbing her from behind with the beanie on?

2097
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Yes.

2098
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Nice.

2099
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Tied up her sleeve.

2100
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
That's kind of cute, I guess.

2101
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Next one is called, it's a Dropbox link.

2102
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It's a Dropbox link.

2103
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Let's find out what's going to happen.

2104
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Oh my God, it's the artist.

2105
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,000
It's the artist.

2106
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
It's new.

2107
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
There we are.

2108
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
All right.

2109
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Okay, I'm on the first panel.

2110
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I'm already liking what I'm seeing.

2111
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Yes.

2112
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
All right.

2113
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:52,000
By new PS, did y'all give anything for free comic book day?

2114
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I've not heard of free comic book day, so I guess not.

2115
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Oh, maybe it's an American thing.

2116
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Yeah, there's a day called free comic book day where just a lot of stores, you can just

2117
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
walk into a comic shop and they'll just give you a free comic or something.

2118
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Oh yeah, we don't have that.

2119
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
That sounds cool though.

2120
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
A lot of artists do something for it.

2121
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
No, I didn't realize that it happened.

2122
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Oops.

2123
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Next one.

2124
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Here we go.

2125
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
What the hell do you hogs want from us?

2126
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Radcon money, the lost tapes, patrons?

2127
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
We don't have any of that shit.

2128
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
It's true.

2129
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
True because we didn't charge for March.

2130
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I'm never going to stop.

2131
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
The rest of my life, I'm going to look at my bank account and I'm going to think there

2132
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,000
would be several more hundreds of dollars in there in that number if only things had

2133
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
been different and it'll never not be true.

2134
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I'm cursed.

2135
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Anyway, anyway, it's not important right now.

2136
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Oh, Benji, my bitter summer child, you know what I'm here for.

2137
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Snoop hogs.

2138
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Errorare's rap hog from episode 255 Snoop Hogs.

2139
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I don't recall a rap hog, yeah?

2140
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Before, I really like the way they did the hands on this Snoop Hog.

2141
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Oh, yeah.

2142
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
It's a little bit, a little bit gorillas.

2143
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Yeah.

2144
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Yeah.

2145
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
That's his name.

2146
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Jamie something.

2147
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
The tank girl guy.

2148
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Yeah.

2149
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:44,000
It's a bit, or a bit, or a little bit Hellboy.

2150
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

2151
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Yeah, I see what you mean.

2152
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Yeah, it looks really good.

2153
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
The answers.

2154
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
The answer's Ben St.

2155
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:58,000
What does oblivion fall put in the CPK recipes so they don't taste like shit?

2156
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Clusterpunk Kitchen.

2157
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:06,000
How to properly pronounce icy, icy Molotov Ligma Sakurai.

2158
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Okay.

2159
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Okay.

2160
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The real reason why Nate left the podcast.

2161
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
The Snoop Hog is being, he's snooping around.

2162
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Oh, sure.

2163
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I find these, these answers.

2164
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
God, my tits are so hot.

2165
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I can't, you have all the answers in those.

2166
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
My fat tits.

2167
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
The Kawasaki scrolls.

2168
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
The Kawasaki scroll.

2169
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
They're in your cleavage.

2170
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
My tits look so sexy.

2171
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
They're great.

2172
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
They are great.

2173
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
They are.

2174
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I wish I could see mine more.

2175
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
They're kind of, you can just kind of see them from behind there.

2176
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
This, oh my God.

2177
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
This is so good.

2178
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:01,000
New is a genius.

2179
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Why, I have nothing else to add to this.

2180
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:14,000
I can't, I can't improve upon it other than, boy, I don't remember there being a wrap

2181
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,000
hog, but I believe it.

2182
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I do remember we were listening to a few of Errorari's things.

2183
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
We couldn't comprehend them.

2184
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:28,000
So maybe there was a wrap hog in one of those and we just didn't get it.

2185
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Perhaps.

2186
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
It does explain where the scrolls have been all along, you know.

2187
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Fat tits.

2188
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,000
It answers a lot of questions that have been lingering.

2189
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,000
What a revelation.

2190
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Well, that was the last voicemail.

2191
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Oh, is it?

2192
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Yeah, I think so.

2193
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Right?

2194
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Am I crazy?

2195
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Oh, no, that's true.

2196
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
It's, that is the last one.

2197
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Yeah.

2198
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:03,000
So, and what a, and what a one to go out on and wow, we've only been recording for two

2199
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
hours today.

2200
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
We have, we have robbed these view listeners.

2201
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Oh, no.

2202
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Of their content.

2203
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
All right.

2204
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Next week.

2205
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Their hard iron content.

2206
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I will, I will make sure to make have some things to talk about next time.

2207
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
You should, you should like injure yourself and go to the hospital so you can talk about

2208
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
that.

2209
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah, I'll say, oh, what the fuck?

2210
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
My legs broken.

2211
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Oh, and then we can fuck.

2212
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
And then I can gripe about American healthcare, private healthcare and all that and we can

2213
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:45,000
have a whole thing go down that rabbit hole, you know, how many, that's an evergreen, not

2214
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
well, it's an evergreen well.

2215
02:07:49,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I pledge that for next week's episode, I will, I will be in, I will have spent, I will be

2216
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
arrested.

2217
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I will be incarcerated in the American prison state.

2218
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Nice.

2219
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I will deliver my manifesto from through my one phone call through my one phone call

2220
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:22,000
give, I'll call you and I'll say, Hey, listen, I'm just going to like talk into your talk

2221
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
into your answering machine.

2222
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And I just want you to play my message on the podcast.

2223
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And that's my one phone call.

2224
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:36,000
What if I can't figure out what if I don't have an answering machine?

2225
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I guess I don't need a machine these days.

2226
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
It just goes on my phone.

2227
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I guess the podcast, then I guess the challenge is met and the podcast is dead.

2228
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I'll try and carry it.

2229
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Oh, no, I'm dying of COVID.

2230
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I won't be able to carry the podcast.

2231
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Oh, how ironic.

2232
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
How ironic you would die of disease that everybody fucking has.

2233
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I can't do the podcast by myself disease.

2234
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:11,000
What if Usopp did a podcast on the pirate ship?

2235
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Well, that would be racist because Usopp is a racist caricature like Aunt Jemima,

2236
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
and he needs to be canceled.

2237
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:22,000
You know, the real racists are the ones that won't let Usopp have a podcast, in my opinion.

2238
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Thanks for listening.

2239
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Thanks for listening.

2240
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000

2241
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Oh, hey, please, please give us some money at patreon.com.

2242
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,000

2243
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000

02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,000

So if you haven't listened to that.
