1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,940
I won't bless that guy that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:21,920
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's Ben Saint and Gibbontake.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,360
I just attacked Ben with a red hot poker.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,520
Yeah, yeah, you know how it is

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,600
Do you have something you wanted to start with well, I was gonna ask you about phantom's revenge cuz I was sure yeah phantom's revenge is out

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,120
You played it I did played it you played it and I watched you stream it and it was

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,980
So fun watching you figure it out in real time

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,380
I

9
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,900
Had a I re I rewatched most of the stream cuz I just liked it that much. Oh

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,740
Wow, yeah, I know it was great

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,900
Well, I'm glad to have been the perfect

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,540
Gamer for that one the perfect gamer you I think you you told me that you

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,180
Eventually you didn't beat it on stream, but you said it took you like three more tries

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,460
Which meant that you took like six tries total

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,100
Like so seven. Yeah, some of my bad

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,820
I think that's less than most people, but you really took your time with it like you really like

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:36,300
Took a while for each run and you were like unpacking after every move and like really like carefully choosing

18
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,780
Your next decision

19
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,660
It was because I had played the demo and that was like

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,900
The point of the demo is that you have to find out the one

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
Way to beat it. Yeah

22
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,620
And so every single thing you do is like that could end the run if you don't know what you're doing

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,580
Yeah, if you don't think about what you're doing. Yeah, I came into the the game with the right mindset

24
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,460
Yeah, I have I don't know. I might have told you this

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,020
I've definitely told some people on Twitter this but um, you know the demo was like really hard to the point that you basically

26
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,660
Couldn't win unless you did exactly the right

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,940
Moves every time every turn

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,220
The the the game as the final game is not quite like that. It's still pretty hard

29
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,180
You got to know what you're doing. You can't fuck around, but there is some leeway in there

30
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,420
You can you can make a few suboptimal decisions, but if you play it optimally 100%

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,740
there is a

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,860
Wind condition in there. There's something you can do in there that is as hard as the demo was

33
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,900
Which is to say there's only one way to do it

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,060
Specifically that is getting to the end without letting Virginia take any damage

35
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,300
You can you can keep Virginia completely safe through the whole thing if you do everything 100%

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Correct and not yeah

37
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,940
Yeah

38
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,580
Well, well one one person actually did it like sauce pirate

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,100
seemingly by accident or maybe maybe just a

40
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,100
They just

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,060
Figured it out and just have just happened to do it the right way or something

42
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:22,000
But yeah, they they they did it that way and I was like wow. I almost and I kind of didn't expect anyone to do it like that

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,700
I

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Feel like once you know

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,420
How long the game is yeah, and like what is expected of you to win?

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,100
Yeah

47
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Because I think one of the playthroughs

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,500
I don't know whether this was on stream or off stream, but I did like optimal plays. I kept Virginia alive

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I got to the end and I'm like, okay. I

50
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,580
have a

51
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,380
ton of slime

52
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,380
That is not useful

53
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,980
Because the amount of damage I will take and the amount of attacks I need to perform. Yeah, do not like deplete it

54
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,220
That much and I can't use it to level up because all my poisons are gone. So that that number is

55
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,340
Like excess slime I can use elsewhere earlier in the run. You mean after the after the big room

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,100
Yeah, after the big room or at some point near the end where it's like yeah

57
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
calculating the amount of

58
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:26,220
Slime I need and I had excess so I knew yeah that I could use that excess earlier in the run to save on like

59
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,500
oh

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,980
No, I think it was like I realized that I could afford to level up earlier and

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,540
Then that excess slime will be used up by my attacks

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,940
Right, and then it was like it was those sorts of realizations that were fun, right? Yeah. Yeah seeing you

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,700
Seeing you like figure something out like oh wait a minute like oh if I oh

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,140
I actually have to dab like if I dab it actually saves slime because then Virginia does the attacks

65
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,900
And I don't have to spend it just like kind of kind of seeing you

66
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,620
Like go from room to room and then in in a particular room

67
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,700
There were there were a couple of times when I was like

68
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,220
This is exactly what I wanted the player to feel like I wanted like I wanted them to get here and die in this specific way

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,060
And realize oh I can't do that what I have to do is this instead, and then I won't die there

70
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
The

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,140
There are

72
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,540
Yeah, so when I when I I added them the anoint command for leveling your weapon up

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,140
and and

74
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,740
Weapon marriage I added them in like a later update kind of just as like a

75
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,420
Joke basically like I added them thinking that they wouldn't even like do anything

76
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,620
But it turns out it created like a completely separate way that you can win

77
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,340
Like I didn't even intend for this to be it to be the case, but it turns out you actually

78
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,080
Well, I made the game thinking you would have to level up to win

79
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,820
But with anoint in the game you actually don't have to level up anymore

80
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,220
You can level up just only by anointing and without level you or you can win with only anointing and not leveling up

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,580
I didn't even mean for that to be the case, but it turns out it is and that's okay

82
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,060
I'm not sure which is like easier. I think it's just like whichever one you kind of

83
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,460
figure out first

84
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Ends up being the way to do it, but they both work

85
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,700
I just think that's pretty funny because I think I didn't mean for it to be useful, but it is

86
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,180
That's like a lot of games

87
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,380
Yeah, they don't they don't have like a one win condition

88
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,060
They have like a bunch of systems that can interact in so many possible

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,580
Permutations the game designer couldn't possibly like account for every possible way

90
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Yeah, I thought because leveling up gives you boost your damage more than

91
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,980
than

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:06,300
Anointing I thought that anointing would not boost it enough to meaningfully make a difference, but it turns out it did

93
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,780
So

94
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,420
Yeah, I am I've been watching my itch

95
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
analytics and

96
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,820
I

97
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,740
Was pleased to see that the game got a little boost the other day from being featured on Equestria daily

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Yeah, a

99
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,100
Lot of people saw that and we're like I can't believe Equestria daily is still

100
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,940
Still posting I can't believe that sethisto

101
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,620
Yeah, I don't know much about what he knows

102
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,780
Okay, it's such an odd thing to put this like Justin does it

103
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,320
I don't know if he does like OC things a lot. Maybe he does. I mean

104
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,620
Well, you remember how it was back in the day, right? I

105
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,460
Mean back in the day if you made anything pony related

106
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,140
You would get like I feel like it had to at least be like relating to the show

107
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,620
Like your thing is almost entirely your own OC and a bunch of slime and

108
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,620
It's like it's barely anything to do with my little pony. That's true. You know on the one hand

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,140
You're totally right on the other hand. I really feel like I

110
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,980
Like I just said that back in the day they would host like

111
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
anything pony

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,660
It's got how much it's got it's got to be drier

113
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,860
Like the wells got to have run even drier these days, right? Like the brony fandom has reduced significantly

114
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,020
There's got to be less to go around. I feel like they'd be hungrier than ever

115
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,860
um, I suppose so but I mean

116
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,500
You're right though. They weren't gonna do it. I'm sure I added sethisto on Twitter just to see if I could maybe entice him and

117
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Nothing happened right away

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,980
And then oblivion fall told me that he like emailed sethisto and like asked

119
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,020
Are he say I don't I don't know if he I don't know if he

120
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,780
Just like recommended it like hey look at this game or if he said like hey so that hey sethisto

121
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,740
Please you know you and I we go back, you know, we're we're best friends, uh, please as a personal favorite

122
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,980
I know it's embarrassing. I know Ben Saint is like a is like a weird freak and nobody would

123
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,180
Nor is ordinary circumstances want to be associated with please please let me call you know

124
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,140
I you know, I gave you my kidney that one time you were you know dying of alcohol poisoning

125
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,740
And you needed a new a new some new organs like please just I'm trying to call it in that favor now

126
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,140
Please just feature Ben Saint stupid little slime game on your pony website. Thank you and good night. I

127
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
Don't know which of those two things happened

128
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,100
I mean, I feel like Seth has always been consistently pretty cool. I

129
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,500
So like I'm sure I'm sure once it's been brought to his attention. He'd read it out like the blurb

130
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,620
I mean, wow, this is pretty funny. I mean, I look up ponies like I think I can see him just being like, oh cool

131
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,340
I don't really know any what he's like at all. So maybe you're right. I just I got no idea

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,900
I would think of you. Yeah, there was a blurb on the site that

133
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,780
Seemed it's see, I don't know. I guess he wrote it

134
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,420
So and it seemed like pretty genuinely appreciative of it. So yeah, maybe he saw it was like, uh, lol, what is this?

135
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Which should be cool

136
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,220
Yeah, I'm joking about the the other option

137
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm joking with the liver, but if Clayson wasn't clear, I don't think that that actually I don't think that that actually happened

138
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,820
Although I can't prove that it didn't

139
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,820
Um

140
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:53,540
Yes, and then um, I yeah, uh, oh, yeah side cyber shell played the game and posted his results

141
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,900
And I asked him if you wanted to come on this episode. He said he couldn't make it this week, but it will have him on

142
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,820
Someday one of these days soon and I'll ask him. I don't know to tell me that the game is good

143
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
And then he will

144
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:19,340
Uh, any oh, yeah, anyway, check it check out check out my analytics. Let's look at these analytics in the general

145
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,780
There they are. What flag is that? I think it's uh, is it bisexual?

146
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,820
Let's say it looks like one of those four different purples. It's like super bisexual. There's even more shades

147
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,620
You know what? This is this is four four distinct shades of purple instead of three

148
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:44,480
It's bisexual, but it it it specifically excludes the possibility of being like equally

149
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,140
Attracted to to men or women. It's like yeah

150
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,620
You can be you can be bi and you could be into one and the other, but you can't ever be perfectly

151
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,860
Perfectly in the middle. You always got to lean one side or another

152
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm taking the stand and I'm fine with the L's and the B's and the G's and the T's

153
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,740
But the B's that are like I mean I'm kind of in the middle like nah those specifically those ones

154
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't put their liars. They're just lying. They got to have a preference. That's what this flag means. I

155
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
sected more like by

156
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
Fercated by

157
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,960
No, um

158
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,640
The word I was looking for was defenestrated, but that's not that's not right. He forested

159
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,260
D-flowered

160
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,500
So what what's the yeah use the um, that's a big jump

161
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,660
Yeah, that was that was the day after the equestria daily feature

162
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,020
Uh, as you can see, so it actually had as you can see it got yeah, it actually did it got it got like um

163
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,020
Because it's not just on the website. It was also on the equestria daily

164
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,180
Instagram

165
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,500
And I saw the instagram got like a hundred or two hundred likes on the on the phantoms revenge post

166
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
That was pretty funny

167
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,100
But okay, what's interesting to me here is these colors, right?

168
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,860
Because there's four of these colors and these mean something um

169
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,100
They are these are these represent the sources that of the traffic

170
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,340
uh that

171
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,180
Okay, so

172
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,540
On the left see there's like the the purple on the top and then like a middle purple in the middle and then pink on the bottom

173
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,220
The the the top purple is on the far left not the not the blue we'll get to that later

174
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,340
On the left the purple is from twitter

175
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,900
And then the middle purple is from my website stcomics.com

176
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,060
And then the bottom pink is from itch.io

177
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,100
I think what that means is people just discovering it organically on the website scrolling. Yeah. Yeah, which is good

178
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Like that's what I want the most of

179
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,460
Uh, because I think what that means is people who had never seen

180
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,300
You know my stuff before just finding it on the site like oh, what is this?

181
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,980
um

182
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:09,100
And then see yeah on the the day it gets the big spike that big up blue blue is from equestria daily.com

183
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,980
but you know encouragingly

184
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,380
uh the uh

185
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,900
Yeah, the pink bar the people discovering it on itch got got a boost too somehow. I don't know

186
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
um

187
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,340
Maybe that means people were going to the website and typing it in the search bar and finding it that way

188
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,820
It could be that or it could be like increased traffic

189
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,100
boosts the algorithm of itch and so it gets shown

190
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,300
It's like oh, this is a hot new thing. There's loads of people looking at it and then more people would find it via itch

191
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,380
I can't do anything

192
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah, maybe I I hope so and then uh that last day that's

193
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,580
Uh, that's today. So like, you know, it's still 10 a.m. So I'm hoping

194
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,620
I'm hoping that you know by the end of today it gets maybe it's has as many or maybe even more than uh yesterday

195
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
um, I don't know

196
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
but uh, yeah, so

197
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,540
You know people are are finding it through the website, which is good because you know, I would I hoped that the game would appeal not mere

198
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,500
I hoped that the game would appeal for its gameplay and for its puzzle elements to you know, just people that like

199
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
in video games, uh

200
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,660
and not necessarily just to people who uh

201
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,860
Have read the comic although, you know, obviously it's got the story in there that is directly tied into the comic and all that

202
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,180
Uh, so it's nice to see some people. Uh, just just find in it. That's very encouraging

203
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Yeah, yeah

204
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,060
What else? What else? It's been good job. Nice game. Thanks. I'm proud of the game

205
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
I think it came out really good

206
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,540
uh, I want

207
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,940
more people to play it. I think I have

208
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,540
200 and something downloads now and I don't know like what

209
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,860
You know like in in terms of youtube numbers like that's terrible like 200 views of a video is like well

210
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Get out of here. I don't know

211
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,220
like

212
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,740
That's gotta be better on itch. I don't know. That's probably I feel like that's probably a lot for just some game that someone posts on itch

213
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,380
I don't know if that's like if I should feel good about that number or bad about that number

214
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,820
Well, I don't have access to

215
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
uh pumpkin alley

216
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,460
like

217
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,140
Not not that i'm not that it's a contest or anything

218
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,220
No, no, no, no, I'm trying to see like if there's like a trend

219
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,660
What I have hippo not tries not to die from skeletons on

220
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,780
It's the analytics on that one. How do I find this?

221
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Uh, if you go to your dashboard

222
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,140
Oh, shit, this doesn't go all the way back. No, it goes back to november 2021, but this was uploaded before that

223
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
It must be somewhere

224
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,500
Hmm

225
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,940
I so I um, yeah

226
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,780
I released a patch like two days or after release. I released a patch because there were some uh

227
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,620
There were a couple of little minor things that I had missed

228
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,620
and uh

229
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,420
I I had to I deleted the original file

230
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,100
And I uploaded a new file version 1.1

231
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,420
That's what you can download on the site now and I made a little development log

232
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,900
A patch notes page that explains like what all the changes are. It's all really minor stuff

233
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,660
um

234
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,340
But I but uh because it deleted the original file

235
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,220
It deleted the the record of like how many downloads that file had and I was like, oh, no

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,860
Now i'm gonna lose my analytics data

237
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,780
About you know, how many downloads the game has but no

238
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,940
It remembers how many downloads the page has had separately from how many downloads that particular file has had

239
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,260
So I did not lose that

240
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Information so I know that it's 200 and

241
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,300
200 and like and 230 I think I pulled up. Um

242
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,900
Uh hippo tries not to die from skeletons when it came out

243
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,780
Or after I made a video about it. It got like 200 views. That was the spike

244
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,300
Mm-hmm, and then way later in like 2019 you got 50 views somehow. I don't know why

245
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,740
Was it like was it like uh, was it like

246
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,500
When oblivion fall made that uh made that uh

247
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,860
Uh the the cuphead animation, uh, I don't know could be

248
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,620
I feel like that was earlier, but it maybe is that then from that point, uh

249
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,980
Yeah, I don't I don't know. I haven't looked at the um dashboard analytic stuff that much

250
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,140
Phantom's revenge

251
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,100
To where I'm sitting at. Oh, no. Oh it passed 207 250

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,060
2174 views 277 downloads

253
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
It's not enough. It's not enough

254
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
When I hit a thousand downloads

255
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
When I hit a thousand downloads, uh

256
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Where can I shill it?

257
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,340
Where can I shill it?

258
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,860
Harder

259
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Maybe I should like email some

260
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Could I email some gaming games journalists about it? Maybe I don't know

261
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,180
Uh, yeah, I don't know about that. I don't know how that works

262
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:23,660
I don't know. I you know, I tried I sent a couple emails about endless war to some like games journals once

263
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Uh, it nothing ever happened

264
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
uh

265
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,740
I mean

266
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,780
I could try it again now that I have a game with graphics

267
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,140
These fucking hacks need their need the baby needs their bottle. I guess game journals need their graphics

268
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
On their video games

269
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
I guess

270
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,220
Anyway, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, two 250 241

271
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,980
Views of that game hippo tries not to die

272
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
30 28 downloads

273
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,540
On on the peak and then there's a bunch of other ones. How do I find like the just just just on like one day?

274
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,500
Yeah, that was the the the peak is the same like 200 something views

275
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,700
The 28 downloads of that shitty little like who cares thing

276
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,180
But you're talking that's that was the day like the day it got the most

277
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,780
Traffic is what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

278
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:35,100
Uh, um, hmm. Well, if you go to yeah, if you go to dashboard

279
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,940
Oh, wait, I'll download counts 548 people downloaded hippo tries not to die

280
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,260
Hmm. That's my target. That's my glass ceiling. I got a breakthrough

281
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,380
Uh

282
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Yeah, it's an it's a new creator dashboard

283
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,220
Did I did I talk did I mention the ukraine bundle? I think I did last episode

284
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,700
I think yeah, we did

285
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,580
The the games on there are so fucking ridiculous

286
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,140
You get the you get minute you get Celeste

287
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,100
You get the kingdom 2

288
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,460
You get there's like there's like a bunch of like

289
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Games like everybody should play

290
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,580
On there. Yeah

291
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:26,220
I when I noticed was super hot, which is when I wanted to play but I couldn't be bothered to pay for it

292
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,220
Hmm. Do you have do you have a vr rig?

293
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Uh, my brother does

294
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,060
Oh, oh bob. Oh my god. Yeah, baba is you and a short hiker on there

295
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,980
Already had those but that is nice. I did already have a short hike. I did not have the baba is you

296
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,140
So I might I might play that actually I already had I actually already had

297
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,940
Celeste and minute and a short hike, but like

298
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,580
Any one of those games is worth the ten dollars for the bundle. So I got the baba is you so I might play the baba as you know

299
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,340
I think one of the baba is you I think one of the baba is you guys worked on noida

300
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,660
I feel like I remember that factoid somewhere. I

301
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Can't don't quote me on that

302
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,300
um

303
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,180
Anyway, this week has felt really long because

304
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
The the day that I put the game out

305
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,940
Felt like it it felt like an entire week went by

306
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,700
It's like watching. I don't know just watching like the numbers go up and like hearing people like, you know

307
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Responding to people on twitter being like, oh, I can't beat it games too hard

308
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,100
It's it seems like it seems like people can beat it in

309
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,220
The number of tries varies from like, you know, half a dozen to maybe like up to like 20

310
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,780
But it seems like it takes people around like four to six hours or so

311
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,220
Of you know, try and shit and figuring it out

312
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,100
To to to figure it out. Yeah, how long was my stream like three hours your stream was about three hours. Yeah

313
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,420
Yeah, it took me like

314
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Maybe two hours after that off stream

315
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,260
Mm-hmm

316
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,540
Steel viper said it took them like four or five hours

317
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,460
That seems that seems to be about where it's settling

318
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,100
which is uh

319
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
I don't know that might be

320
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,580
Maybe it's long. Maybe it's long, but uh, whatever

321
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I hope that um

322
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,820
I hope that uh, it's gratifying when when you when if people can stick with it

323
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,500
And you know have that realization. Uh-huh. I found out what I need

324
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,780
I figured I would need to do and then execute on it and get to the end

325
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,940
I hope people will be like

326
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,380
Yeah, it was worth it. It was it was worth my my energy

327
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,900
My precious my precious spirit energy my precious time on this earth was uh

328
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
spent well enough

329
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,620
uh

330
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,340
If unless you have anything else, I don't know. Do you is there anything else to say about that at the moment?

331
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,260
Um, I don't know. I mean I I liked it. I enjoyed uh the figuring out of stuff

332
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,980
Yeah, it's very polished and cool looking

333
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,820
Thank you

334
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,420
and the

335
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,860
the story

336
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,100
And the the face the face of I guess we can't I don't really want to spoil like exactly what happens

337
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,460
I know you everyone knows that it's his phantom's revenge and nightstar is involved

338
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:36,060
Nice. I mean nightstar is on the um her little her little gift and the thing is on is on the store page. So uh, yeah

339
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,060
Yeah, so there's no reason to like spoil what happens, but I really like that one face

340
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,980
That one face. Yeah, I yeah, that's good. It's a good face

341
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,140
uh the

342
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,020
I have been um, I have been retweeting people that uh

343
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:56,380
At me or hashtag phantom's revenge with the screenshots of their you know win

344
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Uh, I have not

345
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,980
I won't I don't retweet ones that include the entire screen because the entire screen shows

346
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,740
Spoilers, so if you want me to retweet you just uh, just crop that out. Just show your stats. Oh, yeah the um

347
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
You know what I want to mention the

348
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,620
The patch I did here's here's what I did in the

349
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,820
The the v version 1.1 patch notes

350
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,780
Uh, oh, yeah, this is funny

351
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,020
Did you know that the the the damage that the son that the squirt gun soniches did it was just wrong

352
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,100
They simply did not do the amount of damage that it said they were doing

353
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,140
I yeah, I think I saw somebody talk about that somewhere

354
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,820
Uh, and I it was so I I had no idea that it was incorrect. I just assumed that what I was looking at

355
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,980
Was truth. It's uh, the insect was a lie. I don't think it would have made that much difference

356
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Really in in terms of like

357
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,540
Although I do remember that on the stream at one point you said like

358
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,740
Oh, I it's it seems important that the squirt gun damage deals more damage than attacking

359
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:14,620
Costs slime and it turns out that that's not true. I mean, yeah, yeah the the okay

360
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,220
So what what happened was I I figured it out. Um

361
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,220
These squirt guns were meant to do 960 damage

362
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,660
And it calculates the damage they should do as 960, but then to actually deal the damage

363
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,620
It because you know when you're taking the damage your your slime number like

364
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,580
You know it it actively like rolls down, you know, it doesn't just change number

365
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,300
So it deals a fraction of that damage every frame the animation is playing

366
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,500
And it turns out that the animation was only 20 frames and I thought it was 25 frames

367
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:56,700
So it only dealt four fifths of the intended damage. So it dealt 768 instead of 960

368
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,260
Uh, but you know the game was all balanced around the amount of damage they were actually doing

369
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:11,180
So I just changed it to be 768 to preserve the balance. So now it's now at version 1.1

370
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
It actually says 768

371
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,140
It feels like a really strange way to

372
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
To calculate the damage something takes

373
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:25,260
You think so like for for every frame of animation like if you ever wanted to change an animation

374
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Everything would be shifted

375
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
right

376
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Um

377
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Yes

378
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Yes, if I if I changed the if I changed how long

379
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,060
Okay, well, here's what happens. Here's what happens the the sonichu squirts a bullet, right?

380
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,260
It creates a bullet object the bullet object moves to

381
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,820
Uh, the player or the the the hero being targeted

382
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,340
Uh, then when it reaches their location

383
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,340
The bullet destroys itself and creates a new object

384
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,900
That is called hit splash and it's a little has a little like splash like to show like water splashing off of them

385
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,860
and then that hit splash animation depending on whether the bullet was shot by a

386
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,540
Uh, a squirt gun sonichu or a super soaker sonichu

387
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,940
It it has a lifetime value that is set to either

388
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,300
A long value or a short value and then it counts down that value until zero and then it destroys itself

389
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,900
And so that lifetime value determines how many frames

390
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460
the object lasts

391
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,380
And so for the super sonichu it only the lifetime value it was set at at 20

392
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,940
And so it it exists for 20 frames

393
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,820
And then it dies. So yeah, if I were to change how long that

394
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,940
Uh lasted it would change the amount of damage that was that was being dealt

395
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,100
uh

396
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
actually the the number is like

397
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,300
The number of damage is actually based on

398
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:11,740
Phantoms starting slime level. So if I changed phantom starting slime level all the sonichus and all of both types

399
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,820
Would suddenly deal a different amount of damage because they calculate a value based on his starting level

400
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,700
And then they take that number and then they do the thing of like, okay

401
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,300
They divide it about by the number of frames and then they do a fraction of it every frame

402
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,340
That's I mean, that's how I achieved the uh the effect of like his his uh,

403
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,300
You know his slime count like, you know rolling down as he takes damage

404
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,460
I probably there probably was a another way to do it

405
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,620
It seems overly complicated and relies on like multiple different things aligning perfectly

406
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,580
Uh, it might it might be

407
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
To tell you the truth. There's another thing

408
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,260
I mean, there's probably a lot of things like that. Um

409
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,300
The screen shake like when

410
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,780
Okay, like when phantom takes damage, there's a screen shake effect

411
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,180
uh

412
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:11,100
Let me tell you what doesn't happen in that in when the screen shakes the game does not

413
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
render an image of itself

414
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,980
And then shake the image what actually happens is

415
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
uh

416
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,700
Is that the game goes through a list of every object that exists in the game

417
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,860
Selects those objects that I decided these things shake during the screen shake effect

418
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,860
And then takes those actual objects and moves them

419
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
around according to

420
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
a continually varying

421
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,340
Uh variable well first it records their initial position

422
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,380
And then it takes it creates a shake object that randomly

423
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,460
Varies through a shake variable and then it takes every object that is considered shakeable

424
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,020
And then it shakes them around and moves them around their starting position

425
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,980
And then it like ends and then it returns them to their starting location

426
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,460
And then it destroys itself and then the shake is over

427
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,420
uh, so

428
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,220
Very stupid and inefficient and bad way to do that

429
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Uh, but that's what I do

430
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,780
I mean, it's funny because like you play the game and it just it nothing feels wrong

431
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,740
It's just sort of like yeah, it's a screen shaker. It's this is a jumping thing. It doesn't feel wrong

432
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,500
But under under the hood it's totally wrong and it's totally fucked up and bizarre and like

433
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,500
you know

434
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Somebody I for I forget who it was

435
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,260
Someone on the endless war dev team at some point

436
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,260
Like someone was looking at the the endless war code and someone DMed me to be like ben

437
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,700
I'm looking at the code you wrote for endless war

438
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
And it is so bad

439
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,660
To the point that I am convinced that it has memetic qualities

440
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,980
Like that's what they that's what they say

441
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,100
What were they referring to I don't exactly know

442
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,740
They I they just thought that my code was so bad and so like counterintuitive that it was like

443
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,780
A joke it was like I'd written it as a joke

444
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,740
That's what they said anyway, I don't know there. I'm sure they I'm sure it wasn't that I'm sure it was fine

445
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,220
um

446
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,500
the

447
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,820
But it doesn't matter if the the end result is good

448
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,740
It just depends on how long how much extra time you may have taken to make something happen

449
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,900
Yeah with a convoluted way like that. Yeah, uh

450
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,780
Yeah, there's probably a bunch of stuff in there that I did the hard way because I just didn't know there was an easy way to do it

451
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,180
Uh, but you know that's learning

452
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,380
Uh folks

453
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,300
I mean

454
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,460
That's video games and you know and you know what like what's like what's the alternative?

455
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,980
Like that I feel like maybe there's some people that might hear that and be frustrated like ah ben

456
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,260
Like why didn't you just like learn game design first? Like why didn't you like study?

457
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,100
I don't know computer science first or something and I'm like well

458
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,220
That would it take like

459
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,580
Yeah, it made the game take longer that I didn't know

460
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,140
The right way to do these things

461
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,460
But how much longer than that would it have taken for me to like become educated beforehand?

462
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
Before I could have I would have even started

463
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,100
Making the game. You know what I mean?

464
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,500
Actually, it's funny. I actually feel like

465
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,180
You're

466
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,580
You're like higher education your physics degree and your your knowledge of mathematics you already have

467
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,340
Probably made you think of these more convoluted ways of doing it than if you were like a real dumb dumb

468
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Hmm

469
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,940
What do you mean your brain is so a bit like like my brain's so big that I it's like that episode of

470
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,700
Mordecai and rigby regular show where they become so smart that the nobody can understand them anymore

471
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,180
That's like my code

472
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,420
It's like if I were trying to do something I'd be like, um, I don't know one plus one

473
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,420
How do I figure this out? And I would look at tutorials and being like all this

474
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
I wouldn't think to do it so convolutedly

475
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,380
Well, I wouldn't even know how to think about that. You know, you know what?

476
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:25,420
Something like screen shake. I probably could have just googled like

477
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,100
screen shake effect in game maker and just seen how people

478
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:37,260
How other people figure theirs out because like there are there are there are there are things in game maker that I don't even understand like

479
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,060
apparently like the game

480
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,300
it renders

481
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,140
all these sprites

482
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,660
onto a

483
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Quote unquote screen, right? There is a thing in the game called a screen

484
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,540
Which you you can basically just quote unquote shake, right?

485
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,700
So I probably could have just googled it and I would have found that out and it probably would have made my life easier

486
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,180
I just didn't think

487
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,260
I just thought like okay the game is the game is drawing these pixels

488
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
I have to make the pixels move

489
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
somehow well

490
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:18,300
The the the the sprites are tied to objects. Well, I guess I got to make the objects move or I got to make the objects draw their sprites

491
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,820
Just just the most the most intuitive way that I thought to do it was well

492
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,580
I got to make the objects move

493
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
I got to make the objects move to make the screen shake

494
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,620
Turns out game maker kind of has a built-in thing that sort of means that you don't have to do that

495
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I I guess I was like

496
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:44,380
I did oh, I I did use a tutorial like the first thing that I did the first the very first thing that I did when I started making the game

497
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,220
was I looked up tutorials for how to build a like a

498
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
jrpg battle menu

499
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
and I followed tutorials from

500
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,220
A guy I think he was called game maker rob was the youtube channel

501
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
He had just a tutorial series about it

502
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,300
And I just walked through with him making a thing

503
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,460
It took me like three days. I think of following his tutorials to get a menu going

504
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,820
Which seems like I remember at the time being like oh, this has taken me so long. I just want to be done with it

505
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Now in hindsight, it's like wow three days

506
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,060
Little that I know this shit would take me like 13 months

507
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,220
Uh

508
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,700
Oh, well, uh, but um

509
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Yeah, so I I followed that tutorial and uh, it was kind of annoying

510
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,500
And he you know, he was building like a rpg magic menu. So it has stuff in there

511
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,460
He's got magic. There's a magic option

512
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,060
There's spells. They don't do anything but there is like

513
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,380
So yeah, so in the phantom's revenge code there is like, you know

514
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,980
No, uh annotated out code for like

515
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,940
A man a magic option in the uh, you know in the battle menu and whatever

516
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,580
Uh, that was like the foundation that I built everything else on and then every time I wanted to add a new command

517
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,260
I'd be like, okay. Well, let's take a command that I already have

518
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,580
Like duplicate it and then like whichever one is closest to what I'm envisioning duplicate it and then just you know

519
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,420
Make make such changes as are required to turn it into the new command that I wanted to be

520
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,900
um

521
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,500
yeah

522
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I

523
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
I don't know I

524
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,060
I'm I'm I'm actually like

525
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,460
I know I know that it was not

526
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,140
I know that I didn't do everything in the most efficient way possible

527
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,900
But how was I but like how am I supposed to know?

528
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,260
What what am I supposed to do about the fact that I don't know?

529
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,980
What am I supposed to do about the fact that I don't know the optimal way to do everything because right?

530
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,500
If I wanted if I wanted to be like, oh, well, let me first. I'll learn everything about game design

531
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,860
I'll learn everything about programming before I start making my game and then I'll know the optimal way to do everything

532
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,940
And then I'll you know, and then I'll do everything as efficiently as possible. Well, sure

533
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,500
But then I'll how I'll never I'll never start making the game, right?

534
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,100
I'll just you'll get caught in that thing with like, oh, I'm I'm not ready. I'm not ready to work on this thing

535
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,780
I have to um that that is true. That is a potential trap. I have to prepare for it. I have to like no

536
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,860
I'm not ready. I have to I have to study more before I can start it. I'm not good enough

537
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,660
you know

538
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
I'm never worried about not being good enough

539
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,380
Um, because I'll never be good enough. So whatever

540
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,060
Yeah, that's that's the best way you could ever look at anything

541
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,780
It is I'll never be good enough. I'll never be good. I'll never be good enough. So you to fuck it

542
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,700
I know that I'll it'll suck whenever I end up doing it. So might as well suck now

543
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,420
Why wait suck now die later

544
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,140
true

545
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,740
uh speaking of sucking and dying and video games

546
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,700
Uh, I've been playing Hades this week after after the game came out

547
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
I was like, I want to play a video game

548
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:14,220
I I started playing Hades famously the reason I started playing Noita was because

549
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,940
Someone recommended me and my old roommate Lorenz recommended me Hades

550
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,700
And I went to download it and then as it was downloading I saw steam recommending me Noida

551
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,500
And I went and I looked at the demo for that or the the the trailer and I was like, what the fuck is this?

552
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,620
And I downloaded Noida and then I played that for a year and then I never played Hades Lamal

553
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,980
Well, but I'm playing Hades now and it's really good

554
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
It's really fucking good. Do you?

555
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,300
Do you know about it? I I do know about it. It's the company that made um

556
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,540
bastion

557
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,100
Yes, and uh and and transistor

558
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
Yeah, they they have that

559
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,420
distinct

560
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,500
Isometric sort of style. Yeah camera angle thing

561
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,780
I submit isometric camera angle and uh like strummy like folk guitar

562
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
I don't know what you'd call it

563
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:21,420
Like a sort of like uh, I don't know what you would call that style of guitar, but there's a very specific

564
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,500
It maybe I don't know. Um, but there's a very

565
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,380
particular sort of strummy guitar soundtrack they have and sometimes

566
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,300
Sometimes that soundtrack the Hades sounds like that and I'm like, oh, yeah, this is a super giant game

567
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,100
I didn't play bastion and I didn't play transistor

568
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,740
and I also didn't play um

569
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,100
Do you know about their weird like fantasy basketball game?

570
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:53,180
No, uh, it's not it's um, hold on, uh, you play basketball in an isometric perspective

571
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,060
It's not actually basketball. It's a

572
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,900
But it's like a it's like a sort of it's like a fantasy sport game

573
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,220
That is sort of like basketball because it involves moving a ball to a goal

574
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,460
um

575
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,020
That's all sports. Yeah, pretty much, uh, pie. It's called pyre

576
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,380
It's a it's about um

577
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,980
I watched a video about super giant games one time and that guy said that like he pyre was his favorite

578
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,220
It's it was not successful

579
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,260
Uh, it's like their worst performing game ever

580
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,740
Uh, because a lot of people didn't get it, but this guy really liked it

581
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,620
because it's like, um

582
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:40,460
It's not like in universe. It's about like a band of nomads that have been exiled from some

583
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,300
country, but like they're part of this like weird spiritual, uh culture and they have to do these like

584
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,700
Rituals and like the the the the game it's not the game is like the ritual. They're doing this like

585
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,340
Ritual, but it's like a competitive ritual to see like who can I don't know

586
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Make the sacrifice first or whatever

587
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,420
I don't it's very weird

588
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,020
Yeah, pyre is their other game people don't know that one as much people don't talk about it as much as bastion and transistor

589
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,580
Uh, but anyway

590
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Yeah, I haven't played any of those games

591
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,940
I uh, I haven't played them in either. There's something about the

592
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,700
camera angle that that perspective that I I

593
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I don't like for some reason

594
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,180
Yeah, I know I I kind of know what you mean. There's something about it

595
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,860
I don't I don't know. Yeah, like it's it's objectively a good way to

596
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,700
Depict what they're doing for for the gameplay

597
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,580
You can see a lot of the the the place and you can dodge around if it was in first person

598
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,620
It would be maybe disorienting if it was side-scrolling then there wouldn't be a lot of depth

599
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,420
And uh, if it was completely top-down, I mean, it would be the same I guess

600
00:42:54,620 --> 00:43:00,140
That's just something about it. There's just like unappealing visually not like because of art style

601
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,980
It's just that that view. I don't like it. I get it. It reminds me of like shitty gba games

602
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:10,940
For some reason that I didn't enjoy like like there was this fucking spiral game that was on Game Boy Advance

603
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're talking about like season of ice and fire or something

604
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,380
It feels yeah, it felt it felt cheap a little bit

605
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,420
Honestly, yeah, like that. I know the exactly the spire you're talking about. I've played it. It was like a cheap knockoff

606
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,980
I feel yeah

607
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,140
It's not fair, but yeah, I also feel like something about that it kind of looks cheap

608
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,580
Like I never I was not impressed by what I saw of bastion

609
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
And transistor. I mean they looked fine

610
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,220
I'm like I got it, but I was not enticed to play them

611
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,020
but people told me that Hades is uh, like a

612
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,140
You know a rogue a rogue light

613
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:55,500
With like really like fun combat deez nuts. Hey, hey deez nuts. And so

614
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,620
Yeah, I was like, okay, that sounds like my kind of game. So I gave it a try and yep. It's my kind of game

615
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,980
Uh, it's I really appreciate

616
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,380
Do you know the story?

617
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:12,060
I really appreciate it. I I assume from what I've seen that it's Hades son

618
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,740
And he's like, I don't go fuck and Hades like um, you do have to go fuck and then he fights all the gods

619
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:24,780
Some something like that. Uh, you don't fight the gods the gods are the gods give you boons because they want to help you escape

620
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,380
Uh, but it's really good because um the conceit of the game

621
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,180
This is this is what we call ludo narrative. Uh, whatever the opposite

622
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:40,620
I've had the same thing the other day. I couldn't think of ludo narrative assonance

623
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Synergy, whatever. Yeah, uh

624
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,540
When you uh, because the story of the game

625
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,900
The story of the protagonist and the story of the player are the same

626
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:57,660
Because you know, he too he keeps going out and trying to escape and dying and getting reborn in the pool of sticks or whatever

627
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,140
And he's got to try again

628
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,900
He you know for him it's a pardon the expression, you know

629
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,500
This sycophie and task of you know, just going and trying over and over and over again

630
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,300
And for you and that's what you the player are doing as well

631
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,260
You're trying over and over and over again making it a little bit further each time

632
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,980
Uh, very good. Very good. Uh, they really were like

633
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,100
Hey, why don't we make the why don't we make the story fit the gameplay and then they did

634
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
Uh, I really appreciate that

635
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,340
The best ludo narrative synergy is when you die in the game you die for real

636
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:38,380
You you can either yeah, there's you could either make it so that you know, the character never really dies

637
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,740
He just gets reborn over and over, you know, that's one way but that's for cowards. Yeah, the better way is

638
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,260
You die in the game

639
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:54,220
The game the game shoots you with a VR headset with a gun attached and when you die the gun goes off

640
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,940
Uh

641
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,940
Really heightens the uh

642
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,940
It heightens the drama

643
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,180
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

644
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,180
That would be a black mirror episode of some sort of cheesy like

645
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,220
Post like future scary future scary story where it's like

646
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,740
Everyone was playing vr, but they didn't know there was a fucking little bomb inside and if they died in the game

647
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,380
The bomb would go off in the future and they couldn't take that vr helmet off for no reason

648
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,580
Can you believe that in the degenerate future? You know

649
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:33,420
Humanity has humanity has regressed so much. We're so we're so like dopamine star that like people are even

650
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,820
People are playing vr games

651
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,940
They they can't even get off on regular vr games anymore

652
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,540
Now they have to play vr games with a little bomb in the headset

653
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,420
That will go off and make them die if they lose. It's the only way they can feel anything anymore

654
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,220
Uh, it's the future

655
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,620
I mean it sure that'll be invented by some crazy person and then they'll stream it and everyone will be saying no

656
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,740
I mean at that it's like, you know, I mean people die doing uh

657
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,620
Doing uh, what do you call it? Uh, auto erotic?

658
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Auto auto erotic asphyxiation

659
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,940
Uh, so, you know, that's like, oh, you know the little the danger is what makes it is what makes it good. So

660
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,940
Uh, same, you know say but for but for gameplay instead of orgasms

661
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,660
uh

662
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,660
Good good video game

663
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:32,220
Uh, I think I I I I my first my first win my first win was with the rail

664
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:36,220
Uh, the the rail gun that's uh, that's how I got my first

665
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,780
win although

666
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:42,700
The story the story continues even after you quote-unquote win like

667
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:49,980
Just uh winning is not enough. You have to you have to do more beyond that. So I'm still

668
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,980
I've been playing it for like three or four days now. Uh, it's really good

669
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,620
Uh, that's like other than watching my analytics. That's like all I've been doing

670
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,540
Uh, I deserve it. I deserve a break

671
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,740
Yes, yeah video game I video games are good for you actually

672
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,700
Uh, I was gonna say this this segue earlier when you're talking about a patch, but the there will be

673
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:24,620
Uh, I'm not sure when but definitely like within the next few days as of recording a patch for pumpkin alley

674
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,300
Oh

675
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,820
Did you already do a patch that like changed the uh the falling thing?

676
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,020
No, no, we that was the patch I was talking about we were making and um,

677
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,380
It's not out yet because we there was a there was a complication with some people on some computers

678
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,460
max

679
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,300
Couldn't open the photo album from the menu and some people in different countries had like

680
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,180
Uh, the the the tutorial signs like not work with the text

681
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,740
It's there's a there's a bit of like

682
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,620
Fixing of a very specific little bugs

683
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,300
Um, but we it's very close to being

684
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
Done, uh, there's also

685
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,220
A new lizard

686
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,220
In this new no fucking way

687
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,100
There's a new lizard. Oh, and um

688
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,900
There's a bunch of changes to like the speed of characters and a bit of jumping tweaks and

689
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,300
It's a lot of little things. So it's not like it's not gonna be like

690
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,660
We're not gonna continue making patches over and over again

691
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:30,300
This is just gonna be this one time because there was a bunch of like kind of important bugs

692
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,060
And we thought we may as well like tidy up some stuff

693
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:40,140
While we were doing it and then this is this is the this is the pumpkin patch. We're calling it

694
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,020
Huh, and then that's great

695
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,500
and then later

696
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
We'll be the next patch will be the

697
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:51,500
Fucking finished game or however we we want to to do that

698
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,340
We might have an alpha for like kickstarter back as if we make a a

699
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,140
A kickstarter for to to fund it

700
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,740
You mean we're looking into that at the moment, but yeah the alpha

701
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,220
Uh, what are you gonna do for the for the alpha version?

702
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,420
What do you mean?

703
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,860
You you said you're gonna do a patch and then you're gonna do one more update and that's gonna be the alpha version

704
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,140
No, the no no no the the patch. This is just for the demo. We're talking about the hotfix for the demo

705
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,700
Yeah, and then when we make the full game

706
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,540
Oh, right

707
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:32,300
That's the next time you'll see any of new stuff. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, yeah, it makes sense

708
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,100
Uh, so

709
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,540
So if you have played the demo already, there is reason for you to play the new one because of the new lizard

710
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,740
Uh, yeah, I wanted to yeah, I watched I watched keyblade spirit

711
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,700
stream the

712
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,580
Herself playing the demo and she found lizards that I had not even heard of before

713
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,420
I didn't know about the white lizard. That's exciting

714
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,620
Yeah, so I still have not found

715
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,940
The red one and the white one and I think maybe one other one or maybe it was just those two

716
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:13,900
And then I guess there's another one now that I'll have to hunt down

717
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,140
Uh

718
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
Pretty pretty cool. I like those

719
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:25,100
I call them surprise lizards because they make the little they make what sounds to me like the little alert noise from

720
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,620
Metal gear solid

721
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,820
There's something like that

722
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,260
Oh

723
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:39,820
I was gonna mention, uh, yeah for the the phantom's revenge patch the patch notes. Here's here's what I did

724
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,100
Uh

725
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:47,420
Yeah, so the squirt gun damage, uh, I didn't change the damage that they actually dealt. I just changed the number

726
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Well, well, I fixed the code so that

727
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:58,300
It's it it intentionally deals the 768 and then I changed the number. So it actually says like, okay, this is how much it actually deals

728
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,060
um, there was a mistake in the

729
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,700
Virginia's sprite not in her normal sprite, but when she was sad in the chambers where she's sad

730
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,260
Uh, her tail had like a visual error in it where like

731
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,060
The impression of her like wings sort of like was taking like a chunk out of her tail

732
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,540
It was kind of hard to see but if you watched it, you could you could see it. It looked a little yeah, I mentioned that

733
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,780
Yeah, that's right. You did. Um, yeah. Yeah, I forgot it was you

734
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:35,100
Uh, uh, so I fixed that that's fixed. Um, I I made it so that the end screen displays

735
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,100
the end screen used to display your, uh

736
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,460
What was it your your time to beat your slime coin your

737
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,860
Uh, your virginia's status your horn status

738
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:58,940
Uh, probably maybe one I forget. Anyway added it now displays your final level and your final, uh, weapon skill or your weapon mastery level

739
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,180
because um

740
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:06,540
You know, it's there's since there's different routes, right since you can take a leveling route or uh

741
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,500
Or an anointing route. I thought it would be good to show like, okay. What's your final level?

742
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,940
What's your final

743
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,380
Anoint status so you can be like, oh, that's how you want. Okay, because those are those are relevant. Those are worth

744
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,300
knowing about

745
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,740
Um, and then oh, I changed it. You said this as well

746
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,620
You thought it was a mistake that uh, the final boss when you when you exclamation point data on the final boss

747
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,500
It shows her max hp, but it doesn't show

748
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,340
Her it doesn't update when you damage her. Yeah, that was not a mistake. I was just lazy

749
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:43,580
Uh, but I fixed that so now now it displays

750
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,940
Her her current hp as a fraction of her

751
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:53,260
Total hp so it says like, you know 2000 20 000 out of you know, 3000 32

752
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,180
1500

753
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,620
um

754
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,620
The inner lad spoilers that number

755
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,580
Uh, don't worry about it

756
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,540
Uh the um

757
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:10,300
The inner lab music before I had forgotten to fix the inner lab music to loop

758
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,540
So if you if you played it long enough

759
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,100
The inner this is when you get past the the spoiler battle

760
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,740
Uh, and you get into the inner area

761
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,540
Before it just it would fade out and then start again. I changed it so that it loops now

762
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,140
Uh

763
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,660
And then I added to to the to the marriage animation

764
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,300
I added a little thing where the word skill up pops up twice

765
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,380
Uh, when phantom when phantom kisses uh platinum

766
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,940
His little heart comes little green heart comes out and then it goes bling and then it turns into a little double skill up

767
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,620
Because I thought oh, yeah

768
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:52,300
Because I thought there was a pretty significant chance that people wouldn't realize that marriage actually increases your weapon skill

769
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,780
So I added that to be just to make it crystal clear like this this is increasing your weapon skill

770
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:02,620
I thought it was it was just like a funny like cutscene. No, no, it's uh, it's it

771
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,780
It's too it. Well, yeah in endless war getting married

772
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,820
Uh boosts your weapon skill by two but means that you can't switch your weapon at will

773
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,220
Uh, so I mean phantom only has the one weapon so he doesn't need to switch

774
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,700
But uh, yeah, it it boosts your weapon skill. You can I think you can anoint

775
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I think you can anoint

776
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,220
Four times before it stops increase you can keep anointing

777
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,820
But it just doesn't increase your weapon skill any further after a while

778
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,820
And then I think beyond you can then you can marry and I think that will boost your

779
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,020
That will boost your skill

780
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,660
Too higher than that

781
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,300
You can if you anoint twice

782
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,740
You can that's when you can get married

783
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:56,060
And then you could if you wanted to anoint up to four times before it stops being helpful

784
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,180
And then at whatever point you get married

785
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,380
Boost your weapon skill to above whatever you were at when you marry. So you could

786
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,860
Get as high as low as weapon mastery eight if you anoint four times

787
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,580
And then marry I think I think

788
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:19,340
Does that increase the slime it takes to attack or is that just your level? No, uh weapon mastery

789
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,820
Does not increase the cost to attack only leveling increases the cost to attack

790
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,100
The that's that's and that's that's the truth

791
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,860
Uh, so it doesn't it doesn't really matter whether you

792
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,460
Leveling it matters when you do it anointing it does not and marriage it does not matter when you do it

793
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,620
It doesn't it doesn't cost you more to do it earlier

794
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:47,420
Uh, and then oh, yeah, the last thing was I had a patron a patron's name was just in there twice for some reason

795
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,580
So I just took that out. So now it's only in there once

796
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,220
And those are all the patch notes

797
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,300
It took me like it just took me like a couple hours to do all these things was really easy

798
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,100
Uh, but now the game is perfect

799
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,460
Damn

800
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,340
Oh, oh, oh wait one more thing one more thing I have to say about this is it was really funny

801
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,300
So the way that you finish the comic is by beating the game

802
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,660
And then when you beat the game you get the link to the end of the comic, right?

803
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,740
Yes, well, I made two different versions of the ending where

804
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,580
Uh one where phantom has his horn and the other where he does not

805
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,300
Uh, you know, because I was like, well, what if you if you beat the game with your horn, you know

806
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,660
You want to you would want phantom to have his horn in the final scene? Yeah. Yeah

807
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:43,340
Well, it turns out you can never get the horn ending. It is impossible to finish the game

808
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,100
And get the the link to the horned version

809
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,100
Really? Yes, because I I didn't

810
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,420
the the

811
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,420
If you if you play the game optimally

812
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,980
You can you can keep virginia from taking a hit

813
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,940
uh, if you

814
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,540
You you can't you can't prevent phantom from

815
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,860
Well, no, you you can't prevent phantom from

816
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,420
Taking from losing his from losing his horn in the same way. I'm not gonna say I won't spoil why but the point is it doesn't work

817
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,740
Uh, uh, you you you can okay. You can win with the horn, but you

818
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,140
You get the bad ending so you don't get the oh, yeah, so you don't get the link

819
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,460
So yeah, you the only way to win

820
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:40,220
Uh with the horn means that the game doesn't let you doesn't give you the link to the final page

821
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,180
So that no one will ever see yeah

822
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,300
It's there. I guess you you would have to um

823
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,540
You have to heck the game you would have to well you would have to guess the url

824
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,620
You would if you got the the actual ending you could maybe try like changing the url

825
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:00,380
And maybe you could find the horn version if you really wanted to does that mean one of them is like more canon than the other

826
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,900
In my I already considered the horn the hornless version to be more canon

827
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,380
Because I was like well, I mean nobody's gonna

828
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,500
I I had I had forgotten I had actually forgotten

829
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:18,940
Uh, I had I was thinking for a minute that if you played it perfectly you ended with your horn intact and

830
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,580
Virginia unharmed that is that is wrong. You you can't do that

831
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
But you don't you just don't have enough slime

832
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,820
uh

833
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,180
So I was thinking

834
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,900
Yeah, you can do it, but like no one's gonna do it on their first

835
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,540
Playthrough and it makes more

836
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,980
You know and you know people are gonna lose their horn on their first win

837
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:43,580
You know of course and honestly it makes a little bit it's a little bit more thematic if like you know if phantom has taken

838
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,820
damage by the end of his

839
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,620
quest for for revenge

840
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,220
It's also like a cool cutscene like if this was part of the comic

841
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,420
Yeah, that would happen that would just be like a cool thing to happen

842
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:01,020
Yeah, so even even so the the hornless ending was more canon in my head

843
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,100
Although I thought if you get the hornless version that's canon too. You deserve it

844
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
Uh, but turns out no

845
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,900
It's not because it's impossible

846
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:14,620
I just uh, it's a different timeline thought that was thought that was pretty funny

847
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,340
uh, you can um

848
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:23,740
The bad the the actual bad ending though is not canon as endless war will let you know if you try to continue on

849
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,300
after getting it

850
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,380
Someone in my patron discord was like

851
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,140
Oh, the link's not working the link's not working and I

852
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:39,580
Smugly I was like, hey, you know what you did you deserve this

853
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:45,820
But it turned out no just like their their internet browser was just like not responding

854
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,460
So I was like, oh no

855
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:55,100
Oops, you know what you did. You know you didn't get uh google fiber. You didn't you didn't update chrome

856
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,260
new monster

857
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,460
Yeah

858
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,340
uh

859
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
LeMau

860
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,020
Whoo, so yeah, it's the the weakest felt really long

861
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,060
Uh, yeah, it hasn't it felt like a long time ago that the game came out

862
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,700
Your game came out it really did

863
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:18,220
Like I I released it that day and then like by the time it was like the end of the day

864
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,460
I was going to bed. I was like, it's only been one day

865
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,820
The game's only been out for one day. It felt like an entire week had gone by

866
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,700
was it uh, was it

867
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,500
Was it lenin that said uh, there are

868
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:36,540
There are decades where nothing happens and there are weeks where decades happen or something like that or stallin

869
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,100
one of those guys

870
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,100
One of my heroes

871
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,700
It sounds like yeah, this sort of thing. Yeah that a smart person would say

872
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,980
True

873
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,780
So a capitalist would never have said that they would never have figured that out dogs

874
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,540
um

875
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,940
Yeah, I guess uh, that's that's uh

876
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,660
That's what's been going on with phantoms or revenge

877
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:12,380
I'm glad the game's done, but now I don't know what to do with myself. So I've just been playing hades

878
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,500
and that's well

879
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:21,100
I mean, you did say you were gonna like work on biscuit page is the next thing. Oh, sure. Yeah

880
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:26,140
There's always like a list of of like projects to get round to it's just that

881
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,660
You've spent so long

882
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:32,220
Building up momentum and like

883
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,660
For this one project now that you've stopped you take a break and then it's like

884
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:42,700
Um, well now I've got to do another thing. Oh, no, you're you're at a standstill

885
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,220
You've got to like build up the momentum momentum again for a different thing

886
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,380
Actually, I lied what I have I have spent some time

887
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
Doing stuff related to the book

888
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,260
Uh, like I've been all right

889
01:02:55,260 --> 01:03:01,180
I've been I've been in touch with printers like getting quotes from different printers and like finding out like who's gonna give me the best price

890
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,380
Uh, and I've been like setting up, uh, you know

891
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,940
The the image files that I will eventually use for the uh

892
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,500
it turns like a

893
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,740
I kind of put that aside for a bit because I need to deter I need to determine which printer I'm going with

894
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:23,660
First so that I know what dimensions to use and then I can do the like, you know

895
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,580
Set up set up the pages to be the correct, uh

896
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:34,940
Uh, yeah dimensions and whatever I it's looking like mix-im is going to be the the cheapest option

897
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:41,500
Cheap cheapest and has like the most um the most uh like options. I think

898
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,540
I just wish they'd send me the goddamn sample pack

899
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:50,060
I just still haven't they won't no they won't do it. Uh, oh, oh they said um

900
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,500
Um

901
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,140
Yeah, they did I did I tell you this already? They said uh

902
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,860
They initially told me that they wouldn't do it because there was a software issue

903
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,540
Like their website was just like not working and I asked them like

904
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
Well, can you just send it to me?

905
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,020
And they replied and basically they were just like no

906
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:17,020
I just won't they were they were like, uh, hold on. What did they say? They said something stupid

907
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,460
Um, we hate people from Boston

908
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,180
Okay, they they said unfortunately due to the global paper shortage

909
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:30,780
We are not offering sample packs at this time to anyone. So I guess they just aren't doing sample packs at all

910
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,460
Oh

911
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,380
So that's unfortunate. It is unfortunate and it makes me wonder like wait

912
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:41,660
Am I like getting am I getting like a bad price to print right now like is printing right now bad

913
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,540
Because paper shortage

914
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:51,100
I don't I haven't heard of a paper shortage. I would imagine something something covet would have done something somewhere

915
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,740
I don't I don't know maybe

916
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,340
That that's what they said unfortunately due to the global paper shortage

917
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,300
um

918
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,300
Maybe I mean it's just it's just like

919
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,620
I just need to know like I would like to see like the difference between like 80 pound paper and 100 pound paper

920
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,700
I could probably get that somewhere else

921
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,420
If I'm not the only people that could give me something like that

922
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:15,580
um

923
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,580
But anyway mixem seems to offer the

924
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:24,380
I'll probably have to just bite the bullet and spend like 60 dollars or 70 dollars ordering like a test copy

925
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
Yeah

926
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,700
Uh, but I don't they seem to be I

927
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,700
I contacted another local printer in boston. This one was called alpha graphics and they too

928
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,860
They were quoting me like like 30 or like 25 30 dollars a copy

929
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,820
Like what is like what is the point of view?

930
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,620
What what are you doing?

931
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,860
I don't know. I I don't know if it's their fault. Maybe it's the global paper shortage or whatever

932
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,860
But it's just it's just an unacceptable price point like I'm aghast like I'm aghast that they would show me that

933
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:03,500
And like not be shamed of themselves. I don't know. Oh, I'm looking it up

934
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,020
Paper prices have gone up a little more than 25 percent since january 2021

935
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
and

936
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,140
And because and because they're up 25 they can't offer sample packs anymore

937
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,780
25 well, there's

938
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:25,020
I mean there's more to it like they say the paper mills reduce their workforce during the turmoil of 2020

939
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:32,220
Many mills transitioned into making boxes for example for amazon versus making paper for direct mail pieces

940
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,420
I guess since paper

941
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,660
They have the power to make boxes and there's more demand for those. I don't know

942
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:44,700
Okay types and paper grades would discontinued. They don't elaborate on why

943
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:51,100
Okay, there's probably lots to learn about that. That's weird. But are but are you telling me?

944
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:53,820
right, but are you telling me

945
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,100
that

946
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,340
No, they can't no due to the paper shortage. They can't send a paper sample pack

947
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,500
But they can

948
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,700
just

949
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,580
print

950
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,300
A thousand copies of my book if I want them to

951
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,060
Well, yeah, because you're paying for it

952
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,980
Okay, but

953
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,980
Okay, but 25 isn't that much and I need and I want the fucking sample

954
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,180
I don't know man. I just

955
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:29,980
Seems stupid. They say they say 25 since january 2021. It probably has gone up

956
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,940
Uh like since 2020

957
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,100
I'm just looking at a blog about it

958
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,300
I uh, maybe

959
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,340
I just

960
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,980
Well, and that makes me nervous because like gosh like what if I'm

961
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,580
What if I'm paying like what if it's going to be like too costly to get my book made now? What if

962
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:00,060
I don't know. I mean I I would have been caught in like the heightened paper thing as well

963
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,220
It was still it was I mean it was still like within what I thought it would be

964
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:12,700
Yeah, although I did I did like order. I did look into it start looking into it in the middle of 2020

965
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,940
I think what if when the hell did I do the lord ghosts?

966
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,140
I don't uh

967
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,380
The paper was already expensive I guess is the point

968
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,500
The I wonder I mean that makes me nervous like geez like

969
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,740
If I wait till next year to do the book will that like

970
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,820
Increase will that like lower the costs?

971
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,620
I don't I don't want to wait until next year

972
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,260
But like I don't know

973
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,820
If if it would make the production cost like 50 lower or something I might consider it

974
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,260
But it probably I mean it probably wouldn't be that dramatic a difference, but like

975
01:08:53,900 --> 01:09:00,780
It would be really sad if like just across the board like paper becomes more expensive because so much is

976
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,220
digitized

977
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:07,260
That you don't need paper so much and then like making comics is way more difficult

978
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:14,460
Physically it would be difficult. I mean it would be sad just just because it would be a sad thing

979
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,980
But it would also be sad for me in particular just because

980
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,620
you know

981
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,740
selling selling books selling the books has been like

982
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,660
a pretty it's been pretty good in terms of like return on investment like it's always been

983
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:32,620
moderately successful so that would be like

984
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,660
kind of a kind of a

985
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,060
bummer for that for me

986
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,220
I don't know

987
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,220
I was anticipating

988
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:44,940
I mean the vapors to Kickstarter did pretty well

989
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,860
I was anticipating that slime and punishment might do even bigger numbers

990
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,660
Which would be very exciting

991
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,900
uh

992
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,460
But

993
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,620
I don't know

994
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,740
Everything is bad

995
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,740
Like I looked at I looked at kablam again

996
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:11,180
You know kablam is where I printed vapors and it it didn't seem like the prices there were like significantly different than they were in the past

997
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,700
So, you know what? I think they're just making it up. I think much like covid itself the uh

998
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,660
The paper shortage is probably a hoax

999
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:25,580
You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean paper does grow on trees. It literally does trees everywhere

1000
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:30,620
What are we even fucking talking about? You know, this is bullshit. It's it's all it's all

1001
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,420
liberal media something something

1002
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,580
um

1003
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,100
Oh man, wait

1004
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:43,180
This is totally off topic, but speaking of the liberal media, uh, do you see that the may is having her kid?

1005
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:52,540
Uh, why would that be liberal media? Why would you tell me about this? Because the kill stream because the kill stream hates the

1006
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:57,340
The kill stream is bravely standing against the tyranny and the scourge of the liberal why would you

1007
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,020
Think that I would ever want to know about any of that

1008
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:06,460
I don't know because I you like to keep abreast of the of the current state

1009
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,860
of the world

1010
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,100
That's not the world

1011
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,620
It is

1012
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:17,100
It's it's it's the most important thing we could be talking about right now

1013
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,900
Well, I hope the baby is okay. I hope yeah

1014
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,220
Yeah in the long term in the short term and the long term really

1015
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:32,220
Really hoping really hoping things don't work out the way they probably will work out for that kid

1016
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,860
Uh

1017
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,020
Yeah, um

1018
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:39,020
Good luck

1019
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:40,780
child

1020
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:42,780
Good luck child good luck child

1021
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,660
What can I what else can I say?

1022
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,980
um

1023
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:54,060
Uh, yeah, I think I think she's like given birth like like did like this week or something like like one minute ago

1024
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:59,660
I think I heard that like her water broke or something like her water. Why did you hear about people?

1025
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:06,300
People were talking about it in my in my discord server somebody somebody said somebody said that like

1026
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:11,660
Her water was breaking and she said like uh, Ethan. No, no, no, we don't have to go to the hospital

1027
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,220
Just now finish your stream finish your stream or whatever

1028
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,100
Uh, that's what I heard. I don't I don't know um

1029
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:25,180
But uh, yeah supposedly I don't know so that's bad and I don't like it. Um

1030
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,220
But uh, you know

1031
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,460
Easy come easy go

1032
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,460
Whatever that means

1033
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,580
What does that mean in this context? I have no idea. Don't worry about it. Um

1034
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:45,020
Damn, well, that's all what else. I don't know. Uh, I don't have any I don't have any notes this week

1035
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:50,380
Speaking just briefly on the lord of ghosts at Kickstarter reward stuff

1036
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:56,380
I have labels now, but I have been holding off using them because I found this company

1037
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,980
Called a black box a black box dot cool

1038
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,180
Apparently they are a Kickstarter backer

1039
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:08,540
Like reward assist program. Yeah, you tell them what you need to send

1040
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:15,100
And uh, where you live and you know, you're a Kickstarter link, please and then they'll give you a quote for

1041
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,540
Handling all of the shipping to all over the place

1042
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:23,100
And I'm like that sounds so helpful. I would love to do that

1043
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,740
This service sounds like I'm its demographic

1044
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,860
It sure does so they're gonna send me a quote

1045
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
tomorrow at the latest

1046
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,500
Um on monday and I'll I'll if the quote is like reasonable

1047
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,420
I'll be using them

1048
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:42,380
if not, then I'll be I'll be printing out labels on label paper and

1049
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:44,140
and

1050
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:48,860
Going insane for a few weeks, but either way, uh, I have all the pieces

1051
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,820
You know, so it's it's not gonna take too much longer

1052
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,780
Let me know how that goes because I mean if they're if they're a good service and their price

1053
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,940
Point is reasonable. I mean, that's the kind of thing I might make use of in the future

1054
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,100
Yeah

1055
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,100
they they say they they um

1056
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:12,620
A lot of kick starters are like for creative things. They they work with like board game people like uh, oh, yeah

1057
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,420
People who make board games on Kickstarter and it's like difficult to send stuff around

1058
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:22,860
Oh, yeah, and so they they made that service because they understand that artists are not smart

1059
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,740
And then they don't know how to do it. That's right. That's true

1060
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,780
um, I um

1061
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,060
Damn

1062
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,060
Wish I uh

1063
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:36,060
I wish

1064
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,020
Making I wish that making the book were not hard

1065
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,220
I actually have a I have a lot to do

1066
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:49,820
For you would you would think that like formatting the pages of a book would just be like, uh, open up like a

1067
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:55,980
Open up like a photoshop document. Uh, you know make a square center it. Uh done

1068
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,860
Uh, not not really there's like

1069
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,100
I kind of I kind of got to go through like I'll have like a standard layout

1070
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:09,020
And then but then like I kind of got to go through every individual page and like like because because they're not all quite

1071
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,180
Some of them are like four most of them are four images. Some of them will be three or two

1072
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:17,820
I kind of got to like customize each one or most of them or a lot of them to a certain extent

1073
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,340
And then I have to write I have to write the index section

1074
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,220
I'm actually gonna I don't even know what it's it's going to be

1075
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,260
I don't know how long it's going to be but I feel like there's going to be a lot to say

1076
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,300
In the index section. It's going to be a lot of words

1077
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,820
It's going to probably increase these page count

1078
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,540
significantly

1079
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:43,100
It's probably use like a moderately small font just to avoid it being like a big like additional print cost

1080
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:47,180
Uh, but anyway, there's a lot a lot to do with that

1081
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:53,900
I think the the reason the the author notes in the homestuck books and the problem sleuth books are at the bottom

1082
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,820
Is to save on

1083
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,820
like an index

1084
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:04,380
Yeah, because because the the like the page is the same like shape as the panels in homestuck

1085
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,980
but like

1086
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:11,180
There's no very rarely. Do they actually fill the entire page with one of the panels?

1087
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,300
They'll have like

1088
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,220
Because they have all text underneath them

1089
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:16,220
They have like terezi do

1090
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,460
The do the thing and then it's like they have the text with the image above it

1091
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,420
And they have like maybe three panels per page with their texts

1092
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,300
And if there's a pestilog that takes up and it's like

1093
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:31,660
With that there's a lot of space to have author notes at the bottom without like

1094
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,460
Compromising too much on like

1095
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:38,380
Showing the pages in full. That's true

1096
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,860
That's true actually and you know, I you know, I pulled out my problem sleuth

1097
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,420
Uh book to like look at the layout

1098
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:49,260
And yeah, I did notice that a lot of it is there is a lot of blank space

1099
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,740
At the bottom of of many pages

1100
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:57,580
Like the the images are all they're definitely there's like set towards the top and there's blank space at the bottom four

1101
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:02,620
You know, it's potentially there could be text there and then at the very bottom. There's the

1102
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,180
There's the running commentary

1103
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,860
I I don't know. I kind of like the idea of like a dedicated index section though. I think I just

1104
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:13,580
It

1105
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,860
Yeah, damn it. Okay. Now I'm in a conundrum because on the one hand

1106
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,620
um, yeah, my the four images like like the

1107
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,340
The the the the the aspect ratio of the images

1108
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:30,140
Most most even landscape oriented book layouts

1109
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:37,180
They're not long enough. They generally they do will have some wasted vertical space. It's almost unavoidable

1110
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,500
uh

1111
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,980
So then I'm I'm I'm left with the choice of either I waste that space

1112
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,460
or I

1113
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,580
I could do a running commentary page by page and then that space would be used

1114
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:55,260
Or you know, if I do if I do in the back of the book, there might be some some waste which is unfortunate

1115
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,940
so

1116
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,940
so like, um, you've got

1117
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,180
You've got the four

1118
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,620
For most tweets. There's four images the same size. Yeah

1119
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,460
Uh

1120
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,900
And like putting all four of those like with their sides touching

1121
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,100
In a grid on one page would be too

1122
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:18,060
Like would make the pages too wide or uh, no, well, here. Well, here's like a

1123
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,140
I was working on it the other day. Here's what I was kind of

1124
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,780
Um, hold on. I gotta I gotta post a

1125
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,540
Here's what I was kind of like mocking up

1126
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,820
Like, uh

1127
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,340
this is

1128
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,500
This is this is including like a bleed

1129
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:41,340
So, I mean, this isn't even you know what this isn't even that bad actually like yeah, there's a little bit of space at the bottom

1130
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,340
But it's not even it's not even that bad

1131
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:49,420
You know what I was like futzing with it the other day and thinking like oh, there's extra space. Oh, I hate this wasted space

1132
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:52,220
But like this is fine

1133
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,580
Is is the white like the bleed area? No

1134
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:59,420
Oh, sorry. No the white on the outside is like ignore it

1135
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,620
That's just the photoshop file you're working in. Yeah, no the the black the black is the page

1136
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,580
Or here, um, let me uh

1137
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,060
here

1138
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,060
there

1139
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,340
Yeah, yeah

1140
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,900
The corner ignore the red in the corner. That's irrelevant

1141
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,100
Uh, so they would be

1142
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:23,980
Some yeah, this something like for text if you got something to say or no, no, no, I think I think this is

1143
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:30,220
I don't shit is this post because I because I got the template from mixam

1144
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,500
No, wait, uh, this is uh

1145
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:43,980
I'm not sure if this includes the bleed or not whatever this is whatever something something like this, you know

1146
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:49,580
So, yeah, there there would be there. Okay, there would be some space for a commentary at the bottom

1147
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,580
There might be a few

1148
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,980
There might be a few cases where

1149
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,580
I would want to write like a substantial amount that maybe I would want more than just the bottom

1150
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:05,740
Uh margin for I guess in those cases I could make a little asterisk and have a little like

1151
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,380
index section at the back

1152
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:13,020
but on the other hand, I kind of just like the idea of having it of it being a

1153
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:18,620
Uh an infinite jest style back of the book index section. I just kind of think that's funny

1154
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,060
Yeah, I mean, whatever you feel like. Yeah

1155
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:27,740
I I remembered that I was at one point thinking of making like a bell jpebook

1156
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,300
And I started like laying out

1157
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,300
some pages

1158
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,740
Yeah, just sort of like this sort of thing. I like that

1159
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
Would it be would it be square pages?

1160
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,620
Yeah, the square pages would be pretty square. Yeah. Um, just because

1161
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:50,620
Actually, I don't know why I think it was just because the problem sleuth books were square and I liked that

1162
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:56,140
The problem sleuth books, they're not they're not quite square. They're like, um, they're like a little bit less

1163
01:20:56,380 --> 01:21:01,740
They're like a little bit more than square. They're like eight by eight and a half or so. I measured I measured mine

1164
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:04,220
Uh because uh, you know

1165
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,420
I was I was looking at this at this stuff

1166
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,300
Uh, okay

1167
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,940
I've got my

1168
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:16,460
I still don't know whether I would want to make a bell jpebook

1169
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,300
It's it's like a fun idea of a project

1170
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,020
but it's still like bell jpe is

1171
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,220
maybe not like

1172
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,860
The thing people would really want

1173
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,020
I don't know

1174
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,020
How many how many would it be a lot of pages?

1175
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,340
I think it would be a lot of pages. Oh, how don't I think I may like

1176
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,660
I got up to

1177
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,180
page

1178
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:46,220
What's this page 35 of the book would be where tiki is introduced

1179
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:50,300
I didn't I didn't finish doing that one. Let me page 34

1180
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,900
I think it would be like maybe a hundred two hundred pages

1181
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,220
um

1182
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:57,740
200 yeah

1183
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,260
Slime and well, I slime and punishment is gonna be like a hundred and

1184
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:07,660
180 or something a hundred and seventy hundred and eighty and that that's not including the index

1185
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:13,580
Hey, see I can't remember whether I'm that number is referring to like the number of panels I have

1186
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,180
um

1187
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:21,580
Because obviously I can fit multiple panels on a single page. Yeah, and uh, some panels are less important than others

1188
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:29,260
If they're like like just sort of moving from one point to another. I like I like this like alternating a left and right

1189
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,820
Thing you got going on here

1190
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,220
Yeah, I think it's pretty good. It's pretty good

1191
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:38,140
I feel like it would be a cool project once I don't have um

1192
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,940
I don't know more pressing projects

1193
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Happening. Hmm. Yeah

1194
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:49,420
I could have like give and take dot say and you can buy the bell j-book. I wouldn't I probably wouldn't do a kickstarter for it

1195
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:57,180
Uh, or would I I don't know in a in a in a in a bit that I'm gonna rip off from the lord of ghosts kickstarter

1196
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:05,260
What the hell did it it's not showing it whatever this this image. I just posted is uh, it's it shows the the bleed

1197
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:10,220
It shows it with the bleed and like uh, it's kind of it's kind of narrow on the edges

1198
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,300
I I really don't like how it's like coming coming coming close to the edge

1199
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:17,820
But it's got like a more substantial margin at the top. I don't like that

1200
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:23,500
There's more space on the right because this is like a left page. So, you know, there's more space in the middle towards the spine

1201
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,540
Um, it'd be reversed for a right hand page

1202
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,900
Ah, there's just a lot

1203
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,580
There's a lot of lot to fuck with there's a lot to fuck with in terms of uh, so

1204
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:42,300
What are you what are you copying from from lord of ghosts? Oh, right? Um, I'm gonna do a when I kickstart that I'll do a, uh

1205
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
stretch goal zine

1206
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,580
and the zine will be, uh

1207
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:50,220
Nuts the beginning. Do you know what that is?

1208
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,980
I

1209
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:59,180
Yes, the like timeline conversions or like it's split whether or not you have the salted cashews or the unsalted

1210
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:05,260
The salted almonds are the unsalted cashews. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh, or well

1211
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:12,620
Uh, I mean, there is the there is the the secret brazil nut ending, but uh, we shouldn't talk about that

1212
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,540
So, yeah, I'll do that as like a little uh

1213
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
choose your own adventure, uh

1214
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,980
probably like staple bound, uh

1215
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,980
Zine it'll be like 13 pages

1216
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,900
Uh, no, no, I'll probably be a little longer than that

1217
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:35,020
Maybe like 20 something because it's all all these multiple versions. Uh

1218
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,380
How many pages is the red man zine by the way?

1219
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,780
That's about a hundred pages. It's a that's big for a zine

1220
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:49,180
That is big for it's got like a flat like it's perfect bound. It's not like stapled

1221
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:56,780
Oh, that's a lot more. That's not even a zine. That's not even a zine. You can't call a zine if it's perfect bound. That's a book

1222
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,900
Uh, uh-oh

1223
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:01,900
I got caught

1224
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,900
That's a book my friends

1225
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:06,780
Dang it. Now people will know I made a book

1226
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:12,540
Fuck you fool. Um, I'm very disappointed. I want my money back

1227
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:19,020
Uh, okay, thanks, but you won't get your red man. Oh wait. Oh

1228
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,300
Oh, well, well, no, never mind then. No, actually

1229
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,980
No, I want I want well, I want the money back

1230
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,060
But I want to still have the thing that I paid for

1231
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,940
Can we can we arrange something like that perhaps?

1232
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:39,340
Uh, sure, I'll send it to you and then you complain and then I'll capitulate instantly. Okay. Okay. Good. I receive red man comic

1233
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,980
You receive no money from me

1234
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,700
Uh

1235
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,700
We can make this work. I think

1236
01:25:47,660 --> 01:25:51,980
Um, you I receive red man comic you receive less than what we agreed upon

1237
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:56,460
Hmm. Hmm. You you drive a hard bargain there

1238
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:59,420
Uh, yeah

1239
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,900
So let's uh, let's see

1240
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:09,100
What uh, what else what else? Um, like I said, I have no notes this week. Um

1241
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,780
I did nothing of note besides release the game and play Hades

1242
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,500
uh

1243
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,060
Well, you deserve it. Thanks

1244
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,940
uh

1245
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,940
Anything I've been doing is um

1246
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:25,980
Is waiting for

1247
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,140
Well, at first I found out about like the

1248
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:34,700
The the black box company and now I'm just been I've just been waiting for them to get back to me with the quote

1249
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,940
Oh

1250
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:39,900
So I've been playing uh animal crossing

1251
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,580
Pocket camp. I think I talked about that before you mentioned it. Yeah

1252
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,540
That's been fun. I have animals

1253
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:50,460
I got Marshall. I got Raymond. Oh my god. Uh

1254
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,420
The best ones

1255
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,420
Yeah, I found all the best ones

1256
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,540
Um, I think there's that new one new ish one

1257
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,900
Uh, what's his name?

1258
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,980
Bunny boy like turquoise

1259
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,340
Femboy bunny that was like ha ha. It's so feminine for a boy bunny

1260
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:14,220
I don't remember that one

1261
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,100
It's a new one new with the

1262
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,220
Switch game. I think

1263
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:25,740
But that's a possible. I can I can find that one and and add it to my my campsite

1264
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,500
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. Good

1265
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,100
And uh, yeah, it's just that's just a fun game

1266
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:37,100
Uh, is it you said it's different from

1267
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,140
New horizons

1268
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:44,860
Yeah, I mean there's a lot there's obviously less you can do on a mobile device

1269
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,940
But like I haven't played the animal crossings. I've just seen people play it

1270
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,660
seems to be just

1271
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:57,820
Good like you go around and you shake trees to get at things you catch bugs you catch fish

1272
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,020
You give those things to the animals as little gift bags and they're like wow, thanks

1273
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:06,380
And then they give you crafting resources

1274
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:09,180
With which you make furniture

1275
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,660
To furnish your campsite. Mm-hmm. And then if you have the right furniture animals

1276
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:18,700
Who like that furniture can be invited to be at your camp. Very nice

1277
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,060
Very nice

1278
01:28:22,620 --> 01:28:23,660
Uh

1279
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:27,820
And and like that that loop has not gotten tiring or tedious yet

1280
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,380
This is uh surprisingly

1281
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:35,580
And it's just it's a good one. It's a good mobile game. I like that. I like that they did that the

1282
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,100
The the Hades loop has not gotten tedious for me

1283
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,740
Although I was very

1284
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,860
I was really mad. I was really mad. Let me tell you

1285
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:47,340
When I realized

1286
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:51,740
I had thought that diamonds I had thought I figured out that oh diamonds are just for like

1287
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,020
They're just for like extra shit. They're just for like, you know, bullshit cosmetic stuff

1288
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:01,180
So I bought a song. I bought like a soundtrack song for one diamond

1289
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,820
And then a day later

1290
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:08,300
I realized like, oh my god, I've earned all the diamonds I can like get easily

1291
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,860
And I'm one diamond short

1292
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,940
of unlocking arabus gates

1293
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:17,420
And I fucking wasted my fucking diamond on a stupid soundtrack

1294
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:26,700
I'm fucking gonna kill everyone. Yeah, you can yeah, you can buy like in-game music that plays at the music stand in the

1295
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,020
Like courtyard or whatever

1296
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:30,140
Right

1297
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:36,940
And you get diamonds you get diamonds by slaying the lernian bone hydra, which is the boss of the second area

1298
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:42,780
Well, you get a you get them in a couple ways, but the easiest way to get them is by slaying the hydra

1299
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:51,420
With each weapon you get a one diamond for doing it with that weapon and you get one for doing it at different heat levels

1300
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:53,180
which is uh

1301
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:57,660
Sort of a difficulty setting you can like turn up for yourself if you want more rewards

1302
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:02,700
So I had completed I had gotten all the diamonds that I could get that way

1303
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
And then I was like, ah, fuck

1304
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:11,900
I'm short of a an upgrade that would add like a new like sort of type of room to the dungeon

1305
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,260
Uh, I ended up getting I had to like trade some shit

1306
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:18,620
I had to like gather up some other crap and trade one for a diamond

1307
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,260
And then I got the extra one and I got the I unlocked the room

1308
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:26,780
But I was mad for a minute. I was like, oh, I wish I hadn't spent that diamond on that song

1309
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:29,260
Oh, well

1310
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,260
Uh, you got tricked. I I

1311
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,860
It was bad conveyance. It was bad conveyance

1312
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:43,740
They didn't they didn't signpost clearly enough that this thing that I had to slay the hydra to obtain was valuable and I should care about it

1313
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,700
Uh

1314
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:52,300
There was okay, we I just thought of one more thing one more thing. Um, I was talking

1315
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,220
to Nate

1316
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,340
about

1317
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,340
Radcon funds

1318
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,060
and I

1319
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,540
I think I'm I'm I'm I think I'm taking over. I think I'm taking over a

1320
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,460
PCP

1321
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:10,140
Like accounting duties from him. He is handing them off to me soon

1322
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,100
and also

1323
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,100
Uh, we were talking about

1324
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:20,780
The expenses that I have incurred while doing stuff like getting road to radcon done

1325
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,580
And doing the dojin

1326
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:27,100
And other such things and we went over the expenses

1327
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:32,300
And uh, I think I'm gonna get paid. I'm gonna get that money that I spent

1328
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,220
This is money that I already spent that I spent my own money that was PCP money

1329
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,220
So I'm just getting reimbursed for that

1330
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:39,660
and then

1331
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:45,500
we talked again about the uh, the brad garlinghouse diss track music video

1332
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,060
and the ova

1333
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,540
And we once again and we once again Nate said

1334
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:55,580
I'm gonna say I'm just gonna say it. I'm just gonna say it Nate said to me. Okay, Ben

1335
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,580
I I'm gonna set a deadline for myself. I will have the

1336
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,580
uh

1337
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,580
Music video done

1338
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,980
He said next friday

1339
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:09,100
So that will be the friday after this episode

1340
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,660
Or that will be a week from the day this episode comes out

1341
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,540
So the day the episode after this comes out

1342
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:23,100
Nate said he would and he told me he would have the brad garlinghouse diss track music video

1343
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,060
These are his words. These are his words

1344
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,820
Uh, all right, and now and now okay. I can't guarantee he didn't say that it would be published

1345
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,260
He said it would be done

1346
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:34,380
So he might

1347
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:39,180
It might be the case that he has he hasn't finished then and then maybe we publish it like the next day or something

1348
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:45,180
Um, so if it's not posted when this comes out, it's not quite time to

1349
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:49,420
Call him out on shenanigans, but uh soon

1350
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,460
Soon thereafter shortly thereafter

1351
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,180
uh

1352
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,940
I asked him

1353
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:01,020
Do you do you care if like we talk if talk a little bit about like money funds?

1354
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,140
um, I mean sure is

1355
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:05,660
part of the

1356
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:10,700
The thing I was concerned. I because I I had not seen like the money

1357
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:15,260
Like he's just sort of kept it in escrow or whatever for this whole time

1358
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,060
Uh, and I was concerned like

1359
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:22,380
damn, what if we like spent it all and um

1360
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:26,460
Like like what if it's what if it's all been spent and it's gone and we're not getting

1361
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:31,580
And there's not going to be any money to pay us out by the time it's it's done. Turns out no

1362
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,220
That's not the case

1363
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:38,140
Nate said that like even after everything there's like

1364
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:41,980
$15,000 just there just sitting

1365
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,860
To be to be dispersed as soon as as soon as he is done

1366
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:52,140
Well as soon as he's done with those videos and uh, and I get uh

1367
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:56,060
Kaiju to finish the damn the damn dojin

1368
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:03,020
Yes, Kaiju. It's not Kaiju's fault Kaiju said he would work on it as soon as he has time, but he has been

1369
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:10,220
He has been busy with uh, his editing work for totally not mark, which he told me was going to be the case so

1370
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,820
It's uh, it's uh, I I accepted that

1371
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,020
Because I don't know he he said

1372
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:21,740
He said I should consider finding someone else if I want it done sooner

1373
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,060
And I was like, okay, I'll think about it

1374
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:31,900
But other than like I genuinely don't know who else I would ask because I I really feel like his style is a pretty good fit for

1375
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:37,500
uh eds stuff because I want to use what ed got done and uh

1376
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,380
So like

1377
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:41,820
That's good

1378
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:48,540
And like I don't I don't know any other I have like I don't know I have not found any other artists who would be like

1379
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,260
Oh, yeah, I could get that guy to do it and that would look fine

1380
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:55,180
Like I just have I don't like maybe there's someone out there, but I don't I don't

1381
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,420
I don't know I don't haven't seen him

1382
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,540
I

1383
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:06,140
Anyway, those are the I mean those are the things that have to get done before we get that money

1384
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,940
We'll get like a few thousand bucks a piece. It'll be pretty sick

1385
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,380
Yeah, and then finally

1386
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:14,300
um

1387
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:18,620
And finally the curse of radcon 4 will be lifted finally. Yeah, yeah the curse

1388
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:21,180
God

1389
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:22,620
It's been

1390
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,260
So long that I can't even remember

1391
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:26,780
Yeah

1392
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:28,380
what like

1393
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:31,820
If I have been reimbursed for anything or or not

1394
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:34,300
Well, Nate has it all gotta go Nate has it all in records

1395
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:41,100
Apparently he told me I had thought that I had been reimbursed for like my uh, not my travel expenses

1396
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,340
But like my expenses while there like, you know food food and stuff

1397
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,300
Uh, apparently I was not like

1398
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,660
He he told me like now I have it I have it down here on the

1399
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:58,780
Spreadsheet that like now you you listed like 400 dollars worth of expenses that have not been reimbursed. I'm like, yes

1400
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:02,220
Fuck yeah

1401
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,380
I'd have to really go back and

1402
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,580
check

1403
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:10,540
Wait, well if you if you already told him if you already reported him then like well, that's the thing

1404
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,620
I don't I don't even remember if I reported

1405
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:18,220
Everything well if you didn't I I feel like I I feel like I I like put

1406
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,060
like

1407
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,060
uh receipts

1408
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:28,620
Somewhere, uh, yeah, I did I was meeting I kept all my receipts from the trip and then I posted screenshots of them

1409
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,260
for him in the all business

1410
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,780
uh

1411
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,780
channel

1412
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:37,980
And that's and I just did that and like that's that's all I had

1413
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:43,740
Yeah, I guess the main thing I would want is like my plane ticket because I was part of the the Kickstarter

1414
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:50,300
Yes, the pay for travel probably. Yeah, probably that 400 includes my plane tickets

1415
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,900
And probably yours as well need to be paid out

1416
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,620
along with everything else

1417
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,820
Oh, yeah, that would have been big for you

1418
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:02,140
because of a international flight and all

1419
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:06,780
Yeah, did you not did you know over though? Did you not get uh?

1420
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:09,660
Did you not get that covered?

1421
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,980
Um, I don't remember it's been so many years

1422
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:16,860
It's been two years multiple years

1423
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:20,140
Or

1424
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,260
wait

1425
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:26,140
I mean red con 2 would have been it would have been around this time of year right like late march

1426
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,220
I think on 2 or sorry red con 4

1427
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:36,140
It would it would have now. Yeah, it was it was march. It was pre. It was just on the cusp of covid

1428
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:39,420
So we're probably scary. No, so we're probably in like

1429
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:44,860
Yeah, this this we were like right around the second anniversary or something like that. Oh

1430
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:48,620
Yeah, it's so weird. How weird is it?

1431
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:55,340
Like what watching the uh the red con 2 documentary and being like red con 1 and 2 were like four months apart

1432
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:59,180
So bizarre

1433
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,060
Yeah, well

1434
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:09,980
Yeah, well things change. Yeah, well, that's life. That's life. I don't want to say about it. Yeah, I mean sure

1435
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,020
Uh

1436
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,060
I don't know that's all I got

1437
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:19,020
That's all I got this week. Um

1438
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:21,020
Oh, have you been reading one piece?

1439
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,340
No

1440
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:27,980
You're gonna get caught up. It's very good fame famously. I do not read one piece

1441
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,700
Uh, I should watch it. I read it

1442
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:37,820
I yeah, you know, you know what, uh, there's a there's a lot of things that I have been putting off doing and being like

1443
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:41,660
Nah, I'll do it after the game's done. Well

1444
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,260
Now the game's done. So maybe reading one piece

1445
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,060
Should be one of those things that I do

1446
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:49,900
Uh

1447
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,580
Yeah, I should get caught up

1448
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:55,500
I know I've been saying that and saying that and saying that but I really mean it this time

1449
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,700
I really mean it. I'm downloading

1450
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:00,940
Uh

1451
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:05,020
Voice mails by the way, I don't know if we're gonna do them right yet, but I feel like we're getting

1452
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,220
Closer to that time

1453
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,260
I mean at the moment

1454
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:14,700
Like all the things that are going on in my life that are major

1455
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:18,220
I've already mentioned. Mm-hmm

1456
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:23,820
And I'm mostly just sort of like enjoying the fact that it's getting a bit warmer. Yeah, and uh

1457
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:31,500
Oh, there's there's a bumblebee every so often in that nice sunlight. That's good. Yeah, I went to the

1458
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:35,020
I went to the post office the other day

1459
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,660
I had like legitimately not been out of my house and like probably more than a week

1460
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:41,660
Like I had not stepped outside

1461
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:45,100
And I was shocked to see that. Oh, it's uh, it's warm now

1462
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,980
That's weird

1463
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,980
That's pretty cool. I guess

1464
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:52,540
But I feel I have gone um

1465
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,380
I have gone with the kids these days are calling goblin mode

1466
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:01,020
I feel like they calling it that. Yeah, I feel like a monster

1467
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:05,980
I feel like a devil who doesn't belong in society anymore. I feel like a wretched little

1468
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:08,700
little uh

1469
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:13,580
Little hand-wringing thing scurrying about I don't want anyone to see me

1470
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:19,100
Uh, that's that's like you're like those little little bugs in in uh

1471
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:26,460
Oh, no, not little little bugs the little scrabbly guys in blood boron you kill them you get little blood. Oh, it's the little tight night. Uh

1472
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:32,700
Tight night equivalents. Dark souls tight night scarabs or whatever they're called. Yeah. Yeah

1473
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:36,460
Exactly. Yes, exactly like that. Exactly. Um

1474
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,740
You have great like powerful loot

1475
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:44,460
It feels and everyone's trying to try and gonna try and squash you for it

1476
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:47,420
Feels bad. I feel like I look terrible

1477
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:50,140
Uh, I don't know what to do about it

1478
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:56,140
Uh, just look good. Duh. Yeah easy. Yeah, you know what?

1479
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:00,940
You're inspiring an inspired an inspiring message of hope

1480
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:04,860
Uh for today's youth. Just get good. I Ie me

1481
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,020
Yeah

1482
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,460
You know what?

1483
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:10,460
Never thought about it like that

1484
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,620
And I never will

1485
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:19,020
But anyway, the point was it was very warm out. It was like all of a sudden it was 70 degrees and I'm like, well

1486
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:22,060
Damn, I guess, uh

1487
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,780
I guess my excuse for uh

1488
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:28,620
I'm running out of excuses to never leave my house. Uh

1489
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,180
COVID's like

1490
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,180
Nobody nobody cares about COVID anymore

1491
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,820
Uh, it's not it's not even winter now. It's warm. So like fuck

1492
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:45,180
I gotta go to a local park and pet a dog. Jesus christ. Don't don't

1493
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,060
Don't fucking say such things

1494
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,380
Uh

1495
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:54,220
Do you have like a local park near

1496
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,460
A local park

1497
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,460
I mean there

1498
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:04,860
There there is one that I there's one kind of I know there is one kind of near a sort of uh

1499
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:08,860
Street crossing like square nearby

1500
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:13,660
Uh, but it's sort of off the road and I have not actually gone to it

1501
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:18,860
Long story short, there are parks. I just have not I have not really seen any of them

1502
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,060
I guess I moved in

1503
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:24,780
I don't I don't go to parks. Do you go to parks?

1504
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,980
Yeah, I love going to parks

1505
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:33,500
I I would never think I would never think to go to a park

1506
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:42,380
It's just sort of um, you know, you go outside, but you're far away as far away as possible from traffic sounds

1507
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:45,180
and

1508
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:50,060
You know sometimes there's nice grass sometimes there's a lake to look at I don't look at like ducks and stuff

1509
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:52,220
I don't know if there are any parks

1510
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:56,940
Around where I live that are big enough that you would be like away from traffic sounds

1511
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:02,140
Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends if if you're in like a big city or

1512
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,100
Or a place where the parks are small

1513
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,980
like

1514
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,980
even just

1515
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:15,820
Surrounding yourself with tall things that are not like made of concrete and instead are made of wood and they're trees

1516
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:19,340
I mean, I go to the I go to the Boston Commons sometimes

1517
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:27,020
Uh for various reasons. That's that's a park. It's not huge, but it's it's probably it's the biggest park

1518
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,580
around I think

1519
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,300
It's probably a bigger is that the place with

1520
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,140
Uh

1521
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,980
Wait, was that the place?

1522
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:42,380
I think I went there. I think you probably did and we probably and we probably played pokemon go. Yeah, I think you did

1523
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,420
Go there and and and another time

1524
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:48,460
I think you and

1525
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,700
Munchy did like a

1526
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:57,580
Like a with rfck con or something with signs. Yes. Yes the slime. I remember watching a stream

1527
01:43:58,540 --> 01:44:04,700
Walking around a big green area slime war slime slime war now slime war now

1528
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,420
Uh, yeah, that was in the common

1529
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:14,220
Uh, it was also it was also the place where I went to uh, so you see andrew yang

1530
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,340
Give us a beat when he was running for president

1531
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,820
Uh

1532
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:26,060
It was where we went for the when it was cold for that time you were here. Yeah, so you yeah, that's the common

1533
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:28,620
I go there once in a while

1534
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:29,660
um

1535
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,980
Just for various uh reasons

1536
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,820
I gotta go

1537
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:40,540
Um, I actually after this is over. I gotta go to the

1538
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:48,060
I've been meaning to go back to medford. I moved so my old

1539
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,700
PO box is in medford

1540
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:55,420
Which is kind of annoying to get to it was probably like 45 minutes to get there. I gotta go by bus

1541
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:02,620
And I gotta I gotta check my po box because I'm sure that some packages have probably been returned to sender and are sitting in

1542
01:45:02,620 --> 01:45:04,620
My po box and need to get them

1543
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,140
Uh

1544
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:09,740
And uh, but I don't want to uh, it's annoying

1545
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:17,180
So but I I'll probably do that today actually because I gotta go out to summerville for some other shit

1546
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:19,820
um

1547
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,380
I guess it's the first day of spring. It's march 20th

1548
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:29,740
It's also my sister's birthday. So I should call her the sister who famously said you're a dog. You're a dog and I'm sick of it

1549
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:33,820
Uh, it's her birthday today. I should give her a call after this

1550
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:38,220
Hmm. Anyway, I'm just rambling now. What am I talking about?

1551
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:42,700
Uh, nothing nothing nothing

1552
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:46,060
Shall we go to voicemail? Yeah, let's go to voicemail

1553
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:48,220
Oh

1554
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:52,380
Oh, man, I made I made two ingredient cookies yesterday

1555
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,820
Shit was so cash

1556
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:01,340
The way two what cookies I talked about these two ingredient cookies the ones that are made

1557
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:04,220
Of bananas and oats

1558
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:12,220
Oh, okay. Yeah, I mentioned these. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna experiment next next batch. I make I'm gonna experiment with uh

1559
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:15,020
adding

1560
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:19,100
Because it's like they're actually I'm actually disappointed. They're actually kind of high calorie

1561
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,060
Like a batch of like eight cookies

1562
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:27,180
I mean moderately large cookies, but still eight cookies like a thousand calories

1563
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:29,500
And that's a lot

1564
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,860
Um, so I'm gonna experiment with sub substituting

1565
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:38,300
This might be the worst thing ever. I'm gonna try and substitute some of the oats with psyllium powder

1566
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:41,020
Which is pure fiber

1567
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:47,500
Is so it's not psyllium. So it's non caloric. I don't know. It might be horrible. It might be just disgusting

1568
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:50,540
Uh, but it might be fine and great and then it would be

1569
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
It'd be very silly

1570
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,900
Yeah, um

1571
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,380
Do you want me here? I'll I'll post uh

1572
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:02,460
Oh, yeah, sorry

1573
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:06,940
Uh, are you gonna post them? Yeah, sorry. I'm getting them. Uh, this one is called

1574
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:15,420
Sorry, I've got a lot of uh, fucking folders open at the moment. This one is called this is for this one is for Gib and not Ben

1575
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:21,020
Okay, so the both of us will be listening. Um, three two one go

1576
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:24,380
Hey Gib, uh, you said

1577
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,620
previously

1578
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:28,060
that

1579
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:31,420
On your money spenders podcast you have gone over

1580
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:34,460
details on

1581
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,620
development of pumpkin alley

1582
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:38,620
um, some yeah

1583
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:41,660
Very vague details without

1584
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,540
spoiling it

1585
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:47,980
Uh, how much detail did you go into into the process?

1586
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,100
a lot a little

1587
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,140
no

1588
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:54,140
Biden find out

1589
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:59,900
Biden find out. I mean Biden will find out. Oh, he's he fucked around now. He's gonna find out

1590
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,020
uh

1591
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:06,380
I feel like there's there's not like

1592
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,780
A wealth of information about like the process of making the game

1593
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,420
I can't remember exactly what I say

1594
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,660
but like

1595
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:20,780
I wasn't like documenting it like very rigorously and I wasn't programming it either so like

1596
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:23,420
How the game works

1597
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:27,980
Is like secondhand information that I get from like watching charlie struggle with something

1598
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:33,100
And I'm like we workshop like possible solutions to problems and

1599
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:35,340
and stuff like that

1600
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,340
um when it comes to like

1601
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:39,340
What I was doing for the game

1602
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:46,620
I was doing animation, but I don't know how to like talk about the process of doing animation for a 3d thing

1603
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:50,220
I don't know. I can't remember

1604
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:52,540
Oh

1605
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,540
That reminds me I I forgot to uh

1606
01:48:55,500 --> 01:49:00,700
I forgot to record that uh that I said I was going to do a patreon podcast and I haven't done it yet

I'll do I'll do it this week and hopefully have that out before this episode comes out

1608
01:49:05,660 --> 01:49:09,260
I meant to have it out by the time the last episode went out, but I didn't uh

1609
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:11,260
oops

1610
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:14,220
Uh, whoops whoops. Yes, exactly

01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:16,140

Okay, next one

antivirus pop-up. Okay. The next one is called um

1615
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:33,580
Dating advice 3 2 1 go. Okay. You wanted to give dating advice. My girlfriend wants to stick a chopstick up my ass. Should I let her? Yeah

1616
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,780
Where's the other chopstick going?

1617
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:39,020
It's gotta go somewhere

1618
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,740
Ow, how are you gonna pick things up with chopsticks?

1619
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:48,860
Is she gonna put one in her eyes and then you combine your powers to pick up the food that?

1620
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:51,820
God

1621
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:53,820
Stop no

1622
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:59,740
Disgusting. I'm just I'm just thinking. I'm just there. Just read the practicality. Oh

1623
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:04,140
Good, I'm glad somebody's thinking about the

1624
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,020
the consequences

1625
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:09,900
I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's terrible

1626
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:17,500
Uh, next voicemail is called, uh, texas anti trans stuff as of march 13th

1627
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:22,940
3 2 1 go. I'm a little late so I'm responding to you talking about this two weeks ago

1628
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:27,740
Hopefully I'm not just repeating information someone else said but I want to clarify what's going on in texas with the anti trans stuff

1629
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:30,620
The first thing is that it's not new legislation. There's no new bill here

1630
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:36,140
Essentially texas attorney general ken paxson out of the blue released a statement saying gender affirming health care constitutes child abuse

1631
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:39,580
And then greg abbott the governor turned around and was like, yeah, that's definitely true

1632
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:44,620
And i'm gonna issue a directive right now to send cps to investigate families of trans children and threaten to tear them apart

1633
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:49,020
Also, this has the effect that psychologists and shit are required to report trans children to the state

1634
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:52,220
So a lot of clinics just immediately close their doors to adolescents outright

1635
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:57,020
This has been happening families are terrified cps workers were diverted from real cases of child abuse

1636
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:02,780
No checks and balances no need for anything to be passed by other lawmakers just abbott abusing his position to terrorize his citizens

1637
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,180
Yeah, I know you don't have to tell me that it's bad

1638
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:08,300
And the first hearing for that was on friday march 11th

1639
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:13,740
state's defense was utterly pathetic and the judge sustained an injunction to prevent the investigations from continuing

1640
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:20,140
Until the next hearing in july ken paxson the attorney general then submitted an appeal the very same day and said that he's not

1641
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:25,580
Going to let the investigation stop. I don't know if he has any way of doing that, but I am kind of fucking terrified at the thought

1642
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:30,620
I'll leave more voicemails if there's more updates before the next show is recorded. This voicemail was left on sunday the 13th

1643
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:37,980
I did hear about I did hear about like a court ruling that the okay. I didn't realize it was not new legislation

1644
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:40,940
I did hear about a court ruling it unconstitutional

1645
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,020
uh

1646
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:46,620
So that's good. Hmm, but like it was blocked

1647
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,820
by the attorney general

1648
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:55,100
And that and like currently like the judge's ruling was blocked

1649
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:01,260
Is that what I'm trying to think if that was what they said just then

1650
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:07,900
Because like does that mean that in texas like families are still being terrorized by this

1651
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:09,580
new

1652
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:11,580
thing not new thing but like

1653
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:13,580
I am

1654
01:52:13,580 --> 01:52:15,100
stuff

1655
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:20,300
Bad thing sucks. I'm unsure. I think it it mean it seems like

1656
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:25,500
What it means is that it's under like uh judicial contention

1657
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:30,620
Like there's it sounds sounds like okay, there is there was a judge ruling against it

1658
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:31,740
but like

1659
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:34,380
Other forces are attempting to combat the ruling

1660
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:38,060
so so until there's a like a a

1661
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:39,660
um

1662
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,900
A consensus on that issue

1663
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:48,460
Whatever is happening can continue to happen. I don't I don't exactly know what's happening. I guess I guess uh

1664
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:52,140
uh clinic clinics being closed

1665
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:58,460
Uh because of like the potential legal uh consequences is happening. Uh

1666
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:04,220
Psychologists being forced to out trans children. Yeah, well, it's um

1667
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,820
Yeah, I don't I mean I don't know if like

1668
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:10,380
uh, they've

1669
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:17,660
Uh probably it has happens a few times. I don't know. I don't know if it's like a widespread thing

1670
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,740
But like I guess it might

1671
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:24,460
From what I've seen it is like definitely a scary thing. I don't know if I've seen

1672
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:31,660
Like specific examples of things happening, but like the precedent is like scary enough. The precedent is pretty scary

1673
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,500
I'm

1674
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,660
I don't know. I mean I could be wrong, but I

1675
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:39,340
Feel like it like it hasn't there hasn't been like I don't know

1676
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:42,140
there hasn't been like a uh, you know, like

1677
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,260
A trans crystal knocked in texas yet, you know, hopefully there won't be

1678
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:51,820
Hopefully like the judge will will stop it before that happens

1679
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:55,420
Ah

1680
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,060
2022 is a good it's a good time

1681
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:02,460
Texas be crazy. It's crazy texans

1682
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,340
um, that's it

1683
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:12,380
The next one is called Nate bestman and terrible translations

1684
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,700
There it is. Uh, yep there three two one go

1685
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:24,300
Okay, so I just rewatched the one piece lecture even though it is the second worst lecture with the first one

1686
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:26,380
Of course being the final fancy one

1687
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:28,780
And one of my big takeaways

1688
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:30,860
Was that then

1689
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:36,300
You really got to tell your stupid brother to stop reading terrible fan translations

1690
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:43,580
Because best guy mr. Nate bestman commits one of the cardinal sins of terrible translation

1691
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,620
Where he says something to the tune of

1692
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:51,660
When delfut users get seawater on them they turn into a hammer

1693
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:54,060
now

1694
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:59,900
The reason this is so bad is because the phrase kanazuchi in japanese which literally means hammer

1695
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:06,300
Uh figuratively is often used in japanese as a phrase to mean somebody who can't swim

1696
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:08,780
yeah, so

1697
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:13,660
In a lot of like terrible fan translations, which I assume are just translated with like you will translate

1698
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:20,460
They don't they they just translate that word as hammer. They just go like oh, you're such a hammer

1699
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:23,020
Even though in english that does make any sense

1700
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:25,180
um

1701
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:31,260
But a japanese person would understand it because it just means a person who can't swim. That's what it means. Yeah other pet peeves

1702
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:34,300
A best guy says things like shichibukai

1703
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:42,060
Or tenryubito or kairoseki even though these are just normal japanese words that could be easily translated

1704
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:49,740
They're not like titles or something. These are just words. It sucks. It's terrible. Fuck you. Okay. I I like shibukai

1705
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,820
I think it's fun to say it like that. I

1706
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:57,980
Instead of I understand this I understand warlords. I understand this caller's point

1707
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:01,260
Okay, I feel okay. I mean

1708
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,220
I'm gonna I'm gonna

1709
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:06,460
I'm gonna extend you

1710
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:14,060
The goodwill to assume caller that you don't think that nate thinks that like literally they turn into hammers

1711
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:18,060
Right like you know that he doesn't mean that so like

1712
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:25,660
Nate knows that he's talking about a colloquialism for not being able to swim a japanese colloquialism a japanese colloquialism

1713
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:28,140
You don't like

1714
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:33,180
That he spent okay. I think you don't like that nate says

1715
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:41,900
That maybe you think that nate presents it almost like a sort of one-piece ism that you turn into a hammer

1716
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:44,300
Is what happens to you when you?

1717
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:48,940
Get water on you as opposed to the reality which is that it is just a common

1718
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:54,060
Japanese phrase maybe it would have been better to not even bother translating it literally and just

1719
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:56,060
Say, you know

1720
01:56:56,060 --> 01:57:01,820
You you you become dead weight you become dead weight or something else like an english I feel like similar what phrase

1721
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:05,260
I feel like I just don't agree with this guy

1722
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:09,260
Or maybe you sink like a stone you sink like a stone would maybe be a better translation

1723
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:12,380
That like because I I don't know I grew up reading

1724
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:15,660
translated anime and manga

1725
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:19,260
And I you know, they don't always translate every word. They don't always

1726
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:24,380
A localize every term. Yeah, and so I feel like that's

1727
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:27,100
just sort of the fun

1728
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:32,220
Like flavor of like yeah, I don't know it doesn't have to be one way or the other

1729
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,860
I don't mind people who like insist on

1730
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,580
Not saying the japanese words or

1731
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:43,420
Or what but like yeah, well what you got to get on my case for saying shibukai or like akatsuki

1732
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:46,380
Like I like saying that I think I think there's some charm

1733
01:57:46,460 --> 01:57:51,260
I think there's some charm to a sort of inept translation where you read like oh

1734
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:56,140
He he becomes a hammer and then there's a little asterisk and then you read at the bottom

1735
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:59,660
That's like this is this is a this is a colloquial expression for

1736
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:04,860
Being unable to swim. I mean it feels like it's like self-evident anyway

1737
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:09,660
Like he becomes a hammer in water. It's like well, I know what would happen if a hammer was in water. It would sink

1738
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,540
I think

1739
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:13,900
I think I think it's fun

1740
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:20,220
It is also fun and I appreciate I could I appreciate the value of like yeah a localization that

1741
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:24,700
It would probably be a more natural reading experience to an english author

1742
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:29,100
You know or to an english reader if you don't have that and if you just instead of

1743
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,300
instead of just saying

1744
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:36,300
He becomes a hammer and then having an asterisk and instead of just

1745
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:42,460
Being you use you use an english phrase like oh if you type water gets on you you'll sink like a stone

1746
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:46,860
You know you'll use like a an english equivalent of like a colloquial phrase

1747
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:53,500
I I think that's you know, it's fun to think about that and that's probably like that's probably a better

1748
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:59,340
You know a better way like a more professional and like cleaner and smoother doesn't take you out of the

1749
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:02,220
Story sort of way to do it

1750
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:04,940
Uh, I guess too, okay

1751
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:08,380
And I understand the argument that like to a japanese speaker

1752
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,420
Maybe you would read the word tenryubito

1753
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:13,500
Not as like a

1754
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,580
You know a proper noun not as like a name

1755
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:20,860
But just as a phrase the way an english person would read. Oh the celestial dragons

1756
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:26,060
Oh the seven the seven warlords of the sea, you know, you wouldn't think it

1757
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:31,260
Yeah, but I I I kind of like the japanese names. I like shichibukai and tenryubito

1758
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:37,420
I like saying them. Yeah, I understand. I but although I get I get why it's like that's not how it's intended

1759
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:42,140
It's it's not intended to be read as like a word spoken in a different language

1760
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:48,620
So I feel like you know, I'm gonna be a fence sitting centrist and I'm gonna say I see both sides of these

1761
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,340
Uh

1762
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:55,660
Yeah, I like saying loro no zoro like what's the enemy?

1763
01:59:55,820 --> 02:00:01,180
Oh, did you know that in japanese the r letter is the the r

1764
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:12,060
That's where yeah japanese

1765
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:18,780
it's a it's a fun thing for a teenager to like try and figure out how to say

1766
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:23,060
true not from the right culture to do that that's right that's what I did I

1767
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:28,180
I tried I learned some I got a book on tape learn Japanese from the library when

1768
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:34,340
I was a kid and I learned a little bit of phrasing here and there it was fun

1769
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:39,940
anyway anyway this guy this this caller you got a point but I think you're being

1770
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:47,460
a little too I think you're being a little too serious about it no it's

1771
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:51,580
supposed to be straw hat it just means I mean I mean I mean I guess you yeah you

1772
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:55,740
would make the same I mean I mean I mean actually I mean I guess that makes it

1773
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:58,620
right because they're not they're not calling him some fancy title moogie

1774
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:01,220
wada they're calling they're just calling oh it's interesting it's

1775
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:07,820
straw hat loofy it's more it's colloquial I and I can I can agree and accept that

1776
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:12,300
you are I would to come across as a nerd if I went around saying moogie wada all

1777
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:17,420
the time but I just kind of like it it's over it's like that would be like if in

1778
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:21,220
if in the original they call him like they literally call me oh stood all

1779
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:26,780

1782
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:51,860
how to get your podcasts on Spotify Apple podcasts etc. 3 2 1 go apologies if

1783
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:56,620
the Spotify situation has been cleared up already if so feel free to skip this

1784
02:01:56,620 --> 02:02:01,380
I'm gonna lose my mind but as somebody with a podcast themselves

1785
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:08,380
it's 12 podcast called tales gets podcast please check it out okay I might be a

1786
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:15,100
modicum of help so the way you upload to platforms such as Apple music or Apple

1787
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:22,180
podcasts and Spotify is that you have to submit an RSS feed this is this is

1788
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:30,340
torture this is torture and so how you updates all the podcasts on like spot

1789
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:35,420
etc. is just by uploading a new podcast to your RSS feeds then it

1790
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:40,940
automatically gets put on all the different platforms okay so really all

1791
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:45,340
you need to do is get your hands on that RSS feed yeah and just uploads the

1792
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:53,900
episodes that aren't in there to it I assume Tom set up the RSS feed and I

1793
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:57,780
don't know how you did it because there's many ways of doing it some you can

1794
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:03,020
make it yourself or you can use like a service to make it so you upload through

1795
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:09,860
that this is literally the worst track down Tom and like steal the RSS feed

1796
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:14,620
like right out of so this is like missing the start uploading this is like how

1797
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:20,660
did you talk for a minute 30 and convey zero information like I know we still

1798
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:24,260
need to get a hold of Tom thanks for thanks like thanks for nothing like I'm

1799
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:28,740
literally angry I'm literally angry at you from for making this like what is

1800
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:32,900
wrong with you why did you think I needed to hear this yes the point is yes

1801
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:37,340
Tom controls the RSS feed yes I know yes Tom is in charge yes oh I just I just

1802
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:42,020
got to get Tom to do it I know that's what I've been saying this week has been

1803
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:46,740
I've gotten a bunch more messages I don't I've got a bunch more messages from

1804
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:50,860
people asking me Ben can you please no I know I asked already but can you please

1805
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:54,340
put them on the podcast apps and like how many fucking times do I have to tell

1806
02:03:54,340 --> 02:03:58,860
you I don't have the power Tom's in charge of it Tom has the RSS feed how

1807
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:02,260
many fucking times do you have to hear that's not my fucking problem why are

1808
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:06,780
people still asking me about it how why don't they ask Tom like what could I do

1809
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:11,340
to make it clearer that somebody else is in fucking charge of it I don't get it

1810
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:20,940
who don't ask me again you fucks okay that's it cuz Tom doesn't answer me I

1811
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:25,220
have it's Tom just don't just Tom just ignores me when I ask him about it and

1812
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:29,940
that's and that's the truth that's that's just where we're at with that so now

you know like it's if I I just I just won't I just won't answer anymore I

02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:56,820
okay anything else no okay hmm what I don't know I see I see Tom tweeting about

1816
02:04:56,820 --> 02:05:04,260
playing Elden Ring yeah like like surely you'd be able to just reply and say oh

1817
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:09,260
yes sorry I'll get around to it like at least that I know what he's doing yeah

1818
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:14,460
no I haven't no he obviously and myself okay okay okay I haven't I haven't dm

1819
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:19,620

1820
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:23,380

1821
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:26,180
right now because I have not actually do you know what I'm gonna do it right now

1822
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:34,180

1823
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:39,100
and and I rescind all my previous anger and if it doesn't get fixed after this

1824
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:45,940
then I will unresend it I had assumed you already dm'd him and he just hadn't

1825
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:49,380
responded that's why I thought no I just added him in the pcp discord which I'm

1826
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:56,100
like he would have seen it obviously like like he maybe not I don't see why

1827
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:12,780
not there we go okay all right message sent I just don't I just don't get it I

1828
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:17,100
just don't get why people keep asking me about it when like I've said like it's

1829
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:22,220
not me I guess I guess I guess just you know for the sake of cosmic justice like

1830
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:27,660
I hope I hope people have been asking Tom too because like there's there's

1831
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:31,500
literally no reason why like I'm the guy like I've said over and over that like

1832
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:40,820
I'm not the guy so it's just it's a little annoying I guess but anyway okay I

1833
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:46,580
sent I sent a dm there I dm'd and now now I have done the extent of

1834
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:50,180
everything I could possibly do about it anyway I fucking hate you voicemailer

1835
02:06:50,180 --> 02:06:59,700
fuck you and fuck your podcast next next one is called Nate soundboard there

1836
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:06,660
it is 3 2 1 go dude remember when Nate debuted as soundboard just to leave the

1837
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:13,100
podcast like three episodes later was that all about kind of cringe I don't

1838
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:18,940
know man I don't know like you it's cringe because you wanted to see more of

1839
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:21,820
the sound yeah did you want more soundboard or do you think he just

1840
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:26,100
shouldn't have bothered debuting it what's what's your what's your solution to

1841
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:31,380
this to this cringe conundrum you've presented us with here you already had

1842
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:34,740
it for a stream that in me I think it was just sort of like I figured out how

1843
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:43,740
to make it play during a podcast yeah maybe yeah maybe I don't know I don't

1844
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:55,580
know okay next one is something there it is it is called then you skip one did

1845
02:07:55,580 --> 02:08:02,340

02:08:11,900 --> 02:08:18,020
have you done it yet no not yet I'll do it yeah I'll go to the library I've been

1848
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:21,860
playing Hades I just released the game a few days ago I guess it's been like four

1849
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:28,460
or five days it's been playing video games and setting up book pages I'll go

1850
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:34,020
to the library I'll go to the library one of these days but thanks for the

1851
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:40,620
reminder next one is called Ben's Saint character inconsistencies to come on

1852
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:47,420
writers three two one go when the character of Ben Saints reacted to the

1853
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:53,460
reveal of the new Pokemons he uttered this phrase I haven't played a good

1854
02:08:53,460 --> 02:09:01,660
Pokemon game since white two however in his own Pokemon son Nuzlocke he said

1855
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:11,380
this I love this game so no wonder this character is so controversial he is so

1856
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:15,380
inconsistent the writers don't even know what to do with this character I mean

1857
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:21,020
come on man get some consistency into the Ben Saint character now I I remember

1858
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:27,100
like I I had a pretty okay time playing Sun I felt more positively about Sun

1859
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,880
while I was playing it than I do in hindsight in hindsight I think it was

1860
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:34,680
pretty underwhelming and I think a lot of the changes they made were bad and I

1861
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:37,760
don't think it's a good direction for the series and I'm not very happy with

1862
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:42,460
it at the time I thought it was okay even so even still I don't think I would

1863
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:47,240
have sighed and said I love this game it just doesn't sound like something I

1864
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:52,160
would say I don't believe you I think you're lying it sounds like the sort of

1865
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:57,680
thing you would say sarcastically maybe something terrible happened yeah yeah

1866
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:03,200
that sounds yeah it sounds about right okay next one is called rip capitalism

1867
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:22,240
three two one go you made it I know we calling a nighter good bye bye thanks see

02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:37,400
extended a lot of good here's my minimalist run where I actually beat it I didn't actually

1906
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:41,560
didn't actually take me 10 minutes because I closed the tab after a break and then I proceeded

1907
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:49,720
to drop in at the last 10 minutes of gib stream uh no I did take you 10 minutes um because that's

1908
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:55,800
the time for the run I you're not the first person to say this and I feel like people don't

1909
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:01,800
get that like the time is not the time you spent playing the whole game it's the time you spent

1910
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:08,360
in the run it's always like that so no it definitely did take you 10 minutes uh don't

1911
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:13,480
worry about it that's pretty fast though no one I haven't seen anyone try to speed run it

1912
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:18,120
uh yeah I haven't seen anyone try to speed run pumpkin alley either

1913
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:24,840
when the hot fix comes out I will explicitly ask for people to do that because

1914
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:33,960
that there's there's a lot of like because it's a 3d game uh there's lots of like potential for

1915
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:42,520
like time saving and and like skips I want to see what people can figure out I I did not add

1916
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:48,280
anything unnecessary to phantom's revenge everything that ended up in there was 100

1917
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:59,480
crucial for the experience um on a slime coin on a no you know no that not text texturally it's

1918
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:06,280
texturally necessary it had the if it changes the it changes the uh the way you feel about it

1919
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:12,760
uh yeah I guess uh no I'm just kidding obviously obviously you're right yeah slime coin is totally

1920
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:18,680
slime coin is totally pointless floor reflections pretty much a waste of time they look nice but

1921
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:21,880
they could have gotten away with they were nice I could have gotten away with adam and honestly

1922
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:29,640
I probably should have but oh well whatever uh you know but not nothing unnecessary uh the um

1923
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:41,240
um what else did he say uh about uh oh I was I think on a I think on a um on a

1924
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:48,360
patreon podcast I will probably go into like stuff that I sort of thought about adding to

1925
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:52,840
the game there was a bunch there's a whole I have a whole list of things that I was considering like

1926
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:58,200
I would like to maybe add this to the game but then I was like no just just you have to stop

1927
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:02,920
you see it has it has to stop somewhere there there were a few features that I was like

1928
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:13,800
really considering uh uh I yeah also like before I really like got a lot of the game like nailed

1929
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:18,680
down like when it was just a battle system with like nothing in it there was I was there was a

1930
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:25,880
lot of like I was considering like a different sorts of like enemies and stuff I was I had like

1931
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:30,040
different ideas about what it could have been uh I don't know there's a lot of things that could

1932
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:37,000
have been but it is what it is and that's a tautology anyway the next one is there's no voicemail

1933
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:45,640
there's just a link to a tweet from doid gazer oh yes yeah this is really good actually doid gazer

1934
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:54,040
is um I haven't seen this I saw this on um yeah on twitter this is actually really good

1935
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:59,720
the pcp iceberg okay or maybe it's or make you crew no it's the void it's like the it's supposed

1936
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:04,360
to be like the void gazer is like Trixie the golden witch iceberg I think is what it's supposed to be

1937
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:14,120
oh is it I think so well I feel like this is pcp stuff because like even at the top star fleet

1938
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:18,600
weird utilitarianism has nothing to do with Trixie at all yeah yeah you're right

1939
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:27,720
uh ask pcp I'm just could we use that hashtag I guess we did yeah for I for the um for when

1940
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:34,440
we were doing questions instead of like voicemails yeah we did rebel pixels neuro typing that's all

1941
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:41,640
this is all normal stuff yeah make survive tbap mining at night sigh wonderbred ripple xrp

1942
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:49,960
group piss slash shit what's your favorite anime yeah one one one one uh riddle my ass

1943
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:54,840
batman wears the podcast I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna go down until I find something I don't

1944
02:18:54,840 --> 02:19:00,680
even remember I actually I don't remember what's your favorite anime that was a question we got

1945
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:07,880
like annoyingly like frequently because like people thought it was digipros anime podcast yeah well

1946
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:12,200
and so there would be like again come up with better questions and that was like a thing we would

1947
02:19:12,200 --> 02:19:23,800
we would rag on I guess uh uh monkey kick uh what's that time Ben been recorded through speakers

1948
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,040
what what does that mean you remember that uh I mean I know my mic used to be pretty bad

1949
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:38,520
I don't remember Ben recorded do they mean that like do they mean like you were recorded

1950
02:19:38,520 --> 02:19:46,440
via someone else's speakers of your voice uh like so that's what it sounds like yeah I'm not sure

1951
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:57,480
either uh let's keep going pizza jumps maddox synchronicities Ben and Jackie's college fun

1952
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:03,720
that's that's a good one that now they now there's a piece of like lost media right there yeah

1953
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:11,080
maddox maddox synchronicities is that's not do they just mean like like oh there was a breakup

1954
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:14,520
and somebody's got to be the dick and somebody's got to be the maddox I think that is what they

1955
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:20,600
like is that yeah yeah it doesn't really line up that's not really like a high profile thing

1956
02:20:21,240 --> 02:20:27,480
yeah like it's yeah it that's just like a hey is in some ways this one thing that happened was

1957
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:32,040
resembled another thing in certain aspects like crazy um

1958
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:43,000
has he groomed munchie now that now that one I'm familiar with give rights for doctor

1959
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:49,480
Jesse okay I think I think this point when you get to the beluga whale that's when you just go from

1960
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:56,040
like well I guess Tom is a vegetarian is is not true but like that we used to say that you know

1961
02:20:56,040 --> 02:21:01,960
we used to say Tom was a communist too uh that used that used to be a thing Thomas in one of the

1962
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:10,200
the rumbles yeah yeah that was a way from way back give rights for dr who what is that in reference

1963
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:16,120
to uh it's because you're just that I do writing stuff uh because you were a show you're a show

1964
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:23,480
writer you do that I get do you do because you're writing stuff for a secret for a secret

1965
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:31,320
project and still yeah so it's dr who because you're British oh well what else what else would

1966
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:38,440
it be yeah um davoo is why davoo wasn't a red con three I don't remember that why wasn't davoo a red

1967
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:44,440
con three I think she just didn't want to come I think it's as simple as that

1968
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:58,200
or wait had she left by then the right con three no maybe um maybe a little are you sure I I you

1969
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:10,280
know I don't remember I know I know at some point she hmm I feel like she was like the first person

1970
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:16,520
to be like hey guys I've I'm officially like I'm like I'm actually leaving like I'm I'm officially

1971
02:22:16,520 --> 02:22:23,560
out and that might I feel like I feel like she was on a like a I need to reduce my presence on the

1972
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:28,520
internet because I'm a game developer now people are gonna find my tweets like that was the thing

1973
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:34,840
she was going on stupid and so she wanted to appear on podcast less and I maybe that was part of

1974
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:45,640
like red con three not coming do you uh yeah I think you you know I don't really exactly remember

1975
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:51,320
like if there was any particular reason or if there it was just like she was just like yeah

1976
02:22:51,640 --> 02:23:01,240
yeah um you know she deleted her she deleted her discord recently did you know about that

1977
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:08,920
like she started discord no she had she put out like two videos started a discord and then deleted

1978
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:16,280
it and said like oh this was like a youtuber discord yeah like like a like a davoo cord

1979
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:23,240
to go along with like I remember it's it's very strange I remember she said she put out

1980
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:34,120
she messaged me to say some shit about uh uh Trixie or whatever and then she said she said and

1981
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:42,920
said she was considering like getting more back into like being online then she made a discord

1982
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,120
and was like I want to be more online then like I want to be in like a community whatever

1983
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:55,640
then she big mistake big big mistake and then she put out that uh five will goes west video uh

1984
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:01,400
and then I think she did one more video after that I'm not sure like more like maybe like a week

1985
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:08,120
ago or two weeks ago um which I missed at the time but it's there and then like a week ago she was

1986
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:13,560
like yeah guys I've decided that uh this was like I was trying I was testing it out uh doing

1987
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:20,520
community uh being online uh don't want to do it uh I'm deleting the discord by uh maybe I'll

1988
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:30,440
like I'll keep making videos but no more community uh it's just stupid I don't know this is dumb um

1989
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:40,280
yeah um anyway so in the in the lowest category then there's devu as a symbiote

1990
02:24:41,320 --> 02:24:44,520
does that is that like the the devu collective that joke

1991
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:49,480
problem is something different you know it's probably

1992
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:57,160
I mean none of these are none of these are real at this point these are all no but like I'm trying

1993
02:24:57,160 --> 02:25:03,000
because like I feel like the devu collective was a very well known joke in comparison to that some

1994
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,920
of these other things I don't think yeah that's what makes me think it's not that I think it's

1995
02:25:06,920 --> 02:25:13,160
saying like devu is not a real human devu is actually like a like a creature that like like

1996
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:18,600
you know maybe latched on to like a Trixie or something that was like a a parasite growing

1997
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:26,360
in Trixie's body or something not a not a human I vaguely remember mage as a tulper I don't remember

1998
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:32,200
in what context was she on an episode where we were talking about tulpers I don't think these

1999
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:40,280
last ones are even like based in anything fiance blood ritual gamer saver and his xkgp

2000
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:44,840
sounds pretty legit though I mean we don't we don't know how old he is

2001
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:50,600
I guess not I guess not like exactly no

2002
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:58,760
it's true then it's just true if we don't know so it's true yes so it's true if we don't

2003
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:03,480
the fact if we don't know everything then like anything anything could be true

2004
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:08,600
as far as as far as I'm concerned sorry I'm putting my bathrobe on because it's getting

2005
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:16,840
chilly in here yeah okay uh so yeah this is uh this is great I love this it's pretty good

2006
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:24,280

2018
02:27:45,240 --> 02:27:52,200
about anime it's more about like life in japan because they all they live in japan um uh yeah

02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:48,920
that's it that's my answer um okay next one

2043
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:56,920
shit sorry I lost my place I'm stupid I'm stupid uh oh god it's a long one

2044
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:04,200
okay this one is called the best non pcp lectures and the problem with most lectures

2045
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:12,120
there's no way this needs to be a minute 30 three two one go all right the best non pcp lectures

2046
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:21,960
are the tectonic improv linkara one as well as the wip university christian reformation one

2047
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:28,520
imo I haven't heard of that one uh there are some decent ones like for example the ash vampire

2048
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:35,480
bionicle one no as well as vampires a piece of shit and his life studios russell grair one

2049
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:41,160
the problem with most lectures though and the vast majority of lectures are

2050
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,200
similar wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait did this did this idiot just recommend the void

2051
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:54,280
gazers russell grair lecture the topics like aren't good for lectures is that what just happened

2052
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:59,800
conducive to the lecture I wasn't listening like it's good final fantasy and this guy's serious this

2053
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:05,800
guy thinks that the that the ash vampire bionicle lecture and the void gazers russell grair lecture

2054
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:10,680
I watched like five minutes of that russell grair one and it was like incoherent and I didn't know

2055
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:16,440
what he was talking about okay whatever there's like loads of them this guy this where this no

2056
02:32:16,440 --> 02:32:22,280
I'm done I've had enough now we know now we know whatever lectures you got to choose the right subject

2057
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:28,280
matter uh it's got to be something yes oh my god it's the same fucking thing it's the same

2058
02:32:28,280 --> 02:32:32,360
fucking thing he says oh it's better to just watch the thing you need something that you need

2059
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:38,840
that you need a lecturer to explain it to you on I know I'm gonna feel I'm gonna feel really bad

2060
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:44,120
if this is like a new viewer who like hasn't like heard us say this exact thing like a thousand times

2061
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:49,960
but well guess what buddy we've said this a thousand times ah I'm mad I'm mad at the voicemail

2062
02:32:49,960 --> 02:33:01,800
today um next one is called lectures part oh god he didn't make a sequel one did he next one is

2063
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:08,600

2065
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:25,480
heard all I need to hear next one is called uh it's a youtube video okay it's from this is from

2066
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:33,560
what the fuck was this video lol at gmail.com okay this is the this is the lady latest yig studio video

2067
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:43,240
entitled we have elden ring at home with the thumbnail called it says elfin ring I watched

2068
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:49,640
like the first uh like minute of this it's performing about as well as all yig studio videos do

2069
02:33:51,400 --> 02:34:01,320
uh the I think the gist of it is my my computer instead of playing the elden ring I'm playing

2070
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:08,360
elfin ring I'm playing it's not actually called elfin ring oh it's called like something ring

2071
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:16,680
uh whatever ring a ding ding I don't know it's just it's like it's just a video I see like hey I

2072
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:22,680
didn't play elden ring I played this other old rpg instead uh at least that's that's the video

2073
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:28,600
I don't know that's pretty soon by the way I will be playing elden ring on stream

2074
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:34,360
oh once the lord of ghost things get get shipped off you said you would be able to play you said

2075
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:40,520
you wouldn't play it until lord of ghosts I gotta admit I have felt like I've been missing out on

2076
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:46,120
something by not playing elden ring everyone seems to just be having such a great time playing elden

2077
02:34:46,120 --> 02:34:54,280
ring yeah it's it's just like universally like that's a good one so I'm like I'm sure I'm gonna

2078
02:34:54,360 --> 02:35:01,320
have fun with it and I and I I would enjoy the process of streaming it and having everyone in chat

2079
02:35:01,320 --> 02:35:05,400
be a veteran of the game and being like no no no no no you gotta do this you gotta do that and I'd

2080
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:11,720
be like huh what then I die that would be fun I want that to happen that does sound fun um okay the

2081
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:18,200

2082
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:24,120

2083
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:29,160
just like I think it we literally just like butt dialed us or something so we'll skip that one

2084
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:45,320
that's fine no problem uh next voicemail is called no tom no watch I wonder uh wait shit uh oh god

2093
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:55,960
I guess um okay whatever next one is a message for voicemailers everywhere three two one go

2094
02:36:58,040 --> 02:37:04,760
everyone or all of the voicemailers we gotta stop sending messages yeah gotta stop saying voicemails

2095
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:11,480
for one week because every episode is way too fucking long so uh I'll stop it for one week

2096
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:17,080
and then we can see you back on next week guys okay there are a lot of people who would be mad that

2097
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:23,320
you said the episodes are way too long people love that some people are like super long episodes

2098
02:37:23,320 --> 02:37:30,600
five hour episodes please yeah I get it I watched that I watched the entire uh

2099
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:36,760
it's it saves somebody it saves somebody having to like click on another video

2100
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:43,640
yeah why would you want to let it play just let it play I get it I genuinely get it next one is

2101
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:49,320
called phantoms revenge three two one go so then his fans revenge you're taking revenge on tripsy

2102
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:54,200
if not you should update the game to be that because that would be an even and more people will play

2103
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:59,880
and fuck you fuck you you didn't play you didn't play the game if you didn't play the game you

2104
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:07,160
don't know it is I can't tell this is a joke I mean I think he's just saying like ha ha revenge

2105
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:13,400
is tricksy okay yeah you're right now and now I'm imagining like the same game but like the

2106
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:20,760
sprites are replaced with phantom horn is just been saying it'd be terrible and and um the sonichus are

2107
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:29,480
uh yigtralite so whatever you could call them I mean did didgy brony is in is in the game

2108
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:38,040
now that is true oh like like didgy brony too it's it's uh it's

2109
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:46,360
you I think you started to pick up on it you started to pick up and I don't know if you

2110
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:54,600
uh picked up everything but there is um there is sort of a like sort of undiscussed

2111
02:38:55,240 --> 02:39:05,080
like story happening in the game with the son I mean uh some of them okay I'll just say

2112
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:11,480
her name her name her name would be didgy bro her name her son even though she's a son of

2113
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:14,760
her name would not be didgy bro sonichu it would just be didgy bro

2114
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:23,720
and that's uh that's uh that's that's consistent that's consistent with all the other uh names in

2115
02:39:23,720 --> 02:39:35,720
the game the I wonder what that means uh you you got to that chamber and you were like huh does that

2116
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:43,640
mean does that mean that some of these sonichus were ponies and I was like hey hey you saw some

2117
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:49,320
other stuff before that you didn't notice but uh it was there so it was there all along

2118
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:57,720
so like pony sonichus turned from ponies I mean I guess nightstar well I shouldn't say anything

2119
02:39:57,720 --> 02:40:03,160
about that but I mean well nightstar okay well nightstar is a sonichu right in the same way that

2120
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:11,080
chris chan is a sonichu yeah they they just are for some reason I now that I think about it I have

2121
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:17,000
no idea aside from like generating soldiers for a war which I guess is happening I have no idea what

2122
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:23,400
that like thing the the facility is doing in ponyville in everfree forests specifically

2123
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:31,800
I will say if you've seen in my second lecture in sonichu one or two when I'm talking about

2124
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:38,360
which which issue is it issue 13 or issue 12 the one that's just like a big text dump of like

2125
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:48,760
fucked up shit happening there's the part where there is the part in that issue where um sonichu's

2126
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:57,080
blood like chris chan's blood gets like splattered over like I think it gets like it gets disseminated

2127
02:40:57,080 --> 02:41:01,400
through the water supply or it gets like like a wave of it or something something happens

2128
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:06,680
chris chan's blood gets on all the nazis that are invading quickville and they all turn into

2129
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:13,640
sonichu's uh and that's just canon that's just on then the sonichu race is filled with nazis

2130
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:22,680
I think all those nazis died no no they no they go a lot of them die discord gives them a lot of

2131
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:27,960
them heart attacks a lot of the remaining ones go back to germany and disband the rite

2132
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:37,400
that's that's just canon that's just the text that's just the text um there's a

2133
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:43,240
I feel like I need to reread sonichu but I don't want to let me let me let me think there are a

2134
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:52,440
couple of sonichu's in phantom's revenge uh what are they blue yon blue yonder is one uh strawberry

2135
02:41:52,440 --> 02:42:00,120
shortcake I think I think that no not strawberry shortcake its name is like uh strawberry something

2136
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,080
um strawberry cream I think it might be called strawberry cream and there's another one called

2137
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:11,880
uh roaming service and there might be one or two others too but the a few of the sonichu's have some

2138
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:19,320
like descriptions that might stand out a little bit uh I don't want to say I don't want to I've

2139
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:28,760
said too much already uh anyway next voicemail is called uh prince isolation

2213
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:59,240
that's pretty good uh drawing the ending I didn't like it I found it very uncomfortable

2214
02:51:59,240 --> 02:52:10,600
to draw that scene but uh Gabe you told me that it was fine well I it's without getting

2215
02:52:11,400 --> 02:52:20,280
too specific yeah it's like it's uh it's like somewhat gory yeah a little bit it's not like

2216
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:27,480
like actually unsettling at least for me in terms of like visuals obviously what's happening is

2217
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:34,520
maybe a bit like it's not it's not about yeah it's not about uh it's not about like the I guess

2218
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:41,800
you could I guess you could call it gore a little bit it's not like yeah yeah it's sort of that is

2219
02:52:41,800 --> 02:52:50,760
just a yeah uh it's just like uh it's like what it says about phantom horn is that what makes you

2220
02:52:50,760 --> 02:53:03,400
unsettled it's sort no not really no it was just like uh it's not that it says like oh it's that it's

2221
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:12,200
bad it's like oh oh I don't know it's not that it's just that it's like a it's it's literally just like

2222
02:53:12,920 --> 02:53:22,120
if I was phantom in this situation this would feel terrible and and like that's it so I'm just like

2223
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:28,440
I'm just feeling it I'm just feeling it drawing it when I feel it feeling it when I draw it and

2224
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:36,760
when I look at it that's it uh yeah that's because I'm that's I'm what you call I'm what you call an

2225
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:46,520
artist give oh really what's that try it sometime why don't you um next voicemail is called uh did I

2226
02:53:46,520 --> 02:53:53,080
upload it already yes I did st comics dot com slash patreon dot com slash ben saint dot com three two one go

2227
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:03,560
to the round of phony veal there was a stranger one fine day it's the song

2228
02:54:05,640 --> 02:54:09,400
heart I spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say oh my god

2229
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:17,640
Jesus she was wanted and a killer his slime level ten and four and his slime court verified

2230
02:54:17,640 --> 02:54:25,400
cal count number one and 19 more one and 19 more Jesus was this guy trying his best

2231
02:54:25,400 --> 02:54:32,120
early in the morning when he rode into the town yeah I mean yeah exactly what he said

2232
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:39,640
haha what sounds like this is canon no one dare to ask his business no one dare to make a slip

2233
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:48,840
the stranger there among them had a big artist if they can't I can't believe it I can't believe it

2234
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:56,920
no hold the stranger lived a pony who would the stranger come to me and she watched the stranger

2235
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:03,800
marching down the cobble pony this is this is great in her bunker on the yaskers she came

2236
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:09,640
I'll kill you I'll fucking kill you fuck it up the slimy stranger was marching towards his day

2237
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:11,560
marching towards his day

2238
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:20,360
base that I like I like that being the canon voice of red man in that sequence

2239
02:55:21,320 --> 02:55:28,120
yeah that's what makes it funny this was uh I don't know LA is our post the somebody's got to

2240
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:37,560
do it like a pcp animated event I did there's this there's a four panel sequence of red man

2241
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:45,080
in the red man in the classic red man comic poses he's singing that song that was uh that was really

2242
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:57,240
something okay next wait a minute okay okay the next one all right now I'm unsure because the next

2243
02:55:57,240 --> 02:56:06,200
one is called please don't play the previous one too late it's too late okay I assume that the other

2244
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:13,240
one was the all right maybe this is the one that um maybe this is the one that uh crezathore meant

2245
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:19,720
not to play and I told him I wouldn't play it but like that was good I already played it and like

2246
02:56:19,720 --> 02:56:27,000
it's kind I mean I have mixed feelings about it no no I love it I love it okay I think it's fine

2247
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:35,320
yeah it's fine don't worry about it um next one is called uh uh god I lost my place next one is called

2248
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:44,920
david hater come collector um oh wait I haven't posted yet David hater come collector there it is

2249
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:52,920
okay three two one go so you wanted better voicemails to riff on here you go give then

2250
02:56:52,920 --> 02:56:57,960
possibly cheesy as a comic artist to a comic artist which platforms would you recommend for

2251
02:56:57,960 --> 02:57:02,440
upload they're all terrible also how much your sites cost you and how hard to maintain their

2252
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:09,560
framework is um they're all all platforms are bad they're all terrible if there's one they're like

2253
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:15,160
I don't know I guess line webtoon is okay it's probably the one most people use I don't know

2254
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:23,800
yeah webtoons all right the I don't feel like they're necessarily good for all types of comic

2255
02:57:23,800 --> 02:57:31,880
you have to be like the right kind to get big noticed on there um yeah when it comes to my

2256
02:57:31,880 --> 02:57:39,880
website it's like a wordpress thing and I pay for the domain and since it's not like dot com it's

2257
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:47,800
just dot site it's like cheaper if I got it through hover which is you may have heard of that it's

2258
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:55,720
like a like a domain registering thing yeah it's quite easy to use my website I got through I think

2259
02:57:55,720 --> 02:58:03,480
it's called digital ocean uh I pay like 10 I pay like $10 a month just to keep my like domain active

2260
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:13,400
uh which is like whatever um I pay like eight pounds a year on give and take dot site

2261
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:20,120
wait do I pay $10 a month $10 a month seems like a lot but I guess I don't know

2262
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:30,600
hmm I know for my other website um it's like 11 pounds for a dotco.uk for a site that I made

2263
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:39,400
for uni that I don't use for anything I think maybe I just decided that I just wanted that dot com

2264
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:47,960
really bad do with the coom it does it does seem high now that I think about it

2265
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:56,360
I mean dot com I don't know the the legality thing I assume that like you're not allowed to sell

2266
02:58:56,360 --> 02:59:02,120
things if it's not a dot com like you can't set you can't have a website if it's not dot com

2267
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:06,760
because it's commercial but I don't know whether that's actually enforced or whether that's true

2268
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:12,120
there's no way that that's like enforced I'll I'll have to look into that because like I was

2269
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:17,480
thinking like maybe I should make give and take dot com or something as well I just think it's more

2270
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:25,880
expensive I don't know I just think it's yeah I mean I don't think it really matters uh it honestly

2271
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:33,640
I probably should have just gone for dot st comics dot dot slime all right well I mean that would be

2272
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:40,840
sick um there's lots of things you could do it's just like um I guess the cool ones are really

2273
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:46,280
expensive and the ones that everybody knows to type in are the most expensive like dot com

2274
02:59:47,960 --> 02:59:55,160
or like dot gov if you're like no those are those are very expensive um all right next one is

2275
02:59:55,160 --> 03:00:01,880
what's that squeaking noise in the last episode uh answer I don't know I don't know what you're

2276
03:00:01,880 --> 03:00:08,280
referring to yeah I don't know was there a squeaking noise I don't remember one uh next one is uh

2277
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:17,320
come collector two sons of liberty three two one go speaking of metal gear did you play

2278
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:25,640
who is best but raid nor snake I played the first one and I didn't finish it and that's it I played

2279
03:00:25,640 --> 03:00:31,720
the first one for a few minutes by the first one I mean solid solid yeah metal go solid yeah

2280
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:38,520
I didn't get very far and I was kind of confused and it was too hard I think I got to like the

2281
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:45,400
like the second elevator sequence I did I never beat it I got like pretty far I knew it and I

2282
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:52,840
never beat it I have like the short game I didn't yeah it's I had never played the whole thing

2283
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:59,240
but I it wouldn't be that difficult to just go through it I think with games like that that

2284
03:00:59,240 --> 03:01:09,320
and like Resident Evil the fact that there are like oh um uh you can't there's like things that you

2285
03:01:09,320 --> 03:01:16,040
can't get back or like rations and stuff healing things or saving points or stuff it's all like um

2286
03:01:16,040 --> 03:01:25,480
what's the word finite you run out yeah that scares me too much fun fungible uh so so like

2287
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:30,920
when it comes to that I don't know the full length of the game I get scared and I get too

2288
03:01:30,920 --> 03:01:36,760
afraid to use healing things and that means I die a lot and then it's too hard I because I feel

2289
03:01:36,760 --> 03:01:40,680
like I need to save those healing things because the game might what if I get to write the end of

2290
03:01:40,680 --> 03:01:47,800
the game and then I can't win because I didn't have any like healing things like uh like stacked up

2291
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:54,600
and so that's why I don't play games you definitely you definitely shouldn't use those items that the

2292
03:01:54,600 --> 03:02:02,680
developers put in the game to like let you beat it you should definitely avoid those at all costs

2293
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:07,480
it's like it's a holdover for me and the time that you shouldn't use them the most is when you

2294
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:12,200
need them like that's when you that's when you know like no this is a trap this is a trap they've

2295
03:02:12,200 --> 03:02:19,000
laid for me it's just a holdover from like when I was younger and I didn't know like the extent

2296
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:24,760
to which games could exist I thought like the possibilities were so far reaching and like

2297
03:02:24,760 --> 03:02:30,440
anything could happen that I need to be super prepared for every eventuality because one time

2298
03:02:30,440 --> 03:02:37,080
I got a game over and I didn't like it like you obviously you want your heroes and your JRPG like

2299
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:41,720
after they beat the final boss you want them to like end the game with lots of stuff in their

2300
03:02:41,720 --> 03:02:47,000
inventory lots of like grenades and like vaccines and stuff like you know they're gonna need to like

2301
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:51,720
sell that later you know to get their life started afterwards to get their retirement fund

2302
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:57,160
exactly exactly yeah I could throw this grenade and deal some extra damage but like you know that's

2303
03:02:57,160 --> 03:03:02,840
gonna be like the starter capital to like you know start my bakery after I settle down start a family

2304
03:03:02,840 --> 03:03:11,080
later camp why would I like oh this this rocket launcher only has three shots if I use one that's

2305
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:16,680
a third of my ammunition gun who knows if I'll get another ammunition box further in I better

2306
03:03:16,680 --> 03:03:24,040
use my pistol instead save save on the rockets and then fight this boss for 200 hours that's right

2307
03:03:24,680 --> 03:03:32,360
that's that's thinking now you're thinking uh what was the question what was the topic

2308
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:43,320
it was your favorite metal gear oh um I don't know I I haven't played much of them um I have like

2309
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:53,080
the HD collection that includes two three and uh snake eater I think and I also have

2310
03:03:53,080 --> 03:04:00,040
metal gear four I think three is snake eater three yeah three snake eater yeah no wait no yeah three

2311
03:04:00,040 --> 03:04:07,160
there's another one there's like a PSP one that's on in the collection oh um uh peace walker

2312
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:14,920
peace walker yeah um one of those uh those are all possible my brothers play those

2313
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:22,600
um they've beaten I think they've beaten like all of them actually I've sort of watched some

2314
03:04:22,600 --> 03:04:29,000
some bits of like metal gear solid four I was like oh that's the one where the they have the thing in it

2315
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:35,560
that's the way I'm worried is our old man I don't know much about them I should play them

2316
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:42,680
because I have them why not uh I just I just have the sense in my head that like metal gear is

2317
03:04:42,680 --> 03:04:47,720
like the hardest game ever made and you have to be a genius to be able to beat such a video game

2318
03:04:48,920 --> 03:04:53,880
why why would you why would you because when I was because I was when I was younger I had

2319
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:57,960
trouble with metal gear solid one I was like okay well I guess I'll never beat this one

2320
03:04:58,760 --> 03:05:03,400
and that just that opinion carried through to everything else well I can't play metal gear

2321
03:05:03,400 --> 03:05:07,960
solid two uh before beating metal gear solid one and metal gear solid one's impossible so

2322
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:14,040
they're probably all impossible I'm I'm a little baby child and metal gear solid is a video game for

2323
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:22,920
grown-up big boys and I'm and I'm not a grown-up big boy yeah I mean I look at something like crash

2324
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:26,680
bandicoot and I'm like well that's I'm supposed to be able to play that that's a kid's game it's

2325
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:31,880
called goofy it's stupid yeah yeah yeah to play metal gear solid it's like it's like technical

2326
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:35,720
you gotta like you gotta know how to like use a rocket launcher and like you gotta be able to

2327
03:05:35,720 --> 03:05:39,560
use your camera to look at things and be smart and I'm like yeah I don't want to do that I want to

2380
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:13,000
next voicemail is mage of light three two one go the thing about vosh is that he kept saying that

2381
03:12:14,040 --> 03:12:19,560
he's okay with people criticizing the misogyny but whenever someone criticizes the misogyny he keeps

2382
03:12:20,200 --> 03:12:26,040
saying that this is sitting ground to jk rallying yeah like well are you okay with being criticized

2383
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:35,320
also like I know this is like it bullshit but if a lot of people have told you that what you did

2384
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:42,280
was wrong and that they don't feel right about it maybe you should just like hear them instead of

2385
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:47,720
being antagonistic towards them like what happened with contra was so fucking stupid and it's

2386
03:12:47,720 --> 03:12:55,800
literally like how about just saying hey sorry that's it that was all the thing but he is such

2387
03:12:56,040 --> 03:13:03,560
a baby yeah like fucking apologize dude that's it yeah I really think there's no I really think

2388
03:13:03,560 --> 03:13:11,640
there's no basis for him to just double down like the thing to do is be like like it's like it's

2389
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:17,160
bad that it's bad that I said that and that like jk used it to like make me look bad and make all

2390
03:13:17,160 --> 03:13:23,400
of us look bad and it was embarrassing you like it's not it's not the wrong thing to do is be like

2391
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:32,200
no it was good actually uh yeah I mean I watched his video explaining it and he doesn't he he he

2392
03:13:32,200 --> 03:13:42,120
doubled down he doesn't agree that like um it's good for jk rolling but he does agree that it was

2393
03:13:42,120 --> 03:13:49,400
misogynistic okay so I'm like okay well whatever so that's bad right yeah like we're all agreed that

2394
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:57,880
that's bad then like yeah the that part of it okay um he thinks he still has an argument I guess it's

2395
03:13:57,880 --> 03:14:03,640
like there's an argument there I can't remember exactly what he said um hey it's just such a who

2396
03:14:03,640 --> 03:14:10,120
cares like drama fest at the moment I don't like it well it's like man getting all heated about it

2397
03:14:10,120 --> 03:14:17,880
all all I can say is like man I got I got some uh just just for like mention for mentioning it on

2398
03:14:17,880 --> 03:14:24,600
Twitter I got some I got some bros I got some bros showing up in my dm or not in my replies

2399
03:14:25,880 --> 03:14:33,000
and oh my god they're so annoying like yeah like like angry vosh people are like

2400
03:14:34,200 --> 03:14:38,520
they're not they're not quite as bad as smaller people but they're they're on the same level

2401
03:14:38,520 --> 03:14:45,560
because they'll show up they'll show up and like you can just I can just smell it I can just smell

2402
03:14:45,560 --> 03:14:49,320
it through them they think they're gonna show up and they're gonna own me with fax and logic that's

2403
03:14:49,320 --> 03:14:53,480
really what they're here to do they show up and they start asking questions they show up and they

2404
03:14:53,480 --> 03:14:58,360
just and they start asking questions that are obviously meant for me to answer them in a way

2405
03:14:58,360 --> 03:15:03,000
that will like lay a trap that they can catch me in like I that's obviously what they think they're

2406
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:15,560
gonna do to me uh and it's just it's just infuriating I hate them um and uh yeah uh so next one is okay

2407
03:15:15,560 --> 03:15:26,920
we got another one from mage of light three two one go also before I forget I mean it's kind of

2408
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:35,240
ironic that man is so angry at vosh because he constantly is doing the ironic misogyny thing or

2409
03:15:35,800 --> 03:15:41,880
maybe not ironic who knows I don't think that's true man you're you're so fucking hypocritical

2410
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:47,640
when when was the last time I did that you just name name name an instance that I did that

2411
03:15:49,080 --> 03:15:55,080
I don't know what they're saying you're doing ironic misogyny I don't know even if I did I mean

2412
03:15:55,080 --> 03:16:01,560
the difference would be well I didn't I didn't get JK Rowling retweeting me saying something like that

2413
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:08,120
and saying like this is this is what men do to me all the time and like I'll never back down from

2414
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:16,200
this sort of bullying right the point is JK Rowling didn't like make it a make it a you know a a a

2415
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:20,680
point in the culture war that's that's the difference even if you're right which I'm not sure if you're

2416
03:16:20,680 --> 03:16:34,200
right about that anyway next one is called you know fuck you fuck you it's not hypocritical

2417
03:16:34,200 --> 03:16:44,200
it's not hypocritical because it's it's a different situation like a like a like you can you can be

2418
03:16:44,200 --> 03:16:51,080
upset that the the the state of affairs is that JK Rowling uh screenshoted something

2419
03:16:52,200 --> 03:16:58,600
um the not necessarily like like vosh didn't know that would happen it's I don't think it's

2420
03:16:58,600 --> 03:17:02,920
probably a bad thing because he's such a public figure to have done in the first place but then

2421
03:17:02,920 --> 03:17:11,720
it's like I don't think vosh is a bad person for being like ha ha women bad like as a joke

2422
03:17:11,800 --> 03:17:16,680
like I don't think that makes him a bad person what I do think kind of is is pushing him into

2423
03:17:16,680 --> 03:17:21,640
like oh he's sort of just like a bad guy now territory is that when people say

2424
03:17:22,840 --> 03:17:29,400
well you know that you know it's bad that misogyny is bad he he doubles down and goes no

2425
03:17:29,960 --> 03:17:35,960
it's it's good and here's why no that's what that's what I saw his video that's like uh uh

2426
03:17:36,600 --> 03:17:41,320
you know like like the moral necessity of being misogynistic to JK Rowling or whatever

2427
03:17:42,280 --> 03:17:45,960
like I didn't watch the video no of course I didn't watch the videos I just saw what

2428
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:50,360
there I just saw what they're called and I saw what he's saying on twitter right I mean that's

2429
03:17:50,360 --> 03:18:00,680
entirely the problem is that his is uh he milked he decided to milk the the discourse with a really

2430
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:06,280
inflammatory thumbnail and title of course like the content of the video is obviously a lot less

2431
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:11,880
well not obviously apparently but like it was a lot less actually inflammatory he acknowledges

2432
03:18:11,880 --> 03:18:17,320
the misogyny you know it's yeah and it's just like there's more nuance but like nobody who's angry at

2433
03:18:17,320 --> 03:18:23,880
vosh would like go to the efforts to like listen to what he's has to say and I don't think I should

2434
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:29,480
have and it's like I'm not gonna I'm not gonna listen to his three hour stream because then it's

2435
03:18:29,480 --> 03:18:34,680
a 20 minute clip but if I don't want to listen even that's too much uh I don't want I'm not

2436
03:18:34,680 --> 03:18:40,200
gonna turn into one of these vosh people they're terrible uh the message the message that it's

2437
03:18:40,200 --> 03:18:47,960
putting out okay it's it's it's a little bit bullshit it's a little bit bullshit for for you to

2438
03:18:47,960 --> 03:18:56,120
like okay you title you title your video something that clearly implies one thing and then in the

2439
03:18:56,120 --> 03:19:02,040
video maybe you you put in there a little secret thing you put in there like oh well actually

2440
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:08,440
I don't know I don't actually think what it's not it's not it's not my fault it's not my fault

2441
03:19:08,440 --> 03:19:13,240
that the message I take from that is that you think the thing you titled your video because

2442
03:19:13,240 --> 03:19:18,920
you were deliberately deceptive about it uh so yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that when he has

2443
03:19:18,920 --> 03:19:24,520
20 minutes to like talk about it I'm sure it comes across as much more nuanced than the title of the

2444
03:19:24,520 --> 03:19:31,640
video but I don't feel like uh I've made an error or anything by taking away from that the message

2445
03:19:31,640 --> 03:19:39,160
that is like he's doubling down on misogyny it's yeah it's it's it's a fair like assessment I guess

2446
03:19:39,880 --> 03:19:46,440
all right it's just um and I absolutely will not seed ground and I absolutely will not seed

2447
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:51,560
ground and given to the bullying of the vosh freaks who just want to be like did you watch the stream

2448
03:19:51,560 --> 03:19:56,280
did you watch the stream here I'll link you a video watch this video yeah I won't like it's

2449
03:19:57,240 --> 03:20:05,160
I think it's what was annoying me about it most is like you know people are misunderstanding things

2450
03:20:05,160 --> 03:20:13,400
from both sides and like information is getting like not fully understood and people are like

2451
03:20:13,400 --> 03:20:18,600
living their lives and this is just sort of a blip and it's like you know twitter like

2452
03:20:19,480 --> 03:20:25,880
what is your opinion on this thing and like nobody is should be expected to go on an expedition

2453
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:32,920
before they can give their opinion yeah um but I wish they either did that or just didn't give

2454
03:20:32,920 --> 03:20:38,840
the opinion if they don't know what is happening exactly I feel like it's it's too normal it's

2455
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:47,640
too normal to be expected to say your piece on something before you understand it and that's

2456
03:20:47,640 --> 03:20:58,760
why a lot of shit happens and it's completely unimportant yeah well uh I guess I understand

2457
03:20:58,760 --> 03:21:05,640
what you're saying but uh I don't know I just really I just really don't like I just really

2458
03:21:05,640 --> 03:21:11,640
don't like the messaging that's coming out from like the vosh camp I really don't like I really

2459
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:20,680
don't like it at all it's it's stupid yeah um anyway fuck you mage of light I'm not a hypocrite

2460
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:29,240
uh I won't uh just let you uh say that shit to me it's not true uh next one is uh insubstantial

2461
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:36,520
update to Texas anti trans oh great I can't wait to have this I can't wait to receive an

2462
03:21:36,520 --> 03:21:43,640
insubstantial update on the situation uh three two one go so earlier in the week I left a voicemail

2463
03:21:43,640 --> 03:21:48,360
about uh the anti trans stuff going on in Texas and the update is we don't really know what's

2464
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:52,520
going on they're still appealing stuff that's that's what I said Texas DFS was asked if they're

2465
03:21:52,520 --> 03:21:57,960
still doing the investigations into families of trans kids and they gave like a non-answer so

2466
03:21:57,960 --> 03:22:03,640
who knows in funnier news ken paxton tweeted an obvious cancel bait tweet about how Rachel

2467
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:09,400
Levine is a man and then uh the twitter made an exception to not delete his tweet but just flag

2468
03:22:09,400 --> 03:22:14,840
it as offensive because he's a public official but they he still went on and made another tweet

2469
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:20,520
decrying big tech censorship about it anyway and is tweeting more like obvious cancel bait and it's

2470
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:25,880
really hilariously transparent what he's doing is Rachel Levine that swimmer who I've been seeing

2471
03:22:25,880 --> 03:22:33,640
on twitter lately for the one who won a thing I don't know there's like a very tall trans woman

2472
03:22:33,640 --> 03:22:41,640
swimmer who like Charlie Kirk or someone was like tweeting about you know oh drag out the

2473
03:22:41,640 --> 03:22:50,040
trans women in women's sports thing the only time we care the only time we care about women's sports

2474
03:22:50,040 --> 03:22:56,440
is when we can use it as a wedge issue yeah against the people we don't like okay uh

2475
03:22:58,360 --> 03:23:04,120
so yeah I guess we don't know whether they're doing as I thought the bad stuff as I thought

2476
03:23:05,160 --> 03:23:12,280
well I hope they don't do the bad stuff I hope uh I was I was I remember seeing that like there was

2477
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:17,720
a judge you know ruling an unconstitutional and I remember I remember being relieved like okay

2478
03:23:17,720 --> 03:23:23,880
I'm glad this isn't just just going unchallenged I heard Joe Biden say something about it as well

2479
03:23:23,880 --> 03:23:29,720
I feel like oh yeah Biden was pro Biden's auntie but the Biden administration is like this is bad

2480
03:23:29,720 --> 03:23:34,760
so that's pretty yeah but like are you gonna do anything about it Joe you know that's fair

2481
03:23:34,760 --> 03:23:39,000
what are you gonna do huh where are your thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers from the from

2482
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:47,400
the Biden administration uh they said um they released a press oh it was like um

2483
03:23:49,640 --> 03:23:55,080
the like the national sorry I don't remember exactly what agency but some national agency

2484
03:23:55,080 --> 03:24:02,040
released a press uh release that was like you know our you know the the national agency you know

2485
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:08,440
offers like uh you know support you know you know in spite of like you know the like state uh

2486
03:24:08,440 --> 03:24:12,840
like if if any family feels they've been discriminated against on the basis of like

2487
03:24:12,840 --> 03:24:21,320
you know race sex a sexual orientation gender identity you know our agency you know we can

2488
03:24:21,320 --> 03:24:27,480
you file a complaint with us and we will you know help with that or something so it's good

2489
03:24:27,480 --> 03:24:39,000
it's good this is cool I guess uh anyway it's a developing situation um next one is called

2490
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:43,720
tournament arcs three two one go

2491
03:24:46,120 --> 03:24:53,560
in episode 300 you talked about how lazy tournament arcs are and I can't agree more I can't believe

2492
03:24:53,560 --> 03:25:00,040
that Ben zane fruit one into the champion you're wrong you're wrong there's not an there's not a

2493
03:25:00,040 --> 03:25:05,640
tournament arc in the champion that just takes merely a tournament there is merely a tournament

2494
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:10,920
but like story is not really about that uh story is not really anything because it's just like the

2495
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:17,240
intro chapter like a tournament arc is a very specific sort of you have all of these characters

2496
03:25:17,240 --> 03:25:24,520
in a a story that involves a lot of special types of magic fighting powers and stuff you

2497
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:33,160
put them up against people and to see who wins and it's just a long uh series of fights but like

2498
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:41,960
the context for the fights is like a competition whereas usually it's like we're trying to do

2499
03:25:42,040 --> 03:25:48,840
something and save the world or stop someone bad I that's why it would be lazy is because it's like

2500
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:53,800
what if we just got rid of the story from this battle manga and just had battles instead

2501
03:25:55,240 --> 03:26:00,840
yeah but that's not I mean you know I mean a good it's not it's not a bad good tournament arc

2502
03:26:00,840 --> 03:26:07,240
you know has a story going on it's yeah sure sure but like like the laziest way to do it is for

2503
03:26:08,200 --> 03:26:14,200
whatever story is going on to be put on hold while we punch each other for a bit right it's been

2504
03:26:14,200 --> 03:26:25,000
done badly before yeah uh um I'll get man I'll get I'll get back to the champion when I know

2505
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:31,720
what it is that I want to say with it and also when I get over the feeling that in my gut

2506
03:26:32,520 --> 03:26:40,200
that I am too ashamed and embarrassed of myself to say anything ever uh one day

2507
03:26:42,200 --> 03:26:47,640
what do you mean like like the the the moral of the champion yeah you don't want to actually come

2508
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:52,680
out and say anything about it it's not that it's that I it's that I don't it's that I don't really

2509
03:26:52,680 --> 03:27:00,760
know what the uh the real champion was the friends we made along the way I feel I feel like I could

2510
03:27:00,760 --> 03:27:07,000
ending I feel like I could say something I could I could have a message in there there's a kind

2511
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:11,560
there's a couple different ones I could have and like I just I would just have to settle on like

2512
03:27:11,560 --> 03:27:16,600
here's what I want the message to be and here's exactly how I'm going to go about saying it and

2513
03:27:16,600 --> 03:27:21,720
I don't know exactly what that is yet uh so it's going to be it's going to be an allegory it's going

2514
03:27:21,720 --> 03:27:26,840
to be capitalism is bad for capitalism it's going to be an allegory for youtubeing and and

2515
03:27:26,840 --> 03:27:32,200
and and uh Sophia is a youtuber she's burnt out that's what she doesn't like making her youtube

2516
03:27:32,200 --> 03:27:39,960
videos that get slay queen and everyone loves them it's about being an only fans uh sex worker and

2517
03:27:39,960 --> 03:27:47,720
how uh it's it's a real job actually it's real work it's an allegory and then all the people

2518
03:27:47,720 --> 03:27:54,440
say I want to be just like you and it's like yeah it sucks exactly everybody everybody wants to be

2519
03:27:54,440 --> 03:28:03,800
an only fans girl or guy uh anyway okay we're almost done by the way you've got like two more

2520
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:13,560
okay I think yeah yeah the next one is an image oh the procrastinators podcast is a show where a

2521
03:28:13,560 --> 03:28:17,880
bunch of content creators pick a topic and talk about it so no one cares anymore and we take

2522
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:26,680
viewer questions on twitter where is this yeah what is this from is this like on the youtube page

2523
03:28:26,680 --> 03:28:31,480
I don't know what the lines are no the the youtube channel description just says like under construction

2524
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:40,840
is this from the website is it um let's check I'm just thinking like what what has these like

2525
03:28:41,240 --> 03:28:48,040
like very faint gray lines behind on the white background uh backdrop I don't know

2526
03:28:51,160 --> 03:28:55,800
what is our is our podcast the is our website the pro crap yeah the procrastinators podcast

2527
03:28:55,800 --> 03:29:05,480
dot com uh is there an about section it's a true mystery I don't know this is inside the animus

2528
03:29:05,560 --> 03:29:12,680
an assassins creed yeah I have no idea where where this I have no idea where this copy comes from

2529
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:21,640
um all right whatever it'll be it'll be a mystery forever um okay and then fittingly our last

2530
03:29:21,640 --> 03:29:32,440
voicemail of the day is called wait yeah it's called a one last message three two one go

2531
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:40,600
hello comrades nicole here calling my god vulgar heaven he yeah he's giving me a chance to send

comrades it was good knowing you see you nicole uh why you gotta give him a why you gotta give him

2535
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:07,560
a heartfelt send off like that oh gee I'll miss him I didn't know I didn't know how much I'd miss him

2536
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:19,560
till he was gone nicole even just in the in the duration of this this uh episode yeah I've gone

2537
03:30:19,640 --> 03:30:31,880
from ambivalence he's gone tragedy he had a family did he yeah his brother his brother

2538
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:39,480
let us know he was dead oh right yes uh all right well that's a lot I didn't see this

2539
03:30:39,480 --> 03:30:46,760
his brother it was his brother that's the end of the voicemails which is probably just about the

2540
03:30:46,760 --> 03:30:57,320
end of the podcast yeah uh go check out the pumpkin alley the new hot-fixed version see if you can

2541
03:30:57,320 --> 03:31:03,640
find all the lizards including the new one will that be out by the time this is out um it yeah

2542
03:31:03,640 --> 03:31:11,000
okay pretty pretty pretty sure it will be um the only thing we're waiting on is like feedback to see

2543
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:15,880
whether something works on a mac version and if it does then we just set it live because it's already

2544
03:31:15,880 --> 03:31:23,800
uploaded hey what did you make a pumpkin alien what did what did you make pumpkin alien uh unity

2545
03:31:23,800 --> 03:31:33,560
in unity okay uh you know I was talking to crack and like I I want to get phantom's revenge going on

2546
03:31:33,560 --> 03:31:39,480
I wanted to run an html so I can put it on new grounds and I probably want to like maybe convert

2547
03:31:39,560 --> 03:31:46,520
to a bunch of platforms and I just I was thinking maybe I could maybe pay someone like on five or

2548
03:31:46,520 --> 03:31:51,800
something to do that because I don't want to do it um and I and crack said he would look at it and he

2549
03:31:51,800 --> 03:31:58,040
might be able to just do it and he told me that like oh actually he can't because um he uses linux

2550
03:31:58,760 --> 03:32:04,600
and like game maker studio just doesn't run on linux like even in in wine like it just doesn't

2551
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:11,160
run you can you can make a game project for linux but you can't run the program that there's no

2552
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:19,480
version of the program that runs on linux which seems insane uh linux is so odd it feels like it

2553
03:32:19,480 --> 03:32:27,720
only has drawbacks I mean I don't really uh the people that like it really like it but I don't know

2554
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:34,360
why exactly from what I from what I gather is like it's a version of windows or whatever

2555
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:44,680
that has stripped away unnecessary background um processes uh that like slow down the machine

2556
03:32:44,680 --> 03:32:53,160
and that don't literally need to be there um and so you as a user can customize the experience of

2557
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:57,960
your computing experience you know your computing experience is perfectly customizable

2558
03:32:57,960 --> 03:33:03,480
and there's no like a windows update is forcing you to do something and it won't let you not do it

2559
03:33:03,480 --> 03:33:09,400
like well linux does not have that and that's like I think is the appeal is the total control over

2560
03:33:09,400 --> 03:33:17,800
your computing uh time yeah but I'm like it's like it's like the opposite direction to apple where

2561
03:33:17,800 --> 03:33:24,200
there's so much less control than you have over windows where you can you can see all the program

2562
03:33:24,200 --> 03:33:29,160
files and stuff and yeah in a mac that's possible but it's like it's harder like it there's just

2563
03:33:29,880 --> 03:33:37,400
super easy like consumer friendly apple product windows for like everyone this just is useful

2564
03:33:37,400 --> 03:33:45,240
and then linux for the nerds is what I understand indeed yeah it's for computer it's for people that

2565
03:33:45,240 --> 03:33:51,640
like know the enthusiasts and look that with a computer which I don't really know on that level

2566
03:33:51,640 --> 03:34:00,120
what I'm doing yeah uh so anyway uh I do I do really want to get it running on html and uh

2567
03:34:00,120 --> 03:34:07,960
and put it on new grounds at some point uh I just uh I just want to do it just want to do it it might

2568
03:34:07,960 --> 03:34:14,680
be mm-hmm I had I had started converting I had started converting it but it was

2569
03:34:14,680 --> 03:34:19,000
turning out to be a little bit of work and I gave up I'm like I just can I just pay someone

2570
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:28,280
like 50 bucks to do this for me uh yeah I wonder if you could put 3d games on uh new grounds uh

2571
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:35,160
I mean and I don't see why not like in theory it would have to be uh it would browse a version

2572
03:34:35,160 --> 03:34:41,320
rather than just a game file that you can run and executable it'd have to literally work in

2573
03:34:41,320 --> 03:34:48,200
browser so probably not I mean I I made um like the champion game runs in browser that one runs

2574
03:34:48,200 --> 03:34:53,720
html it's not a downloadable executable downloadable yeah but it's like a two-dimensional game and it's

2575
03:34:53,720 --> 03:35:01,080
not like a million things going yeah yeah but like there's nothing um there's nothing about

2576
03:35:01,960 --> 03:35:11,080
it's like you know 2d-ness I don't I don't see why a 3d game wouldn't work in html um well I know

2577
03:35:11,080 --> 03:35:16,120
3d games that do work in html I just I guess I just don't know enough I feel like the pumpkin alley

2578
03:35:16,120 --> 03:35:23,800
demo has a little too much to process for like the browser to handle it hmm I don't know how it

2579
03:35:23,800 --> 03:35:28,040
works though I maybe it just defaults to the computer handling it instead of the browser but

2580
03:35:28,040 --> 03:35:36,520
then how's it be on the browser wow I don't run away from snakes did work in browser but it took

2581
03:35:36,520 --> 03:35:48,600
a really long time to load and that's a much smaller game right yeah um I got no idea but uh

2582
03:35:52,920 --> 03:35:56,040
but I just really want I just really want fandoms revenge on newgrounds I want on every

2583
03:35:56,040 --> 03:36:01,560
platform I think I'm definitely gonna try and put it on steam at some point just because

2584
03:36:02,600 --> 03:36:09,800
I might I might change the music I might have to change the music because I stole the music from

2585
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:17,400
front mission gun hazard you know how it goes what are you gonna do they're gonna make music for it

2586
03:36:18,440 --> 03:36:24,280
I I was talking to Nate about it the other day actually when we were talking about finance stuff

2587
03:36:25,240 --> 03:36:31,000
he seemed to think that the thing to do was just to commission like sound to like music which

2588
03:36:32,600 --> 03:36:39,400
yeah I could do that it seems like so unnecessary but like I guess if it makes the difference and it

2589
03:36:39,400 --> 03:36:46,040
makes it's so like it's so like bankrupt it's like creatively bankrupt like hey hey musician could you

2590
03:36:46,040 --> 03:36:51,560
like make me a song that like basically sounds exactly like this other song like it's it's different

2591
03:36:51,560 --> 03:36:59,080
but like just make it sound like this other song okay okay bye uh like how like how sad you know

2592
03:37:00,200 --> 03:37:07,960
um but that's all like like I but I you know like uh the game is it has like events in it that are

2593
03:37:07,960 --> 03:37:13,960
very specifically timed to like the timing of the music like I really I sort of made the scene

2594
03:37:13,960 --> 03:37:20,360
sort of around the music that is in them sometimes so there's really no way around it if I if I wanted

2595
03:37:20,360 --> 03:37:25,960
new music in there so I don't know I guess so yeah I could do that or I could just upload it with

2596
03:37:25,960 --> 03:37:30,760
the music intact and like just be like Square Enix will never notice because it's like from an old

2597
03:37:30,760 --> 03:37:37,480
game that nobody cares about and like that's true I don't know I don't know what I'll do about that

2598
03:37:38,200 --> 03:37:44,200
