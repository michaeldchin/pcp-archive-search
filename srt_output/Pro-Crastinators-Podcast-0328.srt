1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's another week. We had a bi-week two weeks ago.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A channel got in trouble for, well...

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A salacious link.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, YouTube considered the link to Vinny's drawings, adult content nudity, breaking terms of service.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So we got a temporary, one week temporary strike or ban or hold or whatever on uploading, not on uploading but on publishing videos.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, so...

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So that was stupid.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Uh, we're back.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Not Vinny's fault.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Uh, just like YouTube being, and then I appealed and then they just have still not, I appealed immediately and they still have not answered my appeal.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But we're back to having the ability to post, right?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, all our privileges should be restored now.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But we still have a warning on the channel from two years ago because I or someone else put the link to the Shadbase in the description.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Lol.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, I should appeal that again.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And that one's not for nudity. That one's not for nudity or adult content. That one's for external link slash advertising.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought that wasn't a problem.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because it's Shadbase that it was like they caught, oh, this is one of those websites that are bad.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't, I don't know.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Truly, I don't know. You would think that would expire, especially since I removed the link and appealed.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uh, well, you gotta appeal more. You gotta be more appealing.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, I, damn, damn if that ain't the truth.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Uh, remember how I said that?

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Did I talk about how when I filmed that video, which is almost edited by the way, I have, I had 14 hours of footage and I have edited almost 13 hours of it.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So it is truly, it is truly getting down.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Might be out this week, honestly. I don't know, unless something unforeseen happens.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I went and I bought a light. Did I talk about buying a shop light to light the seat, the shot?

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You did, yeah.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, I wanted to combine it with the sunlight.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes. And it more or less worked. I use that light as my like room light now, but it's too bright on its own.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I used, um, I think I probably described how like I constructed a like cardboard and aluminum foil like light funnel for it to try and concentrate the light in one direction.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, well, I did. And now I use it and I put that like light funnel on it and I pointed it at the ceiling and you know, the white ceiling diffuses the light throughout the room.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So now I use it as my room light and it's great. I mean, I have all light in my, I have a ceiling light, but it's not very bright.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So, you know.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hmm.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So it all comes together.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was about to say, like, we'll be careful about if it's a more powerful light, you're using more electricity, but you don't have the current issue that we have over here with gas prices and electricity bills going apeshit.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Because of the Ukraine war.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, I mean, I mean, how, how much electricity can it be? I mean, it's a bright, it's a bright light, but like, you know, it just sufficiently lights my room.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know. It's one of those things that like, you look at the voltages and the amperages and the wattages and I'm like, this just, it's just electric. I don't get it.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But I feel like there's like,

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Amperage, I hardly know her.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You could, you could probably min max.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wait, wait, sorry. I fucked it up. Amperage. I hardly know her age. There we go. Got it.

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Amperage.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Cross the bridge. That's all I've got.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sounds like a city in, in England. Amperage.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Or New England.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Or New England. Yeah. You know what? You know what?

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Saw a great tweet. This must have been two weeks ago now. It was a, in, in Massachusetts, they call, they call the booster shot.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The booster, the booster shot, but it was spelled like, like Worcester, W-O-R-C-E-S-T.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So the boar sister.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The boar sister, the boar sister shot.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
B-O-R-C-E-S-T.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
E-R.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
E-R.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's boar, boar sister.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Boar sister.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Um, anyway, I'm using that light and it looks, it looks pretty bizarre.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It looks pretty bizarre with the light funnel on it because it's like four pieces of cardboard and aluminum foil taped together.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Uh, but like, it's, they're taped together imperfectly, so the light kind of seeps out at the corners, so, I don't know.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's pretty, it's pretty bizarre looking.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it works.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Lights in my room doesn't get too hot. What more can you ask for?

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Uh, I don't know. Nothing.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Nothing. Nothing. That's right. Nothing. Not a damn thing.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You may never ask for anything ever again.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Not even one subscriber.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, please. In fact, I want less subscribers.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hey, Ben.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The video's almost edited. It's almost edited, Gib.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
13 hours out of 14.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's great.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I know. Maybe this, it should be out this week.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You never know. You never know what's going to happen, but this week seems reasonable.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, what were you saying?

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ben, did you know that the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II is dead?

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I choose to believe that it's not true.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't stand a world without her.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to call it fake news. Yeah, and I, they can't prove it.

87
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They got her coffin. They got her corpse on display right now.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's what they said about Elvis. They said Elvis was dead.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They said the moon landing happened, you know?

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They said Elvis died on the moon, taking a shit by taking his space astronaut suit off,

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and you say, no, you can't do that. And they shit.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's exactly what they said.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It exploded on the moon.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And it turned out to be false. So what did we learn?

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't trust the mainstream media. Don't trust anyone.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's right.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's right.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's actually tomorrow that the funeral, like they're going to put her in the ground on live on TV.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can't miss it.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, good for her.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She loves the ground.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's the day that they're going to get that like food banks are closed and like all like funerals are canceled and food banks.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, people are not allowed to have their own canals.

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Cancer wards are forced.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In forced honor of the Queen, you cannot do anything on Monday.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And if you do, you will be slapped.

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You will be shunned.

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You'll be grabbed out of the crowd by monarchist simps.

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, we wrestle to the ground and then police will be called and they will charge you for something for saying, you know, fuck you.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You know what that is?

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's idolatry.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're allowed to work on Sunday on the Sabbath.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The day that God that you're supposed to take off to honor God, but you can't work on Monday to honor the Queen.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's the false idol idolatry right there.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm probably going to watch a bit of the-

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We should sing more hymns on this show.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't even know hymns.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I know-

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't know-

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
All things wide and wonderful.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All creatures great and small.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All things-

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's not a hymn.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's just a song.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's the hymn they sang in church.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not a-

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Open your hymn book.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's not a hymn unless it sounds bad.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They all sound bad.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Not a hymn unless it's not catchy.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's got the whole world in his hands, got the whole wide world.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That one's definitely not a hymn.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's a damn pop-

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's a damn pop-

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That one's probably newer than Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
God, it's taken me back.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is the sort of thing-

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Because I went to primary school that had a church,

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and so it was just sort of a normal thing.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We had assembly every morning,

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and you would sing hymns.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And that was normal.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, zana, hey, zana, zana, zana, ho, zana-

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now there's-

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Zana, hey, zana, ho, zana-

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now there's a-

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now there's a good ol-

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A good ol-

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
A good ol-

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
praise song.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a good ol hymn.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What was the one with the-

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a fucking harvest festival one.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait, did you know that one I was just singing?

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I didn't recognize it.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's from Jesus Christ Superstar.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh.

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's the joke.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Harvest festival?

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There's one about a harvest festival.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm just like-

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sounds like some pagan shit to me.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, probably.

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sounds like some people that celebrate Halloween

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
who I won't associate with.

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The fucking-

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If I had a hammer song was in there.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think this is like crossing over with just sort of like-

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is that a Jesus song?

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It is, isn't it?

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think so.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If I had a hammer-

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh.

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, I'd hammer in the morning.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'd hammer in the evening.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All over this land.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All over this land.

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And then it goes to like-

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If Jesus had a gun,

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
he'd shoot everyone.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Wait a minute.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The hammer song.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I never sang that song in church,

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
but there's a Garfield strip where John is singing it.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I didn't recognize the tune and I was like,

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mom, what is the song John is singing?

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And she was like,

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, there's a church song.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'd hammer in the morning.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's like, I've never actually heard it sung.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I've just heard that song described.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She tried to describe the song.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I mean, some of the songs are kind of fun to sing along with.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, sure.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I mean, that's why they make songs,

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
so that they're more fun to sing than to just say.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Pop songs, they changed it.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They made it so you can't tell what they're saying,

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but it doesn't matter because it's so fucking cool.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because it's so fucking epic.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because you can bump and grind to it.

207
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because you can get out there

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and have premarital sex on the dance floor

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and do the sinful, secular pop music.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you forest it, you can bump and grind

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to if I had a hammer.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can bump and grind to all those hands.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know what?

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You know what?

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're absolutely right.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And I have been humiliated.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You've been thoroughly pooned this day.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
To be a fool.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Um, why are we talking about God?

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because, oh, because I love him so much, yes.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, yes.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And we should make more,

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we should talk more about his glory.

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's his with a capital H.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, okay.

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know what?

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Fuck God.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You know what God did?

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
God chose the queen and the queen sucks.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Fuck the queen.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He chose to kill the queen.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He chose to kill the queen

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and I can never forgive him for that.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He chose to give the queen the powers.

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He chose to take her away

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
at the young age of 97.

240
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And like, she had so much more,

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
she had so much more good left to do in this world.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's only 96, man.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Get it right.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sorry.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If I'm just wishful thinking,

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
just wishful thinking,

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
she could have made it just one more year.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
70 more years, 70 more years.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You know, I see people that are like,

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
fuck the queen.

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Honestly, I don't know enough about Elizabeth

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
to have a particularly strong opinion

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
about her one way or the other.

256
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Was she a good queen?

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Was she a bad queen?

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Was she just carrying on the legacy of colonialism?

259
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Did she do anything to improve it in her own small way?

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't know.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I haven't been queen posting

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because I don't have a position that I can defend.

263
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I mean, the position I have

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
is regardless of how nice she was

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and how good of a queen she was,

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
she didn't abolish the monarchy.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, the monarchy is bad.

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She kept the status quo of the monarchy

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
being in charge technically.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And any argument you say,

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
well, they don't have real power.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They have a huge amount of money.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They cost the country money at all.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, they do make like proclamations, right?

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They have some degree of policymaking.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, on the technical level,

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
laws only exist when the queen or king now

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
will look over them and say yes.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But they always say yes.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it's not real power.

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But it is technically the case

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
that they have the final say.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Theoretically, they could veto a law

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
that passed through parliament?

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, and I think the House of Lords as well.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If even the Lord say,

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the monarch gets to say no or yes.

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah.

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And people argue that the queen

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
always goes with whatever parliament goes with,

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
so she doesn't have real power.

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it's like in practice, sure.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But I don't think that is a good argument

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
for keeping her and the monarchy system around at all.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's a little bit like how theoretically,

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the electors in the American Electoral College

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
could not vote according to the way

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
that their state told them to.

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Theoretically, they could,

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and they have done it,

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but it's never swung an election.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You know what I'm talking about?

303
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think so.

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Anyway, I'm glad she's dead.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then watch this video get flagged

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
by the British government

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and take them down.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The monarchy is bad.

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
We can all agree on that.

312
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's just a weird, dumb thing to have

313
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in the year of our Lord, 2020.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Could she have abolished it?

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Could she have just said,

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
as queen, there's no more monarchy?

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We're private citizens now.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think if she by herself said,

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
no more monarchies, it wouldn't work.

320
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think she could abdicate.

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then next in line would become the king

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and everyone would just do that.

323
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And she would still be alive.

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't actually know by what means

325
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
she would try to abolish the monarchy

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
because it's like, I don't know.

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Even if you kill,

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
even if every single person

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
who is recognized as a royal family person

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
was killed in a catastrophic tornado

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and there's no one left,

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
they could go up the family tree

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and then go back down and find an heir.

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And so there will always be a monarch.

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't know how you would abolish it

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
without, I don't know,

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
how any other country do it?

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is where my history is lacking.

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It would be a pretty base move.

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, I don't know if she,

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
maybe she lacks any sort of formal power

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to decree that the monarchy is abolished.

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's probably not in any books anywhere.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It would be,

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sure the books all refer to

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the existence of a monarch

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
under the assumption that there will continue to be one.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But it would be a pretty base move

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
if she were to be like,

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
okay, I am stepping down as monarch

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
because I do have the authority to do that.

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I am personally

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
coming out with the,

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I personally proclaim that I think the monarchy

355
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
should be abolished.

356
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So I'm stepping down.

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm just going to continue to live over here

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
as the resigned queen.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
My successor can become king

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if he wants to,

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
but I don't acknowledge him

362
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
as a real monarch

363
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
because I don't believe in such things anymore.

364
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I mean, if that was the best

365
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
she could do formally,

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
then that would still be,

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that would be cool,

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and that would probably-

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That would be cool of her,

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and I wouldn't be celebrating her death right now.

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But the fact is,

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
she lived her whole life to uphold

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the systems that were in place

374
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
that led to her having

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
such wealth and opulence.

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's like, of course,

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
she wouldn't say,

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
let's tear this down.

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
She just likes it.

380
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She likes it.

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Right.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Nobody would ever say-

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
She's good for her.

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Nobody would ever say

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
that she likes being rich,

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but of course she did.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
She didn't do anything about it.

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right, yeah.

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What was that one post

390
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
on a Facebook post

391
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that's like the idiot queen

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and her idiot hat or something?

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, that's Christopher Eccleston.

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's the Doctor Who actor

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
who, with the resurgence of Doctor Who

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
in 2009 or something.

397
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's the first,

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that's the hymn

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
before David Tennant.

400
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He's cool.

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He hates the monarchy.

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Seems like there's a not

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
insignificant amount of British people

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that are just like,

405
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
hey, the monarchy's bad, actually.

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why do we still have this?

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
All the punks hate the monarchy.

409
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Would you say most people like that,

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
or would you say that's like,

411
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
would you say the average person

412
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
is like mildly pro-monarchy?

413
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I mean, as far as like,

414
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
tallies go like,

415
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
what do you call it when you ask people

416
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
what they think,

417
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
60% are like pro-monarchy.

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's funny.

419
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And it's probably,

420
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
it's not exactly a political thing,

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but I think it's obvious

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
that if you're a right-leaning person,

423
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you're pro-monarchy,

424
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
because that's like what you aspire to

425
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is having power and whatever.

426
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I feel like even like a middle

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
of the road liberal,

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
someone like CGP Grey is like,

429
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
hmm, yeah.

430
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I mean, CGP Grey has that whole video.

431
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The monarchy is actually good for the economy.

432
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, it's a sort of thing

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
where if you don't think about it,

435
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
it seems nice.

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's like, look at all that cool stuff.

437
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Isn't that cool?

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yeah, it's a culture.

439
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can be proud to be associated somehow

440
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to that culture.

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Right.

442
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, but it's one thing to have like,

443
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
oh, it's our culture,

444
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but like the culture of colonialism,

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
the culture of like having vast wealth

446
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and then the serfs who don't,

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that sucks.

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's a shitty culture.

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why would you be proud of such a thing?

450
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's like,

451
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
there's an artist called,

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
oh, shit.

453
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, they're called a red and black salamander.

454
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They're called like nine millimeter something.

455
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I follow them on Twitter.

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
They have a cartoon that's really good.

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like,

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
yeah, it's like a big rich capitalist

459
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and then a bunch of like farmers around him

460
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and it's like,

461
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
look at,

462
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
it's like, look at everything.

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The capitalist is like,

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
look at everything I've got

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and all the farmers are like,

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
hey, what, hey,

467
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
what the, he's got like piles of gold or whatever.

468
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then he's like,

469
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
hmm, and then he draws a circle around

470
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the land that they're standing on

471
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and then he,

472
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
like he's still got it,

473
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but he's like,

474
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
look at everything we've got

475
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and all the farmers are like,

476
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

477
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So, yeah, it's like that.

478
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I get you.

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Shit, what was I talking about?

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're just asking if the average person,

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, the average person.

482
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, I mean,

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
when like,

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know,

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think I,

486
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
there's a few people who,

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
if I asked them,

488
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
they'd probably be pro monarchy.

489
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

490
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like friends of parents and stuff

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that I've met before,

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the majority of people I know,

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
as like associates or friends,

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
they're either ambivalent

496
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
or would be like, yeah, fuck them.

497
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So I haven't really grown up

499
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
in a pro monarchy thing,

500
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
even though I think there was a part

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
of my teenage years where,

502
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
as a rebellious move,

503
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
because I'm such a rebel

504
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and such a contrarian rebel.

505
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Did you become pro monarchy

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for a while?

507
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I became pro monarchy for a little while

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
because, you know,

509
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I get you.

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I get you.

511
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And it's so like,

512
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
yeah, but like,

513
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
whatever, it's cool.

514
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It looked like cool stuff.

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Look at the castles

516
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and the cannons.

517
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Damn it.

518
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I had this, you know,

519
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I've probably talked about

520
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
how I kind of had the same thing

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
or like for a little bit

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in high school there,

523
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I was sort of like,

524
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I wouldn't,

525
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I would never call myself a conservative,

526
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
but I would like,

527
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I would dabble and like,

528
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
hmm, but what if,

529
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
but what if,

530
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
what if George W. Bush

531
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is actually like,

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
right to like not respond

533
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
to Hurricane Katrina?

534
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What if,

535
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
what if,

536
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
shit, what was the other one?

537
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What if

538
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the Iraq war was good actually?

539
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Like, what if,

540
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
what if same sex parents

541
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
shouldn't be able to adopt kids?

542
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know,

543
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
just being, just being,

544
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
because everyone around me was liberal,

545
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
because I was in Massachusetts.

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's like,

547
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
my stupid teachers think that like,

548
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
gay people should have rights.

549
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, I'll show them.

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll stick it to the man.

551
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Right.

552
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because in my,

553
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
in my limited,

554
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in my limited field of view,

555
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
all the authority figures were like,

556
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
hmm, good things are good actually.

557
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I was like, I'm going to,

558
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'll show you.

559
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll show you.

560
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You are going to give me homework

561
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and then you're going to have a political opinions.

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let me see that.

563
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let me, let me change that.

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We're going to do something about this.

565
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We're going to set,

566
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
set this record straight.

567
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I guess it's a good sign then that

568
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
like,

569
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
grew up in a pretty,

570
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
not a,

571
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
not left necessarily.

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Liberal,

573
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
like left leaning,

574
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I guess it's,

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
it's,

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
it's definitely got more left leaning over the years,

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
very recently.

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yeah.

579
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
My dad is like,

580
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
pro-socialism,

581
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
which is a strange thing.

582
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's pretty cool.

583
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's pretty cool.

584
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah.

585
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I mean, my dad is a,

586
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I think my dad is,

587
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
is a,

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
is a Bidenite.

589
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So,

590
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you know,

591
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that makes basically communist.

592
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah.

593
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He's basically revolutionary.

594
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah.

595
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Biden has been

596
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
so popular these days.

597
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Everybody loves dark Brandon.

598
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He's sky,

599
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
he's skyrocketing in the pool.

600
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm not even kidding.

601
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I wish I was kidding.

602
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I mean,

603
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
it's,

604
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
it is kind of funny.

605
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And it's,

606
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
it's so easy because like,

607
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the,

608
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the Republicans are like,

609
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
oh,

610
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
we've overturned Roe v. Wade.

611
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Everybody disliked that.

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like liberals,

613
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
even conservatives,

614
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
even some conservatives were like,

615
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
okay,

616
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that's weird,

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
because it's like the more fringe right-wing

618
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
opinions are getting like,

619
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the main attention.

620
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So it's like,

621
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
obviously,

622
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
you'd rather Biden over anything of that.

623
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Do you,

624
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
do you think that's why his,

625
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean,

626
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
it's that combined with a few things lately

627
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that Biden has said that have like,

628
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
cemented his opposition to that kind of right-wing

629
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
in the,

630
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
in the Republican Party.

631
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So I'm like, yeah.

632
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm not sure.

633
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I think,

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think there's,

635
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
why,

636
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
what do you think?

637
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm honestly not even sure

638
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that I can opine on like how the like,

639
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
normal,

640
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
like fucking Joe six pack mind

641
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
thinks about things like politics.

642
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean,

643
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
gas prices kind of went down a bit.

644
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So, I mean,

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I feel like that's big.

646
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
They're still up from where they were before,

647
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but they are not as bad.

648
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And like,

649
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
presidential approval ratings are like,

650
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
extremely tightly correlated with gas prices.

651
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah.

652
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I suppose there's this other things like,

653
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
yeah,

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Biden's siding against pressure.

655
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
In the,

656
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
in the whole Ukraine thing.

657
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's like,

658
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I mean,

659
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Russia's easy to hate.

660
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I mean,

661
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I think every,

662
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
yeah,

663
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
like every fucking western politician has,

664
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
is against Russia.

665
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Aren't they?

666
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah.

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

668
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So that's,

669
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
that's a slam dunk.

670
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There's,

671
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
there's no,

672
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
this is like,

673
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the bad guys are so evil right now.

674
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's like,

675
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
he doesn't need to do that much to seem,

676
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Biden for life,

677
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Biden for life.

678
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No,

679
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
no more elections.

680
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Biden for life when he was very long.

681
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No,

682
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
that's true.

683
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
He's almost the queen's age.

684
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Is he?

685
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
How old is he?

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
He's like,

687
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
in his 70s.

688
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He might,

689
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
he might be 80.

690
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
How old is

691
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Biden?

692
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He's definitely not as 90s.

693
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He's 70,

694
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
he's 79.

695
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
He's 79.

696
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

697
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
That's actually,

698
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I thought he was in his 80s.

699
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He's actually a little,

700
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
a little bit younger than I thought.

701
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Um,

702
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
no,

703
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that's right.

704
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's like,

705
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
isn't Trump like the same age?

706
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Like,

707
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
like Trump,

708
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Hillary and Biden are all like 75 plus.

709
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's just going to be a rotation of those three.

710
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Trump is 76.

711
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's her turn next.

712
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I mean,

713
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
if they live as long as the queen did.

714
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Sure.

715
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
They've got so many more terms left in them.

716
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There's spry.

717
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
No.

718
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Spring chickens.

719
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah.

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Um,

721
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
what,

722
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
what are you talking about?

723
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The only thing that's interesting,

724
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
the only thing that's,

725
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm finding a little interesting about the funeral

726
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that's coming up is that like,

727
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
an incredibly large gathering of world leaders,

728
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
politicians,

729
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
royals from other kingdoms

730
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
are coming to see the queen's funeral.

731
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They're all going to be in the same place.

732
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's going to be like a river.

733
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's going to be in one piece.

734
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And then Sabo is going to come in

735
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and he's going to kill someone.

736
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He's going to assassinate someone.

737
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You talking about like from one piece?

738
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Oh no, did I spoil it?

739
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I don't know.

740
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I mean, yeah,

741
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but like,

742
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll forget by the time I catch up.

743
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah.

744
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Hey, Alias are bleep that for any audience members

745
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
who are not caught up on one piece.

746
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Sabo will come in and he's going to bleep somebody.

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He's going to bleep somebody.

748
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Uh, let me see.

749
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Dude, one piece is so fucking epic.

750
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

751
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I've been reading the most recent chapters

752
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and you're going to love it.

753
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I should.

754
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I'm sure I will love it.

755
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I have no doubt that I will love it

756
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
when I finally get around to it.

757
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm asking Oblivionfall if he has any more

758
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
of those,

759
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
any more voicemails from that side voicemail channel

760
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that he made.

761
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
In other news,

762
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I guess I've got some Clarissa stuff down.

763
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I counted up.

764
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Hell yeah.

765
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I counted up.

766
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I saw you tweeting.

767
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I saw you tweeting about that.

768
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Or you made it.

769
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I mean, I forgot the number,

770
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
but I think,

771
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
what was it?

772
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let me,

773
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
let me check my Twitter.

774
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Find out the knowledge.

775
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Indeed.

776
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Why do I tweet anything other than one thing?

777
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay.

778
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
One must always find the knowledge.

779
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So currently 54 pages are sketched.

780
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I've made 50 pages already.

781
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Those are ones that are done and published.

782
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Okay.

783
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah.

784
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So it was 50 for the Tezuko Award

785
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and that's where I stopped.

786
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
54 pages are now sketched

787
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
because I did like 11 the other day

788
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and it may take another 30 pages beyond that.

789
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
So it could be like 134.

790
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Have you been sketching pages

791
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
or is this just your count of the ones you already had?

792
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I've been sketching pages like recently.

793
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It wasn't 54.

794
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It was more like 34.

795
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Okay.

796
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Cool.

797
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Cool.

798
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So I'm making progress

799
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and it's difficult like laying out a page

800
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and being like,

801
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
okay, well,

802
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
do I want this panel to fill up the page

803
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
or do I want it to be small?

804
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't know.

805
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Where do I put the speechful?

806
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I mean, the speechful was not so difficult

807
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
because if I know what I want to be said,

808
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
it's just a case of like arranging

809
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
the bubble in the panel where the person's speaking.

810
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, I got you.

811
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But there's a few ones that are like,

812
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
this could be a smaller panel

813
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but it's cool as a full page spread.

814
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But I worry that maybe I'm like zooming out too much

815
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and when it's a full thing, it's like the image is too big

816
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and I could fit more onto less pages

817
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
because I'm like,

818
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't know.

819
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
How do you do that?

820
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I think it's probably,

821
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
well, my problem is usually zooming in too far.

822
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So if it were me, I would say,

823
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
hmm, if I sometimes think I'm zooming out too far,

824
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that probably means I'm doing it right

825
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
because like my tendency is to go too far

826
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
in the opposite direction.

827
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know if you're the same way though.

828
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I mean, I've got,

829
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I keep the A4 page on my monitor

830
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
so I can see the whole thing.

831
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I can say, okay,

832
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
from the last page that she does this motion,

833
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
so we need a reaction shot.

834
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I just randomly draw a rectangle

835
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
and then see if I can fit something in it that looks right

836
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and if it doesn't, I change the rectangle.

837
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And then, okay, what else,

838
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
what space left do I have on the page?

839
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Most of the time doing it this way,

840
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I make a page layout and I'm like, yeah, that works.

841
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't think too much more beyond it and it's fine.

842
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But I feel like there's a lot of artistry

843
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
that I'm not going into.

844
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like I could be panel laying out a beautiful panel

845
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
or just being good at it.

846
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But I just want it down.

847
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I just want to sketch it all down so I have all these pages.

848
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah, sure.

849
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I mean, you could always do the rough sketch

850
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and then mix up the paneling later.

851
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That does become a little finicky

852
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
where it's like, oh, this panel on this other page

853
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
would work better on the previous page.

854
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I got to move it over

855
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and then go to shrink some of the other panels.

856
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Sometimes I just drag a lasso around it

857
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and squish it so that it fits.

858
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

859
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it's like, yeah, it works fairly well.

860
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think I'll need to go over them all again

861
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and be like, just to think about

862
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
how good that would be to read

863
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
before I sketch it all down.

864
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But it's happening.

865
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's happening.

866
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm making it.

867
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That's awesome.

868
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, that's good.

869
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That's good news.

870
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Did you finish those commissions?

871
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No.

872
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Give.

873
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There's only a single commission left

874
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
that I have not started

875
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and then another one which I need to finish the coloring on.

876
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So I'm basically done.

877
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So don't worry about it.

878
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Right.

879
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I have edited 13 out of 14 hours of my video,

880
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
so I'm basically done.

881
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You are basically...

882
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So you know what?

883
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I should just...

884
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, dang.

885
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So I should just stop here, actually.

886
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's basically done, so I should just leave it.

887
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah, and delete it as well.

888
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And also...

889
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know, because if I actually post it,

890
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
then I'll lose motivation to work on it.

891
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So like...

892
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I...

893
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Shit, that reminded me of something.

894
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh, no.

895
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Fuck, what was it?

896
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, I actually did get distracted.

897
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay, I'm sure...

898
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I already complained about how I got ghosted in Alibaba, right?

899
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That printer won't talk to me anymore?

900
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

901
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Is that still happening?

902
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Well, she has not contacted me,

903
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
so I have two options.

904
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I was doing the price calculations

905
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and it was so irritating because,

906
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
like, according to the figures they gave me,

907
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
including shipping,

908
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
it was gonna be a whole, like,

909
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
three or four dollars less

910
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
for a, like, per copy.

911
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
If...

912
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
With that printer.

913
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's a significant difference

914
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and it's really upsetting.

915
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I genuinely think,

916
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and this sounds so stupid,

917
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I genuinely think I'm gonna, like,

918
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
make a new account

919
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and contact them again

920
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and, like, pretend I'm a different person

921
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
and, like, fucking catfish them.

922
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Catfish them and try to get me to, like,

923
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
print my stupid fucking book anyway.

924
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Uh, I don't know,

925
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
just because they're just being cons about it.

926
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Have you...

927
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Have you not...

928
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They have other prices.

929
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They have...

930
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Message?

931
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Have you not left a second message?

932
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You fool.

933
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes, I've left messages.

934
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I've left several messages being, like,

935
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Hey, why have you not contacted me back?

936
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Like, why did you stop me?

937
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And they're all red.

938
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's...

939
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's, like, they're all on red.

940
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
She's seen them all

941
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and has chosen not to respond.

942
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay, well...

943
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So it's, like, a deliberate attack.

944
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Then, yeah, I guess you could try.

945
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah.

946
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Do they know what the project is already?

947
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Would they recognize you?

948
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They...

949
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
No, they would not recognize...

950
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I never sent, like, the page files

951
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
or told them what the book was, so...

952
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They might recognize if I, like,

953
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
am asking for a book that's the same...

954
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Like, same page count

955
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and size and stuff.

956
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's possible.

957
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I don't know.

958
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But they haven't seen the files,

959
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
so they might also not recognize.

960
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't know.

961
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm gonna, like, finish the layout,

962
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because I never, like, quite finished

963
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
doing the layout and doing the final cover.

964
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So I'm gonna finish that,

965
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and then I'm gonna fucking catfish this stupid bitch.

966
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then I'm gonna do that.

967
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And if it doesn't work,

968
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
then I'll just have to go with one of the other companies.

969
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But it's seriously, like, this company,

970
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
if I printed, like, at 100 copies,

971
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
it was gonna save me, like, $4 per copy,

972
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
which is significant.

973
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If I printed 500 copies,

974
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
it was gonna be, like, less than half the price.

975
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Or maybe not less.

976
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It was gonna be, like, almost a 50% savings.

977
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Let's say 30%.

978
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It was gonna be, like, a 30% savings

979
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
to print, like, a large number with this company,

980
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
as opposed to the other ones.

981
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And, like, the paper types were all the same.

982
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't know.

983
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I don't, I think it would have been a similar product,

984
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
just cheaper.

985
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I'm, like, I can't, I'm gonna,

986
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
it's gonna kill me.

987
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's gonna eat away at me if I do the Kickstarter,

988
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and, like, the book has to cost, like, $35

989
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
when I know it could cost $30.

990
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If only fucking stupid cunt Mei Zhang

991
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or whatever her name is,

992
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
just didn't ghost me, right?

993
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Just because, like, out of spite one day,

994
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
she decided I'm bored of this guy.

995
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't want to print,

996
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't want to print his sample copies.

997
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You got lord of ghosted.

998
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I wish she was dead.

999
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I want to kill her.

1000
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, then you'll be ghosting her.

1001
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah, I want, yeah, that's right.

1002
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm gonna make her a ghost.

1003
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
How could you do this to me?

1004
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's generally upsetting,

1005
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and I'm getting upset thinking about it.

1006
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Like, why have I been attacked like this?

1007
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why have I been persecuted like this?

1008
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And that sounds like a joke when I say it,

1009
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
but I'm absolutely 100% not joking.

1010
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Ugh.

1011
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I have to get those savings.

1012
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I have to get those precious savings

1013
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and pass them on to the consumer at any cost.

1014
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, it sucks.

1015
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah.

1016
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You know, I was considering,

1017
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
like, for the Clarissa,

1018
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
like, going through Amazon

1019
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
to have it be like, oh, you can

1020
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
like, print on demand.

1021
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Buy and print on demand.

1022
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yeah.

1023
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I feel like that might be,

1024
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if that's doable,

1025
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
or high enough quality,

1026
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that would be a lot safer,

1027
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
a lot less strenuous way

1028
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
of getting that physical out there.

1029
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's true.

1030
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's safer.

1031
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's less strenuous,

1032
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
but the margins are worse.

1033
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's just, it's cheaper.

1034
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Definitely, yeah.

1035
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's cheaper to print them yourself.

1036
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
But it is less of a headache.

1037
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's so much more like,

1038
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I feel like it's well worth the cost

1039
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
based on my experience

1040
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
sending the Lord of Ghost book out.

1041
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah.

1042
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Like, it's just, there's so much.

1043
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's mostly customs.

1044
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It's mostly the fact that customs

1045
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
in various countries

1046
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
can just randomly decide,

1047
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
even though it's all labeled properly,

1048
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
that they can just rip it open

1049
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and say, oh, this looks stupid

1050
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and throw it back.

1051
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And say, it sucks.

1052
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And it appears, like,

1053
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
seven months later,

1054
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
my door, like, destroyed.

1055
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And I have to, like,

1056
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
package it and send it again.

1057
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, I find-

1058
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I hope, but it doesn't happen again.

1059
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I finally went

1060
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
and I opened a new PO box

1061
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
at my new address

1062
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
so I can finally tell

1063
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
my stupid landlord

1064
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
what my mailing address is

1065
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
so that I can finally,

1066
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
maybe even get her

1067
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to give me some of my

1068
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
old security deposit back.

1069
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
That's exciting.

1070
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

1071
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, I have a new PO box,

1072
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
which is good.

1073
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The PO box is going to be, like,

1074
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
it's too- it's tiny.

1075
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's too small to hold, like, anything.

1076
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But it doesn't matter because

1077
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't know why people buy

1078
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the bigger PO-

1079
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
the bigger boxes,

1080
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
because if a thing is too big

1081
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
for your PO box,

1082
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
they just hold it for you.

1083
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They just hold it for you

1084
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and they put-

1085
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
give you a slip

1086
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
and then you give them the slip

1087
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and they're, like, here.

1088
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We had it in the back room for you.

1089
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So, like, I'm just going to abuse that.

1090
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah.

1091
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Like, big enough for envelopes.

1092
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They have to keep the envelopes in the back.

1093
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's big enough for envelopes,

1094
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
but if I- if I do

1095
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
slime and punishment,

1096
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm going to be sending them in, like,

1097
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
boxes.

1098
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Like, little- like,

1099
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
not large boxes,

1100
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but, like,

1101
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
boxes that will not fit

1102
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
in this box.

1103
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
In this PO box is what I mean.

1104
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Um...

1105
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Uh...

1106
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
What else is that?

1107
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Shit, I was going to say something else about-

1108
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Oh, yeah.

1109
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Um...

1110
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The book.

1111
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What I need to do,

1112
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I- I distracted myself from finishing

1113
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
editing the video,

1114
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
because I was contacting

1115
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
some of the other printers

1116
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
to, like, get other price quotes

1117
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
just to compare

1118
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to, like, find out,

1119
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
okay, like,

1120
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
what is the price difference

1121
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm looking at here.

1122
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And I pulled out my paper samples

1123
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and I'm, like,

1124
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
hmm,

1125
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
looking at them.

1126
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I might just-

1127
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I think-

1128
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I meant to do this before

1129
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and I should have gone through it.

1130
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I should have finished this.

1131
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I need to just, like,

1132
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
get a sample copy from...

1133
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Honestly,

1134
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
doesn't need to be the same company.

1135
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I should just get a-

1136
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I should get sample copies

1137
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
from anyone...

1138
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
whatever.

1139
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And I can use those sample copies

1140
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
as, like, a,

1141
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
this is what the book

1142
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
is going to look like

1143
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
when I do the Kickstarter.

1144
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It doesn't-

1145
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
it doesn't matter

1146
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
if it's from the same company

1147
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
or not,

1148
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
as long as, like,

1149
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the final-

1150
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
whoever I end up getting

1151
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the final copies from,

1152
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
you know,

1153
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
makes something that looks

1154
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
very similar.

1155
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So...

1156
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'm probably just going to

1157
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
maybe buy samples

1158
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
off of, like,

1159
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
this other guy

1160
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
whose prices are not as good

1161
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and,

1162
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
meanwhile,

1163
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
sneakily try and catfish

1164
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
the lady into-

1165
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
into giving me her-

1166
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
her deal.

1167
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Uh,

1168
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
that's my-

1169
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that's my plan going forward.

1170
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But I pulled out all these

1171
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
paper copies

1172
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and I'm comparing,

1173
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
like,

1174
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
ooh,

1175
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
16-point,

1176
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
uh,

1177
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
uh,

1178
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
glossy,

1179
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
laminated

1180
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
versus, like,

1181
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
um,

1182
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
this is a 250 GSM,

1183
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
uh,

1184
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
UV-

1185
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
UV-

1186
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
coated.

1187
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I pulled out my copy of-

1188
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I once again have pulled out

1189
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
my copy of, uh,

1190
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
problem sleuth

1191
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
to, like,

1192
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
compare page weights.

1193
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Somehow,

1194
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
even when a-

1195
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
even when a paper type

1196
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is, like,

1197
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
just as thick,

1198
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
just as sturdy,

1199
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
just as glossy,

1200
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
laminated,

1201
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
whatever,

1202
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
it just feels like

1203
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
a piece of shit

1204
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
when I'm holding

1205
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
the paper sample

1206
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
in my hand.

1207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It feels like garbage,

1208
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
like it belongs in the trash,

1209
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
versus, like,

1210
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
versus, like,

1211
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
in the- in the book form,

1212
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
it feels good,

1213
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and it feels right,

1214
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and it's like,

1215
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
yes,

1216
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
this is how a book should feel,

1217
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
even when it's, like,

1218
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
very similar paper consistency.

1219
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think it's just the fact

1220
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that it's a single sheet

1221
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and not, like,

1222
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
many together.

1223
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah.

1224
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You gotta get the real sense

1225
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
of, like,

1226
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
how a book

1227
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
with paper like this

1228
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
would feel.

1229
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah.

1230
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah.

1231
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's-

1232
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
it's-

1233
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
it's a psychological

1234
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
barrier.

1235
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Um...

1236
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You gotta trust the paper.

1237
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But I-

1238
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I gotta-

1239
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I gotta send-

1240
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I gotta send some other guy

1241
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the same mess-

1242
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
requests to-

1243
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
as I sent to this other lady

1244
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
and be like,

1245
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
hey, I want a bunch of

1246
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
different samples,

1247
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and I want them arranged

1248
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
this, that,

1249
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and the other way.

1250
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I want different types

1251
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
of paper on each one

1252
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
so I can compare them.

1253
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And hopefully this person

1254
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
doesn't ghost me

1255
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
for the same-

1256
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
for the same request.

1257
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Um...

1258
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.

1259
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Anyway, I was-

1260
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I feel like I was-

1261
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I was getting bored

1262
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
of editing.

1263
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So even though it's, like,

1264
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
almost done,

1265
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I was like,

1266
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't want to look at this anymore.

1267
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I will pull out my paper samples

1268
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
and I will do it

1269
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
a different thing

1270
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
right when I'm near the finish line.

1271
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, by the way,

1272
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
uh,

1273
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
speaking of-

1274
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
speaking of feeling bad

1275
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
while editing.

1276
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Remember?

1277
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Do you recall

1278
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that we recorded

1279
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
a bonus episode last week, Gib?

1280
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yes, I remember.

1281
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It was-

1282
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Do you remember-

1283
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
for the bonus episodes

1284
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
of the Progress Natives podcast,

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
slash the Progress Natives

1288
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
to find this

1289
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and so many other

1290
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
bonus episodes.

1291
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
50-

1292
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think this is 57th

1293
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
bonus episode.

1294
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Uh,

1295
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
we did a three-hour-long

1296
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
episode where we-

1297
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
because we needed to clear

1298
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the voicemails out,

1299
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
we went back through

1300
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
all the old voicemails

1301
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and we listened to

1302
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
all the ones

1303
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that had never been listened to.

1304
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Uh,

1305
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
yeah,

1306
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and then I did go

1307
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and clear them out.

1308
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So the voicemail box

1309
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
is empty again.

1310
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It should be able to receive

1311
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
voicemails

1312
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
as it used to be.

1313
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I think-

1314
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I-

1315
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
remember how-

1316
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
well,

1317
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I think that we eventually

1318
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
went too far

1319
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and I think we eventually

1320
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
ended up listening to some-

1321
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that we had already listened to.

1322
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I didn't remember

1323
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
any of those

1324
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
if we did.

1325
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh,

1326
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I think-

1327
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm thinking

1328
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
some of the samurai ones

1329
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
might have been ones

1330
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
that actually we had

1331
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
listened to

1332
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
because

1333
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
we were- it was definitely-

1334
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
we definitely went past

1335
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the era of like

1336
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
back when Nate used to

1337
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
screen the voicemails.

1338
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah,

1339
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
that was like a-

1340
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I mean,

1341
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
there was a bunch of pages

1342
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
missing. It was like,

1343
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
oh, this one was from

1344
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
four years ago

1345
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and then suddenly

1346
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
it was from one year ago.

1347
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah,

1348
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
well, that's because I-

1349
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that was because

1350
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I cleared those out

1351
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
because those were ones

1352
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
that I knew

1353
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
we had definitely-

1354
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
those were ones

1355
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that I knew had been-

1356
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
had been-

1357
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
not screened

1358
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
but had been,

1359
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
like,

1360
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
listened to on the show.

1361
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So, yeah,

1362
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I think we went past that.

1363
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Um,

1364
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but we accomplished the goal

1365
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
of listening to all the

1366
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
un-listened-to

1367
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
uh,

1368
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
voicemails

1369
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
from

1370
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
four or five years ago,

1371
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Lamal.

1372
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Anyway,

1373
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
the point is

1374
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
do you recall

1375
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
how when we were recording

1376
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that episode

1377
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I was having a crisis

1378
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
about my hair?

1379
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah.

1380
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah.

1381
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well,

1382
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
um,

1383
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I shaved my head.

1384
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Uh,

1385
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I didn't-

1386
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh my god.

1387
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah,

1388
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I didn't.

1389
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Um,

1390
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I was editing-

1391
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
editing the video,

1392
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
editing the-

1393
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the new video.

1394
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I just think

1395
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
my hair looked so bad

1396
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and it-

1397
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
and I-

1398
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
it was stressing me out

1399
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
and so I went to

1400
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
my

1401
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
bathroom

1402
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and I was like,

1403
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm gonna give myself a haircut.

1404
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think it would look better

1405
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
short-

1406
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
shorter.

1407
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I was thinking,

1408
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
like,

1409
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm gonna give myself

1410
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
just like a more

1411
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
shorter haircut.

1412
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I think it will

1413
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
look better.

1414
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And I started trimming

1415
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
my hair

1416
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and it looked

1417
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
worse

1418
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
instead of better.

1419
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And I was like,

1420
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
no, this isn't working.

1421
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
No, this isn't working.

1422
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No, fuck it.

1423
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Fuck it.

1424
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Fuck it.

1425
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Shaving it all.

1426
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Shaving it all.

1427
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So,

1428
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
so I'm bald now

1429
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and that's-

1430
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
and that's life.

1431
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You know,

1432
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
that's just-

1433
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
you know,

1434
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
the root of all suffering

1435
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is attachment,

1436
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Gib.

1437
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Hair.

1438
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What?

1439
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Like the root,

1440
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
you know, the-

1441
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1442
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, yeah.

1443
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

1444
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The root of all suffering

1445
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
is the same as the

1446
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
the hair root.

1447
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Right.

1448
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's the root.

1449
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's the where it grows

1450
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
out of.

1451
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
No, I'm gonna be-

1452
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Delete all that.

1453
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Sucked.

1454
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
No, I'm gonna be

1455
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
bald guy for a while.

1456
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I ordered a-

1457
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I ordered a,

1458
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
like, head trimmer.

1459
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I ordered,

1460
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
like, a specific,

1461
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
like,

1462
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
a head trimmer

1463
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
for, like,

1464
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
the head.

1465
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And-

1466
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The tip of the tip is

1467
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the beard trimmers are not

1468
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
very efficient

1469
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
for shaving one's head.

1470
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
No.

1471
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So we got, like,

1472
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
an adjustable one.

1473
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Well, yeah.

1474
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Uh, so,

1475
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
um, this is-

1476
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
this is me now.

1477
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
This is me now.

1478
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But I-

1479
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I trimmed my beard too short.

1480
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I should've kept my beard longer.

1481
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, that's-

1482
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
My beard is, like,

1483
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
stubble now.

1484
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's often how,

1485
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
like, it feels,

1486
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
like, balanced.

1487
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
If you've got no hair

1488
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
on your head,

1489
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
you just have a big

1490
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
dwarf beard

1491
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and it looks fine.

1492
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You got hair on your head?

1493
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
That's good.

1494
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You got hair anywhere else.

1495
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's way bad.

1496
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Get rid of them eyebrows.

1497
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah.

1498
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So, uh,

1499
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't know.

1500
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So that's-

1501
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
that's my-

1502
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that's my latest development.

1503
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Uh,

1504
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I will-

1505
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm just imagining,

1506
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
like,

1507
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
like,

1508
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
a style where you

1509
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
shave one side of your head

1510
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and then the opposite side's

1511
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
eyebrow.

1512
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So you have

1513
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
one eyebrow.

1514
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And-

1515
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You would have-

1516
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Bold on one side,

1517
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
but then hair on the other

1518
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
without an eyebrow.

1519
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You think-

1520
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You think that could work?

1521
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I think you would look more

1522
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
normal on the side

1523
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
where you still have the eyebrow

1524
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and no hair

1525
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
because that's a more

1526
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
normal way

1527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
to look.

1528
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I-

1529
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's not as-

1530
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It's not as bad as I thought.

1531
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
My-

1532
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I think my head shape is-

1533
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
is normal.

1534
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So,

1535
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
whatever.

1536
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I just think it looks normal.

1537
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So,

1538
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
it's fine.

1539
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Not as bad as I was afraid it would be.

1540
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It is one of those weird things, though, isn't it?

1541
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Like,

1542
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
if you've never had

1543
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
no hair,

1544
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
you have no idea

1545
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
really what your skull

1546
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
head shape

1547
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
looks like.

1548
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I did-

1549
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I did shave my head in college

1550
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
one time

1551
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
and I didn't really like it.

1552
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I decided-

1553
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I mean, I decided not to stick with it,

1554
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
obviously.

1555
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Uh,

1556
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
but like,

1557
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
whatever.

1558
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Uh,

1559
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
it was fine.

1560
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It was fine then and it's fine now.

1561
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'm um-

1562
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm um-

1563
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, shit.

1564
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I was gonna say,

1565
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
uh,

1566
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
what else was I gonna say?

1567
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh, fuck.

1568
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh, no.

1569
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Uh,

1570
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
duh.

1571
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I can't remember.

1572
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Okay, it's gone.

1573
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Cover for me.

1574
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Uh,

1575
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
uh,

1576
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I don't know.

1577
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I swear,

1578
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I swear I had-

1579
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
No!

1580
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I have like one more

1581
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
note

1582
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
to say about it.

1583
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Oh, well.

1584
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It'll-

1585
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It'll come back to me.

1586
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

1587
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't really have much.

1588
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Something about my head shape?

1589
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Um,

1590
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, I was gonna say,

1591
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I was gonna say

1592
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I talked a little bit

1593
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
on that bonus episode

1594
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
about,

1595
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
uh,

1596
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
uh,

1597
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
like,

1598
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
hair therapy methods

1599
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
that I was dabbling with.

1600
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Like,

1601
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'll continue to do those

1602
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and like,

1603
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
just see what happens.

1604
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But for the moment,

1605
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm just like,

1606
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
eh,

1607
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
fuck it.

1608
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
No,

1609
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
no more hair.

1610
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's-

1611
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
it's stressing me out,

1612
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
so fuck it.

1613
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And that's-

1614
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and that's where I'm at with it.

1615
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Well,

1616
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it's like,

1617
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
it's like,

1618
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
it's like,

1619
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
it's like,

1620
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
it's like,

1621
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
it's like in the Bible,

1622
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
you know,

1623
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
if your right hand

1624
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
causes you to sin,

1625
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
you know,

1626
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
cut it off and throw it away.

1627
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Chop it.

1628
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And if your hair-

1629
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and if your hair

1630
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
causes you

1631
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
to-

1632
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to-

1633
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000

1634

1636
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
to-

1637
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
to-

1638
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
to-

1639
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
to-

1640
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
to-

1641
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
to-

1642
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
to-

1643
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
to-

1644
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
to-

1645
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000

1646
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000

1648
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
to-

1649
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
to-

1650
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
to-

1651
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to-

1652
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
to-

1653
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
to-

1654
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
to-

1655
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
to-

1656
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
to-

1657
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
to-

1658
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
to-

1659
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to-

1660
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
to-

1661
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
to-

1662
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
to-

1663
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
to-

1664
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
to-

1665
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
to-

1666
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000

1667
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000

1668
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000

1669

to-

1671

to-

1672
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to-

1673
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,920
No, I have nothing I could use as a makeshift musical instrument.

1674
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,100
I could go get a musical instrument, but I don't want to.

1675
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,800
Run, escape, it's RuneScape.

1676
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,220
No, I wasn't even trying to make it a bit.

1677
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,060
I just said RuneScape Muse.

1678
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,600
I think it should have a jingle.

1679
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,900
I think it deserves a jingle.

1680
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,500
Go to Google, download Trumpet Sound and then use that.

1681
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,100
Trumpet Sound, OK.

1682
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,200
Yeah, sure.

1683
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,200
Why not?

1684
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,800
I got all the iron ore I need.

1685
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,500
I have in the bank 102,000 iron ore.

1686
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,800
Hey, remind me what the connection is between iron ore and Runeite.

1687
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,800
They're both ores that you can mine.

1688
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,800
Iron obviously becomes iron and Runeite becomes Rune,

1689
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,100
like a Rune bar that you can spit into like a Rune dagger.

1690
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,300
Because I saw you posting that like you had overflowed your Runeite into like 100k

1691
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,900
and it was like no longer showing you the number anymore.

1692
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,260
Yeah, that happens with money as well.

1693
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,700
If you get the stack large enough, I didn't realize it happened to things that weren't money.

1694
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,300
But if you get a stack high enough, it no longer shows individual the number.

1695
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,260
It shows 100 and something k.

1696
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,400
So I knew I needed a little over 102k.

1697
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,500
Actually a little under 102k.

1698
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,200
So I got 102k and that was just that's plenty.

1699
00:50:51,900 --> 00:51:00,600
So now I have all the iron ore I need and I need to now mine 200,000 or so coal

1700
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,700
so that I can turn, I can combine the iron and coal together.

1701
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,200
One part iron, two parts coal to make steel.

1702
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:14,800
Yeah, yeah, steel ingot, a steel bar in which I can smith into stuff for experience.

1703
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,700
Okay, yes.

1704
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,400
So you've got all the iron you were looking for.

1705
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,800
So your plan is to smith it into stuff.

1706
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,600
Is that the final goal?

1707
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
What's the final goal?

1708
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,800
The final goal is to get to level 99 Fletching having only prepared in free to play RuneScape.

1709
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,000
Do you need iron for Fletching?

1710
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
To make iron arrows.

1711
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,400
But I need the steel specifically as like the the the fastest available method of raising

1712
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,500
my smithing level because if I can't smith certain things, I can't do the Fletching

1713
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,800
because I got to turn like I got to make arrowheads.

1714
00:51:53,800 --> 00:52:00,000
So you need the smithing skill that's required to make arrowheads so that you can Fletch

1715
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,600
with them so that you can raise your Fletching skill.

1716
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,800
Yeah, so the 102,000 iron or turns into 102,000 steel bars, which should be enough experience

1717
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,200
to get me to the required smithing level.

1718
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,300
And that is my current goal.

1719
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,100
It's a lot of mining, but it's fun.

1720
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,400
It's just just every so often when I feel like playing it for an hour or two and I listen

1721
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,700
to a video.

1722
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know, I tried to boot up Noida the other day just because I had not played it in a

1723
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,200
long time and I was like, I'll just play a quick Noida and I opened it up and it turned

1724
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:49,000
out that yeah, I had forgotten it is it is like auto saved on like a very like late game

1725
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,800
save file.

1726
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,500
Like I'm very near the end of the run and I have a really powerful wand and I was like,

1727
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,300
oh, shit, and I remembered.

1728
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,900
Oh, yeah, I have this run where every time I beat the run and when it like crashes and

1729
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,700
doesn't remember that I wanted it, it auto loads back at that same thing.

1730
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,100
I have like a bugged auto save file.

1731
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,000
And I was like, you know what?

1732
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,500
Good, you know what?

1733
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,000
It's good that I can't play Noida.

1734
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,900
This is this is better actually.

1735
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,800
Yeah, you were you were a big Noida head.

1736
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I was pretty I was pretty noided.

1737
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, I was noided.

1738
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,200
I was too noided.

1739
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,100
I mean, I almost spent a thousand hours on it.

1740
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,300
So that's cringe.

1741
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,000
There are YouTubers.

1742
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,200
There are YouTubers that have made like maybe a career is putting it strongly, but there

1743
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,500
are YouTubers that have made like a lot of content.

1744
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,200
They've even made it their whole brand almost just centered around playing Noida and like

1745
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,300
they've played like a comparable amount to how much I played.

1746
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,800
Uh, so just what I'm saying is like I played enough Noida that I could have made that I

1747
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,400
could have been a Noida content creator if I had put my mind to it, but I didn't.

1748
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,000
Is that why it's cringe that you didn't turn your enjoyment of a video game into something

1749
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that something someone else can consume?

1750
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,600
That's not no, that's not exactly why it's cringe.

1751
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:22,600
Although it if I were if I were monetizing it somehow, it might mitigate the cringe a

1752
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:30,000
bit, but that's not just why it's just it's cringe because I in hindsight, I don't really

1753
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,400
think there were a thousand hours of content there to be rung out of it.

1754
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,700
I don't think I don't know if I got, you know, not all of those a thousand hours were

1755
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,900
necessary for me to have, you know, been done with Noida, I think.

1756
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,100
It's not a thousand nine nine hundred.

1757
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,900
It's like nine hundred and something hours.

1758
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,700
I could have put I could have put a lot less in and gotten the same amount out is what

1759
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,300
I'm saying.

1760
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,900
I mean, but I would you say it's because of like having to getting a little far in and

1761
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,600
being like, ah, this sucks, reroll, go reroll.

1762
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:13,500
No, no, it was just it was because it's because I just I don't know.

1763
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
I think I was just kind of addicted to it for a while.

1764
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,500
I was just like, I would just start it up and just do it and it would just be what I

1765
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:28,700
was doing, even when like I didn't I don't know how to I don't know how to describe

1766
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:28,800
it.

1767
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,800
I just I just would do it compulsively.

1768
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,600
I was playing Noida and I think it was bad.

1769
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,600
Does that does that adequately explain my feelings?

1770
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,900
That sometimes happens.

1771
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,600
Yeah.

1772
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:50,700
I definitely got into a habitual lugging on to World of Warcraft back in the day.

1773
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah, it wasn't even necessarily that I enjoyed things.

1774
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,400
It's just like I'm resuming my playtime from before.

1775
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,300
It's not like I'm starting again.

1776
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:07,100
I'm I'm I've got all these many quests, these many things to grind on.

1777
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,100
So let's just grind on something.

1778
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:16,200
I mean, an MMO is an MMO is kind of designed to get you to engage with it that

1779
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,600
way, though, right?

1780
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1781
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,700
Yeah.

1782
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,500
I think it's a little I think it's a little weird to look back and be like,

1783
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,200
why did I why did I put 900 hours into Noida?

1784
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
What was the point?

1785
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,500
I mean, you liked it, right?

1786
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,900
I did like it.

1787
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,500
Yeah, yeah, I just liked it.

1788
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,700
Sometimes there's a boy in his game.

1789
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, I guess.

1790
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,100
Yeah, I guess so.

1791
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, I guess so.

1792
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,700
I mean, some people like play like chess every day.

1793
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,100
They just love chess.

1794
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,900
It's not like chess is worse or better than a video game.

1795
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,500
It's just an older thing.

1796
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,700
I guess you're right.

1797
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,500
Yeah, I guess there's any number of things people do just for fun.

1798
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:05,400
And that's just you could see it as a waste of time if you wanted to.

1799
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, I would never say it's a waste of time.

1800
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:15,300
It's definitely a it starts to become a problem where it eats into time that

1801
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,400
you need to use.

1802
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,200
Like if it's a sort of game that hooks you in and keeps you there for like 12

1803
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,000
hours, well, you need to eat.

1804
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,500
You need to go to the bathroom.

1805
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,200
You need to like do other things.

1806
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
You need to get fresh air.

1807
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:36,100
Like a game that keeps you in locked in for extremely long periods of time isn't

1808
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,400
healthy, but playing a game for a large amount of hours just like an aggregate.

1809
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,400
It's not nothing wrong with that.

1810
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,300
I mean, there were definitely times when I would just play Noida all day.

1811
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,900
And that's probably that's probably not always good.

1812
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,900
Yeah, you got a few of those.

1813
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,500
But like it's life needs to continue going on.

1814
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

1815
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,700
And there's always things to do.

1816
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,900
And I mean, a lot of the a lot of those were pandemic.

1817
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,500
A lot of that was pandemic time.

1818
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,700
Oh, well, don't worry about it.

1819
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,200
I did.

1820
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,800
I did.

1821
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,500
Well, you know, it wasn't exclusively limited to then.

1822
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,100
But like, I mean, I do think I racked up the bulk of my Noida hours in pandemic

1823
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,200
times, lockdown times.

1824
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,000
So that's my excuse.

1825
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:26,600
Man, I remember what I did in lockdown.

1826
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,700
I played Noida and I and I made gummies.

1827
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,700
Yeah, I made the Lord of Ghosts early in the year.

1828
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,700
Oh, and I worked on Phantom's Revenge, of course, we did.

1829
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,100
Oh, you know, I did Lord of Ghosts from January to March.

1830
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,500
And then we did Radcon 4 and then I came back and then we're in lockdown.

1831
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,900
I think the Lord of Ghosts had already been finished.

1832
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,900
And then later I did Clarissa and I don't even know what I did in the months

1833
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,900
that I didn't do that.

1834
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,800
Clarissa was like August.

1835
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,100
What the hell happened?

1836
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,900
Did I just play games?

1837
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,800
I don't even know.

1838
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,700
I often find myself being like, what did I do for this certain period?

1839
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,200
Actually, yesterday was a micro.

1840
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,000
I genuinely don't remember what I did yet.

1841
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,900
I was going to sleep yesterday and I was like, what did I do all day?

1842
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
What did I do?

1843
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,100
Like I didn't.

1844
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,700
I guess I fucked around with like paper samples for a little bit.

1845
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,700
I messaged that guy from the other printing company a little bit.

1846
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,000
I did reorganize my room a little bit.

1847
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,200
And those all seem like such small things and yet they added up to, oh, my day's gone.

1848
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,200
I didn't even get any editing done.

1849
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,000
And sometimes I feel that way about like a whole month or a whole year.

1850
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But usually if I think about it, I can recall like, oh, no, no, I was...

1851
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,400
No, I was making the game or no, I was making the comic or...

1852
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,600
Yeah.

1853
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,100
It's a bad feeling though.

1854
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,600
It is a bad feeling.

1855
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,000
It's a bad feeling that usually I can dissuade myself.

1856
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,800
I can remember, no, no, I did this and that and the other thing.

1857
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,400
There's usually something.

1858
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,600
It's always looking back though.

1859
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,300
Like in the moment, I know I'm enjoying myself.

1860
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,100
I'm just relaxing, chilling out, doing things I want to do.

1861
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,100
Maybe they're not like life affirming.

1862
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:42,100
Like the most incredible thing ever happened to me today and I'll remember this memory forever.

1863
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Some days are just nice and comfortable and then I forget what happened during them

1864
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,700
when I try to recall them because they were similar to other days.

1865
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:55,100
I think it's only sad looking back and being like, oh, I don't have any memory.

1866
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,800
Yeah.

1867
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,400
That's why you gotta vlog it all.

1868
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,900
You gotta contentize it.

1869
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:10,100
Yeah, when you don't remember it, it's like it never happened.

1870
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,700
And that's kind of when you're like, when you're not doing new stuff,

1871
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,900
when you fall into your routine of doing the same thing every day,

1872
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,100
then you're like, it gets harder to remember it because every day is sort of the same.

1873
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,100
And so you can't really distinguish one day from another.

1874
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,500
So it kind of just feels like one day that you repeat it over and over again.

1875
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:39,500
Like the more, the more of a routine you have, the less distinct memory you have of the

1876
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,300
like the whole long period that occurred over.

1877
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:43,700
Yeah.

1878
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,700
And that's, I don't know.

1879
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,900
It's not, I guess it's not good.

1880
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,500
I guess it's why you gotta do stuff.

1881
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,800
I don't know.

1882
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,500
I don't know.

1883
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,100
I feel like there's an argument that it's not good.

1884
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,100
But when I really think about it, it really is only like a future problem.

1885
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,800
Like I'll be sitting around being like, what happened that year?

1886
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,000
Man, I don't think anything happened.

1887
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,300
And that's, that's what will happen is that if I did the same stuff for a while,

1888
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:23,700
I won't remember it individually or just I'll have a vague sense of stuff maybe.

1889
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,600
And it's like, is that, that's, that's a thing.

1890
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,600
But is that necessarily a bad thing?

1891
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:37,600
Should I feel bad about like having a routine or should I not?

1892
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,600
I think I, yeah.

1893
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,100
Well, I mean, I think you should.

1894
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1895
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,800
I guess it just depends how it's, how it's working for you.

1896
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:53,800
I mean, everyone likes having like significant memories.

1897
01:02:54,500 --> 01:03:02,500
I feel like I just want to avoid stressing out about not leading the most amazing life

1898
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,800
because then I'd be stressed out all the time.

1899
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,600
Well, I guess it would depend on if your routine is working for you.

1900
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,900
If it's getting, if it's getting you the results you want.

1901
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,800
Currently is.

1902
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:23,800
I mean, it's, it's getting me more results than earlier, which was big depression mode.

1903
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:24,900
Yeah.

1904
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,800
I'm just, I'm just chugging away doing a little bit here and there,

1905
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,800
playing a game in the, in the, in the time off.

1906
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,800
And I'm like, I don't know what happened.

1907
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,200
But eventually I'll have a comic and I can be like, oh, well, what do you know?

1908
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,100
Yeah.

1909
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,100
And that's a, and that's a.

1910
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,100
Don't that beat all.

1911
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,100
Is that from something?

1912
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,100
Won't that beat all?

1913
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,100
I thought it was just a.

1914
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,100
Don't that beat all?

1915
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,100
Isn't that just a phrase, like a saying?

1916
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,100
Yeah, maybe.

1917
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,100
I've heard.

1918
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,100
Don't that beat all of the other things that it could possibly have been?

1919
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:06,100
Whatever.

1920
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,100
Don't that just beat all?

1921
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,100
I feel it might just be a saying.

1922
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,100
Just jack off.

1923
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Doesn't that just, yeah.

1924
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,100
I don't know.

1925
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,100
It reminds me of something, but I can't, I can't think of what it is at the moment.

1926
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,100
One second.

1927
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,100
I need, I need to crack another sparkling water.

1928
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,100
If you've got a crack head, is it an ice cube?

1929
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:31,100
Going for, going for the rare and elusive Cran raspberry this week.

1930
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,100
By this week, I mean today.

1931
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,100
Hmm.

1932
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,100
What was I saying?

1933
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Man, my new room is so much less.

1934
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,100
It's not even that it's good.

1935
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,100
It's just so much less depressing than my old room.

1936
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,100
It makes me so happy.

1937
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,100
That's great.

1938
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,100
It is great.

1939
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,100
Boy, that shit was a nightmare.

1940
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,100
That's all I have to say about that.

1941
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,100
Yes.

1942
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:04,100
It is good when Ben Saint is not depressed by his living situation.

1943
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,100
True though.

1944
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,100
Although I tried him.

1945
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:15,100
Man, I tried a gummy thing that didn't work out and it was sad.

1946
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,100
I, I tried.

1947
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,100
Okay.

1948
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,100
I try.

1949
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:25,100
I think I mentioned, or maybe I mentioned at my Patreon podcast, which I made one of the other day.

1950
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,100
Uh, that like I tried.

1951
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:32,100
I switched to a powdered gelatin.

1952
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:37,100
I tried switching back from sheet gelatin to powdered gelatin and it was pretty successful.

1953
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,100
I was like, there was this result is pretty good.

1954
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,100
So I tried making.

1955
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:47,100
I thought it was going to be fancy and I was like, okay, why don't I mix up since, since all the ingredients are powdered now?

1956
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Why don't I just mix up all the ingredients in like a big batch?

1957
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:56,100
And then I can just, I can keep instead of having to combine the ingredients when I want to make a new batch,

1958
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:05,100
I can just have a tub full of the already combined ingredients and I can just scoop them and combine them with water and make it that way.

1959
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,100
Just add water.

1960
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,100
Yeah, literally like a just add water version.

1961
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:14,100
Um, well, I tried it and I made, they came out very uneven.

1962
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Maybe, maybe I just didn't mix it enough because like I made four batches and like out of this, like, you know, this big sort of pre combined amount of powder that I made.

1963
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,100
And one came out very kind of soft and, and kind of particle II.

1964
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Another came out decent.

1965
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,100
Another one came out like gritty.

1966
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,100
And then the last one came out like the texture was okay, but I didn't like the flavor.

1967
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,100
That's not really the mix's fault.

1968
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,100
So, but I use the sounds like a mix problem.

1969
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,100
I think it was a mix problem.

1970
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:52,100
I guess the, I could try, I should try it again and try mixing it more thoroughly.

1971
01:06:52,100 --> 01:07:03,100
But I guess the one concern I have is, oh, what if it like, what if there's no amount of mixing that I can do that will cause it like it'll still like naturally separate or something.

1972
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:13,100
If like, if it naturally, if it will naturally separate once it's mixed, then there's no point premixing it because I'll just have to like mix it again before I use it every time.

1973
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,100
And then what was the point?

1974
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:19,100
Could you, could you do an experiment to figure out if that happens?

1975
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,100
Yeah.

1976
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,100
Small samples and mix them together and see if they separate over time.

1977
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:27,100
I should, I should try making like a smaller amount.

1978
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,100
Yeah.

1979
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,100
Saving it in like a jar or something.

1980
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,100
These are like powdery things you're adding together.

1981
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,100
Yes.

1982
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:39,100
That's the reason why I decided, I explained this in the Patreon.

1983
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,100
I didn't go that much into it.

1984
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
You know what?

1985
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,100
I'll just, I'll say the same thing I said.

1986
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,100
This is, that doesn't have to be exclusive content.

1987
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:53,100
I had been using the sheet gelatin because it's fancier and it's more pure.

1988
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,100
And that's true and whatever.

1989
01:07:55,100 --> 01:08:00,100
But I realized like, wait, if I use the powder, then like all the ingredients are powder and

1990
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:05,100
I can just pre-combine them because it's like, yeah, powdered citric acid, powdered, not,

1991
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:13,100
or yeah, sugar, regular granulated sugar, corn fiber, which is a powder and gelatin powder,

1992
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,100
literally just mix it up.

1993
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:22,100
And then in theory, if I got it to work, I would just, you know, be able to scoop that

1994
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:30,100
and add, you know, some amount of water and color and, you know, some sort of fruit flavoring.

1995
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,100
Are the particles different sizes?

1996
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,100
Can you tell?

1997
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,100
Yes.

1998
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:43,100
What they, I mean, the citric acid and the sugar have a very similar like particle size

1999
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,100
and consistency.

2000
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:50,100
The corn fiber has a very, the corn fiber and the gelatin have a more similar different

2001
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:56,100
like smaller, drier, powdery consistency to them.

2002
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,100
Whereas the other two are sort of like little crystals.

2003
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,100
So it's possible that it might separate over time.

2004
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:10,100
I feel like that if you jostle it around that the bigger crystals will be at the top over time.

2005
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:16,100
And so a scoop would need to go all the way down to the bottom to be a full, like a proper scoop.

2006
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,100
So yeah, you probably have to mix it in every time anyway.

2007
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:27,100
Because you can't rely on like it being uniform throughout whatever container it's in.

2008
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,100
If you move the container at all.

2009
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:36,100
It would be okay as if like I just have to like pick up the jar that I store it in and just give it a shake.

2010
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,100
Like if that would do it, that would be fine.

2011
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,100
You think that would make it worse?

2012
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:50,100
When you get like different things and you shake it, the smaller things will find gaps in between the bigger things

2013
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,100
and the bigger things would rise to the top.

2014
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,100
So if you shake it, the bigger things would be at the top.

2015
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,100
You'd need to mix it instead of shake it.

2016
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,100
Like fold it in over itself and all that.

2017
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,100
Yeah.

2018
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:09,100
I mean, if I have to like mix it together with like a spatula or a spoon, then it's kind of like what was the point?

2019
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,100
I will try it.

2020
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:18,100
I will try it again and try to be more thorough about it and just convince myself like okay, no, I mix this as well as possible.

2021
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:25,100
This is definitely not a time saving measure.

2022
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:35,100
I bought a bunch of like glass jars to store different ingredients and I have a jar for sugar and a jar for acid and a jar for fiber.

2023
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:41,100
And I was just like, why did I even bother?

2024
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,100
I could just keep them in bags that they come in.

2025
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,100
It's not that much more convenient.

2026
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,100
Maybe I should just use these jars to store the premixed powdered combo.

2027
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,100
I was thinking to myself, I think it would be nice.

2028
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:02,100
It would be nice and convenient if I could just get, I could have one.

2029
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:09,100
I could have one for the fiber formula and I could have another jar for the non-fiber like sugar formula.

2030
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,100
Hey.

2031
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,100
You have little labels on them.

2032
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,100
Yeah.

2033
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:19,100
What if, what if I just became a drug lord and started selling weed gummies?

2034
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,100
What if I did that?

2035
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:27,100
What if I sold them through the mail, which is completely illegal, but I would never get caught?

2036
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,100
Well, they may listen to the podcast.

2037
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,100
No, they aren't allowed.

2038
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:38,100
If you're a cop, turn this podcast off right now.

2039
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:42,100
Civilians only.

2040
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,100
What if I left?

2041
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,100
What is the legality situation on selling weed?

2042
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:54,100
It's illegal substance now, but you probably have to get a permit or something, right?

2043
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,100
Yeah, to be a vendor, you need a permit.

2044
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:04,100
But I think a lot of people get around that with like a sort of like it's technically a gift.

2045
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:11,100
Like you're technically making a donation to me and I'm giving you the weed as a gift, right?

2046
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,100
I think it's a little bit like, eh, it's probably a little bit illegal,

2047
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:22,100
but you can sort of technically get through a loophole.

2048
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:34,100
Yeah, I think technically you need some sort of permit or license to sell marijuana products for a profit.

2049
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:41,100
It's definitely illegal to put them in the mail, but you know, I was just thinking,

2050
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:48,100
I've sent so many other things that are not, I've sent pins in the mail and I've sent them as letters.

2051
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:55,100
I've sent them as envelopes for the cost of a stamp, even though they contain, you know, non-paper goods and it works.

2052
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:59,100
And it would be so easy to do that with gummies.

2053
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,100
It would be so easy and I wouldn't even, I wouldn't have to go to the post office, I wouldn't incur any risk,

2054
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:13,100
I would have no return address, I could just drop it in a mailbox and 99% of the time it would arrive at its destination.

2055
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:26,100
No delivery fee. You know, every weed vendor around here, they don't send them through the mail, they're a delivery service.

2056
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:33,100
You contact them and you order what you want and then they come and they deliver it to you, because it's not legal to send stuff through the mail.

2057
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:42,100
But there's like a, I was looking up, it's like $50 delivery fee, like it costs a lot.

2058
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,100
I guess if you're buying in bulk, that's fine.

2059
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:53,100
But it's like, you know how it's really expensive to buy to get food delivered with DoorDash?

2060
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,100
Like the fees just pile up.

2061
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,100
Yeah, yeah.

2062
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,100
I think weed is like that, but like even worse.

2063
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,100
So, I don't know.

2064
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:11,100
Here's what I'm saying, is that I definitely would break the law for personal gain, I definitely would do that.

2065
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:19,100
You could just have like a little, you could buy a bike and you could cycle around with like a hamper on the front and it'd be the weed gummy hamper.

2066
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,100
Cringe.

2067
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,100
You could sell.

2068
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,100
Cringe, that's work, that's work.

2069
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:29,100
No, but it would be really funny to see like the bicyclist weed seller.

2070
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,100
You could have a little horn on the side.

2071
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,100
You can honk the horns.

2072
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,100
You can get your weed gummies.

2073
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,100
You have a little straw hat.

2074
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

2075
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Extra, extra.

2076
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,100
Read all about it.

2077
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,100
Read all about it, you're high.

2078
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,100
POV, you're buying my product.

2079
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:53,100
What if I just left, what if I just left flyers?

2080
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,100
What if I just left like, what if I left, how would I advertise it?

2081
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,100
How do I advertise my weed by mail service?

2082
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,100
I want to do it.

2083
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:11,100
With like an insane like picture of you with like your science experiments, sort of like gummy stuff.

2084
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,100
No.

2085
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:17,100
And it's like crazy bends, evil illegal weed stuff.

2086
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,100
Yeah, that's, you know what, that's a real, that's, you're right.

2087
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:27,100
I should put out pictures of, I should put out literal pictures of myself with my home address on them advertising my illegal services.

2088
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,100
Yeah, you know what?

2089
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,100
You know what?

2090
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,100
You're absolutely right.

2091
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,100
It would be so cool.

2092
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:37,100
Everyone would want to buy a crazy bends, crazy illegal weed gummies.

2093
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:45,100
I'd have so many, I'd have so many like, like undercover cops, like in my emails, like, hey, I was interested in your product, actually.

2094
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:49,100
I don't know, I just, I just.

2095
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,100
And then you tell them to come to this specific tile on your, in your floor.

2096
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,100
They stand there and then you've trapped door and they fall down the chute.

2097
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,100
I could do it.

2098
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,100
I could do it discreetly.

2099
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:04,100
I could just leave flyers around that were like, I don't know, maybe they just have a logo on them.

2100
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:14,100
Nothing, nothing fancy, nothing too attention grabbing, but they're like, you know, hey, just saying, if you send $20 to this PayPal, you know.

2101
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,100
Something good will happen.

2102
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:27,100
You will, you will receive, you know, a certain milligrammage of, you know, edibles in your mailbox within the week, you know.

2103
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,100
Maybe, maybe, I don't know.

2104
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,100
To feel like that's a service.

2105
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,100
Feel like that's a service people might be interested in.

2106
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,100
And I just want money.

2107
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,100
I don't like weed, but I like money.

2108
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:46,100
You know, I never get high on my own supply is what I'm saying.

2109
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,100
I liked that one time that I was high.

2110
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,100
Okay.

2111
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,100
And it was like, whoa.

2112
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,100
Yeah.

2113
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,100
That's my experience.

2114
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,100
Yeah.

2115
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:00,100
I'm not a, I'm not a super big, not a super big fan of it myself personally.

2116
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,100
That's okay.

2117
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:06,100
You know, different strokes for different folks.

2118
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,100
I still prefer getting drunk because I feel I have not drank.

2119
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,100
No, wait, that's not true.

2120
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:17,100
I drank with my friends a few weeks ago and because then on the unique name of Sora's episode, I was hungover.

2121
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:24,100
That was my first time drinking alcohol in like quite a while, like a month or two, which is fine.

2122
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,100
You know, it's bad.

2123
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,100
No, it's bad that you are not an alcoholic band.

2124
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
That's cringe.

2125
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,100
That's cringe that you didn't drink every day.

2126
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:43,100
It's pretty, I gotta say, it's pretty cool of me that I only drink socially and I only ever smoke when I drink.

2127
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:53,100
So yeah, there was the further while there, the only time I would drink by myself was during the height of the pandemic

2128
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:59,100
is when I would go and I would get two bottles of champagne from the local liquor store and I would just drink them in my room.

2129
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,100
Oh, no.

2130
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,100
I was pretty, I mean, those are dark times.

2131
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,100
Those are dark times.

2132
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:09,100
The word felt the need to like drink heavily.

2133
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,100
I didn't do it all the time, but I did it.

2134
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,100
I did it a few times.

2135
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,100
Like I've only drunk socially.

2136
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:20,100
There's been a few times where I'm like, man, I think I need a beer to relax.

2137
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,100
But one beer wasn't enough and I couldn't be bothered to get another one.

2138
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,100
So I just drank it and it was like, well, whatever.

2139
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Well, it doesn't feel the same when there's not like a party atmosphere or some sort of event happening.

2140
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,100
Yeah.

2141
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,100
Yeah.

2142
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:45,100
It's when you're just by yourself, it's like, it's sort of like, when do I stop?

2143
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:55,100
At some point you like you're you get a little buzzed, you get a little drunk and then you're like, I guess on the one hand, it makes me like more like I want to go to sleep.

2144
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:04,100
So it's like, whereas if I'm sober, which is most of the time, I have a tendency to tell myself like, no, I don't want to go to sleep yet.

2145
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,100
Like, no, I want to do something else before versus if I'm drunk, I'm like, I'm a little tired.

2146
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,100
Oh, I'll go lie down and go to sleep.

2147
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,100
So it's kind of good.

2148
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:17,100
I had a recipe for disaster, though, if you go to sleep while drunk before you drink water.

2149
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,100
Yeah, it can be.

2150
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,100
Yeah, it can be.

2151
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,100
Because that's where you get a whole hungover.

2152
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,100
That's that's true.

2153
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,100
So, you know, it's a mixed, it's a mixed blessing.

2154
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,100
Alcohol truly is a mixed blessing.

2155
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:35,100
It's a double-edged broken bottle.

2156
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:40,100
Let me see here.

2157
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:44,100
When they say double-edged sword, what do they really mean?

2158
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:49,100
Because a sword has an edge and some swords only have one side of it.

2159
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,100
That's sharp.

2160
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,100
Other swords like a broad sword has both sides.

2161
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,100
Yeah.

2162
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Does a double-edged sword mean that the handle is also a blade because that doesn't even exist.

2163
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,100
They don't have those.

2164
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:08,100
Yeah, the thing about the, yeah, you know, the thing about the saying, oh, it's a double-edged sword is that like lots of real swords are double-edged.

2165
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:13,100
And they're they're perfectly fine.

2166
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:24,100
I think I think the implication must be that you are holding a handle that is also cutting you like a blade, which is maybe the saying is like.

2167
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:30,100
Like it's referencing a sword that is a stupid idea that wouldn't exist.

2168
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,100
But that doesn't make sense.

2169
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,100
No, double-edged swords.

2170
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:39,100
I mean, most European broad swords were all double-edged.

2171
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,100
You didn't didn't cut yourself.

2172
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,100
You just swing it.

2173
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:48,100
You just swing it away from you instead of towards you and it's fine.

2174
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,100
That's the trick.

2175
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,100
That's the trick that no one, no, they don't teach you in solid school.

2176
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,100
You got to swing it at the other guy.

2177
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:03,100
Like a double-edged sword, meaning like you swing it forwards, killing the enemy, and then you swing it backwards, stab yourself.

2178
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:07,100
Well, if it wasn't a double-edged sword, you couldn't stab yourself.

2179
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:11,100
Although you could because every sort has a point.

2180
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,100
It's a double-edged sword.

2181
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,100
Boy, I wish this conversation had a point.

2182
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:24,100
Even one, not let alone two.

2183
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,100
A quadruple-edged board.

2184
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:43,100
In Dungeon Crawlstone's soup, there's triple swords, which is just like three sword blades next to each other on one hill.

2185
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:47,100
So if you stabbed, it would make a little like a-

2186
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,100
It would be three times.

2187
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Three times.

2188
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:55,100
The thing about that that's funny about that is that it literally is barely-

2189
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:59,100
It would be so much less effective than just one sword.

2190
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:06,100
Yeah, because if you managed to slice, you couldn't go very far because the other two blades would stop it from entering the skin.

2191
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:12,100
Yes, it would distribute the pressure that makes the cut.

2192
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,100
It would cut it in three and you would not cut as deep.

2193
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,100
It's like so fucking stupid.

2194
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:34,100
I know why they do maces like that just to make it a little easier to hold but still have a lot of weight to it and smaller surface area of contact.

2195
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,100
Yeah, yeah.

2196
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:41,100
An iron ball on a stick would be harder to swing.

2197
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:51,100
It would hit more but it's so soft and round so that they make them like many little tiny flanges of a mace.

2198
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,100
Yes, yes, flanges.

2199
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:59,100
To make a triple sword like that, it's going to blunt its own impact.

2200
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,100
You might as well use a blunt weapon at that point.

2201
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,100
If you really want to distribute the impact.

2202
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,100
I love my mace.

2203
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:17,100
I love Leopold, my flanged mace that I got from King Richard's Fair.

2204
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,100
I forgot I had a name.

2205
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,100
It does have a name.

2206
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:27,100
Does it make any appearances in the dogen?

2207
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,100
I don't know if it does.

2208
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,100
I don't recall.

2209
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:47,100
My character reference had the mace so a bit stupid if it never got drawn into any of those pages but it might not have because it was never relevant to any of the scripts.

2210
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,100
It definitely does appear in the OVA at least once.

2211
01:23:51,100 --> 01:24:00,100
I made sure to have the mace in the OVA whenever that gets done so it will make an appearance I'm sure.

2212
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:08,100
Speaking of the dogen, you saw there's only like six pages left I think before it's done.

2213
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,100
It's like getting pretty close to me.

2214
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
How many are completed?

2215
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,100
I forgot the total number.

2216
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,100
I think the total is like 24 or something.

2217
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,100
So it's mostly done.

2218
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,100
I don't want to release it.

2219
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:34,100
I want to release it alongside the OVA so I hope Nate has reassured us again recently that he will start working on it very soon.

2220
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:41,100
Yes, we've got more of a system to check in on progress.

2221
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:51,100
We all agree that we need to be checking up on the progress on this, which is good.

2222
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,100
I really hope he fucking does it.

2223
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:06,100
I'm sure he will eventually but I hope that eventually is now is what I'm saying.

2224
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,100
Yes.

2225
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:17,100
Speaking of weapons, I've had a gun and I shot.

2226
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,100
Yes.

2227
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,100
No, did you kill the queen?

2228
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,100
No.

2229
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,100
No, they found out.

2230
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,100
Ellie is our cut it out.

2231
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:36,100
Cut out which prominent British political figure who recently died, Gib is directly responsible for the murder of.

2232
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,100
It's Prince Philip.

2233
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,100
Okay.

2234
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,100
We can't let him know.

2235
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,100
I was thinking of like Dungeons and Dragons.

2236
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:54,100
I'm just sort of feeling it right now and I'm like, how do I, I kind of want to DM a game.

2237
01:25:54,100 --> 01:26:03,100
I kind of want to be the person who comes up with a thing and see what those little rascals, those player characters, what they get up to.

2238
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,100
That's interesting.

2239
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,100
Have you played before?

2240
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:18,100
I played, I've only ever played like statless like role play mini game adventure things with a few people, a few groups of people.

2241
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Honestly based, honestly better than D&D in my opinion.

2242
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,100
Yeah.

2243
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,100
And it was fun.

2244
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:34,100
I had this one with a group that had a Munchie in it and I had this character.

2245
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,100
Yeah.

2246
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:44,100
Which was like, it was a crippled boy who had unearthed an ancient technology.

2247
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,100
It was the Atlas, the Boston Dynamics Robot.

2248
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,100
And he, and in using the Boston Dynamics Robot Atlas.

2249
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,100
Like the dog?

2250
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,100
No, no, the walking one, the humanoid.

2251
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,100
Okay, yeah.

2252
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,100
Atlas is the one who can do backflips and stuff.

2253
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,100
Yeah.

2254
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:04,100
Crippled boy, this crippled urchin farmer boy and his legs.

2255
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,100
Was this like a post-apocalypse?

2256
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,100
Yeah, some sort of a thing.

2257
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,100
It sounds very fallout.

2258
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,100
It's not a post-apocalypse.

2259
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:17,100
It was some sort of like Norse thing, but I just said this and everyone thought it was a cool idea.

2260
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,100
Okay.

2261
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:24,100
And so I was this little boy and he needed to go on an adventure to find batteries.

2262
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:30,100
You need to find batteries for the Boston Dynamics Robot because in their primitive culture, they didn't have batteries anymore.

2263
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,100
They don't know what that is.

2264
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:35,100
And the Boston Dynamics Robot is like, I need fuel.

2265
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:36,100
I need energy.

2266
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:42,100
So he only has a limited amount of power before he powers down and it's an adventure.

2267
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,100
And it's all the other characters there.

2268
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:49,100
And I thought that was fun, but it sort of peated out because it was difficult to get everyone together.

2269
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,100
That's how it always goes.

2270
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:55,100
That's how it always goes with D&D, almost always.

2271
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,100
Yeah.

2272
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,100
I'm thinking if I make the world.

2273
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,100
Honestly, yeah.

2274
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,100
That's the hard part, right?

2275
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,100
Finding someone who's willing to DM is the hardest part.

2276
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:10,100
So if you're willing to DM, that is the biggest hurdle removed.

2277
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,100
Yeah.

2278
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,100
True.

2279
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:20,100
I think it would be nicer and more smooth, less stressful for me if I just made a world and people could come and have fun in it.

2280
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:25,100
Which is kind of what I already do with world building for my comics.

2281
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:31,100
So that game that you played, was that the statless one?

2282
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,100
That was a statless one.

2283
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:37,100
Okay, so you haven't played with a character sheet and rolling dice and stuff.

2284
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:43,100
I think we rolled dice for do you do it or do you not do it successfully?

2285
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:50,100
There was no additions and subtractions for character class things.

2286
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,100
It was just sort of like, I'm going to do this crazy thing.

2287
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:58,100
Alright, roll a dice if it's even you win.

2288
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,100
It was very simple, but yeah.

2289
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,100
So there was failure.

2290
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,100
I haven't played D&D in a long time.

2291
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:12,100
I think last time I played D&D would have been that time I had that Aztec campaign,

2292
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,100
which would have been in 2018 or something.

2293
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:25,100
Do you have campaign ideas?

2294
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:30,100
Do you have a concept for a campaign you would DM now?

2295
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,100
Okay.

2296
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,100
I have no ideas.

2297
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,100
It's just sort of like a feeling.

2298
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:40,100
It would be kind of fun, wouldn't it, to be watching everybody.

2299
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:46,100
Like, oh, here's the gnome king and he's got a question for you.

2300
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:53,100
Somebody says, I beat him to death with a mace and it's like, oh, he's quicker than you thought.

2301
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,100
Roll them dice.

2302
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,100
Just like rattle them bones.

2303
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,100
Rattle his bones.

2304
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,100
Have you seen that picture?

2305
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:06,100
This is a really funny joke on Twitter where like, you know how you can spoiler an image on Twitter

2306
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,100
and you have to click it to unspoiler it to see.

2307
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:16,100
There's a really, sometimes I'll see one that's like, oh, like this image contains sensitive content

2308
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:22,100
and you click unspoiler and it's a picture of a bunch of like skeleton gangsters with Tommy guns

2309
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,100
and it says like, they unspoiled it.

2310
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,100
Rattle them boys.

2311
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,100
I love it every time.

2312
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,100
I like that.

2313
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,100
Yeah, I've seen that.

2314
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:42,100
I guess one thing I would say is it might, it would be a challenge if you wanted to run like a rules D&D system with character sheets.

2315
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:46,100
Like the DM, the DM should really know the rules, you know?

2316
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,100
Yeah.

2317
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:50,100
So if you're, so that's, that's a challenge.

2318
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:57,100
There's like books I need to read and stuff if I want to do like an official thing.

2319
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:02,100
But then I would require like the players to also read the books, which is another thing.

2320
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:04,100
It's like, it's really annoying.

2321
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:11,100
It's really annoying when there's like one player that doesn't know the rules and they're all like, how do I, how do I attack again?

2322
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:22,100
Like every time it's their turn, it's like, I mean, perhaps you know, but I hate D&D because literally nobody in the world understands how to play it right.

2323
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,100
Everyone is fucking stupid.

2324
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,100
Everyone, everyone plays it wrong.

2325
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:32,100
Every, there's always, there's always, just give me, just let me rant for one second.

2326
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:37,100
There's always one guy who like every time it's their turn, they're like, how do I attack?

2327
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,100
Wait, what's, what does my armor class mean?

2328
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:43,100
Like, oh, which saving throw do I use for that?

2329
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,100
What do I add to whatever check?

2330
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:50,100
And it's like, bro, you got your attack bonus.

2331
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,100
And you roll a d20 and you add your attack bonus.

2332
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:58,100
We've done this a hundred fucking times and you still don't know.

2333
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,100
There's always one.

2334
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,100
Usually there's more than one.

2335
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,100
Huh?

2336
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,100
It seems complicated though.

2337
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:14,100
It can be complicated, but like 90% of the time it's, it's not like 90% of the time it's, it's, it's like just like the.

2338
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:21,100
When it, when it's simple stuff, simple stuff like attacking or simple stuff like making a check to, to accomplish something.

2339
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,100
Okay.

2340
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,100
I mean, there's that.

2341
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,100
And then there's my other thing of like, everybody always plays wrong because everyone always rolls.

2342
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,100
Everyone's always like, hmm, okay, dungeon master.

2343
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:37,100
Can I make a, can I make a, an acrobatics check to, to, you know, to do whatever?

2344
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,100
Oh yeah.

2345
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:43,100
The player tries to tell the DM what skill they want to use to do something.

2346
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:50,100
When it should really be the DM being like, okay, it should really be the player saying, I want to do this.

2347
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,100
And then the DM saying, okay, to do that.

2348
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,100
Here's what you need to do.

2349
01:32:55,100 --> 01:33:04,100
And I mean, sometimes it might be okay for a player to be like, oh, uh, hmm, is it okay if I use my athletic skill instead of my acrobatics skill?

2350
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:09,100
Like I'm not saying that should never come up, but like in, in general.

2351
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,100
I feel like it would be easier.

2352
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:12,100
Most people just play wrong.

2353
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:19,100
Most people just play wrong in a way that like makes the game worse and I'm sick of it.

2354
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:24,100
I feel like it might be easier if I just invent my own Dungeons and Dragons rule set.

2355
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,100
Oh God.

2356
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:29,100
You think that's, you, you might think that would be easy, wouldn't you?

2357
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,100
You would think that would be.

2358
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,100
Yeah.

2359
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:40,100
It'd be have like your stats like, oh, flumptuousness and that affects, you know, your, your, your bolus picking skill.

2360
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:44,100
You, you are opening up a rabbit hole.

2361
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,100
You are opening up a rabbit hole there.

2362
01:33:46,100 --> 01:34:02,100
No, no, I know it can get extremely in depth because I knew a guy in uni who had an, a system for magic and they would talk about how it worked, how it was like based in physics and, and, and all of these things.

2363
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:08,100
And I'm like, huh, these conversations would go on for extremely long time.

2364
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:15,100
I had never really understood what on earth it was, but he was really into this, this, this system he'd invented.

2365
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,100
I have a.

2366
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:19,100
It's like, I wish you well.

2367
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,100
You know, that's the sort of.

2368
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,100
Yeah.

2369
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,100
I have a friend.

2370
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,100
I couldn't get my head around it, but.

2371
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,100
One of the guys.

2372
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,100
It seemed fun.

2373
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,100
Like I kind of wanted to do it myself, but I felt like it was a little beyond me.

2374
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:38,100
One of the guys I was, I hung out with the other week is a guy who, yeah, he, he, he has come up with many different like pen and paper systems.

2375
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,100
I guess it's sort of a hobby of his.

2376
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:44,100
I think he actually told me that he had like recently published one.

2377
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:51,100
He had like, he had put one out and like, I think he had maybe crowdfunded it and it had made like a few thousand dollars, which was like really impressive.

2378
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:55,100
Like that's like most of those projects don't get anything.

2379
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,100
Right.

2380
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:00,100
Like there's so many, there's so many that receive no traction at all.

2381
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:08,100
I should have asked him for details because I don't remember like what the game was called or, or what the campaign was, but he mentioned that.

2382
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:15,100
But anyway, the point is that like, yeah, he spends like years, he spent like years doing, doing all these sorts of things.

2383
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:22,100
And there is a very, it's really easy for a system to get way too complicated.

2384
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:28,100
And it's, and it's on the other side, it's like, it's easy for a system to be way too simple.

2385
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:33,100
And then you find it's yourself, you're like, well, how does this rule system handle such and such?

2386
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,100
Oh, well, it doesn't, or I can't, or whatever.

2387
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:40,100
Or I never considered that eventuality.

2388
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:47,100
There was that game, that game RISIS that I found or RISIS or R-I-S-U-S.

2389
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:50,100
I always, that's like the one stat RPG.

2390
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,100
RISIS pieces?

2391
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:55,100
Your stat, yeah, your stat is your class.

2392
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,100
And, but your class is just like a descriptor.

2393
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:04,100
And it's something like a runaway tomboy princess or something, right?

2394
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:10,100
Like you're like a level one runaway tomboy princess and like a level two, I don't know.

2395
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:15,100
What's a...

2396
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,100
Crocheter or something, right?

2397
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:23,100
Like, so you have these descriptors of things and anytime you want to do something,

2398
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:25,100
you're not rolling like a particular stat.

2399
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:31,100
You don't have like a value in athletics or acrobatics or search or intimidate or whatever.

2400
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:38,100
You just have like, okay, well how good would a runaway tomboy princess theoretically be at this one activity?

2401
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,100
Is that something that one of them would do?

2402
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:49,100
And if it is, then you can use that class, that quote unquote class as like your modifier to accomplish the check.

2403
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,100
And I always thought that was really cool and I never played RISIS with anyone.

2404
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,100
I kind of meant to.

2405
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:59,100
I kind of wanted to do a game like that at like a Radcon, but it just didn't happen.

2406
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:06,100
Yeah, Radcons were always so weirdly hectic.

2407
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,100
Four was like really hectic, right?

2408
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:15,100
Four was like, honestly, I probably could have organized one at three if I had really like put my mind to it.

2409
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:21,100
But then four was like every day we were doing stuff, so didn't have time.

2410
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:34,100
Yeah, the idea of an RPG system, I would want it to be like very simple if I were to make a rule set.

2411
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:38,100
Like something like, oh, Problem Sleuth, it has Vim and...

2412
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,100
Yeah.

2413
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:45,100
Oh, just a simple game system, you know, like the one in Problem Sleuth.

2414
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,100
Yeah, well, you know.

2415
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,100
Yeah.

2416
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:58,100
I mean, honestly, if you're interested, you should download yourself a PDF copy of like the fifth edition player's handbook

2417
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:02,100
and just like read through it and see like what's normal.

2418
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:03,100
Get some ideas.

2419
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:06,100
Yeah, that, honestly, fifth edition is good.

2420
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:09,100
Fifth edition is like way simpler than fourth.

2421
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,100
Fourth edition was a nightmare.

2422
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,100
Third edition was also a nightmare, but in its own way.

2423
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:20,100
Fifth edition, they really kind of made it a lot more approachable and I think it's good.

2424
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:24,100
And you should read it just to get an idea of like what the baseline, right?

2425
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:30,100
Because that's kind of like the entry point for most people getting into tabletop stuff is D&D.

2426
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,100
And we're still on fifth edition, right?

2427
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,100
They haven't made a new one.

2428
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,100
I have no idea.

2429
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:48,100
I've heard terms like fifth edition, first edition, and I guess like, oh, it's a rulebook and they update it, whoever they are.

2430
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,100
Yeah.

2431
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,100
Well, I never...

2432
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:54,100
No, no, I did play second edition once.

2433
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:59,100
The first time I ever played D&D was like right at the end of second edition.

2434
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,100
The second edition was coming out.

2435
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:07,100
Second edition had Thacko, which was a basically...

2436
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:18,100
They had a very counterintuitive system where to hit an enemy with an attack, you would roll with this number called the Thacko.

2437
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,100
But Thacko was like, you wanted your Thacko to be low.

2438
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:29,100
You wanted your Thacko to be low and the enemy's armor class to be also low, I think?

2439
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,100
What does Thacko mean?

2440
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:32,100
Is it an acronym?

2441
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:36,100
Yes, it stood for two hit armor class zero.

2442
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:46,100
And so if your enemy's armor class was zero and your Thacko was a three, you would roll a 20-sided die and you would have to roll a three or under.

2443
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:50,100
No, a three or over to hit armor class zero.

2444
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,100
And so if their armor class was higher, you would have to roll higher to hit.

2445
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,100
And that's why it was...

2446
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,100
Yeah, like that.

2447
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:04,100
Then third edition, they changed it and now it's like you have an attack bonus and they have an armor class.

2448
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:11,100
And now you just roll a d20 and add your attack bonus and you compare the number to their armor class and not to be determined if they hit.

2449
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:21,100
But third edition had a hugely expanded roster of skills.

2450
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:27,100
I think the skill system was the thing that they sort of exploded in third edition.

2451
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:31,100
And they kept adding on more and more rules erratic to it.

2452
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:40,100
They kept adding an infinite number of prestige classes that you needed to meet certain requirements in order to multi-class into.

2453
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:55,100
And basically anyone could make their own fucking prestige class and the expanded rule set became incomprehensibly complicated.

2454
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:00,100
Fourth edition, they tried to make it simpler by like...

2455
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:06,100
Instead of having all these sort of uncategorized things that different character classes could do,

2456
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:13,100
every character class would have a set of things that were very comparable to each other.

2457
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:22,100
A wizard had a basic attack they could do and they had a once per battle effect they could do and they had a once per day effect they could do.

2458
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:25,100
And a fighter would similarly have all those things.

2459
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,100
And it felt very...

2460
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:31,100
It was very World of Warcraft, it was very MMO.

2461
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,100
And it kind of didn't feel like D&D.

2462
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:42,100
And then fifth edition is basically it's more like third edition, but I think they pared it down and they made it more approachable.

2463
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,100
And they think they were like...

2464
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,100
I don't know, I've only played a little bit of fifth edition.

2465
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:57,100
I think there are prestige classes, but there's like the rules around them are a little bit more like basic and like you can't just fucking do any stupid thing you want with them.

2466
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,100
I don't know, I'm not an expert.

2467
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,100
So it's the player's handbook I would need to read.

2468
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:09,100
The player's handbook is the basic thing that is like how do you play the game?

2469
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:14,100
If you wanted to DM, you would also want to get the Dungeon Masters guide.

2470
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:20,100
And then the third core rulebook is the monster manual, which is like...

2471
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:26,100
You don't really need that if you're a player, but if you're a DM and you want to make encounters,

2472
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:33,100
you would generally want to have the monster manual as like the thing to populate combat encounters with.

2473
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,100
I see.

2474
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:41,100
I would probably want to make my own things.

2475
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:47,100
It would be like a Gip Core version of Dungeons & Dragons, but I will maybe read.

2476
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,100
You can do that.

2477
01:42:50,100 --> 01:43:05,100
The monster manual has rules for creatures that are like appropriate challenge levels to like the character class levels with the players you're playing with, you know?

2478
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,100
You could...

2479
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,100
The monster manual exists to give you like a...

2480
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:14,100
Okay, I have a party of sixth level adventurers.

2481
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:20,100
All right, what is an appropriate thing to have them face off against?

2482
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:24,100
You could re-skin a monster in the monster manual if you wanted to.

2483
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:28,100
You wouldn't have to describe it the way it's described in the book.

2484
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:41,100
I'm trying to imagine, damn, I think it would be basically impossible to like design...

2485
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:55,100
The monster manual, it explains like how challenge ratings are calculated and like how a monster is constructed in order to be an appropriate challenge for a party.

2486
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
So, I don't know.

2487
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:02,100
Trying to make like combat encounters without something like that would be...

2488
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:05,100
You would be shooting completely blind.

2489
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,100
Sure.

2490
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:21,100
I just feel like the general theme of Dungeons & Dragons with fantasy like elves and magician people and gold and caverns.

2491
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:35,100
It's like a very, we know what that is thing, but the player dungeon master like dynamic can be applied to different types of things.

2492
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:41,100
I mean, I know that that has already happened, but like it doesn't need to be a combat heavy adventure.

2493
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,100
Oh, I mean, yeah.

2494
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,100
And the adventures do not have combat.

2495
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:48,100
It could just be like wild and wacky and you meet weirdos, evil gremlins.

2496
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:49,100
Yeah, that's true.

2497
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:50,100
That's true.

2498
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:57,100
Combat is like the cornerstone of many video games and games in general.

2499
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,100
D&D doesn't have to be.

2500
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:06,100
The D&D ruleset, yeah, the D&D ruleset is mostly designed to facilitate combat.

2501
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:11,100
Like it's sort of built under the assumption that that's like sort of the main gameplay loop.

2502
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:17,100
But I mean, it does have like skill systems and things that are...

2503
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:25,100
It can accommodate non-combat scenarios.

2504
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:29,100
Is it necessarily the best and most robust system for non-combat scenarios?

2505
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,100
Maybe not, but I mean the...

2506
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:37,100
I just like the dynamic, like I build a world and like, hey, come play in my world.

2507
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:40,100
It's kind of like building a map in a video game.

2508
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,100
Yeah, sure, sure.

2509
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:50,100
Making a Minecraft challenge run map or a puzzle map and then watching people play it.

2510
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:54,100
I guess just making a game of watching people play it in general is the sort of feeling.

2511
01:45:54,100 --> 01:46:08,100
How would you feel if you made a campaign or you made an adventure and then your players just started to play it

2512
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:13,100
and then they just like ignored the main objective.

2513
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:16,100
They just started fucking around.

2514
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:22,100
If I was unprepared, then I would feel a little silly, a little stupid,

2515
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:26,100
because like they're doing these things and I'm like, I have to make stuff up.

2516
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:32,100
Classic scenario, the DM has like an adventure bit made where they're like,

2517
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:42,100
okay, in this adventure, the adventurers will have to rescue the barmaid's daughter from a local kobold den that has kidnapped her.

2518
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:46,100
And then they say, we don't care, let's join the kobolds or whatever.

2519
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:51,100
You start it and it's like, you start in the tavern, are there any wenches in the tavern?

2520
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,100
I'm going to go hit on the wenches.

2521
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:57,100
I'm going to get into a drinking contest with this orc over here.

2522
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:05,100
Oh, I'm going to just light the place on fire because I'm chaotic evil black guard and I just do evil things just to fuck things up.

2523
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:13,100
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm sure when you do that, you don't tell the players, here's the adventure.

2524
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:21,100
You say like you enter a tavern and there's these things described and so you put things in there that they might be interested in.

2525
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:31,100
Maybe if you want to force it, like somebody smashes down the door and starts shooting and then there's like a combat encounter that forces them into it.

2526
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:38,100
It's the same way you would construct the inciting incident for a character in a fiction of any kind.

2527
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:47,100
It's like if you just let the character exist and nothing interrupts their normal life, then they're not going to have an inciting incident.

2528
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,100
You have to introduce it.

2529
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,100
You know what?

2530
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,100
So you would introduce it the same way.

2531
01:47:51,100 --> 01:48:07,100
That scenario I just described, the DM has failed by counting on like, oh, yeah, I just got a hope that my players will start a conversation with him and ask him like, hey, are there any adventures to go on?

2532
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,100
And he'll say, yeah, my daughter's got kidnapped, actually.

2533
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:15,100
It's such a weird thing that that's in so many...

2534
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:21,100
I mean, I know it's ingrained in like, we know that games do that and that's like a thing.

2535
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:22,100
It's a trope.

2536
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:27,100
But like, why would you go to the barkeeper and ask if there's some adventure to happen?

2537
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,100
Yeah.

2538
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,100
I need a quest.

2539
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:30,100
Who talks like that?

2540
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,100
Who would need a quest?

2541
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:36,100
What sort of a weirdo do you need to be to like actually want to go questing?

2542
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,100
I mean, maybe the party paladin.

2543
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,100
Unless you know you're playing a video game.

2544
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,100
Yeah.

2545
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:47,100
And in a video game, like it's like, okay, there's only one thing I can do.

2546
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:57,100
Like the ultimate situation is that you build a world and then the players are actors and they act how they would act or whatever the player would act.

2547
01:48:57,100 --> 01:49:00,100
And it doesn't necessarily mean matter that they're...

2548
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,100
I don't know.

2549
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:07,100
I mean, it would require like good faith responses on the part of all the players.

2550
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:08,100
Even in a video game.

2551
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:09,100
That would be the ideal.

2552
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,100
Even in a video game, if you give the player too much freedom, they'll ignore your quest.

2553
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:19,100
Like that's why like instead of like doing the campaign and like Grand Theft Auto, you know, people would just grab a rocket launch.

2554
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:20,100
I close.

2555
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,100
Yeah.

2556
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,100
I close car pile ups.

2557
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,100
Yeah.

2558
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:25,100
That's the game.

2559
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,100
That's the game.

2560
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,100
That can be the game.

2561
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:31,100
All right.

2562
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:40,100
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is that the world DMing a campaign is a cruel mistress.

2563
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:45,100
It's a deep rabbit hole that will chew you up and spit you out and ruin your life.

2564
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,100
Well, I can start small.

2565
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,100
But you got to do it.

2566
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:52,100
Nevertheless, you must do it.

2567
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,100
Okay.

2568
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,100
Yeah.

2569
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,100
Interesting.

2570
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:06,100
But I mean, hey, I'm here to advise if you want, if you want, I don't know, input on anything to do with that.

2571
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:09,100
Because I've done, I've done a lot of it before.

2572
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,100
I'll read those books and I'll get back to you.

2573
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:14,100
Definitely.

2574
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,100
Definitely read those books in particular.

2575
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:33,100
The player's handbook just just to just to get an idea of like what the game is and what the like baseline concept of like a tabletop role playing RPG looks like.

2576
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,100
They should have called it bloodins and daggers.

2577
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,100
That's way cooler.

2578
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:45,100
That's like a that's like the no role playing like combat only like tabletop mini.

2579
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:47,100
Yeah, version of it.

2580
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,100
Yeah.

2581
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,100
You're in the blood pits.

2582
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,100
You got to fight your way out.

2583
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,100
Bloodins and daggers.

2584
01:50:58,100 --> 01:50:59,100
Shit.

2585
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:00,100
What's up?

2586
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:03,100
Goldrums and black guards.

2587
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:04,100
There's too many.

2588
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,100
There's too many you could make.

2589
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,100
Black guard.

2590
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:11,100
Black guard.

2591
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:14,100
I think I said black guard before, but I meant black guard.

2592
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:15,100
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2593
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:16,100
Is it spelled black guard?

2594
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:17,100
Yes.

2595
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,100
Yes.

2596
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:25,100
It's in the opposite of a paladin is a black guard and I grew up thinking it was said black guard because it's spelled black guard.

2597
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:31,100
But no, it's actually pronounced blaggard, but you would you would never know that from reading it.

2598
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,100
Never.

2599
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:35,100
Yeah, I've never I guess I'd never read it before.

2600
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:36,100
I've only heard it.

2601
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,100
Have you heard it as black guard or blaggard?

2602
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,100
Blaggard.

2603
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:43,100
I didn't know it was like a guard.

2604
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,100
Yes.

2605
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:47,100
It's spelled B-L-A-C-K-G-U-A-R-D.

2606
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:54,100
It's like it's like I've heard it in like scenarios like where it's like used as an insult.

2607
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,100
Oh, black guard, like waste rule.

2608
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:58,100
I mean, I ruffian.

2609
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,100
I've never seen it used that way.

2610
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:09,100
The only context I've ever read it in is in the context of reading up on the prestige class called black guard in or blaggard in the dungeon master's guide in third edition.

2611
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:13,100
So like, why would I know how it's pronounced?

2612
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,100
A scoundrel.

2613
01:52:16,100 --> 01:52:22,100
A man who uses foul language in front of a woman, scoundrel, unprincipled, contemptible.

2614
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:25,100
I guess it makes sense that it would be like the opposite of a paladin.

2615
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:26,100
It's funny.

2616
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:29,100
Yeah, it means like villain or ruffian or something.

2617
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:33,100
In D&D, it's more like it's like a dark knight.

2618
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:36,100
It sort of has a more like, yeah.

2619
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:42,100
It has a more sort of noble connotation in D&D.

2620
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:45,100
Yeah, it's like a sort of a high status thing.

2621
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:48,100
But the word is like the word where it comes from.

2622
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:52,100
It's like it's like a lowly sort of despicable thing.

2623
01:52:54,100 --> 01:53:00,100
Whereas, you know, dark knight is more like, oh, he's, oh, he's, oh, he's dark.

2624
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:02,100
He might be dark, but he's still a knight though.

2625
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,100
Somebody knighted him.

2626
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:07,100
Someone, some king, some, some dark king somewhere.

2627
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:08,100
Some shit king.

2628
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,100
Conferred some honor upon him.

2629
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:16,100
Do you want to jump to voicemails?

2630
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:17,100
Yes.

2631
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:19,100
Let's, okay.

2632
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:26,100
Well, let's, you want to look at these ones that Oblivionfall generously agreed to.

2633
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:30,100
So let's start with an ultimatum from Joshua Moon.

2634
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:33,100
I assume it goes on to say owner of Kiwi Farms.

2635
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,100
All right.

2636
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,100
Three, two, one, go.

2637
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:41,100
I bet you my ass is fatter and more people are going to look at me if I show my ass in public than you.

2638
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,100
Thoughts.

2639
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:49,100
I would say.

2640
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,100
Do you agree?

2641
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:53,100
I got it.

2642
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,100
I don't know.

2643
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:55,100
I just don't know.

2644
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,100
I don't, I don't know what his ass is like.

2645
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,100
I've never seen it.

2646
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,100
No.

2647
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:01,100
So.

2648
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,100
Never seen him.

2649
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:03,100
I don't even know.

2650
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,100
I'm flying blind here.

2651
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:07,100
But I'm going to say no way.

2652
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:08,100
I got the fatter ass.

2653
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:12,100
Everyone's going to look at me and nobody's going to look at you.

2654
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:14,100
So don't even bother showing your ass.

2655
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:15,100
Idiot.

2656
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,100
All right.

2657
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:23,100
Next one is called fiveheadbensaint.mull.mp3.

2658
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:26,100
There's also an imager above it.

2659
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:27,100
Yeah.

2660
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:28,100
Let's look at the.

2661
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:29,100
That's from Bronycon.

2662
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:30,100
That's from Bronycon.

2663
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,100
The last Bronycon, I believe.

2664
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,100
I mean.

2665
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:34,100
Yeah.

2666
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,100
You didn't have, yeah.

2667
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:36,100
You had the.

2668
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,100
That's when I had the pink hair.

2669
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:38,100
The pink hair.

2670
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,100
I mean.

2671
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:40,100
That's all right.

2672
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:41,100
That's fine.

2673
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:46,100
The fucking, that, that convention center is a liminal space for sure.

2674
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:49,100
Oh, that room, that big room.

2675
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:51,100
That huge endless carpet.

2676
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:55,100
That, that, that, that big room is a liminal space for sure.

2677
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:56,100
Yeah.

2678
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,100
That place is in the back rooms.

2679
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,100
That's what it's called, right?

2680
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:01,100
The like.

2681
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:02,100
Yeah.

2682
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,100
The back rooms.

2683
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:07,100
Um, when I say that, I think of the backyard from Guilty Gear.

2684
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:13,100
I wonder if, damn, I wonder if my video will be out by the time this episode releases.

2685
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:17,100
It's not impossible, but I don't want to guarantee it either.

2686
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:21,100
Never make any promises ever.

2687
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,100
True.

2688
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,100
Okay.

2689
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:24,100
Uh, so.

2690
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:25,100
Uh, the voicemail.

2691
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:26,100
Yeah.

2692
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,100
F-bensaint fivehead.

2693
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:28,100
Okay.

2694
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,100
Three, two, one, go.

2695
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,100
It's so beautiful.

2696
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:32,100
Damn.

2697
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:34,100
Look at my fucking show here.

2698
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:35,100
Fuck.

2699
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:39,100
Well, now I'm, well now I'm, now I'm all head.

2700
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:41,100
I shaved and now I'm all head.

2701
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,100
So get, get owned.

2702
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,100
Your forehead, your back head.

2703
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,100
Side head.

2704
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,100
Side head, top head, bottom head.

2705
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:52,100
What's bottom head?

2706
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:57,100
Is it like the, the right of the back at the, like, what do you, what do you call it, the cranium?

2707
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:01,100
The bat, the bottom head is secret hidden head that you only get.

2708
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,100
Oh, it's, it's inside the skull.

2709
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,100
Yeah.

2710
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,100
Yeah.

2711
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,100
Yeah.

2712
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:07,100
It's precious.

2713
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:08,100
Rare and precious.

2714
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,100
Next one is called.

2715
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:15,100
Oh, Mentos trio who three, two, one, go.

2716
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:19,100
Oh, man.

2717
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,100
It's been so many years.

2718
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,100
Please.

2719
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:25,100
Who the fuck was the Mentos trio?

2720
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:27,100
Please repeat it.

2721
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,100
Do it.

2722
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:30,100
I've explained this before.

2723
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:35,100
I've explained the Mentos trio before, haven't I?

2724
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,100
I don't remember.

2725
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:38,100
Well, okay.

2726
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:41,100
I've never, I don't think I've ever heard Mentos trio before.

2727
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:43,100
I've definitely mentioned it.

2728
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:44,100
Okay.

2729
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:46,100
Well, I don't remember.

2730
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:47,100
Yeah.

2731
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,100
Why wouldn't I, why would I mention it and then not explain it?

2732
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,100
Did I say I was going to make it like a patreon thing?

2733
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,100
I don't remember.

2734
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:53,100
No.

2735
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,100
Okay.

2736
01:56:54,100 --> 01:57:02,100
Um, it was, well, when I was in like middle school, when I was, you know, a young teen,

2737
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:08,100
uh, 12 or 13 or so, I would, there was this summer program that my parents would send

2738
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:11,100
me to, it was called college academy.

2739
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,100
And this is where I learned to play D&D because one of, it was sort of like, it was sort of

2740
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:19,100
like a mock college thing for like younger kids where you would, you would sign up for

2741
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,100
quote unquote classes.

2742
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,100
I mean, they were classes, but some of them were.

2743
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:24,100
You know, they were fun.

2744
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:28,100
They were things like rocketry where like you would make a little model rocket.

2745
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:31,100
There was one, um, there was one where you would just play D&D.

2746
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:35,100
And that's, and that was where I played second edition D&D the first time.

2747
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:43,100
Uh, so there was, uh, anyway, on the bus ride to college academy, there were these slightly

2748
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,100
older kids.

2749
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,100
I've definitely explained this, but I'll explain it again.

2750
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:50,100
There were these kids that were like slightly older than me and they had this thing that

2751
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:57,100
they would do and they would buy Mentos before every, uh, bus ride and then they would wait

2752
01:57:57,100 --> 01:58:02,100
until the bus came to a stop and then they would, they had this piece of paper that they

2753
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:07,100
would write Mentos the Freshmaker on and they would like slam it against the window in the

2754
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:11,100
back of the bus and they would hold their Mentos out and they would give thumbs up like,

2755
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:17,100
like someone freeze framing in a Mentos commercial and they would just pose with the sign that

2756
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,100
says Mentos the Freshmaker.

2757
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:21,100
They'd be like thumbs up like, yeah, holding their Mentos.

2758
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:27,100
And they would just see what the, what the person in the car behind the bus would do

2759
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,100
in response to this.

2760
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,100
Oh, I see.

2761
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:32,100
I thought they were doing it to the rest of the bus.

2762
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:36,100
No, no, to the, to the, to the person in the car behind us.

2763
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:37,100
And that was it.

2764
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:43,100
It was just these three kids that would do this thing on the bus to college academy.

2765
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:48,100
And, uh, I, I joined, I joined them one year because like one of them graduated and so

2766
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,100
they needed a new member and I, there, there must always be a Mentos trio.

2767
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:53,100
There must always be a Mentos trio.

2768
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:59,100
Like when one, yeah, basically one graduates and someone else has to step up and take their

2769
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:00,100
place.

2770
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,100
And it got to be me for a little bit there.

2771
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:07,100
I wonder if I took it very seriously.

2772
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:08,100
Hmm.

2773
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:11,100
You wonder if I said, I wonder, uh, yeah, I wonder if it survives.

2774
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:14,100
Like if, if, if somebody replaced you.

2775
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:19,100
I doubt it because it was, I think, I think it was the brainchild of like one particular

2776
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:24,100
guy who had a very particular, uh, sense of humor.

2777
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:30,100
And I think that probably with him gone, maybe I carried on the legacy for a little bit, but

2778
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:33,100
I sincerely doubt that it discontinued.

2779
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:37,100
I don't know if college academy even exists anymore.

2780
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:40,100
Let me find out.

2781
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:44,100
I thought you were going to Google like Mentos trio.

2782
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,100
They got a website now.

2783
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:48,100
They're a multi-billion dollar franchise.

2784
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:55,100
Um, oh my God, it's been going for 43 years.

2785
01:59:55,100 --> 02:00:00,100
Um, well, the website still exists.

2786
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,100
So yeah.

2787
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:06,100
Yeah, there's, there's, there's a, there's a version for younger kids called college gate

2788
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:09,100
and there's a version for slightly older kids called college academy.

2789
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:10,100
I didn't do college gate.

2790
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:13,100
I just started the college academy.

2791
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:14,100
Man, those are good times.

2792
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:19,100
Those are some of my like, the funnest memories from being a kid or from college academy.

2793
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:21,100
That shit ruled.

2794
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:23,100
It was only for like three weeks out of the summer.

2795
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:26,100
I wanted it to go all summer.

2796
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,100
Ugh, good times.

2797
02:00:28,100 --> 02:00:31,100
Good times, uh, back in the day.

2798
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:32,100
Okay.

2799
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:35,100
Anyway, that's, that's your explanation, voicemailer.

2800
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:40,100
Uh, next one is called who, when, why three, two, one, go.

2801
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:43,100
What am I fighting for?

2802
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:50,100
The real question is where?

2803
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:53,100
Where am I fighting for?

2804
02:00:53,100 --> 02:01:03,100
Well, he was fighting for earth because it was, well, I guess he was fighting against

2805
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:09,100
uh, Repliforce, which was on a, had retreated to like a space station, I guess.

2806
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:11,100
So, yeah.

2807
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:14,100
No, it doesn't really work.

2808
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:16,100
Sorry.

2809
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:20,100
You know, he's a, he's a, he's a global fellow.

2810
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:21,100
He's a globalist.

2811
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:22,100
He's a globalist.

2812
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:24,100
He's a, he's not fighting for any particular place.

2813
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:26,100
He's fighting for all of humanity.

2814
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:31,100
All of humanity was put in risk by the, by the, by the coup that Repliforce was trying

2815
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:32,100
to pull off.

2816
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:35,100
It wasn't about like the nations or locations.

2817
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:36,100
Yeah.

2818
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:39,100
The answer to the question of where is everywhere, anywhere, anytime.

2819
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:41,100
I'll fight.

2820
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:43,100
I'll fight anyone.

2821
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,100
That's, that's right.

2822
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:46,100
That's right.

2823
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,100
Um, next one is called Requiem for a Meme.

2824
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:53,100
Three, two, one, go.

2825
02:01:53,100 --> 02:02:01,100
Actually didn't realize there was a 90 second rule before I decided to send this little

2826
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:02,100
voicemail.

2827
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:11,100
Otherwise, this would have been a much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much,

2828
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:22,100
much, much, much, much longer and in detailed story about my ex-girlfriend.

2829
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,100
Okay.

2830
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:30,100
But I'll just get to the important part, which is my ex-girlfriend is fucking.

2831
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:32,100
I don't know why.

2832
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:34,100
You know, Jesus.

2833
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:36,100
This is creepy.

2834
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:39,100
It's, it's quite a bit of drama.

2835
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:44,100
So tell me procrastinators because, you know, you guys seem to be geniuses when it comes

2836
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,100
to women clear on a year.

2837
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:49,100
Undisputed kings of dealing with femininity.

2838
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:55,100
So I didn't catch that.

2839
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:56,100
I don't know.

2840
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:57,100
I don't know.

2841
02:02:57,100 --> 02:02:58,100
I didn't catch the question.

2842
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:03,100
I don't know what to say, but thanks, thanks for the voicemail anyway.

2843
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:08,100
Was that somebody else's voicemail that this guy just chopped and, chopped and screwed?

2844
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:15,100
No, it seems like it was part, like part of the, the bit was that it was like, oh, it's

2845
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:18,100
a generic thing, but it's fucked up audibly.

2846
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,100
Pretty fucked up.

2847
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,100
All right.

2848
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,100
The next one.

2849
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,100
Okay.

2850
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,100
We got from Prince isolation.

2851
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:28,100
We've got another slime times weekend update parts one and two.

2852
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:34,100
So let's do part one, three, two, one, go.

2853
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,100
Are we back?

2854
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:38,100
We're back baby weeks.

2855
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:39,100
Okay.

2856
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:43,100
We're back with the slime times weekend update.

2857
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:45,100
A lot has happened.

2858
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:47,100
Where shall we begin?

2859
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:48,100
All right.

2860
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:53,100
Rowdy elections were concluded and the new rowdy ring leaders are mischief night and anthropomorphic

2861
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:54,100
bunny.

2862
02:03:54,100 --> 02:04:00,100
Demodunk, a janitor made of crystal and yours truly, a demon prince with dashing looks and

2863
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,100
no grain to speak of.

2864
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,100
He's made of crystal.

2865
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:07,100
I shall thus be serving a second term through no political maneuvering or dig riding whatsoever.

2866
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,100
Good.

2867
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,100
In other news, love to hear it.

2868
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:15,100
Shoko held a slime or tournament for the whole community of which rowdy olive was the final

2869
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:16,100
winner.

2870
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:19,100
And the second one is happening within an hour of this recording.

2871
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:22,100
The reward one receives a snazzy looking metal.

2872
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:27,100
Some updates to the city include a natural disasters, including media showers, firestorms

2873
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:33,100
and tornadoes and a new update, which has some missile launches as weapons and free

2874
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:35,100
apples at the candy store.

2875
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:39,100
They kill you because Demodunk is a green witch apparently.

2876
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:40,100
All right.

2877
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:42,100
See you in part two.

2878
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:50,100
Well, I don't know how I feel about the only newspaper about the talks about the slime

2879
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:54,100
in Nalakakam being elected.

2880
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:58,100
It sort of feels like you could abuse that position.

2881
02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:05,100
Well, I mean, Prince was doing slime times before the elections.

2882
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:12,100
I mean, no, I think there is a rowdy bias in the reporting.

2883
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:17,100
There's potential here for major scandals to be covered up.

2884
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:22,100
The way that you counter that is with the free market.

2885
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:26,100
There's a demand for the other side of the aisle.

2886
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:32,100
There's a demand for killer reporting, a killer slant on the news to oppose this mainstream

2887
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,100
media.

2888
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:36,100
Cuck shit.

2889
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:42,100
That's cool that they're having slime oil tournaments.

2890
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:44,100
Remember when I made slime oil?

2891
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:48,100
Remember when I crafted them out of numbers and my brain?

2892
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,100
I do.

2893
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:52,100
Yeah, me too.

2894
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,100
They're still going.

2895
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,100
How cool is that?

2896
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:59,100
Anyway, part two, three, two, one, go.

2897
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:03,100
Then finally, the terrible news I must bring you all today.

2898
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:09,100
Several weeks ago by now, janitor and rowdy ringleader Demodunk used a new fun command,

2899
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:13,100
beat killer Ebola spread in gang violence.

2900
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:18,100
With it, he was able to turn the normal commands into fun commands, which Ebola was unable

2901
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:21,100
to use for lack of understanding of fun.

2902
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:26,100
Demodunk, having had prior knowledge of fun, thus gained an unfair advantage in the eyes

2903
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:29,100
of many and was ultimately arrested of his own volition.

2904
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:34,100
Still, this arrest could not quell the bloodlust of the disgruntled masses.

2905
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:38,100
Fun was ultimately removed from the game.

2906
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:40,100
That's right, dear listeners.

2907
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:43,100
Fun is officially known as a part of endless war.

2908
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:47,100
Strangely, no one has seemingly noticed any significant difference.

2909
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,100
No fun allowed.

2910
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,100
Well, that's it for this week.

2911
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:53,100
And remember, the slime time is the best time.

2912
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:56,100
But most certainly not a fun time.

2913
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:59,100
I can't believe they banned fun from endless war.

2914
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,100
And it's so cringe.

2915
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:04,100
It's the image.

2916
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:05,100
No.

2917
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:07,100
Yeah, no.

2918
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:10,100
Are those guys from like Battlestar Galactica?

2919
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:14,100
No, I think this is from the Sonic comic comic book.

2920
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,100
Oh, yeah.

2921
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:18,100
They're like, we're evil and Dr. Eggman robots.

2922
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:19,100
No fun allowed.

2923
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:21,100
Oh, what the fuck?

2924
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:23,100
I'm sorry.

2925
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:31,100
Did I mention that I the killer kingpin, the cop killer himself died in endless war

2926
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:36,100
because I tried to I tried to have fun without having a fun pizza.

2927
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,100
You were tricked into it as far as I remember.

2928
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:41,100
I was I was duped.

2929
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:44,100
I think it was Demedunk that duped me.

2930
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:46,100
Fucking dead.

2931
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:47,100
Fucking dead.

2932
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:51,100
The economies and shambles.

2933
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,100
Well, you know what?

2934
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:55,100
Honestly, after that, I got to say I'm glad fun was banned.

2935
02:07:55,100 --> 02:08:00,100
I think it was it's probably best for the game to not have not allow it honestly.

2936
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,100
So good.

2937
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:02,100
Good job, everyone.

2938
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,100
The system works.

2939
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,100
Base.

2940
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:13,100
Okay, those are the those are all the messages that were sent to oblivion's temporary side voicemail.

2941
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:19,100
Again, the regular voicemail box is in theory operational again.

2942
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,100
So let me just see what we got.

2943
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,100
Let's see what we got over there.

2944
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,100
Speak pipe.

2945
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:25,100
Okay.

2946
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:31,100
Well, there's yeah, I think the first one is Ben's weekly reminder play delta room chapter two.

2947
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:32,100
Okay.

2948
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:35,100
Then Ben's weekly reminder catch up on one piece.

2949
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:36,100
Okay.

2950
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:38,100
Then no voicemail, no watch.

2951
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,100
Okay.

2952
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:45,100
The first real one is new voicemail contest.

2953
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:49,100
So three, two, one, go.

2954
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:51,100
Hey, I've got a fun new event.

2955
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:54,100
It's the PCP typing competition.

2956
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:00,100
He's winning.

2957
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:03,100
Oh, my God, he's typed so much.

2958
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:08,100
Dude, what are your what are your what are your WPMs on that shit, bro?

2959
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:10,100
It's like NaNoWriMo.

2960
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:11,100
Bro.

2961
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:16,100
He's going for it.

2962
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:18,100
He's going to break the world record.

2963
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:20,100
That's it.

2964
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,100
All right.

2965
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:27,100
If you can clickity click further down the track, you win.

2966
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,100
Mm-hmm.

2967
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:29,100
Mm-hmm.

2968
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,100
I don't think anyone's going to beat that.

2969
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:33,100
I'm just I'm just going to post.

2970
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:36,100
This is this is the one we just listened to.

2971
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:39,100
The next one is.

2972
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,100
Two immature links.

2973
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,100
It's two imager links.

2974
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:48,100
I was from Prince Annihilation at finallyback.com.

2975
02:09:48,100 --> 02:09:50,100
The first one doesn't work.

2976
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:55,100
Yeah, it looks like it's cut off.

2977
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:58,100
I think it doesn't have enough letters.

2978
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,100
Oh, well.

2979
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:00,100
Sorry about that.

2980
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:01,100
But the second one.

2981
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:02,100
Let's try the second one.

2982
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,100
Second one works.

2983
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:10,100
Fun.

2984
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,100
Fun.

2985
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:12,100
Gun.

2986
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,100
Why does no one fun?

2987
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,100
So true.

2988
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:20,100
So true.

2989
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,100
Let me post the.

2990
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Yeah.

2991
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,100
Damn.

2992
02:10:24,100 --> 02:10:27,100
It really it really do be like that is all I can say.

2993
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,100
The next one is.

2994
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:35,100
Oh, I think this is more Vinny stuff.

2995
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,100
Right.

2996
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:38,100
Vinny stuff killed the podcast last.

2997
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,100
Killed the podcast.

2998
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:41,100
So we literally killed the podcast.

2999
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:45,100
Is there a way to tell whether this will do the same thing?

3000
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:46,100
Well, you know what?

3001
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:47,100
We just won't.

3002
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:50,100
We just won't post the link.

3003
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:52,100
We just won't just don't link it in the description.

3004
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,100
Okay.

3005
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:55,100
Put on the screen though.

3006
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:56,100
Yeah.

3007
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:59,100
Unless it's too much.

3008
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:02,100
The last one was it was like.

3009
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:03,100
Oh my God.

3010
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:04,100
Yeah, it's too much.

3011
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:07,100
Oh, the last one was marked like mature content.

3012
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,100
Like you had to like click like.

3013
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:10,100
Yes.

3014
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:11,100
To see it.

3015
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:13,100
If you're like, are you 18 plus?

3016
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,100
I see.

3017
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:18,100
That was probably what caught the thing.

3018
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:19,100
There's a.

3019
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:20,100
Yeah.

3020
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:22,100
I think it was like auto.

3021
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:23,100
Oh my God.

3022
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:24,100
Okay.

3023
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:25,100
There's a lot of these.

3024
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,100
I'm afraid to stand pie in your eye.

3025
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,100
No reference pic.

3026
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:33,100
Is this just what he assumes cheesy looks like?

3027
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,100
Yeah.

3028
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:37,100
Why is he got like Zorro hair?

3029
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,100
He doesn't have like Zorro hair.

3030
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,100
He has a gap in his teeth.

3031
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:43,100
It's hard to make it.

3032
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:45,100
Look good in.

3033
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:49,100
Wait, is this the stand or is this the or is this cheesy?

3034
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,100
Cheesy.

3035
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:53,100
Cheesy has images of themselves.

3036
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,100
Yeah.

3037
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:56,100
You could you could find it quite easily.

3038
02:11:56,100 --> 02:11:58,100
I'm so maybe.

3039
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:00,100
Okay.

3040
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:07,100
Pie in your eye pie in your eye activates on contact with flesh or most effectively when in contact with your eyes when the car is affected.

3041
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:09,100
The perception is warped into a hallucinated reality.

3042
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:12,100
The affected reality differs from person to person.

3043
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:16,100
The hallucinations can be manipulated or controlled by cheesy and his stand pie in your eye.

3044
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,100
There was no reference pic for the first dude.

3045
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:23,100
I drew but the rest of their favorite based on the guy and his music album covers who.

3046
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:25,100
Okay.

3047
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Next one is.

3048
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:32,100
I believe in Ben the continuation of the FLCL thing.

3049
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:33,100
I think this is.

3050
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:36,100
Oh, this is Nate as a Camon.

3051
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:39,100
Hey, Ben gasp.

3052
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:40,100
Uh-huh.

3053
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:41,100
Sorry guys.

3054
02:12:41,100 --> 02:12:44,100
I got carried away with the Fully Cooley episode five scene.

3055
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:47,100
I came to proposition give and take for.

3056
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:52,100
I love this face.

3057
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:56,100
I don't know why but this panel is reminding me of Rugrats for some reason.

3058
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:58,100
Rugrats, huh?

3059
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,100
Don't know why.

3060
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:02,100
I look so miserable.

3061
02:13:02,100 --> 02:13:05,100
Conclusion to the Fully Cooley episode five scene.

3062
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:12,100
Hey, Eleazar, maybe just put a sense of our overgives thick clappers in that first panel.

3063
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:13,100
Don't call them that.

3064
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:15,100
Sorry for giving you so much work to do.

3065
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:18,100
Oh, and then.

3066
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,100
Okay.

3067
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:21,100
So this is not the conclusion because then it continues.

3068
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:23,100
Ben, we will duel for give and takes honor.

3069
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:25,100
The winner will have a podcast.

3070
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:27,100
With her.

3071
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,100
I'm game.

3072
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,100
Game.

3073
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,100
That's why I sell for it.

3074
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:32,100
Fully.

3075
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,100
It's Hariko.

3076
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:34,100
Oh, yeah.

3077
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,100
Give and takes on.

3078
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,100
Here's my podcast.

3079
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:38,100
It's all for you.

3080
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:43,100
Never in a million years will you ever get anything for me for the but full of lead.

3081
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,100
That's not in here.

3082
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:48,100
But I mean, yeah, this is the scene.

3083
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:50,100
Wait, look at the top right.

3084
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:52,100
This is drawn on like some.

3085
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:55,100
Yeah, it's like a like a schedule of something.

3086
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:57,100
It's got old steps.

3087
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:59,100
So let's go parameter.

3088
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:00,100
Critical parameter.

3089
02:14:00,100 --> 02:14:01,100
Critical parameter.

3090
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:03,100
I thought this was like some astronomy stuff or something.

3091
02:14:03,100 --> 02:14:04,100
Yeah, yeah.

3092
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:07,100
I mean, Lamal, it ends there.

3093
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,100
I'm not drawing out the rest.

3094
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:10,100
No.

3095
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:13,100
You don't have to draw the entire episode.

3096
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:16,100
The rest of the episode where in Haruku.

3097
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:17,100
Haraku.

3098
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:19,100
Why does he spell it like that?

3099
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:22,100
Flies around in a bunny outfit and kills a big guy in a trench coat.

3100
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:26,100
Imagine Given taking a bunny outfit being all sexy, but no, but not for me.

3101
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:30,100
My formerly innocent hands shall not be partaking in the making sexy images of Given.

3102
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:32,100
No matter how.

3103
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:35,100
I really saw it as a Tee hee.

3104
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:37,100
Ha ha to have behind closed discord groups.

3105
02:14:37,100 --> 02:14:44,100
But Ben had to have Given take sexy butt cheeks drawn as his favorite anime and also be shown to his impressionable YouTube audience.

3106
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:46,100
Tisk, Tisk, I say to you.

3107
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:47,100
Ben saying.

3108
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:51,100
Wait, is he saying that you asked him to draw this?

3109
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:53,100
He's not.

3110
02:14:53,100 --> 02:15:02,100
I don't know if he's saying that I asked him, but he's he's saying that it was because I demanded it.

3111
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:04,100
And nearly saw it as a Tee hee.

3112
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:05,100
Ha ha.

3113
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:10,100
I mean, yeah, it's unlike Ben, who took it very seriously to me.

3114
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:11,100
This was just Tee hee.

3115
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,100
Ha ha.

3116
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:13,100
This was just laughing matters.

3117
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:16,100
But Ben had to ban it was serious business.

3118
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,100
Okay.

3119
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:20,100
Is this me as Beetlejuice?

3120
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:21,100
Yeah.

3121
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:23,100
Say my name three.

3122
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,100
Yeah.

3123
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:26,100
Say my name and say, then say it.

3124
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,100
Ha ha.

3125
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:28,100
Thanks.

3126
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:30,100
I like my risk a coat.

3127
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:35,100
Am I exuding like green vape out all my my bodily pores?

3128
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:39,100
No, it's called stink lines.

3129
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:40,100
I'm holding the vape.

3130
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:45,100
I'm have my vape cartridge in my hand there.

3131
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:49,100
Oh, it's been saying as Beetlejuice and give a sake as Friska.

3132
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:53,100
Halloween costume get this is the last thing I had drawn for the podcast.

3133
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:57,100
The nest things are of my own imaginations.

3134
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,100
Okay, it's a fair.

3135
02:15:58,100 --> 02:15:59,100
It's a fair.

3136
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:00,100
It's a caterpillar cat.

3137
02:16:00,100 --> 02:16:01,100
His name is Taffy.

3138
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:05,100
He's a magic little guy and generates magic paws to defend himself or hunt how like cats

3139
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,100
do.

3140
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:08,100
It's a creature concept I have for my personal comic.

3141
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:10,100
I'm trying to produce.

3142
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,100
Cool.

3143
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,100
Like a Rayman cat.

3144
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:16,100
A caterpillar, you know, like a ferret.

3145
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:18,100
That's just a ferret.

3146
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:20,100
But with Rayman hands.

3147
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:24,100
This is something that my wife has kicked to gear and this guy has a wife.

3148
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:26,100
You learn something new every day.

3149
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,100
And yet he doodles Ben St. at work.

3150
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,100
What a what a what a paradox.

3151
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:37,100
And these things can't do these things completely completely exclusive for me.

3152
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:42,100
So they and then this something that my wife has kicked to gear in my mind a comic about

3153
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:45,100
her and I being a pirate and a mermaid that fall in love.

3154
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:47,100
That is so disgusting.

3155
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:50,100
That's sickening.

3156
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:53,100
That's too fucking cute.

3157
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:59,100
And and I mean that with like the most negative connotation I can possibly muster.

3158
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:02,100
My wifey Aurora and then her two aquatic sidekicks.

3159
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:06,100
It's a small spiny dogfish shark and a Hawaiian monk seal.

3160
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:07,100
The shark.

3161
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:09,100
Wait, wait, I just skipped it.

3162
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:10,100
I'll read the whole thing.

3163
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:12,100
It takes place on this pumpkin island.

3164
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,100
This pumpkin mountain in the background is actually a volcano.

3165
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:18,100
This volcano where in the natives tried discarding this cursed pumpkin into but the thing blew

3166
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:22,100
up to shape of a pumpkin so they stopped because it freaked him out.

3167
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:26,100
Oh, I feel like yeah, we shouldn't have done that.

3168
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:30,100
The guy who brought all the cursed pumpkin to the island was isolated from the native society

3169
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:31,100
and made his home on top of the volcano.

3170
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:33,100
That's why there's a castle on top of it.

3171
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,100
Yep.

3172
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:35,100
Yeah, checks out.

3173
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,100
That makes sense.

3174
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:40,100
My wifey Aurora and her two aquatic sidekicks is a small spiny dogfish shark and a Hawaiian monk

3175
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:41,100
seal.

3176
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:45,100
This shark is too small and weak to bite through the seal stick layer of body fat, but he do

3177
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:46,100
try.

3178
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:47,100
He do try.

3179
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:49,100
Look at that shark's little grin there.

3180
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:50,100
He do try though.

3181
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:51,100
He do try.

3182
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:53,100
The seal.

3183
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:57,100
Oh, if he could, he would rend your body fat asunder.

3184
02:17:57,100 --> 02:18:01,100
He would sink like in dwarf fortress.

3185
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:05,100
He would sink his teeth into your body, tearing the fat.

3186
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,100
This shark is too small and weak.

3187
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:13,100
The seal is one of three subspecies of earless seal foces that are native to warm water environments.

3188
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:17,100
Unlike otarids, foces do not communicate by barking.

3189
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:19,100
Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.

3190
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:23,100
You probably didn't know that seals get all the water they need from their food.

3191
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:27,100
Their bodies are very efficient at removing and recycling water from their food.

3192
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:28,100
They avoid drinking seawater.

3193
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:30,100
If a seal drinks too much seawater, it can be seriously.

3194
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,100
Why is this all of the seal knowledge?

3195
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:35,100
Animal facts.

3196
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:37,100
Animal facts.

3197
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:40,100
The Hawaiian monk seal is one of two remaining monk seal species.

3198
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:42,100
The other is the Mediterranean monk seal.

3199
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:46,100
The extinct species, the Caribbean monk seal is extinct.

3200
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:50,100
The story takes place in a fictional island, but I'm getting lightheaded.

3201
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:51,100
I'm going to faint.

3202
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:56,100
But I had done a little research to find if there were any warm water manals and had some fun learning.

3203
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,100
Oh, I see.

3204
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,100
Okay.

3205
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:01,100
Hey, thanks for the seal facts.

3206
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:04,100
I really like the shark.

3207
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:07,100
The shark little sideways look with the big teeth sticking out.

3208
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:13,100
He's doing that thing that dogs do when they look backwards and they show the white of their eye.

3209
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,100
Yeah.

3210
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:16,100
Yeah.

3211
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,100
I guess this is him as a pirate in the first one.

3212
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:28,100
He looks like Larry Butts from Phoenix Wright.

3213
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:30,100
Larry Butts?

3214
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:31,100
Is he in the first game?

3215
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:32,100
He is.

3216
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:35,100
He's Phoenix's childhood friend or one of them.

3217
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,100
Oh, yeah.

3218
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,100
Yeah, I kind of see it.

3219
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:40,100
Yeah, I kind of see it.

3220
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,100
Abid, what could I say?

3221
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,100
Thanks for the voice manals.

3222
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:49,100
Thanks for your creative output.

3223
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:51,100
Thank you for...

3224
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:58,100
I have no more to add.

3225
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:01,100
You've been completely flabbergasted.

3226
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:05,100
I've been dumbfounded, stymied, dumbfucked.

3227
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:06,100
Dumbfucked.

3228
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:09,100
I've been dumbfucked at these posts.

3229
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,100
If you know what I mean.

3230
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,100
I know, I don't.

3231
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:21,100
Well, I mean, that's the last of the voice spells for this week.

3232
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:22,100
Yeah.

3233
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:23,100
Oh, that's one more.

3234
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:24,100
Is there?

3235
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:25,100
Yeah.

3236
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,100
No, that's not.

3237
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:30,100
This is Happy Birthday Ben.

3238
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:33,100
Well, oh, yeah.

3239
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:36,100
Last one is Happy Birthday Ben.

3240
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,100
Hey, thanks.

3241
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:39,100
Hey, I appreciate it.

3242
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,100
Reminder to everyone that the voice mails are back

3243
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:45,100
and you can send us a voice mail at speakprep.com.

3244
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:47,100
PCP Voice Mail, is that it?

3245
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:48,100
Yes.

3246
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,100
I think that's it.

3247
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,100
It's linked in the description.

3248
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:55,100
There is, we did the bonus episode where we went through all the old,

3249
02:20:55,100 --> 02:21:00,100
never before listened to, we opened up the vault

3250
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:04,100
and we brought the old voice mails out from the vault from years and years ago.

3251
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:09,100
Hear us respond to people asking like,

3252
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:15,100
hey guys, why did Monkey join the podcast or something?

3253
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:23,100
Were there any really funny old questions?

3254
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:28,100
We didn't come over like any controversial things.

3255
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:32,100
Well, there are questions about like DigiNay,

3256
02:21:32,100 --> 02:21:34,100
who was still on the podcast at the time.

3257
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:37,100
We got a couple like responding directly to things she said.

3258
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:43,100
There were some about, you know, this was back in the, back in the day.

3259
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:46,100
Okay, so anyway, that's on Patreon.com.

3260
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:50,100
Stuff for a new bonus episode, along with 56 other bonus episodes,

3261
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:53,100
along with a classic Bencast, Ben commentary.

3262
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,100
Hear me respond to myself.

3263
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:58,100
Just genius.

3264
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:00,100
How am I such a genius?

3265
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:02,100
Anything else?

3266
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:08,100
I may start streaming Elden Ring soon.

3267
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:10,100
That's just a back in my mind thought.

3268
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:12,100
But no plans yet.

3269
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:15,100
I kind of want to get back into it.

3270
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:17,100
I could, yeah.

3271
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:20,100
I could try a stream sometime.

3272
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:21,100
I could try streaming again.

3273
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:24,100
My internet, sometimes it works fine.

3274
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:26,100
There are times when it's not so good,

3275
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:28,100
but like most of the time it works.

3276
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:33,100
So it might be worth attempting another Minecraft

3277
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:37,100
or something stream at some point, just to see what happens.

3278
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,100
Yeah.

3279
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:43,100
I'm a little bit disappointed with the internet at my new place,

3280
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:46,100
but I don't know.

3281
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:48,100
Maybe it would have,

3282
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:51,100
maybe it wouldn't have the issues that my old place had, I'm not sure.

3283
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:58,100
I have to talk to Maren and get all the Minecraft server stuff sorted out.

3284
02:22:58,100 --> 02:23:02,100
But anyway, I think that's everything.

3285
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:06,100
I think that's all the stuff I wanted to talk about this week.

3286
02:23:06,100 --> 02:23:11,100
So, thanks for listening.

3287
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:13,100
Watch out for my new video, which might be coming out really soon.

3288
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:15,100
Might even be out by now.

3289
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:17,100
But it might not.

3290
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,100
Ha ha.

3291
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:21,100
Okay, bye.

3292
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,100
See you next week. Thank you.

3293
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,100
Thank you very much.
