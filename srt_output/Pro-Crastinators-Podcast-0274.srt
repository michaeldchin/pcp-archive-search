00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Ben Saint is here. Gibbontake is here.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I have blisters on my fingers.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And despite the rumors of his death, Tom Oliver is here.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh no, I did die. I'm just here anyways.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
People have been saying no Tom, no watch in the comments for years and that will show them. They will have learned their lesson.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm glad they can finally watch and understand. Unfortunately, it probably won't be worth the wait.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Our guest this week is my friend, and what's the word, partner in various crimes, Crack AC.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh man, it's been a long time coming. I can't believe I finally made it. You may know me as the programmer behind Endless War back in the early days.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was going to say, or the programmer of Endless War, or I mean more importantly, the creator of the acclaimed, isthereanrv.com.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's correct. My now world famous enshrined in internet history, isthereanrv.com.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A historic resume.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, so it's fucking August 8, 2021, I guess, and I am sure feeling it, if you know what I'm saying.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where does the time go?

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where does the time go? I don't know what's going on. What's this week about?

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's our podcast? Wait a minute, we recorded 280 episodes and we don't even know what this show is about.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This show has a topic? No, it doesn't.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's our mission statement?

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
To be as boring as possible and see how much money we can make doing it.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
To fill the ears of our listeners while they do monotonous tasks, I guess.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To fill the hours between cradle and grave, baby.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
To just wither away, live on stage.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, I mean, it's a noble goal. Somebody has to do it.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Would you rather be listening to ambient noise right now? That's so 2004.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I would rather be listening to a plot summary of a video game that I played when I was a child.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's what I wasn't on the PCP.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
God, if only. If only you could be right now, just escape all obligation and be baby again.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just have some YouTuber explain to you the plot of Final Fantasy 7 that you already know backwards and forwards.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the seventh time listening to that video.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know if it's one channel or just like a trend, but there's like X explained.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Just annoys me in concept.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I just see them and I'm like, sure, you're going to explain it, but I hate you and I want you to stop.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
God, I saw recommended again that thumbnail of Lucas from Mother 3 and it's how Mother 3 breaks you.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I'm like, oh, I fucking hate that thumbnail. I see it recommend all the time.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just click on the little dots and just be like, don't recommend video and then you'll never see it again.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I got to tell you, speaking of Super Eye Patch Wolf, I happen to catch his little Dell saga and this shit drives me insane.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know the saga.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The short version is he put out this like hours long video where he's crying and upset about having bought a computer

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and like the computer was both exactly what he ordered and a piece of shit.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, you bought a Dell computer.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah. Well, right. He buys a Dell computer.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So what was it down to the absolute bare minimum because he wants to be as cheap as possible.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And then he's like sure shocked that he doesn't have a solid state drive and that it doesn't work.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You know, it's not fast enough.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it's like made a whiny video about it.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He made this whiny video, but it's worse than that.

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is a month's lawn saga where like the people in his discord had been trying to help him and he's just been ignoring their assistance.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And it just drives me crazy.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He knows nothing, but he certainly knows everything and it's his constant downfall.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The only thing he knows is that he doesn't like it.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I tried to watch a Super Eye Patch.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I liked his Scooby video.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I remember liking the Scooby video.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I tried to watch another Super Eye Patch Wolf fairly recently and I was so disgusted by his delivery.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
His voice is so cloying.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's okay. It's fine.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's trying to get its hook.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, it's not.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He doesn't have any ground to criticize people's voices.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Neither of ours are smooth and sultry.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He does these little like, well, I, you know, it made me feel...

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think that's an accurate representation of Super Eye Patch Wolf.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He does these performative little like, whispery stops and like giggles.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He whispers. He has a whispery voice. That's for sure.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He's being all oo-woo at you and like it's sickening.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He's putting on a fucking show.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He's putting on a show on his YouTube show.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What I'm saying is I really feel the artifice of it and it feels very, very cloying and manipulative.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's my take.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The only Super Eye Patch Wolf video I've watched recently.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Night Mind has the worst voice on YouTube.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Night Mind's voice is definitely worse than Super Eye Patch Wolf.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I watched Super Eye Patch Wolf video on Space Jam.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He did like his whole like Space Jam 2 leaked script, but it wasn't actually script.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was just something he made up. It was a shitpost and it was hilarious.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I loved it. Super good.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I mean, I feel like, I feel like I'm in, I don't know.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Whatever.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I make that one video, but I don't know if I can get past it.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But anyway, okay, so he's crying about his fucking computer.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I remember, I mean, years ago I did that GoFundMe to get a computer and you recommended me a bunch of parts.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And somebody recommended me and I feel bad being like, oh, one guy fucked up.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's my fault. It's my fault for going against specifications.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But someone recommended me a cheaper motherboard and I decided, okay, I'll get the cheaper.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, why not get the cheaper motherboard?

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I did and it completely ruined the whole thing.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It just didn't work.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It took me six months to get the computer working.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I just had to buy the fucking better.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You just got to buy the fucking.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's like Nauta says in Fully Coolie when he's on the run with Haruko and they're buying the ramen.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can't just go with the cheap brand just because it's jumbo size.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You got to stick with the good stuff.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like I said, he was right.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And you know, I mean, it was literally like you tried to save 50 bucks and it cost you six months of your life.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You know?

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Exactly.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
100%.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Point of point of order.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Always get a decent motherboard and a good power supply.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You will thank yourself 100% of the time.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is why.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Absolutely.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This, this is why I'm, I mean, I hate to endorse a company, but I genuinely, I genuinely get

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
so much out of my fucking Instacart subscription.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It cost me like $100 a year and I never have to go grocery shopping and it's amazing.

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well, I mean, especially for you.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's like $10 a week.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's pretty good.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You don't.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's like tens of hours saved.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's like a huge hassle if you go to the store.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I could see that being like gigantic and life-saving.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's paid for itself like so many times over.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's a miracle.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's great.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's really great.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's that saying?

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I've heard some people say like, when you're, when you're, is it like when you're young,

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
when you trade, you spend time to save money and then when you're older, you spend money

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to save time.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's my saying.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I said that.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Did you say that?

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, I thought someone smart.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I thought someone smart said it.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Excuse me.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
One of those world famous gibbon quotes.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I swear I said it somewhere.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, it's absolutely true.

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's very true.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Since time is money, if you can ever find a way to spend money that will save you time,

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but you save more time, the value of the time that you save is worth more than the money

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that you spent to save the time.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's the fucking, that's how you fucking hack your life.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's like the fundamental principle of life hacking or something.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's how you get on top of your shit.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Speaking of eye patch wolf and weird voice voicings, whatever happened to nerd writer?

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is he completely gone or is he just still making videos that nobody ever sees anymore?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I bet.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, without even looking into it at all, my gut feeling is probably that, you know,

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
he had his heyday.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He, you know, he made, he became as successful as he was ever going to get on YouTube.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then some fucking Corpo company like hired him in some kind of like, some kind of like,

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
managerial position or something off of his reputation.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And now he just works for someone like that and makes way more money than he would ever make on YouTube.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And we'll never hear from him again.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, I'll tell you then.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He made a video on YouTube.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, okay.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because I mean, I had not not heard anyone talk about nerd writer in like a year or more.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know, he still gets decent views.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, I thought he was gone.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I guess it's just one of those, those like, like YouTube is so big that there's entire like,

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
juggernauts of industry that you can completely miss if you're not in the right algorithm circle.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's pretty interesting how quickly you can forget people exist if you just like click a couple things on YouTube.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like I constantly, I like got rid of a lot of like political stuff on my YouTube because I was sick of seeing it.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because I already know the world's bad.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't need to hear about it.

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I just forget.

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And I'm like, oh yeah, Vosh exists.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I haven't seen Vosh's face in like eight months.

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Vosh, man.

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I mean, he was all over Twitter yesterday.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I can't escape him.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, I didn't even know.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I didn't even know.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Everybody existed till literally right now.

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was because there's a picture of him like hugging a fucking Charlie Kirk and Tim Pool that everyone.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay, honestly, it was actually kind of funny.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's actually kind of funny because everyone was analyzing it like they were they were drawing like they were drawing the lines.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The alpha like who's leaning into they were drawing the alpha lines and they were comparing their stances like who's the most alpha in the situation.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And Justin Wang was like, hmm, Tim, Tim's line is the most alpha, but also he lacks cock confidence because he's got his hands crossed over.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So that's kind of a watch.

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Not sure what to make it.

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is actually pretty funny.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, I've been keeping up with Vosh and the the reason he was all over the place on Twitter was because he did that debate with Charlie Kirk on Tim Pool's show.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And it was apparently really well done for like, you know, bridging the gap or like getting Tim Pool fans to be more left leaning or whatever.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So yeah.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Big news, I guess.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I mean, Charlie Kirk is like he was in he's like a he's like a politician or something.

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He's like some sort of a guy.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's a he's a radio personality.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I thought before he was on like a radio talk show host or something.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think he's an official like he's not an elected official or anything.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, I don't know.

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I thought he was like another media guy.

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, I don't know.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Like I said, I don't look at the turning point USA guy.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, maybe.

206
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, he's not the guy from two and a half men.

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If only that would have been a much more interesting face.

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Is that the name of the image where they're all hugging each other?

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's what I'm saying.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Charlie Kirk is so tall.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's like like Vosh is like a kind of tall guy and Charlie Kirk fucking towers over him.

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He's like seven feet tall.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's insane.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No offense to Tom, but I just I don't trust people that tall.

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I mean, I don't trust myself.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Absolutely.

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's really funny because Vosh is like he's kind of big and he makes Tim Poole look tiny

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and then and then fucking Charlie Kirk makes Vosh look tiny.

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's it's it's a trip.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's wild.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's like Tim Heidecker next to Mike Stoklasa.

223
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then you realize how big Eric Wareheim must be.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Wait.

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you remember when Tim Heidecker was on half in the bag?

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
One of the earlier?

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No, no.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What?

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He what he was?

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, he was.

231
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He was like he was the guy.

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He was like the manager of the game shop, right?

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's like I don't remember that at all.

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, you can't rewatch it.

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I've not seen that.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There's there's an episode where they transition from being at Mr. Plinkett's house all the

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
time to going back to the VCR repair shop for the first time.

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You see that set and they come back and they're like, oh, Tim Heidecker is the boss.

239
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And you're like, and then he leaves.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He jumps through the ceiling.

241
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Does it look like a shootout on George Lucas, Rich Evans as George Lucas comes in.

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He's like, I'm going to kill you, Mike and Jay because of the Plinkett reviews.

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And then there's the whole thing.

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then they kill George Lucas and Tim Heidecker flies away and then they own the store.

245
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And then from there on, they do reviews in there as well.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Half in the bag of PCP University lecture when the lore is deep.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I mean, it's deep, but it's fun to watch.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You just watch it.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know what?

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean, in terms like things with obscure lore, I mean, red letter media, I mean, specifically

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
half in the bag does have a continuing narrative that nobody follows.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You could probably do a lecture on half in the bag.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I have seen people take like all of the skits from the beginning and ends of half in the

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
bag and then turning them into half in the bag, the movie, which is like a couple hours

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
long.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And there's like in parts.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There's quite a lot of stuff still.

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Wouldn't you rather spend a couple hours watching some socially awkward people talk about it

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
in a room with a whiteboard?

260
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That just seems so much more entertaining.

261
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, tempting, tempting.

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
My Sonichu lecture is it got like a hundred and it got 70 K views on its first week.

263
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's going to it's going to pass the it's going to pass the Kokoro wish lecture probably

264
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
like a week and a half.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, considering the circumstances, it would be shocked if it didn't.

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean, it's it is it is getting it is getting, you know, I'll just show the graph.

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I fucking love looking at these graphs.

268
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It is getting the my other lecture.

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's getting Kokoro wish more exposure, which is the most important thing, obviously.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, of course.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Here's here's the here's the relative views lately on hold on.

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me put them here in the fucking chat where we all can see.

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wow.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I didn't realize you posted the the lecture on the Ben St. Channel.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, everyone's pretty stingy about their lectures, except for me.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, I only mentioned it because I thought you had way fewer subscribers on the Ben St.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Channel, but it's like nineteen thousand.

279
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm looking at it right now.

280
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's gained almost a thousand since posting the video.

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think I'm going to hit twenty K maybe like next week or something.

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Graduates are all going to be disappointed in two months when nothing else has come out.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah.

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

285
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, I don't know.

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
We'll see.

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Did you explain the colors on this chart?

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We're looking at.

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Sorry.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The blue there is the blue is a Sonichi 102.

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The green is Sonichi 101.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Purple is Kokoro wish.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Orange is Tails gets trolled.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And red is a chat with Chris Chan, Sonichi, the stream.

297
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So as you see, you know, historically, Sonichi 101 has been topping everything.

298
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then, you know, Sonichi 102 has propelled itself and Sonichi 101 up to heights.

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And it is it's pulling the other two lectures up with it.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They're getting maybe like five hundred.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Those lower ones are getting maybe five hundred views a day at the moment or something.

302
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So that's going to squeeze out some more attention.

303
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Could you rescale this logarithmically so we can really see those differences?

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Look at the trend.

305
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know if there's an option for that in the actually.

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

307
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Lunge.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I can sit.

309
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I can't do logarithmic, but I can make it a bar graph.

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That would do it for you.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No.

312
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Sorry.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My options are limited.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you do a pie chart?

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I can.

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You do a Venn diagram.

317
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hmm.

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can.

319
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wait.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just just a giant Venn diagram of viewers who've seen.

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Crystery 101 102 right in Kokoro wish.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I have one more.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I have one more interesting.

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Debateably interesting graph to show these are these are these are views over time for

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Sonichi 102.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
As you can see some time on the fourth day, it had started getting a bump and it basically

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
had like a renewed spike of viewership.

328
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not even slowing down.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's it's debatably only accelerating.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, it looks good.

331
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I mean, it looks totally linear to me.

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It looks pretty good.

333
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's a good.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You see, after 40, it kind of started to flatten and then it was like, nope, not flattening.

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, yeah, baby.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This shit's going to be around forever.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's changing the YouTube landscape.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I noticed you on Twitter put you made a PCP lectures tier maker tier list thing.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, I did because I made them.

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I made one the day before for down the rabbit hole because nobody there.

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There was nobody that had made a down the rabbit hole tier maker before and I was talking

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to someone about those and I was like, man, this the Christian, the Christian down the

343
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
rabbit hole is pretty bad.

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But the Darger, the Henry Darger down the rabbit hole is amazing.

345
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I wonder if I could place the others on a spectrum in between and I could and then I decided

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to do it for because people always argue that the most the most contentious ones are like

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
spirit science.

348
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Some people really like the spirit science one and other people really don't.

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Some people really like the Kingdom Hearts lecture and some people think it's overrated.

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I was like, OK, I'm going to make a I'm going to make a fucking way.

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll post the image of my my tier list.

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So wait, is the tier list your personal opinion or based on what you believe to be correct

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
in a larger sense?

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You mean like, no, this is just this is my personal opinion.

355
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
These are these are my personal opinion.

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's not.

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think I did one.

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But it was sort of.

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know.

360
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I didn't find it particularly interesting where I placed the lectures.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I hadn't seen them in a while anyway.

362
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I put I put Tom's lectures in a tier and some of the comments are like still the thing where

363
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
they're like, it should be higher.

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They're like, Animorphs should be number one of S tier.

365
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's not enough to merely put it in stands.

366
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know.

367
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't know.

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah, it does.

369
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's a strong.

370
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a strong contender.

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Tom, you have done you have done two lectures.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And as far as I'm concerned, they're both they're both a plus your two for two with the hits.

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I can't wait to let everybody down with the third one.

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't know what it will be, but it'll be something.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, I don't I don't know what I would do if I was going to do another one.

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You don't know what it you don't know what it would be.

378
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I thought the usual scheme is you.

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You say it was recorded already, you know, and it's coming soon.

380
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And you just do that for a few years.

381
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
True, true, true.

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Wait, the real story is on a tier.

383
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Is this just because you were there to experience in real life or did it actually get released

384
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
somewhere?

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No, no, it did not get released.

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's just that's just I put that in.

387
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can lord it over everyone that like it is that good.

388
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I kind of just put it in there as a as a troll.

389
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Where did this thumbnail come from?

390
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I just made I just mocked it up and made it because I was like, what?

391
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What if I just put in a fake thumbnail for a video that doesn't make sense?

392
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was expecting for a fucking.

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, I'm not.

394
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I mocked up a fake thumbnail just to put it in there and get it cut off.

395
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's true.

396
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I did.

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It was worth it.

398
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It was pretty good.

399
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a shame.

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
None of you will ever be able to see it.

401
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It it was pretty good and people have asked me.

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I saw somebody asked Nate about it and Nate said he didn't think people were missing out

403
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
on on it.

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I don't agree.

405
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think it was good.

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I think that anyone who was a PCP fan or or a Trixie fan would like it because it's basically

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
about our personal history in the bronie fandom.

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So I think it was good.

409
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If you would rate it, I might be a little biased.

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It might be it might be low A tier high.

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
No, no, no.

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think maybe if you had rated it less than A tier, it would be an admission that it, you

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
know, people weren't really missing anything.

414
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And that's unacceptable.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I wouldn't admit that.

416
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Absolutely.

417
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Absolutely.

418
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You know what?

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're right.

420
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You know what?

421
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Absolutely true.

422
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I think I appreciate you putting the risk at higher than two of Nate's lectures and Munchie's

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
spirit science.

424
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think I think risk honestly, I think maybe it should have been low A. The thing I mean,

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
the thing that I don't like about Final Fantasy and One Piece, I don't think those are good

426
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
lectures.

427
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,500
I think the Kingdom Hearts lecture is a really good lecture.

428
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,000
I think Final Fantasy and One Piece are not good.

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They're too long and they're not like they're too long.

430
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And they're what they're about is not something that that demands a lecture.

431
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,500
I think the the the risk a lecture, it is kind of surface level and it's not it's not very

432
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,000
in depth and it's kind of short, but I like that it's short.

433
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,500
And what it is, what it does cover is lecture worthy.

434
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,500
So I think it's got a special sauce for a good lecture is when it's like really in

435
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,300
depth, but also it's like unraveling some mystique.

436
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,860
You know, like Final Fantasy and One Piece are so mainstream that it's easy to find information

437
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
on them.

438
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,500
Like where else are you going to get Kokoro wish broken down in that kind of extreme

439
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
detail?

440
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You know?

441
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,500
On the one hand, on the one hand, you could say, well, you know, people say, you know,

442
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,100
One Piece doesn't need a lecture.

443
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Just read One Piece.

444
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,500
I guess you could technically say that about Kokoro wish.

445
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,300
You can just go and read, you know, Unicorn Jelly, if you want.

446
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,260
It was about more than just Unicorn Jelly, though, it was kind of about the author and

447
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:13,900
like their meta journey on top of everything, which gives an add so much to it.

448
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:21,800
I think that specifically the lecture format, it works best as a way to explain something

449
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,300
because otherwise you could do a video essay where you just talk about something with editing

450
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
and stuff.

451
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:34,660
The audience being there reacting to the crazy shit is the fun part because like, you know,

452
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,180
the person telling the story gets to tell something wacky happened with Tails gets

453
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,900
trolled or Kokoro wish.

454
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,740
It's like, wow, and people Pog in real time, and it has a certain energy to it.

455
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,900
If you're explaining like the plot of every single Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy 7,

456
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,500
every single Final Fantasy 7, just wait like five more years and we'll be at that point.

457
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Oh my God, there's going to be more.

458
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
There is.

459
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh, no.

460
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,500
We're going to have to have Final Fantasy 7, Vanilla, Final Fantasy 7 remake, Final Fantasy

461
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,860
7, Battle Royale, which is real, unfortunately.

462
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,220
How long is it going to be till the next installment of the remake?

463
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,660
It could be some of the ten years probably.

464
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,060
Something insane like that, right?

465
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:28,020
But like the Final Fantasy stories, they have like Pog's moments within them, but they're

466
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:33,980
not as ridiculous as like the story of Chris Chan and Sonichu.

467
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Some of those things.

468
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,420
There's also like, there's a functional purpose too to having the audience because when you're

469
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,900
explaining something so esoteric and dense, when you're the person who knows it, you tend

470
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,740
to kind of like make assumptions just almost by accident because like you're so deep in

471
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
it.

472
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
Yeah.

473
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,020
So like the audience is there to ask questions that you would get in the comments that can

474
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,500
be answered in the material itself, which is really helpful.

475
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,380
There's yeah, there's there's one there's one point and I included I included tectonic

476
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,380
improv's atop the fourth wall one because I think it's I think it's you know, it's it

477
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,300
says good as a as a PCP lecture and it's got and I like that the subject matter.

478
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,220
I think atop the fourth wall is the perfect kind of thing.

479
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,020
So I included it and but it's got a moment in it that is maybe like the downside of the

480
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,140
lecture form, which like one of his friends that he gets to like sit in the audience,

481
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,700
one of his friends like gets annoyed and like heckles him at one point and they have like

482
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:35,260
a little like moment where you can tell they're like genuinely mad at each other.

483
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,460
I miss that.

484
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,620
I didn't I didn't watch all the lecture.

485
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,980
I could be that's really I could be reading.

486
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,340
I could be reading too much.

487
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
I don't think I'm reading.

488
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,140
There's a there's a moment where they get kind of bit like she's like have to go back

489
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,340
and that's the risk you run.

490
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,420
That's the risk you run.

491
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
It's a good lecture.

492
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,500
I like it.

493
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
And then fuck.

494
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Yeah.

495
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I don't know.

496
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,900
I felt bad putting it in low tier, but the video quality and the audio quality are really

497
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,660
unfortunate on that one and it I really liked making it.

498
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,140
But look, it's a little the quality makes me a little bit embarrassed about it.

499
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,620
So when did that lecture come out?

500
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,100
Like what is that up to?

501
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,540
That came out it would we did RFC Kcon February of 2020.

502
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,060
And I think it came out like not too long after that.

503
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,660
So that's like, yeah, that's as of like February 2020.

504
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,100
So a year and a half ago.

505
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,300
So it's pretty much caught up on everything significant that ever happened because there's

506
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,340
supposed to be season four, right?

507
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,220
Like what's the deal with season four?

508
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
Is that happening?

509
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,860
Is that coming out soon?

510
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,020
It is on.

511
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,180
We're in season four.

512
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,980
And by the way, the name of the generation of people that joined during season four is

513
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,780
foreskin, which is pretty good.

514
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
Pretty good.

515
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,020
I learned that the other day.

516
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,500
Yeah, it is going on.

517
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Server is still active.

518
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,780
People are still are still going at it in there.

519
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Yeah.

520
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
I know it.

521
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:16,540
I dip in every so often and I just am overwhelmed by all of the people being active, being people

522
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,340
I don't know who they are.

523
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,940
And I just did that New Grounds video, give it a bump because I saw that on the front

524
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
page of New Grounds.

525
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
I got front page.

526
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
It definitely did.

527
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Some people did.

528
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Definitely gave it a bump.

529
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
It was a good video.

530
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,100
Not as an incredible video.

531
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,140
Not as many as it should have because it didn't get as many views as it deserves.

532
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,740
Well, New Grounds, unfortunately, doesn't have a lot of like raw traffic, but what

533
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,740
are you going to do?

534
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,940
I mean, it's on YouTube, too, where it is.

535
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
I didn't know.

536
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
I just saw it on New Grounds.

537
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Yeah.

538
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Obviously, it's easier.

539
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Oh, yeah.

540
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
No, it's on YouTube.

541
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
What?

542
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
Did you just like?

543
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
Shaddox find it randomly?

544
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
Well, no, it got front-paged on New Grounds.

545
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Oh, that's right.

546
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Like a couple of weeks ago.

547
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
That's how you found it.

548
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Yeah, it was on.

549
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
You just saw it.

550
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
You just happened to see it on New Grounds.

551
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Well, no, I mean, what they do is they front-page things on.

552
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,940
They do daily front pages and they do like spotlight weeklies.

553
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
And so it was front-page the day I was there.

554
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,940
And so I was like, there it is.

555
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,940
Yeah.

556
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
I know.

557
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,180
I just think it's funny to me that like you found it organically instead of like seeing

558
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,940
me like retweet it or something like that.

559
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
I did not see.

560
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
No, I found it organically.

561
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,940
It was super cool.

562
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,940
I was like, wait a minute.

563
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
I know those guys.

564
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
It was great.

565
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Wow.

566
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
Yeah.

567
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,940
Shaddock's YouTube channel has like a hundred K subs.

568
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,940
But I think her there.

569
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
I don't know.

570
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
I don't know.

571
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,940
I think they're genuinely I genuinely don't know.

572
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,940
I've never, never spoken to them like in voice, but they have them.

573
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
I think they did like fan animations.

574
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Right.

575
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
I think that was what they.

576
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Yeah.

577
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:53,940
So, you know, it's the difficult transition of, of moving from, you know, fan content

578
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,940
into like original content.

579
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,940
I mean, I guess RFCK is fan content, but it's not like, you know, it's not about like a

580
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,940
big mainstream property or something, right?

581
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,940
So it's, it's, it has that, it had that, that, that burden upon it.

582
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,940
I hope that it eventually sees a wider audience.

583
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
It's so good.

584
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,940
It's such an impressive piece of, of animation.

585
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
It's really, really gorgeous.

586
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
It's gorgeous.

587
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
Yeah.

588
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:29,940
And we talked about it last week and I forgot to put the link in the description, but I,

589
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
I fixed it.

590
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
I fixed it.

591
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,940
A commenter pointed out that I didn't put the link in and I, now it's there.

592
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,940
I'll put it in again.

593
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Eleazar put the link top, top of the description.

594
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
It's important.

595
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,940
What were we talking about?

596
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Tier lists.

597
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,940
Tier lists for the lectures.

598
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Lectures.

599
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Down the rabbit hole.

600
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
Yeah.

601
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,940
I just, I just was like, I was just imagining like, man, imagine you're just some guy, just

602
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,940
some PCP head and you see this tier list and you're, and you're going through it and you

603
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,940
get to the real brony story thumbnail and you're like, wait a minute, there's a thumbnail.

604
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,940
It has to be real.

605
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
I didn't know this was out.

606
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
I have to find it.

607
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
I have to find it.

608
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Where does this thumbnail come from?

609
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:23,940
I hope I confused at least one person with it and cause righteous indignation.

610
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
Yeah.

611
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,940
And cause righteous indignation when they realize like, wait a minute.

612
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,940
It's not out after all.

613
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm fucking mad.

614
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Me too.

615
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Me too, bros.

616
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,940
If we ever do another Radcom, I'm going to make sure to have my phone record at every

617
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,940
lecture just in case one of you guys gets cold feet.

618
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
It's like, I don't want to release it.

619
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
I'll have the pirated of the cam version.

620
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,940
I'll put it on a torrent site so people can get the illegal cam.

621
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,940
Literally like a theater, like phone recording.

622
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Exactly.

623
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,940
With people's heads in the foreground.

624
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Could you imagine if that actually existed for the brony lecture, it would be hilarious.

625
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Oh, it would be perfect.

626
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,940
If only we lived in such a world.

627
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,940
I asked, yeah, I asked Victor if he had like the footage and he told me no.

628
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,940
I didn't keep a copy.

629
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,940
I just gave it to.

630
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,940
There were huge files.

631
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
I'm not surprised.

632
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Yeah.

633
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,940
They have shot in like high definition, like two hour long videos with like audience.

634
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Like a pro camera.

635
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
It was like bigger than my head.

636
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Red cams.

637
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
8K.

638
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Yeah.

639
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Wrong.

640
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
Compressed.

641
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Dude, we had to work.

642
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,940
We had to buy hard drives every single person.

643
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,940
We had to next day order them from Amazon just so we could bring the files home.

644
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
They were massive.

645
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
Yeah.

646
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Totally unnecessary.

647
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
Yeah.

648
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
But we did it.

649
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,940
I could just recorded them on a fucking iPhone.

650
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
It would have been fine, but.

651
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
Probably.

652
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,940
Well, well, I mean, that's what we did with RFCK lecture and it was.

653
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
I take it all back.

654
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Well, and we didn't record it.

655
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
It was, you can tell the difference.

656
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
So it was, it was probably worth it.

657
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Oh, I remember now in the RFCK lecture, was that when you chipped your tooth again?

658
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
Yeah.

659
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
That's when I had to turn it off.

660
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,940
It was terrifying.

661
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
It was too much for me.

662
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,940
The body horror in the middle of the lecture.

663
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,940
I mean, you can't, I mean, you can't see my chip tooth or anything.

664
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,940
It's so on brand for RFCK though.

665
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,940
I do.

666
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
It is.

667
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
I do.

668
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,940
I pick, I pick up a piece of post your board and I bite it with my teeth and I tear it and

669
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,940
then I, there's, then there's like, then there's like five minutes where I'm where

670
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,940
Munchie is talking and I'm kind of like more quiet than usual.

671
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,940
Occasionally just kind of like touching my mouth and being like, what?

672
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
What happened?

673
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,940
And then I announced like, hey guys, I just broke my tooth on the, on the, on the, on

674
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
the thing.

675
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,940
But don't worry.

676
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Like the lecture will continue.

677
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
We don't have to stop.

678
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Let's just keep going.

679
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Jesus.

680
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
That's professionalism.

681
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
That's what I did.

682
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Absolutely.

683
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
I was there to do a job.

684
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
God damn it.

685
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,940
All zero dollars.

686
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
You know what?

687
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,940
I think maybe it's a little unfair to put it in the bottom tier.

688
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Yeah.

689
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,940
The quality, the audio visual quality is poor, but it is genuinely informative about like

690
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,940
what is the deal with RFCK, which is the most valuable thing.

691
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,940
When I was doing, when I was doing the, the down the rabbit hole, I was, you know, I made

692
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
the tier list that and then I made my own tier list.

693
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,940
And like one of my biggest criteria for that is like, how much did I learn from it?

694
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Which is why I put, I had to, I had to put good ones like the final fantasy house and

695
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,940
time cube down in like C tier because like I already knew about them.

696
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
I didn't learn that much from them.

697
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
So I didn't like them that much.

698
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,940
There's nothing wrong with them, but I had to RFCK lecture.

699
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,940
It's, it's a very niche topic, but if you're interested in it, it is genuinely informative.

700
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,940
So maybe it should be in B tier actually.

701
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah.

702
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
Yeah.

703
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,440
See the biggest problem with the RFCK lecture is that it spits in the face of RFCK because

704
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,940
it has audio and visuals.

705
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,940
You should have just talked into its speech to text program and just put it in a paste

706
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
band.

707
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,940
That's how you experience the RFCK lecture.

708
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
That's, that's probably true.

709
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,940
I mean, that's what you should, that's what should docket it eventually did right with

710
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Love Web.

711
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,940
You, you should have had, you should have had to download it as a like .txt file from

712
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,940
like a, a media fire download or something.

713
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
Yeah.

714
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
The lecture itself should be like lost.

715
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Like you literally have to like join the discord and find like a hidden channel, complete a

716
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,940
quest to get some role to find a hidden channel to find the download link or something.

717
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Sounds better.

718
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Yeah.

719
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:46,940
Well, maybe next time, maybe next time for RFCK 102 to explaining seasons three and four.

720
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Why not?

721
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Okay.

722
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Right.

723
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Right.

724
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
So what happened in season four?

725
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
What do we got?

726
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Is there like a big story point?

727
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Is there some great new gameplay?

728
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
There was.

729
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
No.

730
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,940
I mean, yeah, I know there is.

731
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
Nothing happened.

732
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
Okay.

733
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
I don't, there is, there is a story.

734
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,740
There is lore and there is, there are gameplay ramifications, but I am not like qualified

735
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
to explain them.

736
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,940
I don't know all the details of them, but yes, those things are there.

737
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
Yeah.

738
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,940
I think I heard there was some kind of election going on to replace the rowdy fucker.

739
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Oh yeah.

740
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,940
The rowdy ringleader.

741
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
Yeah.

742
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,940
They're having an election for rowdy ringleader.

743
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Lord goes swooping right at the last second.

744
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
Absolutely.

745
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Now is the time.

746
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Lord of Goat, Lord of Goat, you got to finish, you got to finish the comic real fast in time

747
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
for the election.

748
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Oh shit.

749
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Got to use all that kick story money to fund the election campaign.

750
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Yes.

751
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Yes.

752
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Yes.

753
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,940
Yes.

754
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Yes.

755
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Publicly.

756
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Based, based.

757
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Chased.

758
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:04,940
I have been, I have been proud, proud to report that I have, I have started working on the

759
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:12,340
game again, Phantom's Revenge and as I said on Twitter, the recent news about Chris will

760
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,780
not impact it whatsoever.

761
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,100
It changes nothing about the plan or how the story was going to end.

762
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,420
So I'm just going to keep, just going to keep plonking away at that.

763
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,260
By the way, have any, I don't know, have any of you seen like the new, new news about that

764
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,140
that's going around on Reddit and stuff?

765
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:38,900
I saw an image compilation of the girl who had the phone call that was leaked.

766
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,140
And they found out that she's like a psycho.

767
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,340
I don't know how true it is, but it seems to fit.

768
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:51,700
If it's true, I called it because in the call where Chris admits to what was going on, she's

769
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,060
clearly like enjoying it and like excited about it.

770
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,300
So it's, it's, it's not, it doesn't surprise me.

771
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,700
I said on Twitter, I was like, whoever was doing this, they're guilty of incitement.

772
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,420
Like it's really sounds like they like caused this to happen in some way.

773
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,900
And it seems like that's true.

774
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,260
So I feel pretty good about that.

775
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:19,660
Yeah, something about like the phone call, I don't know, like egging Chris on to, to

776
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:27,020
do the mother to use that as blackmail to make bleep that out or we'll get demonetized.

777
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,140
It's like, oh yeah, bleep everything I said.

778
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,780
But yeah, that was what I heard.

779
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,060
So fucked up that you would bother with that.

780
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Sounds like sound.

781
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:46,300
I mean, that's the story is that she's just some genuine psychopath who like just wanted

782
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,020
to get Chris to kill herself for fun.

783
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,660
That's what I've heard.

784
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,300
I mean, that seems like the end game of pretty much everyone on Kiwi Farms.

785
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,260
It's, I don't know about that.

786
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,740
You know, you know, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

787
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,260
I feel like that that's sort of a place where people like that can pass as just like jokesters.

788
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:20,900
Like not everyone is there doing that, but some people are and they are indistinguishable

789
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
from the rest.

790
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Yeah.

791
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,700
So people actually do horrible, fucked up shit.

792
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:34,380
I do see people on Kiwi Farms saying, sincerely saying like, you know, don't fuck with them,

793
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,740
leave them alone, just let them be low cows and entertain us.

794
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,420
And like some people are like that, but not everyone is like that.

795
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,420
Yeah.

796
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,100
Well, the people saying, you know, just leave her alone.

797
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
It's gone too far.

798
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,380
Those people have been duped the entire time.

799
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,220
You know, they're the ones going along saying it's funny, but the people who've been driving

800
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,700
everything aren't going to stop because of them and they don't care about them.

801
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,580
You know, that's the purpose of the website is to drive these people further and further

802
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,540
into whatever mess they're in.

803
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,460
Yeah, I mean, you're using people as your entertainment.

804
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,700
So like you don't want the entertainment to end, so you're going to keep pushing and

805
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,700
coating them on further.

806
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Yeah, it's pretty pretty disgusting.

807
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,940
Wish they'd shut them down, you know, poor Chan, too.

808
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,100
But like, what are you going to do?

809
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Yeah.

810
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Yeah.

811
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,620
All you can do is co-concease.

812
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,620
And I'm gonna, that's exactly what I intend to do.

813
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,020
So I will.

814
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,820
I saw I saw Dick Masterson being

815
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,740
even more of a sicko than usual on Twitter today, saying like the girl is a hero

816
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,140
for exposing Chris, just conveniently ignoring the fact that it kind of seems like

817
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,620
she literally like caused it to happen.

818
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,340
She, yeah, she exposed it after causing it herself.

819
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,980
So, you know, that's, you know, he sounds like one of those dumb guys who's like,

820
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,860
oh, OK, yeah, this is real fun.

821
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,140
And then he'll have some point where we'll say, oh, guys, we should we shouldn't

822
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
go any further.

823
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,380
You know, he guys, he's one of these dumbasses, just like

824
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,380
just like the rest. Yeah.

825
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,220
That sounds about right. What a fucking idiot.

826
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,220
Yeah, fucking gross.

827
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,140
Pretty unfortunate that he has such an audience.

828
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Yeah, they're they're they're bad.

829
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,980
Dick, Dick Dupes are fucking low, low intelligence.

830
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,780
I don't know. I don't know.

831
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,620
He's just a particular kind of a particular kind of a sap, I think,

832
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,060
is is vulnerable to that that kind of messaging.

833
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,500
Yeah, it's sad and you hate to see it, but it is what it is, I guess.

834
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,020
That's I don't know. I guess that's whatever.

835
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,660
Let's fucking let's talk about something more, more uplifting.

836
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,820
Oh, fuck, I don't have anything.

837
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,540
Well, no, I don't have anything uplifting.

838
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,300
No, there's nothing I've mostly been sick and trying to get better

839
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,740
and playing video games, and that's not very interesting.

840
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,740
I went to Ohio to try and move.

841
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,820
It didn't work. Moving's really hard.

842
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,260
I heard you were going to move to Ohio.

843
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,100
That's what people were saying on the great. That is the plan.

844
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,340
Still, I mean, I'm going to have to move still.

845
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,460
Yeah, it's just, you know, you know how it is with moving.

846
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,620
All landlords are evil and they need to die in the revolution.

847
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,020
Yeah, yeah, I I guess I had.

848
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,540
It was a huge hassle moving for me, and it's still going to be going to

849
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,260
continue to be a hassle.

850
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,420
I guess it could it could have been it could have been worse.

851
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,980
You know, I did manage to find I'm housed for this month,

852
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,980
and then I got a new place lined up for September.

853
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,100
So dope.

854
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Yeah, you just are you moving to Ohio because it's cheap?

855
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,340
Is it cheap in Ohio?

856
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,140
It's cheaper there.

857
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,940
I can get a studio for like 600, which is pretty good.

858
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,740
Wow. Yeah, that's pretty good.

859
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,780
But even that, it's like, you know, because I was like my plan

860
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,980
initially, which was shortsighted, foolish and ignorant, was like,

861
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,980
oh, I have a bajillion dollars in savings.

862
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,100
I'll just like use my savings to pay the rent.

863
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,940
And they're all just like,

864
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,500
we don't care if you have 10 million dollars in savings.

865
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,020
Make three times the rent at income or no deal.

866
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,860
So can't you?

867
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,940
Well, I mean, you just need a co-signer.

868
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,380
Well, OK, here's the thing.

869
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,260
I have a friend out there in Ohio and they're like, I'll be your cosigner.

870
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,660
And they're like, well, your friends are going to be your cosigner.

871
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,420
They need to make five times the rent.

872
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,820
I'm like, oh, my God.

873
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,740
And they're like, they need to.

874
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,700
And I don't know.

875
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,620
They're like, they need to make five times the rent.

876
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,860
And then they're like, do they are they renting right now?

877
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,780
I'm like, they pay rent.

878
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,300
They're like, OK, subtract all their expenses.

879
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,460
If they make five times the rent after their expenses,

880
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,540
then they can co-sign for you.

881
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,460
I'm like, so they have to make almost five thousand dollars

882
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,860
to rent a six hundred dollars studio.

883
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,020
And they're like, yes.

884
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,940
I mean, I, which isn't I literally I, I opened all my like my emails

885
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,860
to prospective roommates and or landlords with like, yeah, I know

886
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,780
I'm like self-employed and that's like scary and like I don't have any.

887
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
And it seems really shady and you probably think I'm just a hobo

888
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,980
and I have no guaranteed income, but whatever.

889
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,100
I'll just have my parents co-sign.

890
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,060
So just don't even worry about that.

891
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,380
That I mean, I mean, because I knew because I know what they're going to say.

892
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,180
It's like what you're a you're a wait, you're a YouTuber.

893
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,860
Right.

894
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,180
Uh, I don't know about this.

895
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,980
Just trying to explain like I just I I've basically lost my EBT this month

896
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,540
because Nate sent out those those 1099 NECs last year.

897
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,780
So then they realized I have income from two different sources

898
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,580
and they were like, what the fuck is this?

899
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,460
You have two jobs.

900
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,940
I'm like, no, it's just really dumb the way the money works.

901
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,140
And they're like, uh, we're pulling your thing.

902
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,020
You need to like break down month by month, all your income, how many

903
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,580
hours you work for each of these places.

904
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,220
I'm just like, I'm going to be gone in a month.

905
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,740
Nevermind.

906
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,980
So it's just a fucking night.

907
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,780
Government logistics suck.

908
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,700
Depending on who you talk to, the rules are different.

909
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,300
I don't think there's any rules in the government.

910
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,460
I think it's just like that you open up like the government rule book

911
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,820
and it's just like whatever, man, and then a thousand pages of nothing.

912
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,740
Now, you know what it is.

913
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,100
It's all just testing how tough you are.

914
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,500
Are you going to fight back?

915
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,180
Are you going to take him to court?

916
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,820
You know, they're seeing if they can push you around.

917
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,380
I mean, I'm still I'm I'm on week 15 of my eight to 12 week

918
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,500
waiting period for for the the pandemic unemployment hearing.

919
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,740
Yeah, sounds about right.

920
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,660
God, I still it's been it's been 15 weeks.

921
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Yeah, are you kidding me?

922
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,140
15 weeks and I called 12 weeks ago and they were like, well,

923
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,500
normally we would escalate your case, but it's really hard to get contact

924
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,500
with that office on a good day and we're having technical problems right now.

925
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,140
So I'll connect.

926
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,500
I'll transfer you and then they call immediately hung up

927
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,820
after I waited on hold for an hour.

928
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,460
And I was like, our phone's not working.

929
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,220
So at this like like the fine print on their thing is just like if you don't

930
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,380
pay, we're just going to like deduct from your taxes.

931
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,940
I'm like, I pay you in taxes.

932
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,820
So good luck with that.

933
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,020
Plus, I'm leaving the state.

934
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,700
Yeah, come find me, I guess.

935
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,300
I guess that's kind of my game plan right now.

936
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,780
It's like, come fight me, bro.

937
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,700
I'll lawyer up.

938
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,420
I I was going to stand.

939
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,460
I made a joke about like, Tom is like moving to Ohio to flee the tax man

940
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,220
in Massachusetts. I guess I was.

941
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,820
I mean, it's not the primary reason, but it's an added bonus at this point.

942
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,300
Sure. OK.

943
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,820
Bay is the only thing it sucks is I lose the five

944
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,260
thousand or so or not five, maybe like two or three thousand dollars that I

945
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,300
should have gotten since then to now in benefit since the cases hasn't been

946
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,620
decided one way or the other.

947
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,380
But yeah, that's that's pretty cringy.

948
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,380
The state doing what it does best, making you wait.

949
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,900
The state doing what it does best, nothing pretty much, pretty much.

950
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,780
This is this is a sort of, I mean, it's related.

951
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,340
And that's that I'm waiting for some fucking Corpo shills to get back to me.

952
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:22,380
But I had like a week and a half ago, I had two people as a weird

953
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:28,780
coincidence, two people filled out the the Vapors to Kickstarter backer

954
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,620
like survey, like basically like reported their mailing address to tell me

955
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,340
like where to mail there. Remember, you know, I did that campaign

956
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,500
like more than a year, like almost two years ago.

957
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,260
Yeah, long. And yeah.

958
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,460
And and it's been like a year since anyone filled out a survey and yet

959
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,140
like two people on like the end of July just filled out their survey.

960
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,140
But on Kickstarter, they don't just let you see your backer report.

961
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,620
They give you like a certain period of time to look at it.

962
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,340
And then they hide it from you as like a privacy measure.

963
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,140
But you can request access to it, which I did.

964
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,180
So I sent them an email.

965
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,100
It's like, please, please let me see the backer report because these two

966
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,980
new backers just gave me their info and I need to see that info to get them

967
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,140
their shit. And they're like, I waited for a reply.

968
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,740
And then I finally got one and they're like, OK, I'll upload an image

969
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,540
of your driver's license to prove it to you.

970
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,900
And I'm like, sure. And I did.

971
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,380
And now I'm still waiting for them to get back to me on that.

972
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,300
And I know that I got to copy that info. Yeah.

973
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,700
So I. OK, because this is OK, this ties into the other thing

974
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,180
I want to talk about, which is the Road to Radcon book,

975
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,220
which I am I have gotten the cover art from Michi Fostered.

976
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,300
And I am I have arranged it into printable PDFs.

977
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,900
And I'm going to be sending those to the printer tomorrow on Monday.

978
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,260
And I've ordered envelopes to send them out in.

979
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,220
And because I knew from my Vapors Kickstarter,

980
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,060
because I knew that they do this time limit thing.

981
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,500
And I knew that we were going to have late

982
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,140
backer fulfillment on the Radcon Road to Radcon

983
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,060
book for the the PCP Kickstarter.

984
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,500
I went through and I and I like saved.

985
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,700
I screenshotted everyone's like info, so I could have it later.

986
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,540
Everyone's like mailing address.

987
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,460
So I can. OK, I can see the backers.

988
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,180
So I have the I have their addresses saved for shipping those out.

989
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,020
But I'm still going to have to like make an announcement

990
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,100
because I'm sure in like the year since a bunch of people will have changed

991
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,540
their addresses, so I'm going to have to make an announcement being like,

992
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,300
hey, if you change if you live at the same place

993
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,540
and you fill out your survey, it's OK.

994
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,340
I'll send the book to where you were.

995
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,860
If you change your address, don't update your survey

996
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,420
because I can't see the survey anymore.

997
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,300
Just send a message saying this is my new address.

998
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,340
It's changed. And then I will send it to a new place.

999
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,460
So I don't know. I don't know why Kickstarter makes it that hard.

1000
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,340
It seems dumb.

1001
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,980
Probably like one probably like one guy at some point ran a scam

1002
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,900
to like harvest people's addresses using like Kickstarter,

1003
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,180
backer surveys or something.

1004
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,700
And then he ruined it and he ruined it for everyone else.

1005
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,380
And then they, you know, in the EU, they have I think it's GDPR.

1006
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,780
They have really strict data protection, DRPK.

1007
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,420
No, no, no, no.

1008
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,860
They have they have really strict data protection rules.

1009
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,340
And I wonder if it's related to their compliance there.

1010
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,020
Like if they can't work in the EU, if they don't

1011
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,780
delete this data after a certain amount of time, I wouldn't surprise me.

1012
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,140
It's not it's it's not deleted.

1013
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,940
It's just hidden and they are going to ring me out trying to get me

1014
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,300
to prove my identity before they'll show it to me, I guess.

1015
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,140
Yeah.

1016
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,260
Man, but I put I put like illustrations.

1017
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,660
There's like illustrations in the Road to Radcon book

1018
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,300
because me, she did she did sketches.

1019
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,340
She did a cover sketch that had a bunch of the characters on it.

1020
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,540
And then she did like a final version.

1021
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,460
So the final version is the actual cover, but then I took the sketches

1022
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,940
and I kind of like picked them apart into the individual like characters.

1023
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,420
And so the the you know, the blank pages between chapters in the book,

1024
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,820
they have the character sketches kind of like, you know, one here, one there.

1025
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,740
When there's like there's like five of them or something.

1026
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,420
Just kind of just kind of interspersed in there because I had to pad it out

1027
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,620
to make the the number of pages a multiple of four,

1028
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,500
because that's how like bookbinding works.

1029
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,380
I'm very proud of it, actually.

1030
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,660
I think it's going to be a really attractive little little pamphlet.

1031
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,940
A little bespoke item that only

1032
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,460
Radcon four backers will have unless we sell them to other people.

1033
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,180
Maybe which maybe I will because why not?

1034
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,980
I'll probably have like seventy five extra copies at the end.

1035
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,980
If anyone wants one, I'll fucking sell you that shit, I guess.

1036
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,300
I don't know, it's going to be it's going to be cool.

1037
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,860
I'm excited.

1038
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,500
I'm excited.

1039
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,740
And then all we have to do is get the video,

1040
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,380
is get the music video out and the OVA.

1041
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,820
And then we can have Radcon money.

1042
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,060
Yes. And then we. Oh, my God.

1043
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,460
No, you still have a K-Day coming in from that, don't we?

1044
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,100
And the dojin. Yeah, we still have like a all the left.

1045
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,340
Oh, and the dojin. I've got people working on the dojin.

1046
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,220
I've got people working on the dojin.

1047
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:31,340
The the yeah, PCP payday, Radcon money is is in escrow.

1048
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,820
It will all be liquidated and it will rain down upon.

1049
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,740
Like like breaking a pinata.

1050
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,140
This is what it feels like I'm doing all this work.

1051
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,940
It feels like I'm hammering away trying to break this pinata of the PCP

1052
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,580
Radcon money, just break it up.

1053
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:50,700
So it all just comes pouring down on top of you're welcome all the candy.

1054
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,100
Yes, yes, all the all the PC pennies that come exploding out.

1055
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,740
All markets down.

1056
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,460
So not worth as much as they used to be, but, you know, you do what you can.

1057
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,180
It was a bubble. It popped.

1058
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,980
I wish I wish it popped the pinata along with it.

1059
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,740
I'm still. So that's what I've been doing.

1060
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,660
That that was wait, wait, one last that's why I haven't.

1061
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,740
I've just kind of gotten around to doing game stuff again.

1062
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,860
I was going to spend this whole month doing game stuff,

1063
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,500
but I had to spend like the first, you know, a couple of days

1064
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,780
just finishing up the the Road to Radcon book stuff.

1065
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,260
But it's satisfying work and I'm excited about it.

1066
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:31,340
I don't mind. I don't mind it at all. Ha, ha.

1067
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,340
OK, anyway, go on.

1068
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,980
And I was going to say, I'm I'm still waiting for the plush

1069
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,140
to be sent to me or to get here.

1070
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,100
I'm so mad. Are they are they made?

1071
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,580
I didn't get to order one. They're not making it. So fucking mad.

1072
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,580
Oh, well, Tom, Tom, I know.

1073
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,380
That's so un-pog of you. It's super.

1074
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,660
I haven't ordered them yet.

1075
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,260
So I there's there might be so much as there might be room for someone to slip

1076
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,220
you a little, a little, a little cash on the side, a little.

1077
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,940
Yeah, yeah. Imagine not pluging.

1078
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,500
Imagine not being a pluging, dude.

1079
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,340
I had it. I had the tab open, but I got buried in fucking

1080
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,940
calling apartments and trying because I figured out while I was trying to get

1081
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,460
apartments that my phone just doesn't take calls anymore.

1082
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,900
Like I was holding my phone watching.

1083
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,540
I was I was holding my phone watching a YouTube video.

1084
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,060
It's like a Pixel 3a.

1085
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,020
So like a little Android notification popped up and says missed call.

1086
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,860
I'm like, didn't ring, didn't vibrate.

1087
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,180
It just like, eh, you don't need to know you're getting phone calls, right?

1088
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,980
So I missed like a bunch of calls from people

1089
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,820
because it just doesn't let me know I get calls anymore.

1090
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,980
I'm just like, sick. Awesome.

1091
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,580
Now are those all calls from Ohio area or is that every call?

1092
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,420
It really depends because like I know some people in Virginia

1093
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,060
and like they can they've called me.

1094
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,300
I've got notifications for that.

1095
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,020
But like sometimes Massachusetts, it's just like random.

1096
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,180
It works like it's like a coin toss.

1097
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,580
Well, I get your phone call.

1098
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,180
It really fucking depends.

1099
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,180
Yeah, I wonder if it's like some too smart for its own good spam detection.

1100
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,660
You know, that sounds like an algorithm

1101
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,540
Google would implement without my knowledge to fuck me.

1102
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,620
You could probably look and see right now.

1103
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,660
There probably is some spam detection on my phone is so bad.

1104
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,900
And it and I don't know what.

1105
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,060
OK, when I'm when I'm out and I'm not on my computer,

1106
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,380
I basically can't type anything

1107
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:32,620
because something happened to like the autocorrect settings of my phone.

1108
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,980
And I can't I've looked into how to fix it.

1109
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,100
I don't know how to I've gone to all the options

1110
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,860
and I've turned like autocorrect off and it doesn't do anything.

1111
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,260
It doesn't change this at all.

1112
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,100
But like when I'm trying to type in like discord or on Twitter or something

1113
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,300
on my phone, the autocorrect is so it's so aggressive that I can't.

1114
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,260
I literally can't type with it.

1115
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,340
It like I will I will tip.

1116
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,580
It does the thing where, you know, one button is assigned to like

1117
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,540
you three different letters and you have to hit the button three times

1118
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,260
to get to the third letter, right?

1119
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,660
It does that it does that.

1120
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,060
Wait, you're talking about.

1121
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,300
Are you typing with a T nine keyboard in twenty twenty one?

1122
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,220
No, it's a digital.

1123
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,740
No, listen, you don't understand.

1124
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,300
This is not a choice that I made.

1125
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,980
These it just did this on its own.

1126
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,260
And I cannot just download a different keyboard.

1127
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,180
Just go to the disco.

1128
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,620
G board from the Play Store.

1129
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,940
Just I guess I guess I guess you're using.

1130
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,300
I'm just using the fucking Google keyboard.

1131
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,740
The get a different one.

1132
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,180
Get like Swifty or something.

1133
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,980
Oh, my God.

1134
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,060
It's it's it's worse than that, though, because it's it's that

1135
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,700
like you have to hit the button three times.

1136
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:48,580
But it's also auto correcting to not even words, but like groups of letters.

1137
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,540
I will I will hit, you know, the button is assigned to like,

1138
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,460
you know, RQ or a fucking QQRST or whatever.

1139
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,220
So I'm trying to type an R.

1140
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,100
So I'll hit the button and it'll go to Q and then I'll type it again,

1141
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,580
trying to make an R.

1142
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,940
And it will think like, oh, you're going for like a double T.

1143
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,020
And then it will just change to like two two capital T's in a row.

1144
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,060
And then I'll be like, no, it looks like this sounds arcane as fuck.

1145
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,180
It looks no, it looks normal.

1146
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,300
It looks normal, but each key represents three letters.

1147
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,260
Don't you you've never you know how like on a on a traditional like dial

1148
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,780
phones, you know, so if you wanted to type in a letter,

1149
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,220
you would you would use the number corresponding to nine nine keyboard.

1150
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,420
Yeah.

1151
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,460
So yeah, it's like numbers with the letters behind them.

1152
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,820
It's it shows me the numbers.

1153
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,020
And then on top of the number, it has the three, you know,

1154
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,740
like one is why are you using a keyboard on a smartphone?

1155
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,620
It's it's just what it's I was using the regular Google keyboard.

1156
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,980
And now it looks like OK.

1157
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,060
Yeah, I'm sure there's there's a button

1158
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,340
somewhere on the keyboard to like change the layouts.

1159
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,340
Let you just need to you button.

1160
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,260
OK, you say that I have I have given the phone to other people

1161
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,700
being like, what is it doing?

1162
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,060
How do I make it not do this?

1163
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,900
And no one I've given it to has been able to find.

1164
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,500
Yeah, it feels like there should just be a button that fixes it on my old phone.

1165
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,980
I remember I think I had G board and I'm pretty sure I could change it

1166
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,500
to that mode if I wanted to like I've seen this.

1167
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,260
I'm sorry that this could be fixed.

1168
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,460
I'm I'm I'm sure it can be OK.

1169
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,740
But I can't figure it out and I'm not the only one.

1170
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,660
I've handed it off to people and they can't figure it out either.

1171
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,740
But it's it's so so the way the way that I've had to type on the I mean,

1172
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,820
the reason I haven't fixed it is because I almost never do it.

1173
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,500
I almost never type stuff on my phone.

1174
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,980
I use my computer.

1175
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,820
But when I'm out, I have no choice but to use my phone.

1176
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,620
So the way that I have to do it is I have to I have to

1177
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,220
hit one of the buttons, wait for it to show all of the letters that it could

1178
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,340
represent and then select that in.

1179
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,540
I can't like type it with I have to then select that letter

1180
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,980
from a side menu and then before typing any I have to hit space

1181
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,420
so that it like forgets that it's in the middle of typing a string of letters

1182
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,700
because if it if it knows that it's typing a string,

1183
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,420
it will try to auto correct the string and just completely ruin what I'm doing.

1184
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,380
It'll change change the letter that I'm currently typing to what it thinks

1185
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,820
I'm trying to type.

1186
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,180
I can't I'm looking through my settings now.

1187
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,620
I can't find T nine.

1188
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,940
But apparently you can set your keyboard to Morse code if you really wanted to.

1189
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,700
I have no idea why.

1190
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,260
Good. It would be an it would be an improvement.

1191
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,740
It would be an improvement.

1192
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,660
Go to settings then go to languages hit English Quarty

1193
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,420
and you can change the layout to handwriting Quartz, Zerdy, Dvorak

1194
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,420
or Morse code.

1195
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,020
Maybe Ben, you should just cool.

1196
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,300
You should just take this extra phone.

1197
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,340
I've got I've got this HTC phone that's really good.

1198
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,140
You can just have it.

1199
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,900
You just got to come get it. Come get it.

1200
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,220
OK. All right.

1201
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,300
It's a trap.

1202
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,500
I am you you are in.

1203
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,220
Damn, I feel like I had something else I was going to say after the phone thing.

1204
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,340
I had like two topics in mind and one was the phone.

1205
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
There was another one we were talking about before the phone.

1206
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,220
Was it was it bureaucracy, government bureaucracy?

1207
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,380
I don't know. Whatever.

1208
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,980
Kick Kickstarter stuff.

1209
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,580
Kick Kickstarter. Red man.

1210
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,780
Tearless. Red man.

1211
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,300
Tearless. I've I've derailed.

1212
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,300
I've derailed. I've lost.

1213
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,780
I've completely lost track of what's what's going on.

1214
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,780
Well, I'll show I'll show and say I have commissions open right now.

1215
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,900
So I saw they seem.

1216
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,900
OK, yeah, I saw those models you were offering.

1217
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,260
Does that include like textures?

1218
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,260
Yeah.

1219
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,820
It's a complete model.

1220
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,820
That seems like a really good value.

1221
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,140
I think it is.

1222
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,020
They're pretty low.

1223
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,940
I mean, I posted them in my Patreon discord and that someone's like

1224
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,420
message like an hour later.

1225
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,460
Oh, my favorite 3D artist open commission.

1226
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:08,900
They started $1500.

1227
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,020
I'm like, I'm a bargain compared to that.

1228
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,060
You can get to you.

1229
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,860
So OK.

1230
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,500
So does it include the modeling and the texturing

1231
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,020
and like an idling animation because they were moving?

1232
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,300
You the idle animation would be extra.

1233
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,940
I guess I don't manage to be.

1234
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:27,780
It's it includes a fully textured and rigged model

1235
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,180
with like a couple stills and a turnaround.

1236
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,540
So you'd get that and then you can pay extra

1237
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,740
if you want a little animation under six seconds

1238
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,820
and a bunch of things like the whole I'll put it in the chat.

1239
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,740
There's there's here's here's the post with all the shit there.

1240
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,260
It's got all the info there.

1241
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,740
Cool.

1242
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,020
By the way, I just want to say that Azumi that you showed.

1243
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,460
Incredible.

1244
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,700
I love her.

1245
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,540
It's so good.

1246
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,620
I'm so mad that I was like really hoping to like get more progress

1247
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,020
on the game done because I was working on a little thing

1248
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,340
and Unreal Engine moving around and have like a little jump

1249
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,300
animations and stuff.

1250
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,380
I'm like, I'll be so cool if I can fucking show this.

1251
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,660
They have a big reveal, but I needed money

1252
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,340
because I found out coming home from Ohio that the move date was

1253
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,340
moved up from October to the end of this month.

1254
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,500
So now I'm just like super panicked and need money.

1255
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,100
So it's like, well, I'm just going to be a whore

1256
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,980
and open up commissions forever now, I guess.

1257
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:31,220
So the the I mean, the Azumi game is still a 2D game.

1258
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,020
Right. I'm a worker.

1259
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,740
I was working on a 3D game and it looked really cool.

1260
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,500
Oh, I didn't.

1261
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,100
I didn't even know because it was a secret.

1262
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,300
I didn't even realize working on it in secret.

1263
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,700
But now the jigs up because I had to show off all the models

1264
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,820
that I was working on for it because I need money.

1265
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,740
And that was the only example I had of a complex model.

1266
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,820
I was thinking I hadn't heard anything

1267
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,420
about Azumi game in a little while.

1268
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,340
And I guess that explains it's a lot of ruin.

1269
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:02,180
It's all on the back burner now because I need a house slash apartment.

1270
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,060
In my opinion, 3D games are better than 2D games

1271
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,340
because there's more D. There is.

1272
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,420
There's additional D and I want the D.

1273
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,020
So I want more everybody does.

1274
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,180
That's what the people the people crave.

1275
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,380
Yeah. Exactly.

1276
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:25,060
I really I really I really like these.

1277
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,940
I'm looking at like that like they're the older models.

1278
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,740
That one like horned zombie with the big toothy mouth.

1279
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,980
I saw that before. This looked really good.

1280
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,260
This this like industrial elevator looks awesome.

1281
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,980
It looks like something out of solid metal gear or something.

1282
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,980
Yeah, I feel like metal.

1283
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:47,380
I figure like I really got the PS1 look down.

1284
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,940
I feel like it's definitely there, which was the goal.

1285
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,020
Yeah, yeah, definitely for sure.

1286
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,620
So what did you do for me?

1287
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,820
Oh, the other animations for Azumi you showed

1288
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,180
where they're running and the role, the role in particular looked so smooth.

1289
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,100
I really could imagine doing the jump and then rolling after a jump.

1290
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,100
And it just imagining you want to know why it looks good

1291
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,300
because I modeled it after Dark Souls.

1292
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,460
Oh, I went frame by frame.

1293
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,300
Dark Souls is like, how did they do it?

1294
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,020
And I was like trying to get her to do it.

1295
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,580
But like it was really hard because I did it just like Dark Souls.

1296
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,580
And then I was like, I'll just use a blend shape to blend back into the idol.

1297
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:27,820
And it like didn't work.

1298
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,220
So I had to go back and like redo the end half of the frames

1299
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,660
to have her come back to that like actual kind of like

1300
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,980
ninja pose idol animation she stays in.

1301
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,300
There's a lot learned a lot is really interesting.

1302
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,300
3D animation is so fucking confusing.

1303
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,300
Dude, it's all those different little little rotatory.

1304
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,420
I opened up the graph editor for the first time and I cried.

1305
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,460
It was terrifying.

1306
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,900
Every single part of the skeleton has like

1307
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,940
nine different graphs for each like rotation and location axis.

1308
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,220
And then you just open up the graph and there's like 500 lines.

1309
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,940
And it's like, you need to manually adjust these.

1310
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,220
I'm just like, it's scary.

1311
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,300
Oh, yeah, the curve. Yeah.

1312
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,700
The curve fuckers. I could never.

1313
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,860
We got to flatten the curve. Yeah.

1314
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,700
Yeah. If you flatten the curve, you can right click.

1315
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,900
You can be like a straight line, please.

1316
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,420
Yeah, yeah. But then it's all jerky.

1317
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,100
Yeah. If you're making guilty gear, that's what you want.

1318
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,660
That's how you make it look like an enemy.

1319
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,420
Yeah, guilty gear. Never heard of it.

1320
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,900
Hey, I watched those.

1321
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,060
I watched those woolly versus lower videos.

1322
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,180
Yeah. And at first I thought they were kind of good.

1323
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,500
But actually, I don't think they're that good.

1324
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,380
Like they're just OK.

1325
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,700
I watched the first one. I think your lecture is better.

1326
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,700
I haven't watched the rest of them.

1327
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,900
Well, yeah.

1328
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,140
But by the I let the whole series play out in the background

1329
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,100
and by the end of it, I was like,

1330
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,060
he's just recounting the plot of the game.

1331
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,300
He's just he's just giving a point by point.

1332
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,620
This happened and this happened and this happened and this happened.

1333
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,300
It's the lecture, your lecture is a better like top down overview

1334
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,900
of the lore of the world of guilty gear.

1335
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:09,340
His where's his are just a recounting of these are the stories

1336
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:12,340
in the games, which is fine.

1337
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,620
It's a different goal, I guess.

1338
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:18,900
It's it's yeah, I think there's that speaking of the lectures

1339
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,460
having like unique benefits, it's sort of like the difference between

1340
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,660
reading a textbook and then asking the teacher what the hell

1341
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:34,940
the textbook means and then getting an answer tailored to the question

1342
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,940
because the lecture has more of that.

1343
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,300
Obviously, not the audience at home can't like ask questions

1344
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,300
and get an answer in real time when the audience aspect of it.

1345
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,140
It helps with some of the more confusing things that

1346
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:51,940
may just be hard to read or just when you you say them flatly

1347
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,780
in like a plot synopsis, you're like, huh?

1348
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,540
I don't get how that follows.

1349
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,740
I don't get how it tracks and you can ask the person in the lecture how.

1350
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,420
When the audience is unfamiliar with the subject matter

1351
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,860
and they react in real time to like the surprising elements of it,

1352
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,660
that's really good.

1353
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,420
That adds a lot.

1354
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:17,500
And then when they're confused or when they notice like a contradiction

1355
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,220
or a or a weird element and they ask about it

1356
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:23,460
just because it's like what they were thinking, you know, for sure,

1357
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:27,020
some portion of the audience of the lecture at home is probably also wondering

1358
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,340
about that thing, right?

1359
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,980
If you thought of it and you were like, hey, what's what's the deal with that?

1360
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,980
And then you ask it and then you get to the the lecturer

1361
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,620
who doesn't have a written response to it, but they get to sort of opine

1362
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,260
and give their thoughts about like, well, here's what I think is the deal with that.

1363
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,180
Or like, oh, yeah, actually, I I wouldn't have mentioned it.

1364
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,900
But actually, that is interesting.

1365
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,620
So I'll go on a little tangent about it.

1366
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,180
Yeah, it's good.

1367
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,700
It's a good vehicle.

1368
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,660
It's sort of it's it's more.

1369
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,260
I think it's more.

1370
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,300
I think it's a more engaging than like a video essay format in a lot of cases.

1371
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,300
Yeah.

1372
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:02,980
Adds a lot.

1373
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,820
The freeform nature of it's pretty close.

1374
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,060
Yeah, I think so.

1375
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,660
Yeah.

1376
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:12,100
Oh, Pog, I really should do more.

1377
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,820
That would be I mean, that would be the thing to do, right, based on like

1378
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,780
with the kind of views that my videos get.

1379
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:21,700
It's very, very clear that what I should be doing with my channel

1380
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,180
is making more lectures about stuff.

1381
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:28,260
That's what the people respond to, but I have no idea what I would do one on.

1382
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,500
And also organizing.

1383
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,820
Organizing is really hard.

1384
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,780
It's a lot of prep.

1385
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,220
It's very hard.

1386
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:35,660
Yeah.

1387
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,340
And that's why only like three people outside of the PCP have done.

1388
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:43,500
I think it's important to realize because everyone, a lot of people are just like,

1389
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,540
well, you know, it's just a video essay.

1390
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,060
Why not just do it as a video essay?

1391
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,500
And like, why does it take so much work?

1392
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,500
It's like because the video essay, you have a script that you've written all out.

1393
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,620
You can retake things.

1394
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:59,340
If we're doing these live off the cuff, pretty much, we just have like rough notes

1395
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,700
and you just have to speak it all.

1396
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,540
You have to be familiar enough with it to talk about it conversationally,

1397
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,980
but keep the structure of a video essay.

1398
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,100
It's tricky.

1399
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,540
Yeah.

1400
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,460
Well, something that doesn't Victor have the teleprompter.

1401
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,300
He's holding up.

1402
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,580
He's holding up flashcards.

1403
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:13,900
We're not.

1404
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,820
No, nobody knows about that.

1405
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,020
Cut that part.

1406
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,740
He's the cue cards.

1407
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,820
He hands out to the audience members when to laugh.

1408
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,020
Yeah.

1409
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,620
There's there's an applause sign just right out of frame.

1410
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:27,900
Yep.

1411
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,900
There's a there's a riff.

1412
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:34,580
There's a sign that says riff to alert the audience to start riffing.

1413
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,060
And in that one, like 360.

1414
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,780
The one that was the same.

1415
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,300
What was it?

1416
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,620
The your first one, Ben, we had the 360 camera.

1417
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,620
That version lecture in 360.

1418
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,220
Such a stupid idea.

1419
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,540
But like, whatever.

1420
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:52,540
Sure.

1421
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,620
Why not like that one?

1422
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,460
That one has like the cue cards as well.

1423
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,100
But they're always not where you're looking.

1424
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,820
It just so happens that it's.

1425
01:09:58,860 --> 01:09:59,860
Yeah.

1426
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,220
No, you know, it's just like the moon landing.

1427
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,660
You know, Apollo 11, they faked it, not real.

1428
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,020
And that's that's what Ben was doing in that one.

1429
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,860
That was the fake one.

1430
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:13,420
It was all preplanned and everything.

1431
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,540
But Apollo 13, where they had all the problems, that was the real one.

1432
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,380
That's why it went so bad.

1433
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,260
They had to do it for real.

1434
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,700
It wasn't in Hollywood.

1435
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,140
And that's why they couldn't do the 360 anymore.

1436
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,380
You guys couldn't do the 360.

1437
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,860
You had to do it for real.

1438
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,860
We blew our budget on the first one.

1439
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:30,020
We had to make the lectures real.

1440
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:33,540
What one thing that I don't one thing

1441
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,580
that I don't think I could do a lecture on.

1442
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,340
But I think I sometimes I think about doing basically a video essay about

1443
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,260
is that thing that that old forum

1444
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,900
from the people that believe that Digimon were real, the real Digimon.

1445
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,500
Oh, yeah, you were talking about that way back.

1446
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:56,020
Or the Digi Clips and yeah, I considered even back like when I was

1447
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,820
I think when I was about to do the Sonichu 101 lecture,

1448
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,820
I was thinking maybe I could also do one on the Adragon too.

1449
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,740
I was really hype about it. Yeah.

1450
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,140
Well, I tried looking up information on it.

1451
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:11,100
And like a lot of the info that I used to have has been like scrubbed.

1452
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,580
There is OK.

1453
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:16,820
There was like when I learned about the when I learned about the Digi Clips,

1454
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:18,860
you could the forums still existed.

1455
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,700
And I went to the forums and I read through the threads and they were pretty funny.

1456
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:28,380
Now, like the only evidence that exists of it is the something awful thread

1457
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,380
or the something awful post from years and years ago.

1458
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:36,460
So I think what I would have to do if I did that video is I would I could.

1459
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,140
Yeah, I could summarize like what's on the something awful thread.

1460
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,260
What was the deal with it?

1461
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,300
What happened?

1462
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,820
And then I think a big chunk of that video would just be being me being like,

1463
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,540
hey, guys, I can't prove any of this,

1464
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,780
but let me just tell you some really funny shit that I remember seeing

1465
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,740
from the the real Digimon Believers Forum,

1466
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,300
like in the aftermath of the something awful rate.

1467
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,020
I don't know. I don't know if that's really going to be good.

1468
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:03,780
That doesn't sound that great.

1469
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:08,300
You know, damn, I thought it might be funny.

1470
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,500
But OK, I mean, never mind.

1471
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:14,340
Bummer.

1472
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,660
I don't know. It's it's that one's a that one's a read.

1473
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:23,980
That's one of the funniest stories of Internet buffoonery that I have seen.

1474
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:27,020
And nobody talks about it probably because it's all like gone.

1475
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,740
The information is not like on archive.org or anything.

1476
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,140
It's just all been scrubbed for real.

1477
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,660
I have I have tried to find like I've tried to use like the wayback machine

1478
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:41,180
to go back and like look at the old forum post and I wasn't able to do it.

1479
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,180
I am.

1480
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,380
Maybe one of these.

1481
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,420
What a nightmare.

1482
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,260
They'll try archive.

1483
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:51,100
So what you're saying is that not only are the PCP lectures great pieces of art,

1484
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:54,820
they're also like cultural archiving projects.

1485
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,740
That is precisely what I'm saying.

1486
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:01,260
Wait, is archive.org and wayback machine the same thing?

1487
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,100
Yeah, I think the wayback machine is powered by archive.org.

1488
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,300
Yeah, yeah, it is. OK.

1489
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,700
Oh, well. Oh, well.

1490
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:18,020
Um, I just think the DigiClips is really funny.

1491
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,020
OK, what else?

1492
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,340
How's everyone doing? How's everyone's man?

1493
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,940
You know what I wanted to talk about?

1494
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,660
I wanted to talk about what's the process of buying a house

1495
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,420
because it's it's really fucking mysterious.

1496
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,260
I just recently went through and I bought bought my first house.

1497
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,580
Pretty exciting. Jesus.

1498
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,460
Yeah, I've seen your your update.

1499
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,380
Your update posts about the renovation.

1500
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:46,540
Yeah. And it's like it's it's so much more difficult

1501
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,060
than you would even imagine, right?

1502
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,780
Like in order in order to buy a house, you know, you start,

1503
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,220
you go to like Zillow dot com and you're like, oh,

1504
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,820
look at all these houses for sale. I can just just go on.

1505
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,820
You just go on eBay.

1506
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:58,500
I could just pick any one I want.

1507
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,820
And I'd like, hello, sir, I'd like to buy your house.

1508
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,900
What?

1509
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,500
Me, it's yeah, millennial, millennial, stupidly.

1510
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:09,420
Avocado toast, please.

1511
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,220
Me, nodding wisely, one house.

1512
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,300
Yeah, it's just that.

1513
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,220
But but it's so much worse.

1514
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:20,220
So you have to first of all, you have to find yourself

1515
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,060
a real estate agent, right?

1516
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,220
So you find your agent, you have to need an agent.

1517
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:28,380
If you don't have a they call it your buyer's agent.

1518
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,140
If you don't have an agent, you're fucked.

1519
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,500
You're not even going to get to see the houses.

1520
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,940
So that's like the first step.

1521
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,780
You find an agent and then you find a house you want to look at

1522
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,740
and you tell the agent, hey, can you talk to their agent

1523
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,180
and get me into the showing?

1524
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:46,220
Right. And you have every house is selling within like a few days.

1525
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:50,220
So you have to find a house immediately email your agent,

1526
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,740
get the agent to set up a showing like the next day.

1527
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,420
And then you can put an offer on the house like the day after that.

1528
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,700
And the offer process, you would think like, OK, just tell him,

1529
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,620
yeah, I'll give you your asking two hundred ninety thousand.

1530
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,820
I'll give you two hundred ninety, right?

1531
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:08,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1532
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:14,860
You have to find a loan officer, somebody who works for like a mortgage company.

1533
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:19,140
And then tell them what the house that you want to buy

1534
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,340
and what you think you want to offer.

1535
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,820
And then they have to pre approve you for a mortgage

1536
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,660
for like a little bit more than that, but not too much more.

1537
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,940
Otherwise, it looks suspicious to the seller's agent.

1538
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,100
So you get this pre approval letter and they won't produce that

1539
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,300
unless you give them like bank statements

1540
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,220
and like pay stubs for a couple of months of recent history.

1541
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,860
So there's this whole process, right?

1542
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,140
And if you manage to navigate this, you got your pre approval,

1543
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,180
you put your offer in, you'll still fail.

1544
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,820
You'll still fail because if you offered two hundred ninety,

1545
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,820
you're asking two hundred ninety.

1546
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,940
You're not even you're not even on the table.

1547
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,220
You're not even playing the game.

1548
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:06,700
Oh, oh, is it like a game where like everybody knows that like, yeah,

1549
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,940
you say two ninety, but it's like how much more exactly.

1550
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,500
It's this whole fucking game.

1551
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,460
So you go to Zillow or whatever, you see the price the house is listed

1552
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,060
or realtor.com or whatever.

1553
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,420
All that's another thing.

1554
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,140
All the sites are all pulling from the same one database.

1555
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:25,500
There's only one database of listed houses and every every like,

1556
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,700
oh, we'll find you a house site is just pulling off of the same database.

1557
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:33,820
And then they reformat it with their own CSS in some way.

1558
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,020
So that's a whole scam.

1559
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,980
Wow. Capitalism sure does breed innovation, right?

1560
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:45,220
But yeah, every day I find a new reason to fucking buy a guillotine.

1561
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,980
It's incredible. Yeah, it's crazy.

1562
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,780
They list their house for for some number.

1563
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,060
They have some number that it's supposedly worth.

1564
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,260
And nothing is worth what they're listing it for.

1565
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:57,020
But that's what they say, you know, because the housing market right now

1566
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,540
is just like going up and up and up to infinity.

1567
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:03,620
So you got to you got to come up with your your pre-approved mortgage,

1568
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:09,820
whatever document that says you're you're worth like like 10 percent more

1569
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:13,460
than you need, and then you got to offer like five percent more than they're asking.

1570
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:16,580
And that might get you considered.

1571
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,660
But then there's like all these.

1572
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:22,580
So there's different types of mortgages and like the the buyer's agent

1573
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,900
will convince them that different mortgages are better or worse.

1574
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,380
And so they'll disqualify certain buyers.

1575
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,460
Excuse me, the seller's agent will convince the seller

1576
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,820
that different mortgage types are like better or worse.

1577
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:38,900
Like they don't they won't take the the VA loans from veterans

1578
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:43,300
because that has contingencies and that's you don't want that.

1579
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:45,300
You don't want contingencies. That's bad.

1580
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,220
So they only want convention. No, obviously.

1581
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,020
They only want obviously, you don't want.

1582
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,500
What kind of a fool would be OK with contingencies?

1583
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,860
They want the buyer to have a conventional mortgage with no contingencies

1584
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,900
or ideally cash.

1585
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:02,780
And you're like, no, who has who has hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash?

1586
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,860
Right. If you could just if you could just buy it with cash.

1587
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:08,020
What's the point of all this fucking rigmarole?

1588
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:10,500
But but you still have to do it. You still have to do it.

1589
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,900
You know, such an alien.

1590
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,860
I like how you've just confirmed that I will never own a house.

1591
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,380
Like, like, but no, no, it gets worse.

1592
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,380
Tom, it gets worse. I mean, you can believe it.

1593
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,020
It's I'm sure it can.

1594
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,820
We live in America and everything can get worse.

1595
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,060
So you kidding me?

1596
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:32,340
So I for my personal house, they did list it.

1597
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:37,580
I think they listed for 280 and I offer 290 and I wasn't even the highest offer.

1598
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,580
But again, I had the conventional mortgage.

1599
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:40,860
And so that got me it.

1600
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,860
They said, OK, we'll take your offer.

1601
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,780
But then I had my contingencies.

1602
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,820
So I said, I have to do a home inspection before I'll buy the house, right?

1603
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:53,420
If the home inspection says the house is no good, then I'll walk away, right?

1604
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,340
Or we can negotiate on the price.

1605
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,140
And I was lucky that they accepted that because now a lot of the time,

1606
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,020
you can't even do that.

1607
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,420
You have to just like buy it as is pretty much sight unseen.

1608
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:06,420
You walk through the house one time for five minutes, right?

1609
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,980
Sure. And then you realize there's like ants in the walls and demons under the floor.

1610
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:17,580
Yeah. So. Oh, so then you got speaking of speaking of ants in the walls

1611
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,780
after the store, I got to tell you about the ants.

1612
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,380
OK. Oh, OK.

1613
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:25,420
Well, this is a this is a note about apartment hunting, right?

1614
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,220
This is about moving.

1615
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,060
This is about homes, I guess.

1616
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,820
Just a funny story.

1617
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,940
I moved in to this temporary house that I'm staying in for a month

1618
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:36,540
before I start my other lease at another place in September.

1619
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,740
When I moved in, my roommate here, I barely see him like at all.

1620
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:44,220
He just stays in his room, smokes weed, fine by me.

1621
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,900
Yeah. I moved in.

1622
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,420
There was a pizza in a box on the floor.

1623
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:53,380
Yeah. In the main living room.

1624
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,980
No pizza in the box.

1625
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,260
I'm like, OK, guy was eating a pizza.

1626
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,900
That's cool. I like pizza.

1627
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,140
It makes sense. It is.

1628
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,540
It is. It's the eighth.

1629
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,860
It's the eighth of the month.

1630
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,700
The pizza is still there.

1631
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,460
There's ants crawling into the box.

1632
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:14,060
And I'm I'm at the point where I'm like, I think I might need to do something about.

1633
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,700
I know it's not my pizza to move.

1634
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,860
I may be my apartment to deal with this pizza situation.

1635
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,900
You're looking at it too short term, right?

1636
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,700
Because eventually the ants will have consumed the pizza.

1637
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,940
No, the problem solves it.

1638
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,060
That's probably what he was thinking.

1639
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,220
He was like, I could pick this up or the ants will take care of it for me.

1640
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:38,860
Why why spend the effort doing what the what nature will do.

1641
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:42,660
Exactly. He's got an army of mates working for essentially.

1642
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,460
Yeah, maybe he's got to figure it out.

1643
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:49,980
Man, man, so so back at the ranch here.

1644
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,220
Yeah. Yeah.

1645
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,460
So I have to have the home inspection done.

1646
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:58,460
I hire a home inspector costs a thousand bucks, which, you know,

1647
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,540
you think, oh, a thousand dollars, that's a lot of money.

1648
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,100
But no, you'll be believing a thousand bucks here and there.

1649
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,580
The whole process, that's just constant.

1650
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,940
Yeah. Yeah. Everybody needs their fucking every fucking bloodsucker

1651
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,180
involved in this process needs their needs.

1652
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:12,740
Oh, yeah.

1653
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,020
It's because the entire industry needs to die.

1654
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:19,940
But yeah, the the big guy comes at the end of hidden surprise fees.

1655
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:26,740
But so you get the home inspection and then you also need to get an appraisal done.

1656
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:28,980
So you think you know what the house is worth.

1657
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:32,260
You made an offer that you believe is more than what the house is worth,

1658
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,060
but otherwise you won't get it.

1659
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:37,180
Now you need to convince somebody who works for the bank

1660
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:40,900
that the house is worth at least the offer that you made on the house

1661
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,300
that you know is more than the house is worth.

1662
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,860
Say that again.

1663
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:50,180
So they you have to hire an appraiser who comes in and they value the house

1664
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,700
and they have to come up with a valuation that's more than your offer.

1665
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,900
Otherwise, you can't get a mortgage.

1666
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:02,180
They have to value the house that you are buying that is more than your offer.

1667
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,340
Otherwise, you can't.

1668
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:07,460
Why do they want the value to be bigger than what you want to have a mortgage

1669
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:10,980
on a house that they think is worth less than what you want to pay for?

1670
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,540
So you have to convince the bank to give you money.

1671
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,180
And then you have to convince the bank to let you spend the money.

1672
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,940
So basically, you pay you pay this appraiser.

1673
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,460
You pay this appraiser to to tell the bank.

1674
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,180
No, it's a good deal. No, it's a good deal.

1675
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,180
You have to pay the bank to tell them that they're fucking you.

1676
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:30,220
You already know what the house was worth.

1677
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:34,100
You made an offer that's more than that because the bank makes you pay

1678
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:38,100
to tell them that you are fucking yourself over for their benefit.

1679
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,940
And that you're happy about it and they can convince them that.

1680
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,820
No, no, no, it's time to burn it all down.

1681
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:48,900
Burn it all down, pay more and less, but not actually.

1682
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,380
Yeah. OK, crack.

1683
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:53,580
Why did you do this?

1684
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:57,620
Well, I'll tell you why, because it's way cheaper than renting.

1685
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,300
And I can I can do it in the long run.

1686
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,500
But at what cost immediately immediately?

1687
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
You just it just costs you your dignity.

1688
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,220
It's it's not it doesn't cost.

1689
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,580
It's not immediately cheaper because you don't have to spend

1690
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,820
two hundred and ninety thousand dollars to immediately to rent.

1691
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,700
No, no, it's immediately cheaper

1692
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:18,260
because you ever do you ever think about how you can like 3D print

1693
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:21,780
an entire house for nine grand and for some reason we're not doing it.

1694
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,260
We know why we're not doing it, but isn't it strange?

1695
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:30,140
Yeah. So so you go through the sole process, right?

1696
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,820
You get the appraisal, the appraisal.

1697
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,500
If you're lucky, it comes in at the number you need.

1698
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,020
You've got the magical valuation, your offer was accepted,

1699
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,700
you're approved.

1700
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,500
Now, maybe if you're lucky, the mortgage company,

1701
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,740
the loan guys will actually come through with the money

1702
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,380
before the deadline that the seller is set.

1703
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:53,300
Now, there's like an extra three weeks where like they're just coming up

1704
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:56,980
with the money and going through all of your your finances and history.

1705
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,460
Just secretly, there's this underwriting process, they call it,

1706
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:03,940
where they're just they're digging into your history in a deep background check

1707
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,220
and like maybe anything they can do to be good.

1708
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,580
Yes, or anyway, is there anything in here?

1709
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,500
Or anywhere we can just run with all the money

1710
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,820
they've already spent on this process and make them restart the whole thing.

1711
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,620
That is correct.

1712
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:20,940
So if you get through all of that, I see.

1713
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,660
If you get through all of that, it sounds a lot cheaper to buy a gun

1714
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,140
and start going to Wall Street.

1715
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,900
Yeah, the same.

1716
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,780
Don't say that you can't you can't bleep it.

1717
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,020
If you get through all of that, then the big kicker comes.

1718
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,060
You have to hire a lawyer who will do what's called the closing

1719
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:43,060
and you go to the lawyer's office and sign all the paperwork and everything.

1720
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,660
And then you need to both pay the lawyer

1721
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,820
and the company giving you the mortgage, a shitload of money.

1722
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,300
So like in my house, for example,

1723
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:56,980
I was going to pay five percent of the price as my down payment.

1724
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:00,820
I needed an additional five percent of the overall cost of the house

1725
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:04,420
just to pay the the lawyer in the bank, the closing costs.

1726
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,380
All the all the fees.

1727
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:08,380
Yeah, just lost money to fees.

1728
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:12,980
Yeah, an additional five percent five five five percent of the of the cost

1729
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,940
of the total value of the house.

1730
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,620
So it's like, you know, if you talk to a boomer about this and they'll say,

1731
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:22,860
oh, yeah, to buy a house, you got to have 20 percent down payment.

1732
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:27,580
You want to have 20 percent of the you will never you will never be able to do it.

1733
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:29,900
Right. If your house was three hundred thousand dollars,

1734
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:33,660
you would need $60,000 and then probably

1735
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:36,780
twenty thousand dollars on top of that to pay for closing costs.

1736
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,700
It's impossible. You cannot do it. Right.

1737
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:43,340
So I was able to do it was this is 10 percent.

1738
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,660
This is because, yeah.

1739
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,060
Wait, I thought you said, wait, how do you do it with 10 percent?

1740
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,300
I thought you said 20 percent was was not enough.

1741
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,420
Yeah, no, no, no.

1742
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:55,260
So they tell you you need 20 percent because if you pay 20 percent down,

1743
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:59,380
then you can avoid private mortgage insurance, which is an additional monthly cost.

1744
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,620
But it's impossible. You cannot do it

1745
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:07,500
because nobody nobody could save 20 percent of the value of a house today.

1746
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,580
Man, all of this fucking process, it's a good thing.

1747
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,380
This process isn't in the way of something essential like housing.

1748
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,940
You know, that would seem kind of cruel.

1749
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,820
Yeah. Oh, meanwhile, right?

1750
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:22,340
Like you're renting a place and you you don't do I pay my rent this month

1751
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,860
because I'm going to stay here another month.

1752
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:25,780
I don't know when will we close?

1753
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,180
I have no idea. Right.

1754
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:32,060
So you better plan to rent a house and also buy a house

1755
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,860
at the same time for a couple of months and have them overlap.

1756
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,580
Otherwise, you're back.

1757
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,860
Yeah, I see. I see.

1758
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,260
I see. Pretty exciting.

1759
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,460
Pretty good. Yeah.

1760
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,860
The surprise at the end where it's just like stuff.

1761
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,980
Oh, yeah. You remember how you had your down payment?

1762
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:49,540
Well, if you just have all of that money that you saved up,

1763
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:52,780
if you could just have already saved twice as much of that

1764
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:56,180
to pay the other guy, that'd be great.

1765
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:00,460
So what what a closing cost to other than nothing?

1766
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,660
Closing costs. It's just a scam.

1767
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:06,940
It pays the lawyer that you sign the documents for that.

1768
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:09,100
And then you pay the bank that's giving you the money.

1769
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,660
You pay them.

1770
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:16,860
Haven't you already paid them for giving you money?

1771
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:19,860
You already paid them twice, though.

1772
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:26,860
No, you pay them because then they disperse part of those costs

1773
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:30,140
to pay the the two real estate agents who are involved.

1774
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,220
So because they have to get paid, that's how they get paid.

1775
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:39,380
And I remember when you could just go to a store and buy something.

1776
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,380
Yeah, that was cute.

1777
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:45,300
I that it feels like it would be cheaper

1778
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:51,660
to buy the necessary materials to build a house in the woods.

1779
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,860
Yes, it feels like it would be cheaper.

1780
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,100
But you don't own the land, so you can't build out there.

1781
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,580
So you'll get arrested.

1782
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:00,660
You need you need to you need to buy the land.

1783
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,460
And I mean, you you can't really build a house yourself.

1784
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:06,860
So you need to you need to like hire contractors for that.

1785
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:10,140
That's I'm sure that's it's I've played mine.

1786
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:14,820
I'll tell you hiring contractors is a whole separate pain in the ass.

1787
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:16,940
Yeah, I can only imagine.

1788
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,420
So I move into this house and the roof starts leaking.

1789
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:21,820
And I'm like, all right, cool, cool.

1790
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:24,180
And I paid three hundred thousand dollars.

1791
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,340
Yeah, no big deal.

1792
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,740
I'll just hire a roofer to come out and and check it out.

1793
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,900
Fix it, right? No big deal.

1794
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,300
Hmm. Yeah.

1795
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,940
Well, I'll tell you, I've had obvious.

1796
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:37,060
I've called like 10 different roofers.

1797
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:40,460
I got one to come out and they had to come back five times to keep fixing it

1798
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,060
because they fucked it up every time.

1799
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,500
And that's just how it goes.

1800
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:49,420
OK, you just you just smile and say, oh, good to see you again.

1801
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,180
How's it going, Bill at the roof and company?

1802
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,940
We're on a first name basis.

1803
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:57,900
And that's just how he likes it.

1804
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,580
This is what he wants.

1805
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,860
Now, did you have to play every time?

1806
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:05,260
Or did he actually like have no, no, I only had to pay him the first time

1807
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:09,180
when they supposedly fixed it and then they came back four or five times for free.

1808
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:12,620
But, you know, the only cost is water has been pouring down

1809
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:16,340
on my sofa and my computer five times during the rain.

1810
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,380
Not a big deal.

1811
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,060
No, of course, I take it.

1812
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,420
You know, it's funny, I was it's funny.

1813
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:28,140
I just was I was just telling I was having a conversation

1814
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:33,620
with Kazi the other day about about spending about, like,

1815
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,980
you know, using using money to, like, make create more money

1816
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:42,380
and how like home ownership is like the is like the thing.

1817
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,420
It's like the thing that you do to, like, to, like, build wealth in America.

1818
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,060
That is a thousand percent true.

1819
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:48,780
And I'll tell you.

1820
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:54,380
So in order to buy the house, what I did was cash out my 401k for my old job,

1821
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:59,340
which I could do with no fee because of the pandemic,

1822
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:04,420
because of the pandemic, all 401k cash out if you if you had a quote unquote

1823
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:10,940
pandemic related impact to your finances, which everyone did.

1824
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,100
So you could cash it out with no fee.

1825
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:17,900
And I took that money and then combine that with some some money

1826
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,180
that I got when the company I worked for got bought out, which was like,

1827
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:25,340
I didn't have much savings, but the two of those together was just enough

1828
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,540
to have like 10 percent of this house.

1829
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:30,220
So it was just barely enough money, right?

1830
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,420
And if you look at the value of the house today,

1831
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:38,980
just like a few months later, I bought this in December and November.

1832
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:44,220
I already, on paper, have way more money than I had before I bought the house.

1833
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:49,620
Like, I'm I'm just make including including like the value of the house.

1834
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:53,020
If you look at the net, if you look at the value of the house today

1835
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:58,220
versus like what I spent on it, I already have made back all that money.

1836
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:59,780
Like it's no big deal.

1837
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,300
Yeah. Yeah.

1838
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:04,100
And, you know, and it's good for the foreseeable future.

1839
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,140
Like and so my monthly costs are lower.

1840
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,940
I already have that that extra value.

1841
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:14,060
Like I there's no downsides as far as I'm concerned,

1842
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:18,180
except for everything you just said for the night, the nightmare process.

1843
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:21,100
The nightmare process of the except for one needing

1844
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,900
front fee that you need. Yeah. Yeah.

1845
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:29,660
So honestly, what I would recommend if you have if you have a regular income,

1846
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:34,300
like if you have a steady income and you can somehow like liquidate a bunch

1847
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,860
of shit to get just enough money to get your foot in the door and buy a house,

1848
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:43,580
do it. It is absolutely worth it because you then immediately start saving money.

1849
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,020
Yeah. Because once you have the mortgage,

1850
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:49,180
once you have the house and you have the mortgage,

1851
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:52,940
your rent payments are basically going to yourself. That's correct.

1852
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,420
Yeah. So it's just, you know, I pay like

1853
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:01,580
like $300, let's say, of my mortgage payment is just lost to interest or whatever.

1854
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:06,020
But the other like $1,200 goes basically into a bank account.

1855
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:09,420
Right. Yeah. Which is which is sick.

1856
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:14,740
You have you have assumed debt and now your rent goes to like pay down.

1857
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,500
Yeah, exactly.

1858
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,860
More or less. Yeah.

1859
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,860
And and it's not just lost, right?

1860
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:20,860
Because all that debt is just equity.

1861
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:25,060
It's just I own a greater percentage of it's the value of the house. Exactly.

1862
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,500
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1863
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:31,980
That's um, but I'm too hard, though.

1864
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,660
So hard for capitalism.

1865
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:36,060
It's so annoying. It's too much.

1866
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,180
Yeah. It's, you know, it seemed basically impossible.

1867
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:41,580
It sounds all the way up until I did it.

1868
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:44,100
Yeah. Yeah.

1869
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,020
I just can't imagine having a large lump sum of money.

1870
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,380
I don't even know what that looks like. I have no idea.

1871
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,580
I just, I don't know.

1872
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,660
I still get excited when I find a quarter.

1873
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,060
I'm just like, oh, my God.

1874
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:02,460
It's the most the most affordable houses are like out, you know,

1875
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,940
they're out of way from like, you know, civilization.

1876
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,140
And I like I like urban.

1877
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,140
I like urban living.

1878
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:12,660
And I could never afford a building in like the city.

1879
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,420
Yeah. Yeah.

1880
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:16,340
I mean, yeah, that's housing costs.

1881
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:19,260
Real estate costs is location, location, location.

1882
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:22,580
Yeah, for sure. And I was able to save some money.

1883
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,820
I bought a small house and I bought it.

1884
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:29,220
You know, next to Worcester, instead of Boston, where where it's a little cheaper.

1885
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:33,380
Yeah. I just want a house the size of a studio that costs like nothing

1886
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,420
in the middle of nowhere, as long as I get decent internet.

1887
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:37,420
That's all I care about.

1888
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,300
But the inside of my house is like a thousand square feet or so.

1889
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,940
Maybe a little bit more if you count some of the loft area.

1890
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:47,980
So it's not like a big house, but I've also got gigabit fiber.

1891
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:51,700
So like I got the killer internet and it's it's sick.

1892
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,620
Honestly, I love it.

1893
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:57,140
Think how much slime you can mine with a connection like that.

1894
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:03,380
Why do you think you got the profits are the profits are skyrocketing?

1895
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,380
Like I said, I'm already making money.

1896
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,940
It's all it's all in slime, but I'm making money.

1897
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,020
I don't have money for the down payment.

1898
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,020
But if you look at my.

1899
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,420
Also, I'll sell you I'll sell you my discord account

1900
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,380
that's tied to my endless war profile that has like so

1901
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:30,940
is like quadrillions of slime coin slime, corn, gold, farming.

1902
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:34,140
You could probably get pretty far doping someone

1903
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:36,860
into thinking that it's an actual cryptocurrency.

1904
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:41,380
Yeah, I mean, the only thing that gives crypto value is faith.

1905
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,820
So like there's no reason you couldn't just make it.

1906
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:47,460
The block chain, Tom, nobody knows what the block chain is.

1907
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:48,580
You just say that you're on the block.

1908
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:52,140
It's all the it's all the Persian general problem or whatever.

1909
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,460
Tom literally don't know what you're talking about.

1910
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:59,900
I it's that some fucking thought experiment that Bitcoiners are like,

1911
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:02,220
oh, it's it's an age old question.

1912
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:05,140
And Bitcoin's the all the greatest solution mankind has ever

1913
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,620
has ever come up when I when I think of block chain.

1914
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,260
Well, I can think of is cube anal beads.

1915
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,700
Gross. Oh, I'm just saying I get it.

1916
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,300
But I don't like it.

1917
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,500
That's fucked up.

1918
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:25,220
Man, speaking of speaking of horrible things, speaking of

1919
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:29,380
disappointments, speaking of speaking of speaking of both.

1920
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:32,180
Speaking of speaking of things that go up your ass.

1921
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,060
Bitcoin is on the rise again.

1922
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,820
People are saying it's rallying again.

1923
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,220
I know.

1924
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,180
GPU. Holy shit.

1925
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,540
I haven't been able to render in cycles for three fucking years.

1926
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,180
It fell under 30 K for a while.

1927
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,020
And now it is it's almost back up to 45.

1928
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:52,820
People are saying, oh, people 100 K.

1929
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,500
Crack, were you able to get a GPU?

1930
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,940
Do you even need the GPU?

1931
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,260
No, I've been running.

1932
01:35:58,260 --> 01:36:02,140
I've got a GTX 970 or something.

1933
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,100
I've been running that shit since it came out.

1934
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,260
And it's great.

1935
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:08,820
I I got it right before GPU prices started going totally insane.

1936
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,060
So it's like I'm so, dude, I have.

1937
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:14,260
OK, I almost bought a 20 60.

1938
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,700
But I was like, eh, the three thousand series will come out.

1939
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,300
And that fucked me.

1940
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,260
But then I found one.

1941
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,820
I got a 30 60 TI.

1942
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:22,660
I paid way too much, but I got it.

1943
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,180
And then it was defective.

1944
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,340
And I was like, oh, fuck.

1945
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,940
New egg was like, we can't.

1946
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,860
We don't accept returns on this item.

1947
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,900
We can only replace it.

1948
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,420
I'm like, oh, so you'll send me another one.

1949
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:36,620
And then I waited two weeks and they're like, we have no stock.

1950
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,300
Here's your money back.

1951
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,340
I'm like, back.

1952
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:40,620
Got him.

1953
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,180
And it's been it's been a nightmare ever since.

1954
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,340
That's terrible.

1955
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:47,260
And yeah, I've been trying to get like a 30 70.

1956
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,700
And it's just you can't do it.

1957
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:49,900
I mean, I'm just at this point.

1958
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,860
I'm just like, I'm just going to get a four thousand series.

1959
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:53,900
They're going to come out next year like clockwork anyway.

1960
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:58,700
So like, yeah, and hopefully they make more of them right there.

1961
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,100
The rumors right now is that like, oh, they're going to be like

1962
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:05,860
twice as power consumption, but like twice as powerful as the 30 series.

1963
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:08,900
I'm like, so they're just going to like charge scalper prices at MSRP now

1964
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,340
because they realize they can get away with it.

1965
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:12,100
Yeah, exactly.

1966
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:12,980
They're just going to come out.

1967
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,060
It's going to be a thousand bucks.

1968
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,940
Yeah, it's going to be 70 or whatever.

1969
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,620
Fucking Jensen's going to come out with his fucking leather jacket

1970
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:21,740
and pull one out of his stove and be like, hey, guys, it's fucking.

1971
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:24,580
It's only eight ninety nine for the forty sixty.

1972
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:25,580
And what a bargain.

1973
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,580
Like, I hate my life.

1974
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,420
Money, so it's the worst.

1975
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,220
I'm just the fuck.

1976
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:38,340
I just remember, did we did me and crack and Tom, did the three of us

1977
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:41,580
ever hang out at the same time at like Trixie's house in Boston?

1978
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,340
I think just one time we did.

1979
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,740
We went into Boston and like with Munchie

1980
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:50,540
and we hung out and we went around the city and we went to that fucking

1981
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:55,140
park and it was cold, but we were hanging out there anyway.

1982
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,540
We were just dicking around.

1983
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,660
Oh, when we played Pokemon Go in the in the Commons.

1984
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,260
Oh, I was thinking of the was that the same time?

1985
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:08,380
Like, I know that crack, you came and hung out that one time.

1986
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:13,860
I think it was on like Christmas or it was like around Christmas at Trixie's place.

1987
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,100
And that was the time I got really drunk.

1988
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:20,540
Mr. New Year's, I went to and I don't know if you were living there.

1989
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:21,900
That doesn't narrow it down.

1990
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,660
Yeah, that was there.

1991
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:26,700
But Tom was like in a tonic state.

1992
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,380
Yeah, I wasn't there for real tired or no, you were.

1993
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,820
I mean, you were physically there, but like you were not.

1994
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,300
You were not engaged in whatever was going on.

1995
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:39,740
Oh, when we went to like the Chinese place and stuff.

1996
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,460
No, no, no, this was at the house.

1997
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:44,140
No, no, when we're hanging out in the house, I'm thinking,

1998
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:45,540
I'm thinking maybe these were two different.

1999
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,180
I think they were the time we went to the Commons and then maybe because I was

2000
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:52,740
definitely alive and doing things and the trip I'm talking about or excursion,

2001
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,260
whatever you want to call it.

2002
01:38:54,260 --> 01:39:00,100
I forgot about the crack was there for the Boston Commons,

2003
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,340
Pokemon Go trip.

2004
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:02,420
No, I don't think so.

2005
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:04,460
You were there for no, you were definitely there because that was the first

2006
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:09,500
time I saw you in real life was this this outing that I'm talking about.

2007
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,820
Wait, wait, you're thinking are you thinking there was the separate time

2008
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:15,660
when we all met up for Christmas?

2009
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,460
I think the year before, like when I was still living in Georgia

2010
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,900
and I came up to visit and

2011
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:25,220
Nathan or no, that was the same time.

2012
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,580
No, that was that was the same time.

2013
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:29,660
I don't know if you were cracked.

2014
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:32,100
You were definitely there because we ate the spicy.

2015
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:35,020
The do you eat the spicy sauce there for the major cross.

2016
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,140
I was there.

2017
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,140
I don't know if Tom was.

2018
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:38,940
I don't know that.

2019
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:40,500
God, wait, give you were not.

2020
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:41,500
You were not there.

2021
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,620
Give you were not.

2022
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,660
No, you're just you were not there.

2023
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,620
Oh, my God.

2024
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:51,060
Well, I guess that makes sense.

2025
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:52,060
And where are you going?

2026
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,580
Where are you going with this?

2027
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:55,100
I don't know.

2028
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,580
I'm just trying to piece together.

2029
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,620
I'm just trying to figure out my life when we hung out and why.

2030
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,060
I don't know what I think.

2031
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,660
Why would we do such a thing?

2032
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:03,820
Why would friends hang out?

2033
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:05,380
OK, and like have a good time?

2034
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,540
What a strange concept.

2035
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,500
Man, there was it doesn't make any money.

2036
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,020
It doesn't pay the mortgage.

2037
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,180
It's true.

2038
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:15,340
It's becoming increasingly risky to have fun in today's economy.

2039
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:17,340
Doesn't grow my portfolio.

2040
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,820
Speaking of the one time we did the sauce thing

2041
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:24,060
where where you guys famously ran out of the place to eat snow.

2042
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,900
Oh, I know that.

2043
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,700
I don't know if I did.

2044
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:32,100
I think after that, I don't know if like I dropped off

2045
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:38,060
you and and Nate and Michelle and everybody down like a parking garage.

2046
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,580
And we took a picture together.

2047
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:41,140
I wish I could find that picture.

2048
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,940
Hmm, that sounds familiar.

2049
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:48,380
Yeah, I remember you just you ate.

2050
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,260
We all I didn't run out to eat the snow.

2051
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,220
Everybody else ran out to eat the snow.

2052
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,940
I just bought a bunch of bottled water

2053
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:56,300
from the counter and started drinking bottled water.

2054
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,940
You didn't like move.

2055
01:40:58,940 --> 01:40:59,940
You didn't move.

2056
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:03,420
You just sat there with your face like puffy and red

2057
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,580
and like tears streaming down your face, just emote, just staring,

2058
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:08,580
just like, yep, hurts real bad.

2059
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:09,820
Yeah, it was terrible.

2060
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,380
But just but just placid, but just placid about it.

2061
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,540
I mean, I ain't trying to make a scene.

2062
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:19,700
Everybody else had no problem making a scene.

2063
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,300
No, you know why?

2064
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,140
Because May had just eaten a ton of the sauce.

2065
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:27,460
And I was like, you know what, I I'm just going to eat a bunch of the sauce.

2066
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,660
And oh, yeah, didn't she like not just is what it is.

2067
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,420
Didn't she like not even care?

2068
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,260
Not. I remember she didn't even notice.

2069
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:36,620
She had like no real.

2070
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:37,540
She was like inhuman.

2071
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,180
Basically, I'm feeling look like a robot.

2072
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,580
Yeah, scary in hindsight.

2073
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,580
Creepy, creepy.

2074
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:45,580
Yes.

2075
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:50,140
Whatever, I just like to reminisce about the good old days.

2076
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:53,260
All right, listen, we live in a post COVID world now

2077
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,860
and nothing good is ever going to happen again.

2078
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:58,500
All we have, all we have is our memories, guys.

2079
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,900
All right, get on board.

2080
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,900
OK.

2081
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,380
Yes, true.

2082
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,500
I have.

2083
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:11,620
Oh, I have I have a note here about

2084
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:15,460
Nate Nate's new Nate's podcast, The Gamer Zone.

2085
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,820
I don't know if anyone. Gamer Zone.

2086
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,700
I didn't I didn't listen to it.

2087
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:22,020
I just I didn't I don't know.

2088
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,100
I saw that that's a thing that exists.

2089
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:28,100
And I'm not I'm not clear on if it's a I'm not sure if it's a one time.

2090
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,180
I think it's conditional on its success.

2091
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,020
If the, you know, people watch the first one, they'll do another one.

2092
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,180
I mean, how I mean.

2093
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:42,220
I mean, it's going to get it's going to get whatever I imagine doing a podcast.

2094
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,460
How embarrassing. I know.

2095
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:47,300
Very, very embarrassing.

2096
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,580
I was looking if I could find everything is conditional on everyone at the table.

2097
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,060
But I don't have it.

2098
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:56,660
I don't think of the thing that you were talking about with the snow.

2099
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:00,780
But instead, I found this, which is like, I think.

2100
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:03,900
Redcon one or two.

2101
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,420
No, that that was.

2102
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:08,820
That was I'm retrieval.

2103
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:09,980
Con was a Brony Con.

2104
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,220
What was that was in Boston?

2105
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,740
Because we were in South Station.

2106
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,420
We took that photo.

2107
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:15,220
That was for the meetup.

2108
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,780
Remember trying to do a impromptu meetup at South Station?

2109
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:22,420
The the the the the that was like Redcon, like three.

2110
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,380
Yeah, it was like on three point five people call it.

2111
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:27,540
That was when we all went to Trixie's place.

2112
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:30,700
That was when we had that stupid meeting.

2113
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:34,740
Where nothing was accomplished except that, like, very unproductive.

2114
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,340
Nate decided Nate.

2115
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:38,860
No, that was when Nate made the decided, like, yes,

2116
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:41,620
I will be moving to Virginia Beach to do canton.

2117
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,420
That was that was like the only that was like the only thing that got it.

2118
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,460
It is that proceed in the orchid events.

2119
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,740
They all they all talked about it

2120
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:52,420
like it was we were making plans for all of us.

2121
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,220
But nobody had it was just those two.

2122
01:43:54,220 --> 01:43:55,300
And that was the only thing.

2123
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:58,380
And they could have just fucking talked about it under any circumstances.

2124
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:03,820
Yeah, it was it was because Trixie would never come to meetings

2125
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,140
and or something.

2126
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:09,100
And so, yeah, they decided to all meet up.

2127
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,700
Or at least it was it was Nate and Trixie

2128
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:16,700
in Boston, because Trixie was in Boston at the time.

2129
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,540
Then you were around.

2130
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:20,300
So you're like, yeah, I'll be there.

2131
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:21,580
And then Tom probably.

2132
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:22,700
And then I heard about it.

2133
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,100
And I was like, oh, everyone's going to be there.

2134
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:27,100
Yeah, I want to go and then I flew over.

2135
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:32,260
It's like it's like it was no it was no travel for like me and Tom.

2136
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:34,540
Nate, I don't I don't know.

2137
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:36,340
I think Munchie was just visiting.

2138
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:38,140
Munchie was already there or something.

2139
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:40,660
He was. Oh, for school.

2140
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,900
No, he was there for school, I think, or something.

2141
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:47,260
And then, yeah, the weird part is Nate deciding

2142
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:53,620
that he had to come to Boston to like have a pow wow about whatever it was.

2143
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:56,460
Was that the same weekend that we all had the discussion

2144
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,980
with Munchie about college?

2145
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:00,740
Because wasn't he there to visit Kaze before going to school?

2146
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,300
I don't remember.

2147
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:04,820
That did happen. Maybe.

2148
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:06,300
Yeah, it might have been before.

2149
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,260
It might have been before he might.

2150
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:12,100
He might have been looking at colleges or something like that.

2151
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,900
And just, yeah.

2152
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,500
Yeah, but then I mean, yeah, since everyone was going to be there,

2153
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,940
I mean, you can say it was a waste of time to just be like, well, that event

2154
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,260
was where I believe where Noogle was born.

2155
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:25,380
And that was worth all of all of the trouble.

2156
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,340
Noogle was pretty great.

2157
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:29,660
Noogle, I mean, it's I mean, it's not.

2158
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,500
I mean, it was fun. Don't get me wrong.

2159
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:36,100
I just think it's weird was that they had that Nate had to travel

2160
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,700
across the country to have a to have a desk or a person.

2161
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:43,500
Yeah, basically, but whatever.

2162
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,140
I mean, we had played.

2163
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:47,900
We did have Jack three.

2164
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,540
And then you and Munchie did like an RFC K thing.

2165
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:54,260
No, that was when that was when we did the

2166
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,700
infamous for all.

2167
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,660
Wait, what's the the campaign in Brawl called?

2168
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:02,660
Subspace emissary.

2169
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,740
Wait, no, that was. Yes, we did.

2170
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:06,100
I think so. Yeah, we did that.

2171
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:08,460
Like the eight hour subspace emissary

2172
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:11,100
play through that got destroyed by the fat 32.

2173
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:14,140
It's because it was my hard drive.

2174
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:15,620
Yeah, what a nightmare.

2175
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,060
Fuck, fuck that game.

2176
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:21,540
I thought because the I have a clip from a stream that you did.

2177
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:23,900
RFC K wise.

2178
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,460
Hmm.

2179
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:32,060
So you know, I'm just like, if that was did you also do the subspace emissary?

2180
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:35,020
We might have streamed.

2181
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,380
We know it wasn't a red come through.

2182
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,540
We might have streamed some Brawl at some point,

2183
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:44,620
but we did off stream a recorded

2184
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:49,140
subspace emissary run and it was lost on the hard drive

2185
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:51,620
because of the fat 32 format.

2186
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:54,140
Yeah.

2187
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:59,380
Yeah, well, OK, OK, whatever.

2188
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,980
OK, well, now I know.

2189
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:02,580
Speaking of speaking of the sauce,

2190
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:05,900
I found the picture of not the one that I wanted to find,

2191
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:08,900
but this picture of me after I suffered the sauce.

2192
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:13,460
You, this looks like you had recovered.

2193
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:18,180
This seems like this looks like your expression the entire time getting a house.

2194
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,580
That just seems like.

2195
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:21,700
Yeah, that's that's about what the process was like.

2196
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:25,900
Yeah, yeah, this is this is after you'd had a little time.

2197
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,620
You'd had a little time to like kind of recover from it.

2198
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:30,380
You were more intensely.

2199
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:31,540
It's hard to imagine.

2200
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,060
Like before.

2201
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,060
Yeah.

2202
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,220
That was some fucking sauce, though.

2203
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:40,420
That shit sucked.

2204
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,220
Good, good times, good times.

2205
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:50,980
OK, well, I guess nothing to say about the gamer's own, I guess.

2206
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:54,340
I guess I just thought it bore mention.

2207
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,940
Yeah, it's about Dan.

2208
01:47:56,940 --> 01:48:01,580
I'm I'm all out of I'm all out of fucking topics of interest.

2209
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:03,460
I've got I've got a couple more.

2210
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,940
I've got a couple more.

2211
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:08,460
I mean, first, I got to plug the quake map.

2212
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:11,620
I made a quake map just recently, just for fun.

2213
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:14,060
It's the 25th anniversary of quake.

2214
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,180
Then played it.

2215
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:17,180
Yeah, I think you probably had a bad time.

2216
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,820
I played it.

2217
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:19,940
I played it.

2218
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:23,580
No, once I figured out what I was doing, I played it and I had a good time.

2219
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,380
But then this I didn't find the secrets because they involve kind of high level

2220
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:32,060
quake strats that I was felt sort of exhausted when I learned what was.

2221
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:34,020
What do you use to map quake maps?

2222
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,620
Or like, these are like a modern editor that people are using?

2223
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:38,460
Yeah, I assume so.

2224
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,620
There's a combination.

2225
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:43,060
So in order to make the actual geometry to do the modeling,

2226
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,940
you can use this tool called trench broom, which is really good.

2227
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:48,300
It's really modern. You pretty much just paint in 3D.

2228
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,460
It's wonderful.

2229
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,700
Absolutely wonderful.

2230
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:53,900
But every other part of the process is ridiculously antiquated.

2231
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:56,940
So like really to manage textures.

2232
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,660
I use this tool Wally, which has been unchanged since about 1998.

2233
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,340
But it runs it fucking runs in wine.

2234
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:05,460
No problem.

2235
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,140
So no big deal.

2236
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,140
Jesus, that's incredible.

2237
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
And there's there's some other little tricks.

2238
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,780
So there there's this guy, Eric W, who does

2239
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:20,660
the the current iteration of tools that everyone uses to compile their maps

2240
01:49:20,660 --> 01:49:22,380
and the lighting and stuff.

2241
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,100
And those are good.

2242
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,820
So you just download them and their command line tools.

2243
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,700
But people make like like GUIs that you can use to pretty much just like

2244
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,860
check some boxes and have it make the map.

2245
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,580
So that's no problem.

2246
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,220
Yeah. And honestly, I would recommend it.

2247
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:40,580
I would say go download trench broom.

2248
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:45,300
There's this guy dump truck DS on YouTube who does tutorials.

2249
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:49,260
He has a ridiculously in depth tutorial series that literally

2250
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:53,460
anybody can follow and it'll get you started and you should do it.

2251
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,860
Tom, you should actually do it.

2252
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:57,780
Go make a quick quick map and have fun.

2253
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:02,580
But everybody listening, stop listening.

2254
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:06,700
Go to my website, download this this map and play it and then come back.

2255
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:10,300
So that's wait, link link it right here.

2256
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:12,420
Link it in the in the chat so LES are confined.

2257
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:15,580
Yeah, it's just if they just go to kissy.net, it's on the first story.

2258
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:20,180
But I'll link the the actual link in case, you know, in case it's two years.

2259
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:24,100
No one's going to type a link in a browser.

2260
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,140
You have to give it too many numbers.

2261
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:28,900
Play the check. Check out.

2262
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,300
Check out the slime factory.

2263
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,300
Take a tour. Take a tour of the slime factory.

2264
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:35,940
See where the see where the slimes like fuck.

2265
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:36,940
Yeah.

2266
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,580
Hmm. Yeah.

2267
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,580
And even if you even if you don't have quick install on your computer,

2268
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:43,500
there's a link to get you started.

2269
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,300
You don't have to like figure anything out.

2270
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:47,740
You print, download a thing, click a button and you play.

2271
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:53,300
So I'm glad you have texture filtering off, as God intended.

2272
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:55,420
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

2273
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,940
And I would recommend I would recommend if you know how to do it to do it

2274
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,460
because, God, the blurry textures.

2275
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:05,900
Why? Why do people play every time I watch someone playing?

2276
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:06,820
Wait, what is it? What is it?

2277
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:09,900
Try it? Does it like smooth out every texture and quake?

2278
01:51:09,900 --> 01:51:11,980
The pixels are like gigantic.

2279
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,500
They're all 64 by 64 for a face.

2280
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:16,060
Yeah, it rules.

2281
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:19,300
So you want to you want to turn the the texture filtering will be on

2282
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:23,220
by default with any OpenGL engine and turn it off.

2283
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:26,460
Turn off the texture filtering. Oh, turn it off.

2284
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:30,180
God, I. God, I hope I wasn't playing with it and not even probably work.

2285
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,460
I don't think I did.

2286
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:33,660
It was probably on. Yeah.

2287
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,620
I like those. Every time someone plays Doom with those on,

2288
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:38,740
I just like want to shoot cringe.

2289
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:41,020
It's extremely cringy. It's super cringy.

2290
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:44,220
Yeah, it feels kind of missing the point like this.

2291
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,300
There's new Doom.

2292
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:49,820
If you want smoother Doom, it's it's not going to play the old one.

2293
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:51,820
It's going to be I want to doom.

2294
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:56,500
I want to doom where the like the like 20 polygon enemies are rendered in,

2295
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,620
you know, for 4K resolution.

2296
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:03,180
They have to run at like at 124 frames per second.

2297
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,740
Why? Yeah.

2298
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:09,340
And you know, it's the mind of the there's a huge community of people

2299
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:13,340
who who make like high res models and textures for Quake One.

2300
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:16,740
And like, you know, more power to make whatever you want.

2301
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:17,860
That's cool.

2302
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:20,620
I would never ever in my life play with that.

2303
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:23,460
I wanted to look like shit because that's what it looks like.

2304
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:25,900
That's great. That's great. Yeah.

2305
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,940
Is there a way it looks great?

2306
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:30,740
It looks great to have like a super high

2307
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:33,860
poly game with shitty textures.

2308
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:35,900
Yeah, absolutely. And cool. Yeah.

2309
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:40,220
I feel like that would look awkward, like a really smooth,

2310
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:45,900
like a really smoothly rendered model with big, crunchy pixel textures on it.

2311
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:50,900
Would like like a like a very crushed Photoshop face of an actor on the face.

2312
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:54,060
If you look very bizarre, because you probably like

2313
01:52:54,340 --> 01:52:58,300
wouldn't be able to line up like your four textures or four pixels of an eyeball

2314
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:01,500
onto the geometry of your photorealistic eye properly.

2315
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,940
Yeah, it's doable.

2316
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:05,460
I want to see it.

2317
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:08,540
Go download, make human, get like a low poly Quake One model,

2318
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:11,620
just slap it on there and see what happened.

2319
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:16,460
Yeah, you know, I did see in in in Crash Four,

2320
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:20,580
there's like a bunch of skins that you can have.

2321
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:23,980
And one of them is like Crash from PlayStation One.

2322
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:27,500
You can play the Crash Four game with a Crash One guy.

2323
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:31,500
But it kind of it looks horrendous

2324
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,900
because it's not the actual same model.

2325
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:37,220
They make it look like it, but it maps on to like the new

2326
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:41,340
like rig, the skeleton of the new characters or the animations for it.

2327
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:46,980
But I think the worst thing about it is that the lighting

2328
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:53,380
that, you know, cuss shadows that that that on that sort of low poly

2329
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,260
like single color for like Crash Bandicoot

2330
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:59,740
completely changes the way he looks.

2331
01:53:59,740 --> 01:54:02,540
You have to use and you can't change the the shadows.

2332
01:54:02,540 --> 01:54:04,740
No, that's so bad.

2333
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:09,980
Yeah. So it looks like it's so as I was as I was importing my models

2334
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:13,660
into Unreal Engine, like it defaults to like a PBR texture.

2335
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,460
The show has like realistic lighting and stuff.

2336
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:17,620
And it completely ruins the effect.

2337
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,220
You have to make it unlit.

2338
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:22,820
Pete, PBR photo based rendering.

2339
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:26,580
It's like it like simulates how light interacts with materials

2340
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,700
like in a game engine.

2341
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:33,340
So all the stuff will like have like realistic reflections

2342
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:35,380
and realistic shadows and all that garbage.

2343
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:38,180
And I'm just like, no, turn it all off.

2344
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:39,460
Well, who needs it?

2345
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:41,020
Honestly, who does?

2346
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:42,580
Yeah. Yeah.

2347
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,860
Yeah, I agree.

2348
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:50,260
Like you really don't need that much to make the game good.

2349
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:55,460
It's honestly better if the graphics are worse, but they just, you know,

2350
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,460
you can feel something when you look at it.

2351
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:00,500
Yeah, like making it look more real isn't better.

2352
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,500
I just played.

2353
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
That's like better. I just was playing.

2354
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
That's like how I feel that way about art in general.

2355
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:09,340
Like if you can get across the same amount with less detail,

2356
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:13,500
it's just better like most of the time, minimum conveyance is is ideal.

2357
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:18,140
Yeah, I was just playing the version three, the beta version three

2358
01:55:18,140 --> 01:55:22,980
of Project Rutality, which is like a crazy high gore over the top mod

2359
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,580
for the original doom.

2360
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:27,180
It's so much more fun than the new doom games.

2361
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:31,100
It's so good, though, the just like crazy amount of just like

2362
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:34,740
catharsis they have to all the weapon effects and stuff,

2363
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:37,220
because it's just like these little pixels just getting blown apart

2364
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:41,620
and spattering pixely blood everywhere and like all the sound effects are

2365
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:43,820
because like the visuals look like shit.

2366
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:46,780
So they have to make the sound sound really good to sell

2367
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:49,460
like how fucking powerful these weapons are.

2368
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,620
And it's like the best.

2369
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:54,300
It's so fucking I mean, it's really I hadn't heard of Project Rutality.

2370
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:57,420
You know, there used to be Brutal Doom.

2371
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:58,940
Yeah, I don't know.

2372
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:01,180
This is a fork of that from by another guy.

2373
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:05,340
OK, yeah, and more guns and more effects and crazy shit.

2374
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:09,500
If it's not related to Brutal Doom, that's like really unfortunate naming.

2375
01:56:09,740 --> 01:56:11,460
Yeah, right.

2376
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:15,580
No, he like forked it and like took it and like I guess I don't know why he

2377
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:17,380
forked it because I haven't looked into the history of it.

2378
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:21,300
I just know that it's a fork of that, but it's kind of the same idea.

2379
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:25,140
But like even more ridiculous and like you can get like weapon upgrades

2380
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:29,220
and like there's like three different kinds of BFG is just like an inventory

2381
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,140
for days. It's like really fucking cool.

2382
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:35,500
It sounds cool. Brutal Doom was sick as fuck.

2383
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,580
Oh, it's so good.

2384
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:39,380
It's like still my favorite shooter is like those kind of things.

2385
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:44,940
It's like what's the difference between doom and you can explain it if you want.

2386
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:49,780
Oh, so doom, the base doom game is extremely primitive, right?

2387
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:53,420
Like you're you're essentially moving on a 2D plane, right?

2388
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:57,420
And you can look only straightforward and you have some simple weapons

2389
01:56:57,420 --> 01:57:00,900
with Brutal Doom. What they did is allow you to first of all,

2390
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:02,340
you could look all over the place.

2391
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,300
The weapons are more complicated.

2392
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:08,660
So you can you can do things like look down the sights of your shotgun, right?

2393
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:12,300
And they have different weapons and just just generally improved

2394
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:15,500
gameplay all over plus a whole new series of maps.

2395
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:19,100
Yeah. Hmm. But isn't isn't the original?

2396
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:22,700
I mean, the original doom is built around its simplistic gameplay, though, right?

2397
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:27,540
Yeah. So you can revisit that the original maps with the improved gameplay

2398
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:30,740
and also there's new maps. Yeah, because I mean, you can it works

2399
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:34,620
with any map file from doom, but like obviously with like the increased

2400
01:57:34,620 --> 01:57:37,860
like weapon damage and stuff, you can get map packs that are made,

2401
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,500
especially with this kind of refined gameplay in mind.

2402
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,620
But like, I mean, you know what doom looks like.

2403
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:43,820
Like this is the video I saw.

2404
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:46,260
There was like, I got to play this. It's fucking nuts.

2405
01:57:47,740 --> 01:57:50,900
Hmm. I see. I see.

2406
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:55,100
Speaking of games, I just I saw.

2407
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:00,140
At you know, we've we've been to a Brony Con or two and at

2408
01:58:01,460 --> 01:58:05,540
and at previous Brony Cons, this I've I've I've met this guy,

2409
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:09,260
this guy Tony Yotes and and he has been making this game.

2410
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:14,140
He's been making a pony game for, I don't know, but several years now,

2411
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:17,820
like since the T-Bap days, I think, and battle.

2412
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:18,940
Yes, battle gem ponies.

2413
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:21,380
And he just launched the Kickstarter for it.

2414
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:27,220
And it's it's like, I honestly, after like, I've just kind of had this guy

2415
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:30,420
as like a follow on Twitter for years and years every now and then.

2416
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:31,460
I see a battle gem pony.

2417
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:33,260
I'm like, huh, looking good, looking good.

2418
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:35,060
And it's it's actually real.

2419
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:37,060
They actually did the the Kickstarter.

2420
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,820
I can't believe it.

2421
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,620
But I thought it was cool that it's actually happening.

2422
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:43,820
It seems like it's it's actually doing like pretty well.

2423
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:45,860
I think it's up to like eight. Oh, man.

2424
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:49,100
Something you can you can download a demo right now and play it.

2425
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:52,140
I have I have not.

2426
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:54,620
Yeah, I was just looking at Kickstarter, you know,

2427
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:57,140
because the concern always the Kickstarter comes out.

2428
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,500
And it's like, does he even have anything?

2429
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,380
Is there even actually a game?

2430
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:03,700
Is this just an idea after all this time?

2431
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,380
I hope so. But yeah, no, it's real.

2432
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:07,700
So he's got a demo.

2433
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:12,500
Yeah, I I asked I asked him how how much it would take

2434
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,660
to get to get Phantom Horn in the game.

2435
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:17,940
And I think it's it's it's a little it's a lot.

2436
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,740
You'd have to make like a whole sprites.

2437
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:21,260
I don't think it's feasible.

2438
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:22,500
It's just made me sad.

2439
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:25,980
But. Oh, well, that's OK.

2440
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,300
That's OK. I'll still I'll still buy it.

2441
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,540
But still fucking got me by the balls.

2442
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,540
I got to do it.

2443
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:33,740
Oh, well.

2444
01:59:33,740 --> 01:59:36,180
Yeah, I don't know, fucking Battle Jam ponies.

2445
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:41,260
That's I just I invested in it just because

2446
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:43,220
I have known about it for so long.

2447
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:45,700
And every every every once in a while,

2448
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:48,780
I see it on the timeline and be like, hmm,

2449
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:51,060
will this ever be a real game?

2450
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,540
So I would think it was neat if it was.

2451
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:55,500
And here it is. Cool, cool shit.

2452
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,820
I don't know.

2453
01:59:56,820 --> 01:59:58,980
Games are coming back.

2454
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:02,180
I guess there must be a there must be a

2455
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:04,620
brony contingency that's still there.

2456
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:05,780
Just like alive.

2457
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:08,300
You made a fucking a pony,

2458
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:11,460
a pony themed Pokemon like indie game.

2459
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:13,340
Take my money.

2460
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:17,020
There must still be a contingent because, you know, it's going.

2461
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:18,900
Movies coming out like this month or next month.

2462
02:00:21,140 --> 02:00:22,020
Are we going to?

2463
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:23,340
We got to do an episode.

2464
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,220
We got to do. We got to do it.

2465
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:27,260
I'm ready.

2466
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:29,500
I'm I'll go see it in theaters.

2467
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:32,740
I don't give a fuck about the Delta variant.

2468
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:36,140
I, you know, I assumed it was, but maybe it's not.

2469
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:40,340
I mean, the the the last pony movie came out in theaters.

2470
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:43,420
Yeah, I feel like it probably will.

2471
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:47,060
It says Netflix.

2472
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:48,500
I don't know if it's coming out in theaters.

2473
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:51,700
No, no.

2474
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:54,780
That's just we'll all have to gather at Crack's house and watch it.

2475
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,500
Yeah, come on down.

2476
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,300
Yeah, you know what?

2477
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:00,700
OK, I'll fly over.

2478
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:01,820
Why not? I'm in.

2479
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:04,060
Hell, I'm in.

2480
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:06,580
Hey, so speaking of kick starters,

2481
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:11,460
Tom, you were saying you got the the framework computer

2482
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:13,740
and my immediate concern, right?

2483
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:18,020
So I've seen so many kick starters for like, this is the new modular phone,

2484
02:01:18,020 --> 02:01:20,140
which is going to revolutionize phones.

2485
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:22,900
And like, you'll be able to just upgrade it piece by piece.

2486
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:26,620
And literally, none of them have ever materialized into a device.

2487
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:27,940
Mm hmm.

2488
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:29,340
This laptop looks better.

2489
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,740
But like, what's sold what's sold to you?

2490
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:34,540
Well,

2491
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:37,580
it's not a kick starter, which is important.

2492
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:40,860
First of all, they have pre-orders open.

2493
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:44,620
The device exists like reviewers, like everyone in the tech

2494
02:01:44,620 --> 02:01:48,140
like reviewer sphere has already used the device, had hands on and like,

2495
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:50,300
it works, it functions, it's been reviewed.

2496
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:53,980
They've already shipped out two, I think, waves of them

2497
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:56,500
and they're on like wave three of orders.

2498
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:00,860
OK, so it's real, which is the first like big sticking point,

2499
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:03,900
like it's out and exists.

2500
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:08,420
I think the second thing that sold me is that all the components

2501
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,620
in it are off the shelf.

2502
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:12,340
There's no proprietary hardware except for the main motherboard,

2503
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:15,980
because like you have to solder the CPU onto something.

2504
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:20,740
But even that, they have all the schematics for the board available.

2505
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,380
And unlike every other laptop,

2506
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:26,940
you can actually take the main board out and use it outside of the laptop.

2507
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,820
So if you, you know, you're done with the laptop,

2508
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:31,180
you can like set it up as like a NAS or whatever,

2509
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:34,220
because it'll run unconnected to the rest of the components.

2510
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,140
And that also means like if the company tanks,

2511
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,900
you can still replace things because all these components are off the shelf.

2512
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:44,260
So like you can buy a battery from a third party, you can buy a new display

2513
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:46,300
from a third party.

2514
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:49,860
But that's like the great thing about it is literally the entire computer

2515
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:53,140
is modular, which is like I've been bitching about it forever

2516
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:57,220
that like it sucks at like these like really portable like ultrabooks and stuff.

2517
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,100
They're all designed to be throwaway products, you know,

2518
02:03:00,100 --> 02:03:02,780
like everything soldered to the board and the excuse was like,

2519
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:07,380
oh, you can't get a computer this thin and light unless you solder everything together.

2520
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:10,260
And like we've all kind of like accepted that as being true.

2521
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:14,260
So this this company framework is made up of like X people from like Facebook

2522
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:16,940
and Apple, I think.

2523
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:20,380
And they were just like, why don't we make a laptop that's like actually

2524
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:24,260
decently designed, but all the ports can be swapped out

2525
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:27,740
because it's just it's just four USB-C ports coming off the main board.

2526
02:03:28,020 --> 02:03:30,980
And you get, yeah, so you essentially got like tiny dongles.

2527
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:34,420
Yeah. And then you just have dongles that just slot into the chassis itself.

2528
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:36,460
Same, same.

2529
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:39,060
Rigid, rigid, compact dongles.

2530
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:40,060
Yeah, exactly.

2531
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:42,260
You know, as we're all familiar with.

2532
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:45,660
Stop your turning wheel.

2533
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:49,340
And so even even the like the the schematics and stuff for those are available.

2534
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:54,660
So other people can make their own kind of adapters for for the computer itself.

2535
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,300
And I don't.

2536
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,940
I mean, my laptop that I have right now is like more powerful than this thing.

2537
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:07,460
So I technically don't need it, but I'm kind of just like putting my money

2538
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:10,140
where my mouth is and being like, you know what, I've wanted something

2539
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:12,340
like this to exist forever.

2540
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:18,100
And if I can just do my little bit to like give them the momentum

2541
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:22,660
they need in the beginning, maybe like next year or the year after they'll

2542
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:26,980
release like a 15 inch laptop that has like a full fat, like, you know,

2543
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:31,820
45 watt CPU and a dedicated graphics card, which is something I would actually buy.

2544
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:33,140
And then that's fully modular.

2545
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:36,220
So like if later down the road, it's like, you know, 1080p is nice,

2546
02:04:36,220 --> 02:04:39,180
but I could really use a QHD screen or a higher refresh rate.

2547
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,820
Instead of having to buy a whole new computer, like with this one,

2548
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:46,220
you can just take the magnetic lid off and just drop in a new panel

2549
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:50,260
and seal it back up and like actually upgrade your notebook.

2550
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:53,540
Like I would have my desktop, which has like half of the components

2551
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:56,460
have been sitting in it for five years versus, you know, the motherboard

2552
02:04:56,460 --> 02:05:00,620
and CPU are new because I upgraded that recently and just like being able to do

2553
02:05:00,620 --> 02:05:04,740
that because like it sucks having to like throw out a perfectly good display,

2554
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:10,300
perfectly good motherboard, perfectly good RAM because like one thing broke, you know.

2555
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:15,460
So I just said, fuck it, it's a hundred bucks down.

2556
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:17,340
I can still cancel it for a reason.

2557
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,300
I decide I don't want to, but it's shipping in October.

2558
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,100
And it's like, I don't know.

2559
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:27,060
I just really believe in the idea and like it's not vaporware because like,

2560
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:30,140
you know, Linus Tech Tips and a bunch of like reputable people

2561
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:33,940
have had it in house and swear that it's actually good.

2562
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,420
So fuck it. I'm going to give it a shot.

2563
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:40,620
Yeah. Yeah. And I just, you know, I just hope that all the all the hardware

2564
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:44,260
that's included and available is like supported in the Linux kernel.

2565
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,620
But I don't know.

2566
02:05:45,620 --> 02:05:47,300
That would be my next concern.

2567
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:51,620
I know you buy a laptop and it's like 50 50 chance,

2568
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,700
whether the the wireless or the Bluetooth is going to be in the kernel.

2569
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:56,740
From what I understand.

2570
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:00,460
And again, I'm not a big Linux guy, despite me wanting to the Linux.

2571
02:06:00,460 --> 02:06:02,780
Like some people have tested with Linux and it does work.

2572
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:05,980
And even the the fingerprint scanner on it works with Linux as well.

2573
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,980
They made sure that that was supported.

2574
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,220
Yeah, I've never seen one work.

2575
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:11,580
I've never seen one works.

2576
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:12,460
That's pretty good.

2577
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:14,060
Yeah, it's pretty nuts.

2578
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:17,980
So and then because like there are the compatibility,

2579
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:19,780
like they're saying, like right now, you just have, you know,

2580
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:23,860
the the 11th gen ultrabook main board.

2581
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:28,100
But they're also going to make options going forward

2582
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:31,060
that you can put both arm and risk V.

2583
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:34,420
So season there as well.

2584
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:39,060
So like, yeah, the the future sounds really interesting.

2585
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:40,540
So if you could just like, oh, yeah,

2586
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:43,060
I just want to drop an armboard in here for a little bit.

2587
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:45,620
Like that'd be pretty fucking cool.

2588
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:48,260
Yeah, that sounds sick.

2589
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:52,900
You know, and and honestly, like I probably should support that.

2590
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:56,940
But the truth is that I just have a Dell XPS 13 and it's six.

2591
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:59,340
It's like good enough.

2592
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:02,540
Yeah, you know, it's down down the road years from now.

2593
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:05,660
It's like I would love there to be this option available.

2594
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:07,420
That's that's exactly what I was thinking.

2595
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:10,180
It's like I could still use my laptop for like three or four years.

2596
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:14,860
But like my thought process was like, I want this to exist in three

2597
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:18,140
to four years when I do need a new 15 year notebook.

2598
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:21,860
So I'm going to like put my money where my mouth is because I have like

2599
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:25,180
you want to dive into my fucking comment history on YouTube.

2600
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:28,420
You can find me bitching about sealed ram and shit on laptop reviews

2601
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:29,460
for like 10 years now.

2602
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:31,940
So I'm like, well, I'd be a pretty big fucking hypocrite

2603
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:34,060
if I didn't like throw down for this.

2604
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:37,740
So, you know, and it's crazy that it's been so long

2605
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:41,820
and this doesn't really exist yet because years ago when I was in college,

2606
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:45,140
I had a 15 inch, I think alienware laptop.

2607
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:48,900
And that was so close to like a full modular laptop.

2608
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:52,860
And they just completely abandoned that that whole design practice.

2609
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:55,940
Like with that laptop, you could take off one panel and expose

2610
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,980
almost the entire main board.

2611
02:07:57,980 --> 02:08:02,060
Yeah, and it had a discrete video card that was slotted and.

2612
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:03,700
Oh, my God, that's insane.

2613
02:08:03,700 --> 02:08:05,820
Right. It just doesn't exist anymore.

2614
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,780
It just doesn't exist. What happened?

2615
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:11,860
We were right there, you know, because money like it's so much more.

2616
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:14,220
I think Apple leads the charge on a lot of this shit.

2617
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:17,140
And they are money grubbing bastards.

2618
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:18,940
Yeah, right.

2619
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:21,620
Everyone wants the ultra slim aluminum case.

2620
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:26,460
But like, here's the thing, the fucking the framework laptop

2621
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:30,420
is thinner and lighter than like a MacBook Pro.

2622
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:33,820
Yeah, but it's completely modular.

2623
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:38,380
And it's just like, OK, so what's your excuse for sealing everything in?

2624
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:41,460
It's like, oh, because Apple wants to charge like a thousand dollars for a pair.

2625
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:43,380
So they'll just make you buy a new one.

2626
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:47,460
Yeah, there's just no like this is a tiny 13 inch device

2627
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:51,460
that has two sodium slots and everybody like everybody

2628
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:53,900
who makes a 13 inch notebook, it's like it has to be soldered

2629
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:56,140
or we can't get it to be slim.

2630
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,780
It's like can't do it.

2631
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:59,940
It's like these guys designed this look.

2632
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:03,340
They designed this entire computer in less than a year.

2633
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:09,140
So like, if you're Apple, you spend billions of dollars in R&D every year.

2634
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:11,140
Like you clearly just choose not to.

2635
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:16,100
So yeah, yeah, it's pretty fucking sick.

2636
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:21,420
So I'm definitely I'm super interested in what the community is going to do with it.

2637
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:24,340
Because like as much as like framework offers, I'm sure they're going to be like,

2638
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:29,580
oh, dude, this fucking panel from China that you can order from AliExpress totally slots in here.

2639
02:09:29,580 --> 02:09:32,460
And like, there's going to be crazy shit like that's going to start popping up.

2640
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:35,260
And that's that's really going to start taking on a life itself.

2641
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:38,660
Yeah, well, because the reality of it, right, is that a lot of hardware

2642
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:43,380
that's in laptops is standardized and it's just not a standard device

2643
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:45,380
that's available to you as the consumer.

2644
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:48,740
But like the the form factors are standardized.

2645
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:52,580
The parts are interchangeable and it's just a matter of just you can't get to them.

2646
02:09:52,580 --> 02:09:56,020
But like with this one, like the bezel is magnetic and comes right off.

2647
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:58,500
And then it's four screws and the display pops out.

2648
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:01,620
It's like, oh, yeah, I can replace slash upgrade my display.

2649
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:05,500
And like the motherboard, because like they don't have any touch options on the display,

2650
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:07,220
but the motherboard supports touch.

2651
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:11,620
So if you can find one that is compatible, that has a touchscreen,

2652
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:13,500
you just drop it in and now you have a touchscreen.

2653
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:18,700
And like it's it's super cool because like you can up because like they also have it.

2654
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:23,740
So like you up you open up the the computer and all the components have QR codes.

2655
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:25,780
So you can just scan the QR code.

2656
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:29,820
It brings up all the documentation on how to replace it, how to upgrade it, what works,

2657
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:31,380
what doesn't work with it.

2658
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:35,420
So it's like and then I think like this is like such a little fucking nerd thing.

2659
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:38,100
But like when they mentioned this in the minus tech video is like, oh,

2660
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,420
that's so fucking cool.

2661
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:43,500
So all the screws are color coded so you know which goes where.

2662
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:47,300
And then there's a little tiny little extra bit of space at the top of the case.

2663
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:51,860
And so instead of just leaving it empty, they put three replacement screws of each kind.

2664
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:54,100
So you miss one.

2665
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:56,380
There's some sitting right there to replace them with.

2666
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:58,340
I'm just like, they thought of everything.

2667
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,380
It's fucking brilliant.

2668
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:02,180
So, yeah, I don't know.

2669
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:07,420
It just seems like exactly the kind of like company philosophy that I've wanted

2670
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:10,460
for a long time is like, well, I got to do it.

2671
02:11:10,980 --> 02:11:13,780
So I did it and it looks pretty dope.

2672
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:16,540
Well, cool.

2673
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,620
You should probably move on.

2674
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:19,340
Dope as hell.

2675
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,780
I agree with all of that.

2676
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:25,620
Couldn't have said it better myself.

2677
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:27,940
I sometimes use the computer.

2678
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:32,340
There was like three people in the audience who appreciated that conversation.

2679
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:33,460
Yeah.

2680
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,340
And, you know, we do it for them.

2681
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:38,340
I came on here for them.

2682
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:41,900
There's three or four holdouts in the audience.

2683
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:47,220
Like, when are they going to talk about the beveling for those three or four people?

2684
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:50,740
Here's here's a link to the Linus Tech video that really broke it all down.

2685
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:54,420
It's fucking really sick.

2686
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:56,780
We are we are more than two hours in.

2687
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:59,220
So I think maybe it's time to go to voicemails.

2688
02:11:59,220 --> 02:12:00,820
Oh, no.

2689
02:12:00,820 --> 02:12:02,420
Oh, no.

2690
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:03,420
Oh, yeah.

2691
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:07,420
Unfortunately, yes, we still get voicemails.

2692
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:10,540
Do I even have the login info on my fucking browser?

2693
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:11,700
It's been so long.

2694
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:12,980
Oh, no, don't even worry about it.

2695
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:13,740
I'll just put them.

2696
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:15,180
I'll just put them right in the.

2697
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,380
I'll put them right in the links.

2698
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:17,580
Cracks here.

2699
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:18,140
That's right.

2700
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:21,500
So here in the end, I so I got to apologize.

2701
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:25,460
I left 30 voicemails under various names.

2702
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,780
Geez, just just in advance.

2703
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:32,140
I'm sorry for all the voicemails you're about to hear.

2704
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:33,660
It was all me.

2705
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:37,900
I was I was I was looking at the voicemails yesterday

2706
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:39,700
and I saw that there were less than usual.

2707
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,700
And I was like, yes.

2708
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:44,540
But then I check again today and the number has doubled up to like the normal amount.

2709
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,380
So now we know where they came from.

2710
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:47,100
It was all crack.

2711
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:47,500
Yeah.

2712
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:48,900
So we can skip them.

2713
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,460
Like, yeah, I hope so.

2714
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:51,500
You could just skip mine.

2715
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,660
I left them all yesterday.

2716
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:53,300
You could just skip.

2717
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:54,740
They're all about the framework laptop.

2718
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:55,660
So we just answer them all.

2719
02:12:55,660 --> 02:13:02,540
That's the first voicemail is actually like crack, like says the voicemails

2720
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,940
at the same time as they they're played.

2721
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:07,300
So we get like a like an echo.

2722
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:10,460
Recite them, recite them in real time.

2723
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:13,460
The first voicemail is actually an image.

2724
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:16,420
So that's there it is.

2725
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:18,460
Look at that.

2726
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:20,100
I appreciate it.

2727
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:21,820
Yeah, they've got me surrounded.

2728
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:24,460
Is that you?

2729
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:26,060
Yeah, I'm sure that's me.

2730
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:28,060
Yeah, that's definitely me.

2731
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:29,500
I think.

2732
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:31,340
Yeah.

2733
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,020
I.

2734
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,020
All right.

2735
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:36,140
It looks more like Munchy, but I don't know.

2736
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:40,460
Yeah, I thought it was much initially too, but like much he doesn't hate Homestuck.

2737
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,500
Well, I love Homestuck, so that doesn't work for either of us.

2738
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:47,980
Well, no, OK, I was confused about this meme.

2739
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:51,820
I guess the point of the meme is that the person behind the table is saying something crazy.

2740
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:54,260
So if I'm saying I hate Homestuck,

2741
02:13:54,260 --> 02:13:57,020
that means I've gone crazy because I actually love Homestuck.

2742
02:13:57,820 --> 02:13:58,460
I don't get it.

2743
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:00,020
I think it's a bad meme.

2744
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:01,180
This is a weird meme.

2745
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:02,380
Is it supposed to be any of us?

2746
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:04,860
Maybe it's just some random guy.

2747
02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:07,220
God, I hope not.

2748
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:10,460
You know, it's like it's like an ink plot test, right?

2749
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:13,500
It says more about you, your perception of this.

2750
02:14:14,260 --> 02:14:14,980
Right.

2751
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:16,860
That's where you think it is.

2752
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:18,340
Yeah, true.

2753
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:21,620
OK, the the wait.

2754
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,180
Oh, no, I've got to hear it.

2755
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:28,220
The next voicemail is called proper JoJo reading order.

2756
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,460
Oh, it's sorry for my connection is slow.

2757
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:35,780
I will have to upload these early three to one.

2758
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:37,500
Oh, there it is. OK.

2759
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:40,980
Proper JoJo reading order in three, two, one, go.

2760
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:44,300
OK, so JoJo part one and two.

2761
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:46,420
I can't start at that because I know what's going to happen.

2762
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:48,180
I know there's an evil vampire.

2763
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:50,140
I know there's a bunch of scary.

2764
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:53,300
Skip this one, actually, because I don't have any opinions about JoJo.

2765
02:14:53,780 --> 02:14:56,100
JoJo part three is where they use.

2766
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:58,100
Yeah, not about it either. OK.

2767
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,740
All right. Thanks for the voicemail.

2768
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:01,300
Sorry, I can't help you.

2769
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:03,140
I can't can't help you with that one, buddy.

2770
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:04,700
We're moving on. Good.

2771
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:07,420
Oh, sorry. It's got to load.

2772
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:11,060
Next one is called confusion.

2773
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:13,500
Ah, discussed contempt.

2774
02:15:14,060 --> 02:15:16,180
Three, two, one, go.

2775
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,220
All right. So recap.

2776
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:20,140
Trixie works with Vizier.

2777
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:23,500
Vizier is the producer for Dick's show.

2778
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:27,020
And Dick is buddies or whatever with Ralph.

2779
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:30,700
Ralph ruins Trixie's life by way of May.

2780
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:37,740
So why does Trixie put up with being only two degrees of separation?

2781
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:39,820
Because she's a simp.

2782
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:41,020
She's a simp.

2783
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:43,260
Does that make sense to anybody else?

2784
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:45,380
Because why would she put up with this shit?

2785
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:48,820
Dick is famous and has big money connections.

2786
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:53,340
You put up with that shit, just like lose your wife to somebody

2787
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,100
and then like be totally fine with being, you know, that that close

2788
02:15:58,100 --> 02:16:02,340
to a direct business relationship with them is sickening.

2789
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:06,660
Yeah, you know, this voicemail are really, really hit on something.

2790
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:07,980
I think we've all been missing.

2791
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:10,820
I don't think Trixie has been acting in her best interest lately.

2792
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:14,540
You don't say.

2793
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:19,860
I just can't believe.

2794
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:23,700
That's true. It's true.

2795
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:29,540
Ethan Ralph is a terrible, heinous man who, in addition to all

2796
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:32,540
his many other personal failings, personally,

2797
02:16:34,780 --> 02:16:39,940
yeah, cucked Trixie, the fiance cheated on Trixie

2798
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:45,060
with this man, but she's fine with being friends with Dick Masterson,

2799
02:16:45,060 --> 02:16:48,660
who is buddies with Ralph because, well, I don't know why.

2800
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,020
Just whatever the reason.

2801
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:51,020
Yeah, it's true.

2802
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:53,500
What a strange narrative being spawned over there.

2803
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:57,940
I think it's dead now.

2804
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:01,380
Next voicemail should have uploaded this sooner.

2805
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:05,100
Next one is called, OK, Henlo Corgo, eight,

2806
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:09,620
Ben's next PCPU lecture three, two, one, go.

2807
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:14,340
Hey, Ben, if you guys ever do a rad con again,

2808
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:16,740
I have a great idea for your next lecture.

2809
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:18,300
Are you ready for it?

2810
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:20,780
OK, here it goes.

2811
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:26,340
The hottest goss in the universe, volume two, PCP edition.

2812
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:28,180
Huh? Huh?

2813
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:29,380
You were just think about it.

2814
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:30,060
Just think about it.

2815
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:33,460
You're not the first person to suggest a PCP

2816
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:36,660
lore or history lecture.

2817
02:17:37,220 --> 02:17:39,260
It's it's it's it's an idea.

2818
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:40,380
It's an idea.

2819
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:44,420
I feel like the problem with it on a conceptual level

2820
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:47,500
is that the only people who would find it interesting

2821
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,700
are people who are already clued into it.

2822
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:54,620
Like, who's going to want to learn about this PCP show?

2823
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:58,860
I mean, I didn't see I didn't see that as a problem

2824
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:02,780
with the RFCK lecture, and I don't necessarily see that as a problem.

2825
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:07,420
Yeah, but RFCK lectures is promoting like a fun discord MMO.

2826
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:10,460
PCP lecture would be promoting instead of the history,

2827
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:12,340
the nightmare that is the PCP.

2828
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:14,620
Yeah. Yeah. Why would you ever want to promote?

2829
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:15,620
Yeah.

2830
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:20,700
The lower this is, the more successful it is, the potential of being.

2831
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:23,340
I don't think it's a terrible idea.

2832
02:18:24,220 --> 02:18:26,260
I've part of it's disingenuous.

2833
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:29,380
Part of me feels it's a little disingenuous to do something on yourself.

2834
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:33,380
Like, if someone else feels you, actually, that'd be one thing.

2835
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:36,300
But then they get it wrong.

2836
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:39,380
I feel like I kind of see what you mean.

2837
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,740
But but nobody else is going to do it.

2838
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:43,740
Right. Nobody else is going to make a video.

2839
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:45,660
No one in the right mind would do that.

2840
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:50,660
Yeah, we have to be the change we want to see in the world, maybe.

2841
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:54,540
OK, the next one is called it's called Be Better.

2842
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:56,780
Three, two, one, go.

2843
02:18:57,980 --> 02:19:03,340
The truth is, Trixie hasn't said shit about Ben in months and months.

2844
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:09,900
All that's left is Ben obsessively sticking to the same talking point

2845
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:14,580
and cracking jokes to the applaud of a handful of people on Twitter.

2846
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:19,140
Call anyone who thinks you're being a massive loser.

2847
02:19:20,380 --> 02:19:23,220
That should make the emptiness go away.

2848
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:26,820
I mean, I don't care, dude, if you don't think it's funny,

2849
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:33,180
if you don't think Trixie is funny, then, you know, that's that's OK.

2850
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:36,180
You're you, I guess you just don't get.

2851
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:38,900
I guess you just don't see the humor in the situation, which is fine.

2852
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:43,100
Not everyone is cut out for the high level stuff.

2853
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:47,260
OK, not everyone understands dramatic irony.

2854
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:49,780
That's all right.

2855
02:19:49,780 --> 02:19:56,100
Next voicemail is called a theory on was on Shreddit.

2856
02:19:56,220 --> 02:20:01,780
Lull Keck Omega Lull Keck G three, two, one, go.

2857
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:04,740
Hey, guys, guess what?

2858
02:20:05,620 --> 02:20:10,220
Did you know that that incel dude, a theory on was actually on that show

2859
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:12,420
that you interviewed last episode?

2860
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:14,060
Yeah, it's true.

2861
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:17,100
I hope you guys don't believe in guilt by association.

2862
02:20:17,700 --> 02:20:20,620
You know, it's like to have shitty people on your show.

2863
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:26,660
What? Also, but Christian and but Ben

2864
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:29,740
states for making his garbage ass OC candidate.

2865
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:33,220
You're really everything you fucking shit.

2866
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:35,900
What the fuck is that guy OK?

2867
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:37,300
He's not OK.

2868
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:39,260
He seems to be mad.

2869
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:41,700
Wow. OK, buddy.

2870
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:44,260
Maybe the thing was a joke at the end.

2871
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,900
Maybe. I didn't hear.

2872
02:20:46,900 --> 02:20:50,420
You know, let's just try to tell me this when he when he when he came close

2873
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:53,420
to the mic and said I didn't know what he meant there.

2874
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:57,260
Let's let's just assume it was it was a it was a goof.

2875
02:20:57,300 --> 02:21:00,980
It was a weirdly delivered comedy sting.

2876
02:21:01,980 --> 02:21:05,820
Yeah, I don't know who Ethereum is other than people were saying he's like

2877
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:12,980
a racist incel who was I saw a clip shredded of some of his discord messages.

2878
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:15,580
Very, very bad.

2879
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:17,700
Yeah, he seems pretty bad.

2880
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:20,300
I'd never heard of him before.

2881
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,420
I don't know what else to say about it.

2882
02:21:24,460 --> 02:21:27,740
Next voicemail is fuck.

2883
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:29,820
I forgot to fucking post it.

2884
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:31,820
Next voice is called now you did.

2885
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:34,820
It's what did I.

2886
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:36,140
Oh, yeah, no, I did. Yeah.

2887
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:37,180
OK, yeah, the one that's three.

2888
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:38,500
You missed one. You're right.

2889
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,860
You're right. OK.

2890
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:43,660
The one that's five seconds is called Nate's new podcast in five seconds.

2891
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,100
Three, two, one, go.

2892
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:48,860
Am I so out of touch?

2893
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:53,500
No, it's the children who are wrong is give you you listen to it.

2894
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:56,140
Is that is that an accurate summary?

2895
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:58,900
They talk about YouTube and in video games,

2896
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:01,820
and I vaguely recall it being very

2897
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:08,700
like old hat conversation topics that have been talked about on the PCP and before.

2898
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:12,340
Nate really is really listening.

2899
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:19,300
Nate really is very indignant sometimes that like video game is not like old video game.

2900
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:22,620
So unfortunate.

2901
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:26,620
Hopefully, hopefully he changes his mind, opens his eyes

2902
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:31,540
and and comes and just quick comes to the modern day and plays and plays

2903
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:34,660
and plays the quake mod of the slime factory quick.

2904
02:22:34,660 --> 02:22:37,300
Yeah, I think I think he could learn a lot

2905
02:22:37,300 --> 02:22:39,860
if he just goes down to crack slime factory and quake,

2906
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:41,940
you can download on my website, courtesy dot net.

2907
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:46,900
Everything you need to know about game design.

2908
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:51,500
There's a new 10 seconds new game is old game.

2909
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,140
It's amazing. Yeah.

2910
02:22:53,140 --> 02:22:56,820
And in fact, also, just a plug, if you download it from my website,

2911
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:59,940
you can also get the the map file and the WAD,

2912
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,500
which you can then open up in the editor in trench room.

2913
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:06,060
And you can see how I made it and you can make your own level based on the same assets.

2914
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:09,420
You can you can modify the level as as it exists.

2915
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,620
You can tweak it. Oh, very nice.

2916
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:14,060
Very cool.

2917
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:18,900
OK, next voicemail is called Easy Breezy, Beautiful Tarbuck Transom.

2918
02:23:18,980 --> 02:23:21,100
Three, two, one, go.

2919
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:24,500
You ever get into a pool that's too cold

2920
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:27,300
so you hold perfectly still and you can tolerate it for a while

2921
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:30,100
because you develop this aura around you of comfort.

2922
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:32,740
But as soon as you move, it's too cold again.

2923
02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:33,860
Think about that.

2924
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:38,260
But with air fucking, a fan isn't a total replacement for air conditioning.

2925
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:40,580
But you can forgo having it run every five minutes

2926
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:43,820
if you supplement it with a fan and you'll get the same effect for less money.

2927
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:46,780
My fuckers never heard of windshield. God damn.

2928
02:23:47,140 --> 02:23:51,940
What? I feel like this is in response to nothing, but I agree.

2929
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:56,420
My my air conditioner has a fan in it.

2930
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:59,020
It runs on an automatic temperature sensor

2931
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:02,300
that when it gets below a certain temperature, it turns on the air conditioner.

2932
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:05,020
And when it gets above that, we're going to get below that.

2933
02:24:05,260 --> 02:24:08,100
It's just the same sensation of air moving,

2934
02:24:08,660 --> 02:24:12,540
air pressure changing across your skin is enough to make you feel cool.

2935
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:15,260
I know. And I know that. Everyone knows that.

2936
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:17,100
So I don't know. Is that controversial?

2937
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:18,900
I don't know. I don't get it.

2938
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:23,100
Big, big fan fan, big fan stand, tarbuck trance.

2939
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:30,140
Next, the next voicemail is this one came through

2940
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:34,140
some fucking vocaru secondary website.

2941
02:24:34,540 --> 02:24:36,860
This was uploaded via fast upload.

2942
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:41,100
It is called snippet of Trixie singing at a music

2943
02:24:41,980 --> 02:24:44,780
show. It's taking a second.

2944
02:24:45,740 --> 02:24:48,300
It's taking a second to wait. No, I already uploaded.

2945
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:50,780
There it is. OK, three, two, one, go.

2946
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:57,980
It's that Trixie. Yes, I get it.

2947
02:24:58,220 --> 02:25:02,340
Yes, I can't even remember that she did a song, but I guess she did.

2948
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:07,780
I mean, I I'm sure this is after I stopped watching.

2949
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:09,580
Yeah, it's later on.

2950
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:11,700
I would believe.

2951
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:15,140
Well, she was like a sort of main character.

2952
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:17,820
Equestria Girls 2 Rainbow Rocks.

2953
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:21,220
Right. Oh, so this is the good one.

2954
02:25:21,220 --> 02:25:23,340
It's the good one.

2955
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:25,420
Yeah, next voice.

2956
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:27,820
There's like three more I found out recently.

2957
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:31,700
I know there was a I knew there was at least one more.

2958
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:33,580
And I assumed there were at least two.

2959
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:36,620
But I think there's the one where they do like the fucking school

2960
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:38,860
like athletics school Olympics.

2961
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:42,900
And then it also ends in like demonic something or other.

2962
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:45,860
They just don't have any good ideas for those things.

2963
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:47,020
They did not.

2964
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:49,300
And I mean, that's the first question girls.

2965
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:51,540
It was never it was never a good idea to begin with.

2966
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:53,180
So, yeah, like you can have a.

2967
02:25:53,180 --> 02:25:56,020
I stand by this the second one is kind of good.

2968
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,140
The second one's kind of good.

2969
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:00,700
The first one. That was as good as it was ever going to get.

2970
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:02,220
They should have stopped there.

2971
02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:05,260
But they it's the best thing they could have done with what they had for sure.

2972
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:08,300
I still find it to be boring.

2973
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,540
Compared to real movies.

2974
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:14,180
Well, of course, definitely.

2975
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,740
We're sitting on a curve.

2976
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:17,020
This isn't cinema.

2977
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:20,060
This is this is where is my something else?

2978
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:23,340
This is a toy commercial that's two hours long.

2979
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:31,460
Next voicemail is called Big Chicken's Egg of Quote Penance.

2980
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:33,580
Three, two, one, go.

2981
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:37,740
When I made that last voicemail, it was before it was before

2982
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:39,100
Kristi got arrested.

2983
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:41,540
I was asking, I was asking to have her on the podcast,

2984
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:44,220
but it was before she got arrested and then and then she got arrested.

2985
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:48,420
And you said, oh, you said you can't get her out because she's arrested.

2986
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:49,860
I'm sorry.

2987
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:51,060
It's OK, Big Chicken.

2988
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:54,420
Pog, Pog, Pog, Soy.

2989
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:57,380
So I forgive you, Big Chicken.

2990
02:26:57,940 --> 02:26:59,820
Nobody could have seen it coming.

2991
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:02,740
It sounds like what a chicken would sound like if it was a human.

2992
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:05,740
Soy, Pog, Pog, Soy.

2993
02:27:07,940 --> 02:27:11,300
When you Pog too hard, that's when you Soy, that's that's the line.

2994
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:15,340
Next one is called Dammit Gibb.

2995
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:18,060
Three, two, one, go.

2996
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:21,660
You have to stop fucking dying.

2997
02:27:21,660 --> 02:27:24,020
I'm trying to fucking die with it.

2998
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:28,700
I mean, I had you considered just stop, stop.

2999
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:31,220
Just just quit.

3000
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:33,980
Just control Z dying.

3001
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:36,660
Hmm.

3002
02:27:36,660 --> 02:27:38,620
But I like dying, though.

3003
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:40,420
It's fun. I knew it.

3004
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:41,460
I knew it. I knew it.

3005
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:43,500
Are you saying that you were the reason you're dying?

3006
02:27:46,220 --> 02:27:47,740
Yeah, must be something.

3007
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:50,140
Because if it was someone else, I would have an enemy to fight.

3008
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:54,980
Next voicemail is is called

3009
02:27:55,860 --> 02:28:00,820
Ben St. More like been gamed by Nate's new podcast, Lamal.

3010
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:03,180
Three, two, one, go.

3011
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:06,380
Trixie's biggest problem that will come back again and again

3012
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:09,220
to fuck up everything she does is and always will be that she is incredibly

3013
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:12,020
intellectually lazy, complete and utter refusal to read up on a research.

3014
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:14,700
Anything bursting onto a scene where summarizing a plot while throwing

3015
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:17,220
in occasional nitpicks and shitty sketches was considered good criticism.

3016
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:19,940
She had obvious appeal as someone who tried to talk about cultural context,

3017
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:22,300
art history, motives, themes and the likes.

3018
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:25,300
But like with everything she touched, be it neurotyping, music or politics,

3019
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:27,900
she refused to read up on the most basic concepts and look further than what

3020
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:30,820
immediately occurred to her, opting to try to reinvent the wheel, trying desperately

3021
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:33,420
and failing to formulate theories that have been well established decades ago.

3022
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:36,620
Bogey Pop Lamal threw her way or lens of wheat and internet addiction induced

3023
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:39,540
brain rot, no wonder other essayists who came long after her run circles

3024
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:41,420
around her in terms of writing, ability and analysis.

3025
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:43,460
Hope those twist teller rap shows pay good.

3026
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:46,700
Now gossip more about may please also wears, Tom, I miss my boy.

3027
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:50,220
My boy, I agree.

3028
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:54,660
Yo, I agree with everything that you just said.

3029
02:28:54,660 --> 02:28:59,940
Yes, that was a pretty, pretty good summation, pretty good take.

3030
02:29:00,180 --> 02:29:06,380
Yeah, was this a synced summary of the court issue that has always been so.

3031
02:29:07,060 --> 02:29:10,060
Yeah. OK, next one.

3032
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:13,300
This one is a Nate head with rage.

3033
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:18,900
It's a minute 30, three, two, just like a Nate had to fucking take a minute

3034
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:22,060
30 to say what I'm sure they could say in 20 seconds.

3035
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:24,620
Three, two, one, go.

3036
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:26,780
Hey, self-proclaimed Nate here.

3037
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:29,700
No, because Nate is a genius and it's a shed.

3038
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:30,900
Nate's a fucking gay boy.

3039
02:29:30,900 --> 02:29:33,820
Everyone knows is he's fucking true.

3040
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:35,300
He cries in the enemy.

3041
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:37,420
He cries in musicals and shit.

3042
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:39,620
He's at least tries to be a human being.

3043
02:29:39,940 --> 02:29:41,900
He at least has a fucking soul.

3044
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:44,860
And he's the only guy in his own relationship.

3045
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:49,620
And you guys are fucking garbage friends who allow these fucking

3046
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:53,420
whims and cowards on the voicemail to shit on his content

3047
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:55,500
and she was even there to defend himself.

3048
02:29:55,740 --> 02:29:59,140
And you don't fucking live to now to defend your fucking friend

3049
02:29:59,140 --> 02:30:02,340
and your fucking brother and give the listen to the beginning

3050
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:05,340
of the Virginia report test and see how he talks about you

3051
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,180
and how he loves you and shit.

3052
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:09,660
When he is not there, you fucking shit on his corner.

3053
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:11,260
Say, I don't get it.

3054
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:12,380
Of course, you don't fucking get it.

3055
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:13,220
You're fucking stupid.

3056
02:30:13,220 --> 02:30:15,020
The fucking fun was of a human being.

3057
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:17,260
The educational system they came was fucking sucked

3058
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:20,460
because you're so fucking stupid when I talk about lifting weights

3059
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:24,820
instead of just lift the fucking weight and not even move your arms and shit.

3060
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:27,620
And when you told this to Nate, she just left.

3061
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:28,540
Oh, yeah, it was.

3062
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,380
He didn't even make fun of you.

3063
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:32,740
But when he is not there, you guys shit on him.

3064
02:30:33,380 --> 02:30:35,460
And your comics fucking suck.

3065
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:37,660
No one's going to fucking read that she is.

3066
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:42,100
You allow Munchie to say the end one of the podcast when he was a minor

3067
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:44,700
and you got a fucking moron.

3068
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:46,580
Wow, damn.

3069
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:47,220
Hold on.

3070
02:30:47,220 --> 02:30:48,420
Got us there.

3071
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:51,060
Shit. Hope you go to hell before you die.

3072
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:53,860
It's so. You go to hell before you die.

3073
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:55,940
And I thought.

3074
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:59,180
He at least ended it with a funny Mario reference.

3075
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:03,900
He did end it with a funny, you go to hell before you die.

3076
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:06,900
Wait, did he say he hopes we go to hell before we die?

3077
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:10,300
I like the implication that like it would have been OK for Munchie

3078
02:31:10,300 --> 02:31:14,020
to say the N word in the podcast if if he were an adult.

3079
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:18,540
Yeah, I hope you go to hell before you die. Wow.

3080
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:22,540
OK, I mean, we're in America.

3081
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:24,580
OK, what did he say?

3082
02:31:24,580 --> 02:31:29,220
Like the Virginia pod or the virginity podcast, Nate says.

3083
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:32,260
OK, that was like three years ago.

3084
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:33,660
That was like three years ago.

3085
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:37,940
And like this guy is like you you you you you you let the voicemails

3086
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:39,820
shit on Nate when he's not here to.

3087
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:42,820
He's not here to defend himself because he isn't here.

3088
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:45,940
He could fucking be here if he wanted to and he chooses not to be.

3089
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:47,700
So like, why is that our fault?

3090
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:52,500
Guy, my guy, you're you're you're you're misplacing the blame here.

3091
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:56,620
I mean, we've said multiple times, we don't screen the voicemail.

3092
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:58,700
So it's not like we're allowing anything.

3093
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:02,100
It's just whatever shows up.

3094
02:32:02,380 --> 02:32:03,100
I'm not going to.

3095
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:07,260
Has has anyone here actually like seriously been like fuck Nate?

3096
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:09,420
I don't think so.

3097
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:13,100
I mean, I mean, a few occasionally in voicemail.

3098
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,700
Well, yeah.

3099
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:17,580
No, no, no, I mean, if any of us been like, yeah, fuck Nate,

3100
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:19,820
I don't think anyone's been like that in his time.

3101
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:21,300
I think I'm pretty.

3102
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:24,180
I think I'm I think I'm pretty generous, honestly.

3103
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:26,580
Like, I yeah, I don't.

3104
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:30,780
Like I didn't say I didn't watch his Michael because because like.

3105
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:31,700
So I don't know.

3106
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:35,580
I want him to make good videos and it's sort of a shame when that one was

3107
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:38,380
so confusing and bad and lots of other people felt it was.

3108
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,580
That's just talking about it.

3109
02:32:40,580 --> 02:32:41,540
The Michael video.

3110
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:43,460
The the it's a new one.

3111
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:44,380
See that time?

3112
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:45,580
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

3113
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:48,020
It's it's it's a new it's a new it's hard.

3114
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:49,700
It's really hard to explain.

3115
02:32:49,700 --> 02:32:54,620
Actually, the the the basic thing is that it's a very long

3116
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:59,460
beyond during video of multiple different topics about the video game

3117
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:06,180
industry, which are at their core kind of basic, but they are elevated

3118
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:09,780
into seeming as if it's a big smart thing.

3119
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:12,100
And it just it was very confusing.

3120
02:33:12,820 --> 02:33:17,420
OK, I reject the idea that I was too dumb to figure it out.

3121
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:23,260
Yeah, the this kind of I'm kind of annoyed.

3122
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:28,260
I'm kind of annoyed at this guy is like, guys, Nate said he liked you

3123
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:34,060
one time three years ago, and now you allow criticism of him on your show.

3124
02:33:34,060 --> 02:33:35,300
That's so unfair.

3125
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:37,500
Yeah, I don't hate Nate or anything.

3126
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:40,060
I don't know if you listen to the old episodes.

3127
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:42,900
We like joke and dunked on each other all the time.

3128
02:33:43,460 --> 02:33:46,260
I mean, my God, Nate, Nate has basically

3129
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:50,540
has basically bailed on two podcasts with you, give Nate doesn't come

3130
02:33:50,540 --> 02:33:55,060
on the PCP anymore, and he's basically stopped doing the the the the body cast.

3131
02:33:55,540 --> 02:33:59,820
So like if he whatever, if he wants to defend himself, he can come on the show

3132
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:01,620
if he feels the need. Right.

3133
02:34:01,620 --> 02:34:04,060
I didn't even realize the I don't I don't did it end.

3134
02:34:04,700 --> 02:34:06,900
I didn't like officially end, but they haven't done it.

3135
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:07,580
I never officially.

3136
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:10,340
Months. It just I didn't know it was still

3137
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:13,220
it wasn't going on anymore, because like obviously I don't watch it

3138
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:15,580
because I haven't watched one piece on a spoiler for myself.

3139
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:17,700
But it has it has been a while.

3140
02:34:17,700 --> 02:34:18,540
Well, he's been a while.

3141
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:22,500
Sometimes like taken like, oh, sure, we haven't done an episode in a while.

3142
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,780
We'll do like three chapters this time.

3143
02:34:24,780 --> 02:34:28,260
And it's just been one of those but extended over a longer period of time.

3144
02:34:28,980 --> 02:34:31,220
And to the point where people are like, oh, it's over.

3145
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:34,300
I'm like, well, I never was intended to be over.

3146
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:39,780
But I did ask him at one point and he said he was busy with with editing.

3147
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:43,580
So I don't know. I guess I could ask him again.

3148
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,140
Hmm.

3149
02:34:47,140 --> 02:34:48,900
Um, yeah, I don't know.

3150
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:53,780
I really don't get where this voicemailer is coming from, but I don't know.

3151
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:58,180
He could have just it really is like a longer form version of a thing

3152
02:34:58,180 --> 02:34:59,980
that you could have just said, fuck you.

3153
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:02,980
And then that that would have been I do.

3154
02:35:03,100 --> 02:35:05,860
I do feel like it could have been half the length, right?

3155
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:07,780
I think I'm I'm right on that.

3156
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:13,340
Next next voicemail is called where was I?

3157
02:35:14,180 --> 02:35:16,140
Wait, OK, I'm sorry.

3158
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:18,900
I uploaded the wrong one upload.

3159
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:24,780
Well, OK, the one that's there right now, one thirteen is called Hugh Janus.

3160
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:27,180
Three, two, one, go.

3161
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:29,580
There is a non-zero percent chance

3162
02:35:29,740 --> 02:35:33,340
they may as getting gunned at this very moment, feeling Ethan's sweaty.

3163
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:37,220
Harry Belly resting on her spine, grinding her vertebra together.

3164
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:41,540
As he forces his unimpressive pecker down to try to get her trusty

3165
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:43,300
as I like to call it.

3166
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:46,140
Maybe he even has to stand on a foot still to reach her.

3167
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:50,020
Anyways, did you ever notice that in all green screen scenes

3168
02:35:50,020 --> 02:35:53,260
in the nostalgia critics, the wall, no one is wearing shoes.

3169
02:35:53,620 --> 02:35:58,020
They're all in socks, sometimes even with colorful, funny designs on them.

3170
02:35:58,460 --> 02:35:59,060
That's.

3171
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:02,100
No, why did you cut off?

3172
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:04,300
I wanted to hear more.

3173
02:36:05,460 --> 02:36:08,980
Well, I guess that's because I don't want to get mud on the green screen.

3174
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:11,540
Why would they have mud on their shoes?

3175
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:15,100
Well, they probably just fill me in doors and they don't wear their shoes

3176
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:18,060
in doors, something that simple.

3177
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,300
And they just they didn't consider it.

3178
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,620
They're just like, we're all just wearing socks.

3179
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:26,180
That is really funny that they're all wearing socks all the time

3180
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:28,140
because Doug was like, don't take your shoes off

3181
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,460
before you step on the green screen floor. Absolutely.

3182
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:34,380
Well, it's too big to fit in the washing machine.

3183
02:36:34,380 --> 02:36:36,860
You can't wash it. You guys got we got to be careful.

3184
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:38,220
Fair enough.

3185
02:36:38,220 --> 02:36:40,700
But like then just crop the scene so you don't see the feet.

3186
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:43,260
Right. Oh, my God.

3187
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:46,860
Well, that was that was a treat.

3188
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:54,820
Next voicemail is called Robo Sam Tokyo Robot Chef 321 Go.

3189
02:37:04,020 --> 02:37:09,260
I am Robo Sam.

3190
02:37:11,580 --> 02:37:14,860
Jack Knapp, the big man is your foreskin.

3191
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:19,220
Where's your foreskin, Ben?

3192
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:20,820
We still get voicemails.

3193
02:37:20,820 --> 02:37:22,220
You cut off your foreskin.

3194
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:26,820
No, I mean, you know, man,

3195
02:37:27,780 --> 02:37:32,860
your foreskin is the secret ingredient to my soul.

3196
02:37:34,020 --> 02:37:38,140
I am creating that safe foreskin film.

3197
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:43,300
The other ingredient is the sweat of your feet.

3198
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:47,580
Is this the villain of Phantom's Revenge?

3199
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:55,740
See, if we were going to do a PCP lecture,

3200
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:59,140
it's this kind of stuff that'd be really interesting to try to integrate.

3201
02:37:59,140 --> 02:38:02,780
It's like, yeah, then we got to the weird voicemail arc and.

3202
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:04,860
It never stopped.

3203
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:08,300
I understand I understand where this guy is coming from.

3204
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:13,820
He wants to make soup and I want to keep my anus, my taint sweat.

3205
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:17,060
So, you know, clearly there's a there's a conflict of interest there.

3206
02:38:17,900 --> 02:38:19,940
He's a natural foil for me.

3207
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:26,220
But it's just it's just going to have to be what it is, you know, conflicts.

3208
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:28,980
The conflicts just keep on keep on mounting.

3209
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:31,460
Next one is called

3210
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:37,660
born born to mop three to one go.

3211
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:42,660
This is Ben's weekly reminder to not watch.

3212
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:47,660
It was about watching one piece.

3213
02:38:47,660 --> 02:38:48,460
It was about reading it.

3214
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:50,460
Does anybody ask about watching one piece?

3215
02:38:51,220 --> 02:38:53,420
I would never watch one piece.

3216
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:55,620
People do tell me to read one piece.

3217
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:57,700
You must have meant not read one piece.

3218
02:38:57,700 --> 02:38:59,100
Well, wait, no, he's right.

3219
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:00,820
I should not watch one piece.

3220
02:39:00,820 --> 02:39:02,380
So he's right, actually.

3221
02:39:02,380 --> 02:39:04,620
I should read it. Yeah. OK.

3222
02:39:04,620 --> 02:39:06,580
Well, that's fine, then that makes total sense.

3223
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:11,700
Next voicemail is called.

3224
02:39:12,260 --> 02:39:13,620
Oh, I already put it there.

3225
02:39:13,620 --> 02:39:19,220
Re bad comments award show number one, three, two, one go.

3226
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:22,260
Forgive me for not knowing the lore

3227
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:25,220
because there was supposed to be a fucking lecture

3228
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:28,260
about this shit that's just never coming out now.

3229
02:39:28,620 --> 02:39:33,780
But the PCP is originally the horseshoe crew, right?

3230
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:35,860
And that's a Jesse thing.

3231
02:39:35,860 --> 02:39:39,700
Sort of the horseshoe drowning in horseshoe's channel.

3232
02:39:40,060 --> 02:39:44,060
So therefore, if the PCP had originally been

3233
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:46,260
on a specific person's channel,

3234
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:49,300
wouldn't it have been on the drowning in horseshoe?

3235
02:39:49,300 --> 02:39:54,700
It was not a group formed as Jesse is the Jesse being the leader.

3236
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:57,140
It was just a cool name and we were all friends.

3237
02:39:57,140 --> 02:40:03,140
But the but the first horse cast was on Jesse's first horse cast was

3238
02:40:03,460 --> 02:40:06,660
yeah, Jesse and and Trixie.

3239
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:10,340
And then I was there and then T-Bab was there.

3240
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:14,500
Yeah, I don't I don't think there was ever any real chance

3241
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:18,260
it was going to be housed on on that channel, though.

3242
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:24,420
Next one is called making comics is hard three, two, one go.

3243
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:27,220
Have you ever considered so that, you know,

3244
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:29,980
making a comic doesn't take literally forever?

3245
02:40:29,980 --> 02:40:32,740
Tommy J is sending too many voicemails.

3246
02:40:32,740 --> 02:40:33,740
It has to be said.

3247
02:40:33,740 --> 02:40:35,500
There's three artists there.

3248
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:39,420
You have Ben, the artist, give the artist and Tom, the artist.

3249
02:40:39,740 --> 02:40:42,900
So is it so insane to have one of you

3250
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:46,900
write a comic and the other one draw it or one of you writes a comic

3251
02:40:46,900 --> 02:40:49,220
and two people split up drawing it?

3252
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:51,940
I mean, I don't even care if the fucking art styles clash.

3253
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:53,300
That would be what are you talking about?

3254
02:40:53,300 --> 02:40:55,140
Which panel was the give panel?

3255
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:56,900
All right, I know was this all right.

3256
02:40:56,900 --> 02:40:59,300
That's which panel and panel.

3257
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:04,220
You know, I don't it doesn't sound like a very bad idea to me to be completely.

3258
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:06,460
Yeah, it'd be cool and it'd be funny.

3259
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:07,540
I don't know, man.

3260
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:08,620
I just I don't know.

3261
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:10,860
The answer is because we don't want to. OK, we just don't want to.

3262
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:12,940
I don't know. I got I got people.

3263
02:41:12,940 --> 02:41:16,260
I'm paying people with Radcon funds to do the dojin.

3264
02:41:16,260 --> 02:41:20,620
It's fine. Next voicemail is called I'm working on.

3265
02:41:20,620 --> 02:41:21,860
I got my own shit.

3266
02:41:21,860 --> 02:41:23,660
I want to get a fanish fan of revenge.

3267
02:41:23,660 --> 02:41:27,460
I want to spend I'm going to spend this fucking month drawing the PCP dojin.

3268
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:30,740
I guess I guess drawing comics is really easy and I was wrong.

3269
02:41:30,740 --> 02:41:34,780
So, sir, for us and send the completed

3270
02:41:35,580 --> 02:41:38,900
you have one week next voicemail link us the completed comic.

3271
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:43,580
You know, it's just like to bias in Animorphs.

3272
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:48,020
By the way, check out my appearance on the Animorph in Time podcast, by the way.

3273
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:51,260
But it's just like Animorph says, you know, just because you're a bird

3274
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:56,420
and you're made to fly and flap your wings doesn't mean it's easy.

3275
02:41:56,740 --> 02:42:00,860
Doesn't mean it's not hard and exhausting to flap your wings and fly

3276
02:42:01,220 --> 02:42:05,740
unless you find a juicy thermal to ride around the sky. Right.

3277
02:42:05,900 --> 02:42:11,060
Comics is like 99 percent flapping your wings trying to keep yourself in the air.

3278
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:14,340
And it's only really once you like finish the last panel

3279
02:42:14,660 --> 02:42:17,300
that you finally hit that thermal updraft until then.

3280
02:42:17,300 --> 02:42:19,460
It's just I think so.

3281
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:22,580
It's it's all grinding until you get a publisher to

3282
02:42:22,940 --> 02:42:25,660
until you get Diamond Publishing to distribute you nationwide.

3283
02:42:25,660 --> 02:42:27,980
It's all flapping until then. It really is.

3284
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:36,180
Next voicemail is called Starbucks Ransom three two one go.

3285
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:42,260
Tarbuck, that doesn't sound very trans or handsome.

3286
02:42:43,220 --> 02:42:45,860
Get a life. Yeah.

3287
02:42:45,980 --> 02:42:48,980
Oh, transom. Sure.

3288
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:51,860
I get it. Why? Why not?

3289
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:55,020
Next voicemail is called

3290
02:42:56,220 --> 02:43:01,460
Bad Comet Awards Show two seventy two Shreddit three two one go.

3291
02:43:03,060 --> 02:43:04,380
You know something, Salaro.

3292
02:43:04,380 --> 02:43:07,180
See, I guess you could see I'm getting red right now, man,

3293
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:09,940
because your live tweet asked comments about how bends of live

3294
02:43:09,940 --> 02:43:12,860
are annoying me to the point of facial discoloration, dude.

3295
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:16,140
Next time you should explain what exactly your problem is, brother,

3296
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:18,580
because your groveling attitude will be no favors.

3297
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:24,540
So what you're going to do when procrastinemia runs wild over you?

3298
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:26,900
That's a great comment. What are you talking about?

3299
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:30,340
Tommy J. What are you on? That's that comment ruled.

3300
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:35,300
First of all, these are all these are all time.

3301
02:43:35,300 --> 02:43:37,860
Tommy J. You send too many voicemails, dude.

3302
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:39,860
I like I fucking we fucking been over this.

3303
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:42,700
OK, fucking get a grip.

3304
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:45,340
What if Tommy J. is just crack with putting on a voice?

3305
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:48,820
Yeah, this is just yeah, that's all there you go.

3306
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:55,580
OK, I love that this one threatens the other commenter

3307
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:58,020
with defeat in the Royal Rumble.

3308
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:02,260
Like that's the consequence for making a bad comment as it should be.

3309
02:44:02,820 --> 02:44:07,860
Second of all, OK, I don't want to single out Salaro, but two two weeks ago.

3310
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:10,620
So Salaro does have this habit. Salaro will.

3311
02:44:11,180 --> 02:44:13,660
First of all, I love Salaro.

3312
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:16,820
Salaro is very supportive on the Shekels for Heckels streams.

3313
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:22,220
So I'm not trying to call them out, but they do make comments

3314
02:44:22,620 --> 02:44:27,060
where they will just be like, Ben, what you said about this was a lib take.

3315
02:44:27,060 --> 02:44:31,220
You had a lib take about this thing, and then sometimes they just won't elaborate.

3316
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:33,540
And they did this two weeks ago.

3317
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:38,140
This was when we were talking about gender stuff and how I said that like

3318
02:44:38,180 --> 02:44:42,180
I said that like, you know, maybe it maybe I should be a they

3319
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:44,780
because like I don't because gender stuff, right?

3320
02:44:44,780 --> 02:44:48,340
I said that thing about like, maybe I should be a they maybe that would be the right thing to do.

3321
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:53,580
And Salaro commented like, Ben, your take about gender was really live

3322
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:56,500
and you should and you should, you know, rethink it.

3323
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:58,300
And they didn't explain it at all.

3324
02:44:58,300 --> 02:45:01,020
And honestly, that one really kind of annoyed me

3325
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:05,380
because I genuinely don't think I said anything that I should be embarrassed about.

3326
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:11,740
And, yeah, fucking if you got a problem with what I said, tell me what it was.

3327
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,900
I guess I was holding this in.

3328
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:18,140
I was holding I've been holding this in for two weeks, that that one comment

3329
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:20,780
just rubbed me the wrong way and it got under my skin.

3330
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:26,660
Fuck, Tom and Jay, don't make so many voicemails.

3331
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:31,140
Somebody else talk, I can't remember what was said.

3332
02:45:31,140 --> 02:45:32,860
So it doesn't matter.

3333
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:37,060
I said, I said, I don't I said, I think gender is fake.

3334
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:38,180
I said, I think gender is fake.

3335
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:42,380
So maybe maybe they is the way to go, but also I don't want to do that because it's hard.

3336
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:49,780
Yeah. Oh, I think I think it's the maybe the declaring gender to be fake

3337
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:53,300
when clearly people do care about gendered expression.

3338
02:45:54,380 --> 02:45:56,540
So rather about all kinds of fake shit.

3339
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:02,660
So it's like it's it's more correct to say I don't care about what my gender

3340
02:46:03,660 --> 02:46:05,340
expression is.

3341
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:07,540
I don't see things as male or female.

3342
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:10,980
I just do what I want and then that would be a non binary action.

3343
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:13,780
Yeah, I mean, binary mode.

3344
02:46:13,780 --> 02:46:17,180
The trouble you get into is the same thing as saying, well, you know,

3345
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:18,980
I hate all the racism.

3346
02:46:18,980 --> 02:46:20,780
And in fact, race isn't even real.

3347
02:46:20,780 --> 02:46:21,860
I don't believe in it.

3348
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:25,220
You know, you go down that path and it's just that's true, though.

3349
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:26,900
I don't. It is fake.

3350
02:46:26,900 --> 02:46:30,620
Race is also fake and socially constructed experience that people feel

3351
02:46:30,620 --> 02:46:33,100
because of the social construct is real.

3352
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:36,300
And so I didn't say that it's not real.

3353
02:46:36,740 --> 02:46:39,580
No, I know. But that's that's probably where they're coming from.

3354
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:42,580
Yeah, you're probably right.

3355
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:46,620
Well, yeah, OK, whatever.

3356
02:46:47,500 --> 02:46:50,420
Just don't bully me. Come on, I'll kill you.

3357
02:46:51,220 --> 02:46:56,700
Just don't bully me and we won't have any more of these little problems.

3358
02:46:57,060 --> 02:46:59,660
Uh, next one is called

3359
02:47:00,220 --> 02:47:03,500
I don't feel like hooking up the good mic for this one.

3360
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:06,260
Three, two, one, go.

3361
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:11,860
They should make a magazine.

3362
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:16,500
That's just pictures of poor people looking real sad.

3363
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:21,220
And they can call it vanity unfair.

3364
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:26,780
Yeah, yeah, the idea of a magazine

3365
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:29,060
with just poor people in it was what made me laugh.

3366
02:47:29,980 --> 02:47:32,300
I don't know if that's appropriate.

3367
02:47:32,940 --> 02:47:35,300
That's the good shit.

3368
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:38,140
That's what I'm here for.

3369
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:40,860
Did I? Next one is called

3370
02:47:41,460 --> 02:47:47,540
Bad Comments Award Show two waifus three, two, one, go.

3371
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:52,780
I use the term best girl by sky or sometimes best person

3372
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:56,300
because I don't like the connotations of non-concentral ownership

3373
02:47:56,300 --> 02:47:58,620
that come along with the term waifu.

3374
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:02,020
Osteria Leaf Green, you thought you had a fantastic moral wink

3375
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:04,020
in the making with this comment, didn't you?

3376
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:06,340
That you could look down on everyone from the top of the pile.

3377
02:48:06,340 --> 02:48:10,260
The one person educated enough to know that waifu was a misogynistic term.

3378
02:48:10,780 --> 02:48:13,300
But there's one problem, one little thing to slip you up.

3379
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:14,780
You're wrong.

3380
02:48:14,780 --> 02:48:16,940
You got your little factoid backwards.

3381
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:19,660
Kanai is the term with the connotations of ownership

3382
02:48:19,660 --> 02:48:22,700
and waifu was the modernized loan word that replaced it.

3383
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:24,940
But you feel real smart now, huh?

3384
02:48:24,940 --> 02:48:30,140
I mean, I mean, waifu is still the same thing kind of.

3385
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:33,060
I think it's kind of the same thing.

3386
02:48:33,060 --> 02:48:39,660
If you think that waifu is a term that connotes sexist ownership,

3387
02:48:40,620 --> 02:48:43,620
then I guess people talk about it in an ownership way.

3388
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:45,020
It's like, oh, they're mine.

3389
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:47,260
You can't have them, you know, like.

3390
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:51,340
Well, I mean, when it's a fictional character that like, then like.

3391
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:53,340
I know, it's it's it's innocent enough.

3392
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:56,500
But like, if you're going to criticize it for being misogynistic,

3393
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:59,540
I don't think that's like in real in real life.

3394
02:48:59,620 --> 02:49:05,180
Ideally, a person who is a wife is married is, you know,

3395
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:07,420
doing that of their own volition, right?

3396
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:10,100
So it's not, you know, we don't.

3397
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:14,140
But if it's a fictional character, you have to declare it for them

3398
02:49:14,140 --> 02:49:15,940
because they don't have agency. They're they're fake.

3399
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:18,300
They don't have they can't make the decision.

3400
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:20,980
So I don't know, whatever.

3401
02:49:20,980 --> 02:49:22,580
I don't fucking care.

3402
02:49:22,580 --> 02:49:25,260
Next voicemail is called.

3403
02:49:28,220 --> 02:49:30,180
Wait, sorry, I lost track.

3404
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:32,020
I lost track of the voicemails.

3405
02:49:34,380 --> 02:49:36,380
Good, I have to go from the top.

3406
02:49:36,380 --> 02:49:37,340
Listen to all of them.

3407
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:39,620
Yes, it's bad.

3408
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:42,660
Bad comic award show three, Steven Universe.

3409
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:45,100
Three, two, one, go.

3410
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:47,700
Yeah. Wait, OK.

3411
02:49:48,620 --> 02:49:53,380
I really didn't like you guys simplifying the characters.

3412
02:49:53,740 --> 02:49:57,540
Now I'm literally just rocks and over sexualizing them.

3413
02:49:58,020 --> 02:50:02,340
Rebecca's sugar put time and effort into each and every one of them.

3414
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:08,380
And you just say, well, I love to go down with this fucking disgusting.

3415
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:12,980
You know, you know, Miss Anna, it's just so precious the way you come down here

3416
02:50:12,980 --> 02:50:17,820
and get so upset, so upset about the mistreatment of fictional characters.

3417
02:50:18,140 --> 02:50:20,700
I just bring scary Internet guys.

3418
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:22,940
Any more bad comic award show?

3419
02:50:22,940 --> 02:50:24,180
Yeah, I think so.

3420
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:25,660
I think the bits.

3421
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:27,420
I think the bit.

3422
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:31,900
I mean, the bit relies on, I mean, first of all, the voice terrible.

3423
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:37,420
The fact that they didn't stop the voice when they stopped reading the comment as well.

3424
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:39,620
Their voice is just the voice they're making.

3425
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:42,500
I just I just I just don't want these.

3426
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:44,820
These are not like entertainingly bad comments.

3427
02:50:44,820 --> 02:50:48,380
These are just like asinine, irritating, pointless comments.

3428
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:52,340
And I just don't want to hear this is just insulting and annoying to the listeners.

3429
02:50:52,900 --> 02:50:55,140
Yeah, I'm done with it.

3430
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:55,860
Yeah, I'm done with it.

3431
02:50:55,860 --> 02:51:01,180
Find nuggets of like really bad comments and have like a funny take.

3432
02:51:01,180 --> 02:51:02,340
Yeah, you have.

3433
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:06,500
Yeah, it's like not every episode is going to have a fucking

3434
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:08,540
jewel of a goofy bad comment.

3435
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:10,460
It's just it's just not going to be universal.

3436
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:14,260
The next voicemail, mercifully, is a Imgirlink.

3437
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:18,220
To Yager's Anonymous here.

3438
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:23,180
Why is Sarah's Hand there?

3439
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:24,100
I don't know.

3440
02:51:24,100 --> 02:51:26,620
I don't think she is one.

3441
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:30,140
And I don't know who that goth girl is on the right.

3442
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:34,660
I would imagine that is a Toho, something or other.

3443
02:51:35,420 --> 02:51:38,020
But I don't know some sort of anime thing.

3444
02:51:40,100 --> 02:51:41,380
I like I like it.

3445
02:51:41,380 --> 02:51:42,780
But I got to be I'm not.

3446
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:44,220
I don't think I'm getting.

3447
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:47,220
I don't think I'm getting the intent behind this one.

3448
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:49,660
I feel like I'm missing something.

3449
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:55,060
But nevertheless, love your love your work.

3450
02:51:55,060 --> 02:51:58,700
Voice mail, voicemail, Imgir, art man.

3451
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:00,900
Yes, next.

3452
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:03,300
Can all the voicemails just be images?

3453
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:05,220
They're so much quicker.

3454
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:06,540
This is the last episode.

3455
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:09,260
There was the the real this person did the really good,

3456
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:14,380
you know, virgin voicemail versus Chad, you know, voicemail image poster.

3457
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:16,180
And it's it's absolutely true.

3458
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:16,980
It really is.

3459
02:52:16,980 --> 02:52:20,100
It's just next voicemail is called.

3460
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:22,580
Sorry, I got it here.

3461
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:25,660
Next voicemail is called Sorry, It's Bad.

3462
02:52:26,380 --> 02:52:28,300
Oh, great.

3463
02:52:28,340 --> 02:52:30,060
Wait, no.

3464
02:52:30,060 --> 02:52:31,460
Wait, no, sorry.

3465
02:52:31,460 --> 02:52:32,820
Yeah, no, sorry.

3466
02:52:32,820 --> 02:52:35,140
The next one is called Applejack.

3467
02:52:35,140 --> 02:52:35,940
This is called.

3468
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:37,460
Sorry, It's Bad will come later.

3469
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:39,540
Applejack three, two, one, go.

3470
02:52:40,980 --> 02:52:42,180
Howdy, bad horn.

3471
02:52:42,180 --> 02:52:44,060
It's me, Applejack.

3472
02:52:44,060 --> 02:52:46,060
Now that the dimension was just happened,

3473
02:52:46,060 --> 02:52:48,180
every pony lives in the same dimension.

3474
02:52:48,180 --> 02:52:50,140
Ain't that something I think me.

3475
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:52,500
It really you twirl out in textured collab.

3476
02:52:52,500 --> 02:52:54,220
We should open a cider stand.

3477
02:52:54,220 --> 02:52:55,460
Oh, handle the apples.

3478
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:57,300
You can do the art and graphics.

3479
02:52:57,340 --> 02:53:01,060
If this sounds like a darn tooting good idea to you, send me a message.

3480
02:53:01,060 --> 02:53:03,740
I love you, Applejack with a Twitter.

3481
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:06,860
Get on it.

3482
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:11,820
I Applejack is a Applejack is a is a dependable pony

3483
02:53:12,020 --> 02:53:17,140
who would not bail on a business that we started together.

3484
02:53:17,300 --> 02:53:20,780
So I think it's a sound requiring it's a serious offer.

3485
02:53:21,620 --> 02:53:24,900
It absolutely Applejack won't waste my time.

3486
02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:26,340
I'm down.

3487
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:28,300
Let's fucking let's strike a deal.

3488
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:30,700
Let's take out a mortgage together.

3489
02:53:31,980 --> 02:53:34,100
Oh, God, Slime and Punishment will never end.

3490
02:53:34,460 --> 02:53:36,740
It'll just be a whole new pony arc.

3491
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:39,580
Phantom Phantom Horn gets married to Applejack.

3492
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:42,380
Slime, Punishment, Applewog.

3493
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:47,460
He he he brings he brings Applejack to New

3494
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:51,100
Los Angeles City and she becomes like the she like rises to the ranks

3495
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:54,020
and becomes like a mining tank, a tycoon, right?

3496
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:55,860
I think she would start a.

3497
02:53:55,860 --> 02:53:57,980
I think she would start.

3498
02:53:57,980 --> 02:53:59,380
I think she would start a co-op.

3499
02:53:59,380 --> 02:54:03,260
She would start a mining co-op to resist the dominant dominating

3500
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:07,500
capitalist power of like a do the farming.

3501
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:11,420
What do you call it, the reaping and sowing stuff?

3502
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:19,020
I know, I think that's I think that she if she were thrust into a new situation

3503
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:23,980
and she had to make the bet, I think she would take up whatever industry was like.

3504
02:54:24,980 --> 02:54:26,740
No, maybe she would grow the apples.

3505
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:29,140
I was thinking maybe she would just do what's more practical.

3506
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:31,620
Yeah, no, she's naturally.

3507
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:36,540
No, she's she could find a way to fashion apples out of Slime and sell those.

3508
02:54:37,220 --> 02:54:40,300
I'd be like acid candy apples dipped in Slime.

3509
02:54:40,940 --> 02:54:42,140
Dire dire apples.

3510
02:54:42,140 --> 02:54:44,860
We are they already grow dire apples in New Los Angeles.

3511
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:46,340
Oh, well, perfect.

3512
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:48,500
Major major cash crop.

3513
02:54:49,620 --> 02:54:52,820
Next voicemail is called a belated apology.

3514
02:54:52,860 --> 02:54:54,940
Three, two, one, go.

3515
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:58,660
I realized that if you played that 20 second clip of Trixie singing,

3516
02:54:58,860 --> 02:55:00,580
you might get a copyright strike.

3517
02:55:00,580 --> 02:55:02,140
Well, I'm sorry.

3518
02:55:02,140 --> 02:55:02,940
Too late.

3519
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:05,140
I just wanted to be funny.

3520
02:55:05,140 --> 02:55:06,780
Too late.

3521
02:55:06,780 --> 02:55:09,420
Oh, would we get a copy right strike?

3522
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:11,820
You know, Pony, probably.

3523
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:12,980
It's definitely possible.

3524
02:55:12,980 --> 02:55:14,300
Possible.

3525
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:18,220
Ellie is our, I don't know, fucking scramble the audio or whatever.

3526
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:24,540
Or just pitch shift it, delete it and then add it back in, reverse it, reverse.

3527
02:55:24,540 --> 02:55:27,020
Cut it down to be like two seconds long.

3528
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:30,540
At a noise gate that's extremely high.

3529
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:33,860
Yeah, next voicemail.

3530
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:35,780
And we're getting down to the end, by the way.

3531
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:38,540
Oh, I think we've got I think we've got three left.

3532
02:55:38,700 --> 02:55:40,540
The next one is called Twilight.

3533
02:55:40,540 --> 02:55:42,300
Three, two, one, go.

3534
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:44,940
Hey, Phantom Heart, it's me, Twilight Sparkle.

3535
02:55:45,140 --> 02:55:46,900
I've been a big fan of T that for years,

3536
02:55:46,900 --> 02:55:49,460
but I've never gotten the chance before to tell you base.

3537
02:55:49,540 --> 02:55:53,020
You're like my third favorite MLP creator, just behind KP and Dr.

3538
02:55:53,020 --> 02:55:57,340
Wolf, why'd you quit the fandom?

3539
02:55:57,460 --> 02:55:58,940
Don't you like our show?

3540
02:55:58,940 --> 02:56:00,180
Why you hate me?

3541
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:02,460
I used to love you and now you hate me.

3542
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:04,660
I'm never watching Tbap again.

3543
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:08,100
No, please don't change that channel, Twilight.

3544
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:09,060
Speaking of Dr.

3545
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:13,740
Wolf, I just I don't know if anyone's keeping their finger on the pulse

3546
02:56:13,740 --> 02:56:15,100
because I certainly aren't.

3547
02:56:15,140 --> 02:56:17,620
But for some reason in my recommended news,

3548
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:20,260
there was like an hour and forty five minute Dr.

3549
02:56:20,260 --> 02:56:23,900
Wolf video, like like with like an actual thumbnail,

3550
02:56:23,900 --> 02:56:25,500
like commissioned art or something.

3551
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:26,820
And I had no idea what I was looking at.

3552
02:56:26,820 --> 02:56:28,620
And I was too afraid to look.

3553
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:30,300
Oh, OK, Howard.

3554
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:32,540
There is a nearly two hour Dr.

3555
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:35,300
Wolf epic floating around on YouTube.

3556
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:38,740
What is it? Is it I have to review something?

3557
02:56:38,980 --> 02:56:39,780
I don't know.

3558
02:56:39,780 --> 02:56:41,540
Hold on. I was too afraid to look.

3559
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:42,780
I was on my phone on the web.

3560
02:56:43,140 --> 02:56:46,260
Zero, zero could be the latest Magnum Opus.

3561
02:56:48,060 --> 02:56:49,140
See if I can find it again.

3562
02:56:49,140 --> 02:56:51,340
This is I'm looking at his channel.

3563
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:52,340
He's got a.

3564
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:56,980
All of his latest videos are like two minutes long.

3565
02:56:57,580 --> 02:56:59,460
Are they shorts?

3566
02:56:59,460 --> 02:57:02,020
There's there's some karaoke recommended.

3567
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:03,460
So it could have been old as fuck.

3568
02:57:03,460 --> 02:57:05,740
I don't even know now.

3569
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:07,940
You're taking the wind out of my sails.

3570
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:12,300
But I don't see anything like that in the last several months.

3571
02:57:12,780 --> 02:57:14,060
On his channel.

3572
02:57:14,060 --> 02:57:16,420
What what what could be old?

3573
02:57:16,420 --> 02:57:18,980
That would be that long.

3574
02:57:18,980 --> 02:57:19,940
Can we search?

3575
02:57:19,940 --> 02:57:21,020
I mean, you should have clicked it.

3576
02:57:21,020 --> 02:57:22,220
It's gone. I should have.

3577
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:24,420
Now I'm upset.

3578
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:26,260
There was a fucking.

3579
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:28,780
You know, it's a fucking part of the dimensional merge.

3580
02:57:28,780 --> 02:57:30,900
Whatever it is from an alternate universe.

3581
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:35,820
Was it was it the keepers of Discord full movie?

3582
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:39,620
I don't know. I'll look for it.

3583
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:41,540
If I can find it, I'll link it.

3584
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:44,340
But it was the epilogue part one.

3585
02:57:46,260 --> 02:57:48,420
To this one, there needs to be there needs to be

3586
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:50,660
an option to filter uploads by length.

3587
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:52,340
I think we've reached that point of YouTube

3588
02:57:52,340 --> 02:57:54,540
where that'd be a valuable metric.

3589
02:57:55,460 --> 02:57:56,700
I agree.

3590
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:58,540
I have never seen this before,

3591
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:01,300
but I guess there's a full movie on his channel

3592
02:58:01,300 --> 02:58:02,860
and it's five years old.

3593
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:05,740
And I guess he's been doing this for a while then.

3594
02:58:05,740 --> 02:58:06,940
Never mind.

3595
02:58:06,940 --> 02:58:09,100
I guess it's not news.

3596
02:58:09,140 --> 02:58:12,060
This TF2 analysis red versus blue, the movie.

3597
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:14,260
Oh, that was not a movie.

3598
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:17,060
Of course, Dr. Wolf has been doing this.

3599
02:58:17,060 --> 02:58:18,500
He's been doing this since the.

3600
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:20,900
He's still doing gangbusters with numbers.

3601
02:58:20,900 --> 02:58:26,380
MLP generation five from three months ago, two hundred and fifty two K views.

3602
02:58:27,900 --> 02:58:30,500
The world still. Wow.

3603
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:37,100
So yeah, he just he just uploads like reaction stuff to like a new G5 news.

3604
02:58:37,820 --> 02:58:41,260
And yeah, he's just I guess it just shows that there's there's still interest there,

3605
02:58:41,260 --> 02:58:44,420
which means we do we do an episode on the movie.

3606
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:46,660
We'll get all those sick brownie views.

3607
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:47,860
They're still out there.

3608
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:51,020
I will never get over the fucking the last thing

3609
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:55,460
that the staying power of the TF2 aspect

3610
02:58:55,460 --> 02:58:57,940
of the fucking analysis community.

3611
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:02,100
You know, so I was re I was rewatching Sonichi one or two

3612
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:06,020
and I wish I had I say it, but I wish I had emphasized it more.

3613
02:59:06,020 --> 02:59:12,580
Just how funny it is that Chris was at the panel for the TF2 thing,

3614
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:15,220
which has Phantom Horn in it.

3615
02:59:15,220 --> 02:59:18,660
And then Phantom Horn is also the protagonist of Slime and Punishment,

3616
02:59:18,940 --> 02:59:23,860
which is the canon end of Sonichu now because Sonichu's over.

3617
02:59:23,940 --> 02:59:25,420
But Slime and Punishment's canon.

3618
02:59:25,420 --> 02:59:28,140
So Slime and Punishment is the canon ending.

3619
02:59:28,140 --> 02:59:32,740
I just so what a what a bizarre coincidence, I don't know.

3620
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:37,180
It all, like I said, in the lecture, the threads of fate,

3621
02:59:37,180 --> 02:59:38,540
what a tangled web they weave.

3622
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:41,540
I think the most interesting thing to take away from this is that,

3623
02:59:41,540 --> 02:59:46,060
for some reason, YouTube decided that a X year old video, apparently,

3624
02:59:46,540 --> 02:59:50,380
from a channel I've watched, maybe one video on my entire life

3625
02:59:50,660 --> 02:59:52,860
was somehow relevant to me two days ago.

3626
02:59:53,540 --> 02:59:56,340
I can't believe I mean, you weren't you weren't watching.

3627
02:59:57,100 --> 02:59:58,340
No, of course you weren't.

3628
02:59:58,340 --> 03:00:00,660
You weren't watching Dr. Wolf back in the day.

3629
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:02,060
No.

3630
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:04,500
I had my finger on the pulse of that shit.

3631
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:08,020
I was when when the when the moment with Dr.

3632
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:10,620
Wolf series started, I was like, I got to get it on.

3633
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:13,220
And I did.

3634
03:00:13,220 --> 03:00:14,220
And it worked.

3635
03:00:14,220 --> 03:00:17,580
Well, I guess it shows what you know.

3636
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:19,620
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.

3637
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:21,620
On the ground floor.

3638
03:00:22,260 --> 03:00:24,820
I did the first animation for the moment with Dr.

3639
03:00:24,820 --> 03:00:27,620
Wolf with with voice of reason, right?

3640
03:00:27,620 --> 03:00:30,140
The voice of the thing about that.

3641
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:31,980
What what moment with Dr.

3642
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:33,980
Wolf became is kind of awful.

3643
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:37,380
But like what it started as like that video, I kind of like it

3644
03:00:37,380 --> 03:00:38,940
because it's sort of like self.

3645
03:00:38,940 --> 03:00:42,700
It's sort of like knowingly silly and like funny on purpose.

3646
03:00:42,700 --> 03:00:46,820
It's it's like a it's like written for comedy.

3647
03:00:47,060 --> 03:00:50,140
Yeah, it's like voice of reason, wrote it to be like

3648
03:00:51,020 --> 03:00:55,980
what if therapy, but I'm insane and you're the therapist.

3649
03:00:55,980 --> 03:00:56,900
Yeah, Wolf.

3650
03:00:56,900 --> 03:00:59,220
And Dr. Wolf was like, I am a therapist.

3651
03:00:59,220 --> 03:01:00,780
And then he ran with that.

3652
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:03,620
And it's a perfectly good and and funny

3653
03:01:03,860 --> 03:01:07,260
like idea for like a skit about these characters.

3654
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:10,660
But, you know, then it eventually becomes this accountant

3655
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:13,820
fucking like genuinely like giving life advice to like

3656
03:01:14,260 --> 03:01:15,860
bronies who are like, Doctor,

3657
03:01:15,860 --> 03:01:18,540
I'm afraid of becoming irrelevant as I age.

3658
03:01:18,540 --> 03:01:21,740
And it's like, oh, God, fine.

3659
03:01:24,900 --> 03:01:27,460
Yeah, those are my thoughts on that.

3660
03:01:28,100 --> 03:01:30,260
You got one one.

3661
03:01:30,260 --> 03:01:34,580
I'm sorry, audience, that I dragged out the final voicemail

3662
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:36,180
longer than it needed to be.

3663
03:01:36,180 --> 03:01:38,700
No, there's there's there's there's two more.

3664
03:01:38,700 --> 03:01:40,100
Actually, never mind.

3665
03:01:40,100 --> 03:01:42,340
I take you back. I owe you nothing.

3666
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:44,660
Wait, OK.

3667
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:47,780
This this is the one the one that's uploading now.

3668
03:01:47,780 --> 03:01:49,500
The one that ends in two, six is called.

3669
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:51,140
This is sorry. It's bad.

3670
03:01:51,140 --> 03:01:54,660
OK, here we go. Three, three, two, one, go.

3671
03:01:55,300 --> 03:01:58,060
And then how is your conversation about?

3672
03:01:58,060 --> 03:02:01,140
Isabella Laureata, I think it is.

3673
03:02:01,140 --> 03:02:02,660
Who? How it's pronounced?

3674
03:02:02,660 --> 03:02:04,220
How was your conversation about that earlier?

3675
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:06,700
And what? Yeah, just one thing.

3676
03:02:06,700 --> 03:02:07,980
Chris is going to get upstained.

3677
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:10,300
Ha ha. Why? Thanks.

3678
03:02:10,940 --> 03:02:12,860
Who is Isabella Laureata?

3679
03:02:12,860 --> 03:02:15,260
Is that a G5 pony?

3680
03:02:15,260 --> 03:02:16,420
Oh, oh, wait.

3681
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:19,620
I think that might be the girl who allegedly

3682
03:02:19,740 --> 03:02:23,060
like was was like convincing Chris to do the stuff.

3683
03:02:23,060 --> 03:02:25,940
I think that might be Chris is going to get.

3684
03:02:25,940 --> 03:02:27,900
First of all, it's it's Epstein.

3685
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:31,340
And I don't know, probably not.

3686
03:02:31,340 --> 03:02:34,500
But like, I don't know, whatever. OK.

3687
03:02:34,620 --> 03:02:35,980
OK, the last one is called Help.

3688
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:39,020
I was raised by Brownies. Three, two, one, go.

3689
03:02:39,820 --> 03:02:43,860
I was watching Lyra's song as a little nostalgia trip.

3690
03:02:43,860 --> 03:02:46,220
And like, I realized something.

3691
03:02:46,220 --> 03:02:49,020
I was watching T-Bap when I was like 11.

3692
03:02:49,700 --> 03:02:51,780
Is that horrifying? Is that like horrifying?

3693
03:02:51,780 --> 03:02:54,380
Yes. Like, is it we're going to know

3694
03:02:55,020 --> 03:02:57,260
that someone has grown up with your content?

3695
03:02:57,260 --> 03:02:59,140
Because I think it's horrifying. I'm scared.

3696
03:02:59,140 --> 03:03:00,980
Yeah, me too. I'm terrified. I'm scared.

3697
03:03:00,980 --> 03:03:03,540
I feel like we have a lot of taxi who piece of shit.

3698
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:06,100
I hate you. Yeah, OK.

3699
03:03:06,100 --> 03:03:09,060
Well, yeah, a taxi is pretty sick.

3700
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:12,700
People have been telling me in the in the voicemails to watch

3701
03:03:12,700 --> 03:03:15,420
a taxi for months now, and I just don't want to.

3702
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,420
It just doesn't look interesting.

3703
03:03:17,420 --> 03:03:20,740
It's good. I don't know if it's like be your thing, but it is good.

3704
03:03:21,540 --> 03:03:22,900
It doesn't look like my thing.

3705
03:03:22,900 --> 03:03:24,620
I don't know why people think I like it.

3706
03:03:24,620 --> 03:03:26,420
I definitely didn't pick up any

3707
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:27,740
like this is a Ben St.

3708
03:03:27,740 --> 03:03:30,460
thing vibe from it, but it's just a decent show

3709
03:03:30,580 --> 03:03:33,620
that I haven't finished going to fill in behind, but it's cool. Sure.

3710
03:03:35,860 --> 03:03:38,500
Yeah, it's horrifying.

3711
03:03:38,500 --> 03:03:40,340
I guess it's not that surprising

3712
03:03:40,340 --> 03:03:43,700
that some 11 year old who have been watching it's not pony content,

3713
03:03:43,700 --> 03:03:45,820
but it's still weird.

3714
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:49,660
It is pretty weird because I remember I I've been so what they must be

3715
03:03:49,700 --> 03:03:53,540
like 17 now. Yeah, I don't like that.

3716
03:03:54,100 --> 03:03:56,860
I don't know how young, OK, the youngest one.

3717
03:03:56,860 --> 03:04:00,980
Well, I know one person who is, I mean, there must have been at least

3718
03:04:00,980 --> 03:04:03,980
a few really little kids, one person who watched me

3719
03:04:04,620 --> 03:04:07,780
or I'm now friends with has only just turned 18.

3720
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:12,820
So that's that's that was wacky when I learned how old young they were.

3721
03:04:12,820 --> 03:04:14,820
I was like, what?

3722
03:04:14,820 --> 03:04:17,260
And it was like I was uploading.

3723
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:18,940
I was uploading on YouTube thinking,

3724
03:04:18,940 --> 03:04:21,740
yeah, people are my age, right? Of course.

3725
03:04:21,740 --> 03:04:22,820
People are just my age.

3726
03:04:22,820 --> 03:04:24,860
There are no children here.

3727
03:04:24,860 --> 03:04:26,780
But of course, it's a pony show.

3728
03:04:26,780 --> 03:04:29,220
It's because it's because age sneaks up on you.

3729
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:32,300
Like, because like back when we started using the internet, we were young.

3730
03:04:32,380 --> 03:04:34,860
And so like no one else younger than us could use it.

3731
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:37,420
But that's not the truth. I said the word.

3732
03:04:37,420 --> 03:04:41,260
I said there's so many the fuck words and children were saying.

3733
03:04:43,780 --> 03:04:46,340
Sad. That's pretty funny, though.

3734
03:04:46,620 --> 03:04:49,380
Um, I mean, geez.

3735
03:04:51,140 --> 03:04:54,980
Well, we just we have to go back.

3736
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:57,580
We just have to go back.

3737
03:04:57,580 --> 03:05:02,020
You, a viewer, voicemail, go back to being 11 and I'll go back to being

3738
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:05,420
twenty seven or something.

3739
03:05:05,420 --> 03:05:06,940
And we can try again. All right.

3740
03:05:06,940 --> 03:05:12,580
This this this this run didn't work out so well, but we can try again, I think.

3741
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:15,820
Shit, that's it. That's the last voicemail.

3742
03:05:15,820 --> 03:05:18,580
What a what a note to end on.

3743
03:05:19,580 --> 03:05:20,540
We're all old.

3744
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:24,540
Well, we're terrible role models because we never were trying to be in the first place.

3745
03:05:25,100 --> 03:05:29,660
We let we let Munchie say the N word on on this podcast, even though he was a minor.

3746
03:05:29,660 --> 03:05:34,500
Yeah. And that's so I mean, I mean, it's I mean, it's funny to let

3747
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:37,820
I mean, it's funny to that he said that in that way.

3748
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:39,100
But he's also kind of right.

3749
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:41,820
Like that was a thousand percent, actually.

3750
03:05:41,860 --> 03:05:44,220
Yeah. Oh, well, yeah.

3751
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:47,020
Yeah. Yeah. Lesson learned.

3752
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,700
Lesson zero.

3753
03:05:50,700 --> 03:05:51,660
That's it, everybody.

3754
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:53,620
Thanks for watching.

3755
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:56,220
Is that it? Are we are we at an end?

3756
03:05:56,220 --> 03:05:58,980
I would. Yeah, I'm I'm looking at Dr. Wolff.

3757
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:02,940
Oh, well, that's how you know it's over then.

3758
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:06,300
That's how you know there's no more.

3759
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:12,340
OK, well, God, send a speak of voicemail to speakpipe.com slash

3760
03:06:12,380 --> 03:06:14,620
PZV voicemail. We really want to tell them to do that.

3761
03:06:14,620 --> 03:06:17,100
Should we really continue to incentivize that at the end of every episode?

3762
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:19,780
But not that many. Don't send a lot.

3763
03:06:19,780 --> 03:06:22,340
One voicemail, an episode.

3764
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:24,300
Probably one craft.

3765
03:06:24,300 --> 03:06:29,140
Probably one good voicemail instead of trying to make 10 terrible ones.

3766
03:06:30,780 --> 03:06:33,740
Yeah, absolutely.

3767
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:37,380
Next, the patreon.com slash the procrastinators.

3768
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:38,540
We have.

3769
03:06:38,580 --> 03:06:40,740
Elisar has finished editing.

3770
03:06:41,260 --> 03:06:42,220
You're not going to believe this.

3771
03:06:42,220 --> 03:06:46,740
Three bonus episodes are ready to release.

3772
03:06:46,940 --> 03:06:50,660
We have three of them in the can that will be out soon.

3773
03:06:51,820 --> 03:06:53,500
I know, I can't believe it.

3774
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:56,540
That's so much content for only five dollars.

3775
03:06:56,620 --> 03:06:59,420
Only five dollars in the.

3776
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:01,380
We don't have as much procrastinators.

3777
03:07:01,380 --> 03:07:03,420
No, hardly anything.

3778
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:06,940
And I guess that's it.

3779
03:07:06,980 --> 03:07:10,220
Go watch Shaddox RFCK cartoon.

3780
03:07:12,220 --> 03:07:13,380
Love web.

3781
03:07:13,380 --> 03:07:14,900
Uh, are we done?

3782
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:16,300
Yeah, good.

3783
03:07:16,300 --> 03:07:17,700
OK, bye.

3784
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:19,060
Easy.net.

3785
03:07:19,060 --> 03:07:19,620
Do it.

3786
03:07:19,620 --> 03:07:20,220
Yes.

3787
03:07:20,220 --> 03:07:21,260
Play the Quake.

3788
03:07:21,260 --> 03:07:22,780
I mean, Quake.

3789
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:23,420
Go play Quake.

3790
03:07:23,420 --> 03:07:24,540
Slime.

3791
03:07:24,540 --> 03:07:26,140
Quake. Bye.

3792
03:07:26,140 --> 03:07:27,980
Goodbye.

3793
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:30,540
OK, that was great.

3794
03:07:31,660 --> 03:07:32,740
Great ending.
