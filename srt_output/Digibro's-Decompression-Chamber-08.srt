1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, when we left off on the last decompression chamber, I was, uh,

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:42,000
having this grand realization that I can get so far ahead of myself on work, that now I get to experiment and do other, other fun things, explore other avenues of art.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Um, not so much exploring other talents I might have, but trying to develop new talents that I don't have, such as being able to draw and create music.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And, um, do other stuff like that.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I had forgotten to list on the last part that learning Japanese should be something I do at some point in the near future, you know, with all this extra allotted time.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You hear that loud ass fucking car?

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
See, decompression chambers often record it during the day, unlike most of my stuff.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I always forget that a part of why I don't record during the day is that, um, I live on a fucking major road, so there's constantly loud cars and shit.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So yeah, I was talking about developing all these other talents, and so that's what I've been working on mostly for the last week.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Um, it's really interesting, because it feels like I'm putting a lot more effort into other things, not related to my main content that you guys have been seeing.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And yet it seems impossible to slow down my main content.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Not that I'm trying to or anything, but it's amazing how I can do other things, and the other stuff will just naturally come, you know?

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I mean, there's been a DigiBros video every day, um, there will be all month.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Um, I'll talk more about that in a little bit.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But, like, for up until the previous podcast, it was like this long period where I had at least two videos out every day, you know, like one DigiBros and one normal video.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I thought that maybe that would slow down if I started working on these other projects. It hasn't slowed down at all.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Um, in part because there's just so much stuff that I get attached to, you know?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The WaveMotionCannon podcast finally fucking came out, the first half of it anyways.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know why the second half is not coming out until next year, apparently, or why it takes them so long to edit them, considering he didn't really cut anything.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, um, I have no idea why that is, but it's finally out in some capacity, you know?

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Um, main channel video came out, a bunch of after dark stuff came out, and it's like, it just kind of happens.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Because, I mean, with the vlogs, it could just, you know, sometimes I just turn on a camera and rant for 20 minutes, and that's such a miniscule part of my day to do that.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know, that it's like, oh, a 20 minute video came out, you know, without me even having to think about it, just because it came to mind, you know?

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's other stuff I've just been doing on the side, I can't even really remember what a lot of what I put out this past week was, because I've been so focused on this other stuff.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been practicing drawing, been drawing at least one picture a day for the last few days, just bought a tablet, so an expensive one with a screen on it, so hopefully that'll be cool.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And I learned how to fucking use Fruity Loops, the music production program that Shade uses to produce all his beats, and it's very common, it's used by a lot of people.

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And it's funny, because it has a totally alien interface, so whenever I watched him working on it, I was like, I don't understand any of this, and maybe I never will.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But of course, once I installed it, you know, it took me like five hours, and I learned basically everything, so it wasn't that hard to use.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it's interesting, because I feel like I have a head start in a lot of these categories, because of the fact not only that I analyze them professionally, so I kind of know what is supposed to happen for it to be good,

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
but I also have a lot of history in adjacent things.

31
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know, I may not have been using FL Studio or using any like professional materials, but I have been making beats for like five years now, you know, like mostly acapella or weird shit that I make in Audacity.

32
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And it's kind of interesting how FL Studio, you know, just gives me the tools to do the same shit I've been doing much easier and with better sounds, you know, so it's not hard.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I understand, you know, I may not know music theory, I don't know how to make a chord, for instance, or a chord progression, but there's a lot of stuff I can do with sampling and simple beat making that just comes totally natural to me.

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I just get it, you know, it's not, it's, I keep thinking like, wow, this is easy, but then I think, well, maybe for a lot of people it wouldn't be who don't have any musical experience, it probably would be a lot more difficult to know what sounds right,

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
or, you know, something like that, but for me it feels very natural to make music, so that is really cool, and it's been fun, and I've made a bunch of songs.

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Drawing, on the other hand, does not come naturally at all, but again, I do have some basic understanding. It helps, I took a lot of art classes, you know, I,

37
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:54,000
aside from just basic art in high school, I also took, like, design classes, both for traditional and digital media in college, so, you know, I understand the basics.

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know what I'm doing wrong is what I'm saying, like, you know, I can draw a shitty picture and be like, okay, well, you know, the proportions are off here and here, and I got the, you know, this isn't quite sized right, and I know what's wrong with it,

39
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,000
which is more than I think, it's true for a lot of people who are shitty artists, you know, it's not, I think the most important thing to getting better in any medium is understanding what your faults are,

40
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:33,000
like, that's the easiest way to help you improve is if you know what you've done wrong, and it's amazing how many people don't, how many people try to do something and then they completely don't realize what the problems are, you know,

41
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and that makes it really hard, it's really hard to get better that way, you know, and it's why when people come to me for advice on things like writing, I've always had a really difficult time with it, I'm not good, I mean, I am good at giving advice,

42
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not good at wanting to give advice, because, you know, I'm sure you realize that I have fans constantly asking me like, you know, to check, like, check out their thing, tell them what's wrong with it or something like that,

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and too often, the answer is like, some kind of fundamental misunderstanding, or just needing to change the way you think about your writing, like, there's a lot that you only pick up on with lots of experience and studying how other people write,

44
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
don't just like, listen to other people who write, but study how they write, study like, read your thing and then read their thing and then like, if you don't think yours is as good, figure out why it's not as good,

45
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:46,000
because so many people will send me something and like, what they're expecting to be wrong with it is something simple, but what's actually wrong with it is something fundamental, you know, and that is very difficult to break that news to someone,

46
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:02,000
that's why I don't like giving criticism, because no one realizes how harsh the criticism is going to be, no one realizes like, the depth on which I'm going to have to break down their stuff, where, I mean, for some people it's just not having good ideas,

47
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:18,000
for some people it's like, you know, just fundamentally not understanding how to be interesting, for some people it's not understanding just how to grammar or syntax well, or to sentence a structure in an interesting way, or to be thought provoking,

48
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:40,000
or to like, structural problems are everywhere, I mean, the biggest thing is just simplifying all the bullshit out, newbie writers put so much stuff that's completely unnecessary into their scripts, and I've talked about that in the Tips to Write Gooder video, that just like, the biggest things that bother me are erroneous details that are completely unnecessary,

49
00:08:41,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but nonetheless, I think I am pretty good at recognizing my own problems, and I'll tell you about this incredibly sad story that me and Ben Saint encountered recently, and I don't want to like, slag on this person, but I just think it's a really fascinating example of what I'm talking about,

50
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:21,000
we were on Topastic, which is this comics uploading website, it's like a place for webcomics to find an audience essentially, and Ben has his comics on there, he doesn't take it very seriously because it really hasn't helped his like, a Patreon growth that much to have his stuff up there,

51
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but one of his comics recently became like, on the hot page kind of thing of Topastic, his comic The Champion, and we were looking at other stuff on the website, and just kind of like, you know, trolling through and looking at what's what, and we stumble upon this webcomic called like, diaries of an Aspie girl or something like that,

52
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and it's a fairly long running comic with just absolutely abysmal artwork, like the worst possible artwork that it could possibly have, it looked garish, and I mean the writing is not spectacular, it's just kind of a self, an autobiographical except not,

53
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:23,000
like you know, it's like a story about a character who was obviously the writer, like based around the writer and how she perceives herself, but we were looking at the forums, we came upon it, I don't remember if we came upon it from the comic itself or from the forums,

54
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but she had a forum post that was like, why is my comic not more popular, and she writes like a few paragraphs about it, and her idea of why the comic's not popular is because she's not marketing it well, she was like, I know marketing's important, but you know, it seems to me like there's people who put a lot,

55
00:10:43,000 --> 00:11:07,000
like you know, I'm putting so much effort into this, why is nobody reading it, it seems like there's people who are putting so much effort into, or so much less effort into their work, who are just getting really big, really fast, and then we looked through the responses, and it took a long time before we got to someone who had the balls to just say the artwork is not very good, no one was saying it,

56
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:32,000
all of them were hitting it with shallow platitudes about how like, oh well, you know, if you try to, you know, maybe strategize, people tend to like stuff that fits into what they already kind of like, you know, so maybe you have to chase what people are really, no, the artwork is unbelievably bad, that's the problem, you know, and it took a long time before somebody even suggested that,

57
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and that's the most harmful thing that could happen to an artist is both not understanding what their problem is, and then also no one being willing to tell them what their problem is, you know, but it's rough, because I bet that she'd be resistant to it, you know, most of the time when people come to me looking for advice and I give them advice,

58
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:19,000
a lot of them are resistant, or a lot of them just kind of give up, you know, once they realize, like, that the issue is they haven't been writing for long enough, then it's like, oh well, I can't change that, you know, I can't just edit that in my script immediately, it's like, your problem is that you're young and you just started, and therefore everything you write is going to be terrible for the next five years, you know, like, that's the real issue here,

59
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:40,000
revisit this idea further down the road when you've matured as a writer, like, not easy advice to give anybody, but pretty much exactly the case, nobody's that great when they first start, and if they are, they can probably recognize their own problems and improve them more quickly, you know, or they just need one or two little hints, and then they'll be on their way, you know,

60
00:12:41,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Now, my problem as an artist is that I've been doing it for five days, I'm, you know, only using other people's art as base for mine, like, I'm just copying, you know, poses and stuff, and it's going to take a long time before I'm good enough for my work to be presentable,

61
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You'll notice that I haven't been posting any of these artworks anywhere, because they're not good, they're not presentable, they are at best charming, you know, like, and I'm drawing this character, who's part of a story that I'm working on, this fiction story, I kind of hinted that I was going to go down that road in the last podcast, and I've been trying to like nail down what this character looks like and feels like, so I've just been drawing,

62
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the character over and over again, and will continue to do so, probably for months, you know, I will probably draw this character at least once a day, hopefully more than once a day, for like three or four months before, you know, the artwork will be of a quality that is even presentable, you know, and when this thing comes out,

63
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:07,000
because art will be important to it, I need to be able to draw for this piece of work, even when it comes out the artwork is not going to be great, the artwork is going to be mediocre, you know, it is going to be a project released with mediocre artwork of a newbie artist,

64
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and if I continue drawing, then eventually I might release something with good artwork, but this will not be that, I understand all that, I'm not out to make something good here, you know, like conventionally, I'm not out to make something that's perfect, especially not in terms of the art, the art will probably be the least important aspect of it, or at least the least quality aspect of it, you know, it's going to have music that's okay, it's going to have music that uses all the experience I've built up as a musician,

65
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but that's not a lot, you know, you're not going to hear super memorable chords and melodies that I invented by myself, that won't be a thing in it,

66
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:14,000
so yeah, it's not, it's not going to be amazing, and I understand that, and I wish more people had that level of self criticism to, you know, instead of asking me what's wrong with their work, just accept that they're not going to make anything good for a while, and they should not even, don't even bother asking me, you know, come to me when you've been working for five years,

67
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and you feel like you're about to have a breakthrough, or you're on the cusp of a breakthrough, but there's just one or two things you think you need to tweak, you know, and maybe that's the kind of thing I could help a lot more with,

68
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you know, fellow PCP member Tommy Oliver is writing a book right now, you know, he sent me a chapter of it, he's someone I could work with, because he's already got a basis of like he's pretty good, you know, he's a pretty good writer, fiction writer,

69
00:15:42,000 --> 00:16:01,000
more so than being good at writing fiction, I'm much better at editing it, I'm much better at like helping people revise something that's already there, because, again, I analyze this stuff for a living, you know, like, I am good at that aspect, I could totally edit your novel, it just has to be on a certain level of like,

70
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:21,000
like, it has to be something that is basically good, it just needs to be fixed in some ways, you know, someone like Tom, I could tell him like, hey, maybe think about changing the word choice in this sentence, it actually is like that, you know, which is what I think people imagine it's going to be when they show me stuff, and it's usually not like that,

71
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you know, really, you should be sending stuff that, well, I mean, don't send me anything, because I'm not going to look at it, but, so yeah, forget that whole line of thought, because like, this is stuff, when people ask me to look at stuff,

72
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:00,000
um, what they don't seem to understand is that editors, that's a job, that's a job that people get paid to do, that's a skill set, you know, being able to edit someone's work and look at it and understand what's wrong with it and help them to fix it, is something that most people would pay for, you know, if you're working professionally,

73
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and aside from the fact that I'm not a professional editor and I don't have time, if I was, I would expect to get paid, you know, because I do think I could do that, I think I could be an editor, it's a career choice I've considered, if whatever I'm doing doesn't work out, the biggest problem with being an editor is that the writers hate you,

74
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you know, like, unless they're someone who really prizes the idea of an editor, they're going to hate you, and also, I always want everything to be to my taste, you know, I'm not good at editing for what I think the audience will want most, I mean, I guess I could, I could probably do that, but like, I really like to push my own agenda when it comes to seeing other people's work, you know, that's why I don't do it that much, even for my friends.

75
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But um, God, I don't know how I got into that tangent about editing.

76
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Right, I was talking about this art and music I've been making, really surreal experience though, making things that nobody gets to see again, like, this is something I've, you know, I've experienced that in the past back when I wanted to be a fiction writer, I have all these stories that have never seen the light of day,

77
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,240
that you know I mean that fucking novel I wrote back in 2010 nobody had ever read

78
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,040
it until you know now now that people are listening to it and offering comments

79
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,760
on the subreddit which has been great it's been really fulfilling to finally

80
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,840
get people talking about that story and I might talk about a couple more

81
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,200
eventually though none of them are nearly as written as that one was God I've

82
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,200
considered even doing an audio version of Cyrano and purple Steve which is

83
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,480
highly incomplete but I really like what there is of it if you don't know what

84
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:58,520
that is you'll maybe learn eventually but yeah yeah what the fuck am I talking

85
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,000
about holy shit I've completely lost track of where I was going with that oh

86
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,760
yeah yeah yeah yeah making stuff that nobody gets to see I'm sure most people

87
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,000
experience this all the time like if you work on bigger projects or something

88
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,880
or if you're someone who you know gets an idea in your head and it doesn't get

89
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,400
fully realized until later then like I guess it's pretty common to to have these

90
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
things that they don't get to see be seen by anybody but I've gotten used to

91
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,960
this fast-paced I make something immediately release it to my audience

92
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,920
immediately get feedback and it's done and now I'm like I've made a bunch of

93
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,520
songs that are on the internet I've posted them on the internet they're

94
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:46,440
online they're just not under my name and there's a good reason for it because

95
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,840
they're all tied into this story I'm working on and I don't want to release

96
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,280
them publicly until there's more context for why they're there because if you were

97
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,040
to just go and listen to these right now you'd be like why you know why why this

98
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,520
song but if you understand the context of the story and how they're going to be

99
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:16,320
used in the story then it'll make a lot more sense so yeah those won't come out

100
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,840
to later but they're they're decent they're decent little songs I've

101
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,840
listened to them you know a number of times not just because I made them but

102
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:29,000
I think they're they're kind of neat very simple but um yeah like it's

103
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,800
interesting to have released content online that nobody's looking at and I

104
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,200
kind of would love for those songs and the account they're associated with to

105
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,040
like gain some some fandom by themselves without me even doing anything

106
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,200
it's impossible though but there's no way to grow a channel without any word of

107
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,800
mouth without showing it to anybody you know so yeah I have no idea if that'll

108
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,240
even be possible most likely nobody's gonna see these songs until the work is

109
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,080
complete along with anything else I do for it until then or these drawings or

110
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,080
anything else I'm doing so yeah it's a weird experience and and it doesn't

111
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,760
really show because again it hasn't taken away from anything like main

112
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,840
channel videos aside you know I used to be worried that like vlogs were gonna

113
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,320
take away from the main channel and that didn't I mean I guess that happened a

114
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,560
little bit back in like August when I barely made any videos just because I

115
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,120
wasn't up for it I was like way more into the idea of vlogging I was getting

116
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,160
ready for rad con I was excited about people moving in and then like that what

117
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,400
I what I was gonna do with vlogging I kind of lost interest in once everything

118
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,200
had kind of transpired but the the vlogs did not interrupt the main videos

119
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,440
once I got back to work on them you know they they've been coming out

120
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,360
consistently and then I was worried that the the art and the other stuff would

121
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,520
get in the way of the vlogs but that also hasn't happened because it turns

122
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,120
out that vlogging and getting out podcasts is something that I do so second

123
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,520
nature like it doesn't even occur to me that I'm doing it there's no like

124
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,560
preparation for any of the videos I do like I feel like other people have to

125
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,200
psych themselves up and get ready you know they have to like think about what

126
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,960
it's gonna be and prepare I barely do that like when it comes to a vlog I get

127
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,440
an idea I turn on a camera I rant there's there's very little like like

128
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,720
fully thinking out the point sometimes that could be to the detriment of the

129
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,560
video some of my vlogs are a little too rambly they kind of don't really make

130
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,000
the point as solidly as I would like but I've gotten better and better at it and

131
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
even stuff like the edited ones like the mindless self-indulgence one like you

132
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,840
know I I knew I knew all that stuff so I could go through it but I did not like

133
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,680
pre-plan everything I was gonna say I just kind of sat down turn the camera

134
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,120
and went and it came out really great and something like handfuls of Zen has

135
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,920
like some notes taken and I had to play through the whole game but aside from

136
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,320
that you know didn't take that much thought because I'm I'm already again

137
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,920
it's like automatic so these things just come out as they are and they have

138
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,280
they're not affected by this other artwork I'm doing which is really good

139
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,320
that's exactly what I wanted and it's been great I don't know exactly what I'm

140
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,320
doing for the next week DeVue just I guess I got it guess it's already been

141
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,600
two days DeVue went home to to see his parents for the holidays he's not gonna

142
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,360
be gone that long though he he like talked them out of making him stay too

143
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,320
long but I gotta have another video written for him probably by the time

144
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,160
he gets back and then start working on possibly building another backlog like I

145
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,760
did with November and just giving myself the agency to do all this stuff

146
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,280
because the the the story that I'm working on that I'm doing all these

147
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:09,120
drawings and music for is the story itself is very small but the project is

148
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,320
big if that makes sense like you know one of the fascinating things about art

149
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,480
is that the sort of sort of the quality of it or the like the amount of it is

150
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,480
not really proportional to how much effort it takes like you can make an

151
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,440
analysis video that's like the coolest video that you'll see all year and that

152
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,720
analysis video might only take like two days to make whereas a chapter of a

153
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,720
comic that's like the coolest chapter of a comic you saw all year probably took

154
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,240
at minimum a month you know probably more than a month but at minimum a month

155
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,120
to make so it's interesting that like the audience reaction to each of those

156
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,640
could be about the same takes about 15 minutes to watch the video takes about

157
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,800
15 minutes to read the comic chapter you know both of them have a certain level

158
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,760
of impact but one just by necessity of what it is took way more effort and

159
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,520
time and I think that's one of the most difficult things for a lot of artists

160
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,560
to reconcile with it it causes a lot of elitism because you know in the minds of

161
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,680
a lot of artists they're like I worked so much harder I deserve you know more

162
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,200
reward but really the quality of the final product is not all that affected

163
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,480
by how much work went into it you know I mean it can be sometimes what makes it

164
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,160
great is how much work went into it but it's not the only way to make something

165
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,600
good you can make something good in a million different ways you can make

166
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
something great that's spontaneous you know a lot of great music is all about

167
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,760
improvisation and just having a general understanding of how to perform and you

168
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,080
know spontaneity can be amazing for art but some of it has to take a long time

169
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,000
and it really just comes down to what you like doing do you like making short

170
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
form art or long form art if you like making long form art I'm sorry you know

171
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm sorry for you you've trapped yourself in a hell but you know I mostly make

172
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,840
short form art but this one that I'm working on the nature of the project

173
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,640
will make it a much larger project than normal you know longer it'll take

174
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,640
longer to make than it would take me to make any analysis video because of the

175
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,800
nature of the project even though the story itself will be this really small

176
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,920
self-contained story that will probably be consumed consumable in like two to

177
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:43,400
four hours it will not be long but like just the number of skills that I have

178
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:51,200
to develop to even make it possible is a huge element of it so yeah

179
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,760
that's a fun fun paradigm to explore and it's not something I would have been

180
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:05,480
willing to do for any of the last three years you know or more because I would

181
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,040
have been scared that it would get in the way but now that it doesn't look like

182
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,320
it will I can just take my time with it I'm not I'm not in a huge rush to

183
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,840
develop these skills but I'd like this project to be done within the next like

184
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,120
six months so I'm gonna at least try to work fast and hard enough to get it done

185
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:30,840
within six months but besides that um yeah it can take its time and feels good

186
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,320
man alright I'm kind of just repeating what I said on the last podcast at this

187
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,520
point but we'll I'll cut the clip here and I'll only record if I find something

188
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,040
totally new and interesting to talk about between now and whenever this comes

189
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:51,040
out probably late I apologize if this podcast can get a bit repetitive at times

190
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,120
I mean when it's just me talking about my life and my life is kind of the same

191
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,920
weekend and week out a lot of the information is gonna be kind of

192
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,760
repetitive but I mean in a way what is storytelling if not just you know

193
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,440
constantly recontextualizing the same sort of basic human ideas in different

194
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,640
ways to unpack different nuances from them you know it's hardly surprising

195
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,880
that one storyteller will have a lot of commonality among their stories

196
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,000
especially if they put one out every fucking week it's funny because in some

197
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,680
ways this is my favorite show to do because it's the closest to just what's

198
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:37,440
on my mind at any given time this podcast is just like just raw digi bro

199
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,160
Ben said recently I came I don't remember if I told the story on here I

200
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,080
came downstairs and said like it was telling Ben something and then I was

201
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,800
like yeah I just explained it on the decompression chamber and he was like you

202
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,680
know listening to the decompression chamber and talking to you in person

203
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,040
it's like it's essentially the same experience you get a lot of like repeated

204
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,240
information between the two and I'm like yeah it's basically exactly the

205
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,680
stuff I talked to my friends about and the stuff I talk about in general which

206
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,400
in some ways is a sign that the decompression chamber is kind of waning

207
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,400
in its importance when I first started it it was around the time that Ben and

208
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,080
DeVue had been here for like a month because I think no I started this in late

209
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,240
October so around two months but I still wasn't quite I don't know I wasn't

210
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,400
completely you know comfortable talking to them about everything at that point

211
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,200
yet I wasn't like constantly sharing what was going on with me and stuff like

212
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,000
that Victor wasn't around for a while so you know he's the one I'd usually talk

213
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,720
to a lot of talk to about a lot of this stuff and what's great about the

214
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,840
decompression chamber is that as I explained in a previous episode it

215
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,680
really gives me the chance to be like unfiltered and talk in a way that is not

216
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,880
the same as how I talk to other people necessarily I mean there's a lot of

217
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,440
overlap like I just said Ben has you know said that talking to me is practically

218
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,440
the same thing but it's it's not me trying to put on a show and like be about

219
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,440
a topic that the other person can relate to let's put it that way like when we do

220
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:20,120
Digi Bros I usually try to involve Victor on some level but on this podcast it's

221
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,440
just me talking about my life so this is by far the closest you're getting to

222
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,480
what it's like the exact experience of talking to me in person especially the

223
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,520
lack of response from the other side need the one-sided nature of the

224
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:48,120
conversation is also is also true to life but nonetheless it is fun to do and

225
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,840
then that's kind of what what's keeping it going like I don't know that it's a

226
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,200
great show or that it has a lot of unique ideas it's just kind of fun to do

227
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,000
but I can't see it living too long I don't think this show is gonna be around

228
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,640
well into 2017 or anything I also think that probably Digi Bros is just gonna

229
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,320
get shut down I mean it's it seemed it seemed like an inevitability at one point

230
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,640
when we thought Victor was gonna move away and and like we were saying you

231
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,560
know Digi Bros is gonna end cuz he's gonna leave to go to college or to go

232
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,440
to grad school rather and that didn't end up happening so Digi Bros got to live

233
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,920
a little longer but then we ended up putting it on hold for like two months

234
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,240
because we were just busy and then we finally got back to it it doesn't really

235
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
seem like anybody cares anymore like this bomber man let's play we've been

236
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,040
doing the view counts are at like an all-time low comments are at an all-time

237
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,920
low we barely get any comments and I mean reading comments I'm sure I've said

238
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,360
this about all the work I do but like comments are really what let me know

239
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,800
that people are engaging with it you know if I don't get any comments I don't

240
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,480
feel like anybody really cares that much like people are just kind of throwing it

241
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,240
on and you know passively listening to it because it just means we weren't

242
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,320
necessarily engaging enough to like provoke a discussion I don't know maybe

243
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
that's just not the way people you know interact with Digi Bros but we used to

244
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,760
get more comments than we get now and you know I'm not watching them back I

245
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,400
don't think Victor's watching them either it used to be that we we both

246
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,480
watch a lot of them or our friends would watch them nobody I know is watching

247
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,040
them you know I think hippo might be but even he he's been saying that he has to

248
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,680
cut back on his Digi Bro content because they're so fucking much of it so yeah I

249
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,600
don't see Digi Bros surviving because there's not much incentive to do it and

250
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,480
most of the stuff like I don't I don't think our discussions have been that

251
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,880
great in the VAR man playthrough because at this point I run so many shows where

252
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,040
I get out like all the really salient things I want to talk about like when

253
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,400
when Digi Bros started I didn't have vlogs coming out all the time I didn't

254
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,360
have you know three fucking podcasts that I that I'm on and so it made sense

255
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,000
like I had all these backed up topics that I just bust out on the show and

256
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,200
now most of those are things I would make vlogs about because I do want those

257
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,520
those things to be out there and a vlog is just gonna perform way better like you

258
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,960
know on some level it's like I feel bad like you know Victor said the reason you

259
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
know the reason we have nothing to talk about is because you constantly make

260
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,840
podcasts and vlogs and I'm like yeah those podcast and vlogs get the way the

261
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,520
fuck more views you know so it's like the stuff was kind of just just exit

262
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,520
like we were doing what for my money is one of the best let's play shows on

263
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,440
YouTube like I really think Digi Bros was one of the strongest let's play

264
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,080
shows that's ever been it was basically just a podcast but a really fun podcast

265
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,240
with two brothers who you know had tons of running gags and fun things to talk

266
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,840
about and but it never got any attention it never grew it stayed at like this

267
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,640
really steady viewer base the whole way through never grew any bigger you know

268
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,480
when it goes away people people aren't that excited when it comes back you know

269
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,920
when it was gone people kept asking me about if it was gonna come back but then

270
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,400
it came back and no one was like oh Digi Bros finally you know it was just kind

271
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,040
of like oh yeah you guys are playing Bomberman that's cool you know and I'm

272
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,480
sure if we'd come back with like the Dark Souls 3 DLC people will be more

273
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,840
excited and I keep getting asked like why don't you guys why don't you guys do

274
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,320
in the Dark Souls 3 DLC we didn't want to do it like Victor thought it was too

275
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,760
hard and it's only one level and he was like let's just wait for all three of

276
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,920
them to come out and then we could do all three because they're gonna make three

277
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,240
DLCs for the game but it's like if you guys are if people only care about the

278
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,920
game and not actually about the show because the game is fucking completely

279
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,680
inconsequential on Digi Bros it's just a podcast show you know and it used to

280
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,880
have all these really interesting topics that to me were like these should be on

281
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,800
a bigger stage like this is such a good podcast show and that's why we did like

282
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,440
the Digi Bros Discuss Berserk video which got huge the video really took off

283
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,600
and that was a discussion that would have happened on Digi Bros like we were

284
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,040
going to talk about that and then I said why don't we just make this its own

285
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,000
video and people probably love it and they did you know we did the same thing

286
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,200
with the Ghostbusters podcast which you know was somewhat successful it was not

287
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,160
that great because I was a total asshole and played devil's advocate the whole

288
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:38,440
time but you know those are shows that I knew had potential to to be to to gain

289
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,040
some kind of you know attraction where Digi Bros was not gaining any and at

290
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,920
this point it's like now that I'm taking all the best stuff that like the

291
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,880
stuff that made Digi Bro great now that I'm taking those discussions out of

292
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Digi Bros and putting them in other places you know Digi Bros itself is not

293
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,280
only worse but even less popular so there's doesn't seem like there's much

294
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,680
reason to keep it going I mean me and Victor the story is always the same when

295
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,600
it comes to just our personal lives you know I'm always making videos and he's

296
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,280
always struggling to find work it's always what it's going to be so at this

297
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,840
point it seems like there's no real reason to keep it running and there is

298
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,680
the Digi Bro and others show with DeVoo which DeVoo is way into the idea of

299
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,920
doing more Let's Plays and I think we might continue doing it if he's willing

300
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,160
to like edit them and stuff because for me it's just a matter of like you know

301
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,000
we're gonna sit down and play a game and talk for three hours and that's already

302
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,200
in itself like a huge time investment of time that I could be spending working

303
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,160
on other videos that will be relevant that will get attention that will explore

304
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,960
the ideas I want to explore you know and then after those three hours I have to

305
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,560
edit all that and break it up into chunks and post it online you know and

306
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,160
part of the appeal of Digi Bros was just that it was a way for me and Victor to

307
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,120
hang out me and DeVoo can hang out anytime we can have these discussions

308
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,560
anytime we want you know with him it's just a show we're doing so there's

309
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,240
there's even less incentive for me to keep it going but if DeVoo wants to

310
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,960
keep doing it I mean I can show up and play a game and talk you know that's a

311
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,560
huge part of why I still do the pub crawl is because I don't have to do

312
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,240
anything all I have to do is show up and drink and talk to my friend you know

313
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,800
and it's the way I keep up with Cider I don't really talk to him outside the

314
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,160
pub crawl except for like a few lines here and there you know each week because

315
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,880
I know that we'll catch up on the pub crawl and we'll have all the stuff to say

316
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,280
there so so like with DeVoo it's like I hang out with them every day there's not

317
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,480
a huge incentive for us to do a show together so yeah that's why those shows

318
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,800
may or may not continue and this one like a lot of what I expressed on this

319
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,280
show is is gonna get repetitive it's gonna end up being a lot of the same

320
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,440
stories it's gonna be the same thoughts about life and I could I'm not

321
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,600
dissatisfied with this shows view count at all I like both the nature of the

322
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:14,200
show and the the view count on it but I would you know if if if I get into other

323
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,520
stuff and this podcast is in the way or if this podcast waned a little bit and

324
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,720
viewer retention I'd just cancel it you know there's not a huge need for this

325
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:30,040
show to run forever because it will eventually wear out its welcome but

326
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,720
we'll see how long that takes I'm thinking maybe it'll just be a one

327
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,920
season thing like a 12 episode like a you know like a proper show maybe a

328
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,000
season that could be renewed in the future if I feel the need for it again

329
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,600
I mean when I started this thing it was because I really felt I needed to relax

330
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,560
and decompress and the best way I could think to do that with the was with the

331
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,160
podcast now I don't really feel I need it anymore now I'm just kind of doing it

332
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,120
for kicks you know and occasionally when I have a thought that I go oh that

333
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,760
thought would make a decent podcast let's talk about that so I had a thought

334
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,720
in the car on the way home from getting some pizza just now about happiness and

335
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,120
the nature of it and and and how it's perceived because I really think that

336
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:23,160
from an outside perspective my life must either look idyllic or crazy it's

337
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,680
gotta be like one of those right either you're thinking well he's living his

338
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,560
dreams he's making you know a good income he's doing exactly what he wants to do

339
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,440
what more could you want or you think that's no way to live you know being in

340
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,000
your room all day not talking to anyone a slave to your work you know it can look

341
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,040
one way or the other and it's funny because I think that for every

342
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,880
individual I think there's two different ways that we kind of interpret how

343
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,480
happy are we there's there's comparing to your own life and then comparing to the

344
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,560
social construct or like what you're what you think happiness is supposed to

345
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,560
look like so for a lot of people they have a time in their life when they were

346
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,640
more happy than they currently are and that kind of becomes their their

347
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,440
benchmark that becomes their baseline Ben Saint was just talking about this on

348
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,700
the latest procrastinators podcast when he the graduation one where he was

349
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,840
saying that his senior year of college was kind of the good old days because

350
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,640
that was when he was the most socially active you know was getting late all the

351
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,840
time was having a good time and he was like you know when I compare current

352
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,320
like my current self to then like there's clearly something missing in

353
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,680
comparison so I must not be as happy as I was then for me I've never had a time

354
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,080
in my life where I was happier than I am now there's nothing I there I have no

355
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,240
grounds for comparison that's why I always tell people that I'm happy you

356
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,720
know and when people ask I'm like yeah things are going great because I can't

357
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,520
even remember things being better than this but on the social construct level

358
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,520
on the what my vision is of what like my life is supposed to be I'm not there yet

359
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,720
because in my vision of what my life is supposed to be you know I I have I have

360
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,640
a girlfriend or a wife or maybe even kids you know I want to have those things

361
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:24,280
in the future I want to have a family and my own place you know a self-sustained

362
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,720
living which I could afford right now but to me it's like that comes later you

363
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,400
know like I don't think it's important for me to be self-sustained right now

364
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,360
but it is an eventuality I want I want to be living in a house with my wife and

365
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,360
kid not with a bunch of roommates you know who I work with I want them to be

366
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,280
able to afford their own places I want all of us to be able to afford our own

367
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,360
place and be stable living you know in it in a neighborhood together kind of

368
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,240
thing that's my vision of what it would mean to really be happy not to say that

369
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,640
I'm not happy now but just that like that's the thing I'm that I feel like

370
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,400
I'm working towards and that until I have it I will never be convinced that this

371
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,000
is the right way to live you know even though for all intents and purposes like

372
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I'm doing what I want to do you know there's there's nothing there's something

373
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,300
bad happening to me right now there's nothing I'm like struggling with but

374
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,240
there's there's something I want you know and I can't feel satisfied not

375
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,880
having it and the the the weirdest thing about it is that the thing I don't

376
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,040
have is something I have no idea how to get like I think when it came to this

377
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,080
whole creative career for a long time I didn't know how to get it for a long time

378
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,200
I was just sitting around on my ass like trying to figure something out for all

379
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,840
those years I spent as a neat you know or in high school or college wishing I

380
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,920
could be the whole time I was in high school I wanted to drop out the whole

381
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,920
time I was in college I wanted to drop out eventually I did the whole time for a

382
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,120
whole year and a half after that I spent going well you dropped out you're free

383
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,840
you've got all the time in the world what are you doing you know where are you

384
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,400
where is this going man where you going with this is this gonna happen are you

385
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,600
gonna do whatever the thing is and then eventually I figured it out I found the

386
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,720
solution and then I just worked at it constantly until it until I was there and

387
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,440
now I'm there and I'm going okay well I see the next peak you know I see the

388
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,640
next thing I want and I do it's not that I don't want more success I do and I

389
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,120
especially want it for my friends like for DeVu DeVu needs more money if you

390
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,480
want to donate to my patreon and DeVu's pointed this out in the comments on these

391
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,560
before he said don't let Digi's complacency over money stop you from

392
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,400
donating because I still need money you know like DeVu makes 40% of whatever I

393
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,960
make on patreon so you know if you give me more money you're also paying him and

394
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,880
because I a you know make a little bit more and b I spend less than he does on

395
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,240
food oddly enough well okay not overall I spend way more on like groceries and

396
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,720
shit I mean on going out he spends more on groceries okay never mind I spend way

397
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,080
more money than he does but I make a little bit more than him on patreon and

398
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,680
I make ad revenue and I you know make crunchy roll stuff and I also like just

399
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,920
have a big savings because I I save up lots of money DeVu needs money so you

400
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,640
know by all means continue contributing for his sake and I can also pay more

401
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,160
people if I have more money but for me personally in like terms of what I want

402
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,600
out of my life I'm not like hugely trying to get to the next money peak if I

403
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,560
was you'd know because my main channel would be bursting at the seams with

404
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,240
content about current anime the way that it was early this year you know early

405
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,240
this year when I was making videos about erased and cabineri and all that shit

406
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,680
like and in myriad colors phantom world that was all to grow the channel you know

407
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,040
that was all I need more money than I have right now and then I made that much

408
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,820
money and I went all right let's do whatever the fuck we want now shinbo in

409
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:26,200
the 90s no one watches it don't care it's happening you know let's make it

410
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:32,040
16 videos that no one's gonna watch I don't fucking care you know it's for me

411
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:38,320
but if I wanted if I if I did want my channel to grow I know how to do that

412
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,800
it's easy you just talk about relevant shit you know you just make videos at a

413
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,360
quick rate about relevant subject matter you're done that's it you know had I

414
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,960
covered re-zero properly instead of as a plebe and weeb video would probably have

415
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,440
five times the views it has you know but I didn't want to do that I wanted to

416
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,720
plebe and weeb I like I wanted that show to exist it does it's funded for a

417
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:10,280
second season rad cons coming in January huge deal you know so that's not

418
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,400
what I'm looking for out of life right now what I want is the other things the

419
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:23,960
relationship the the the the feeling of of being on my own to some extent of

420
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:30,120
like being my own man kind of thing which I mean I basically am but I don't

421
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:36,000
want to get out there you know a little bit more and that's the that's the only

422
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,480
part that that like when if you ask me are you happy I'm gonna go yeah I'm

423
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,760
happy but I'm not satisfied you know and I don't think I ever will be I don't

424
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,080
think anyone ever is you get to that next peak and you're just gonna find

425
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,240
something else you know there's got to be something else you want but um so so

426
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,480
maybe I'm as happy as I ever will be and that's really the debate that I

427
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,520
constantly have with myself it's like I tell myself I want these other things

428
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,120
but I'm so convinced that once I get them it's just gonna be about chasing the

429
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,360
next high you know it's never going to be oh I did it I got it all now it's all

430
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,200
cool you know that day is never coming it's never coming for anybody so it's

431
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,280
just a fantasy but I have to you know clinging to that's what keeps you what

432
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,960
keeps you going because if I just decided well this is as happy as I'll ever be

433
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,360
then it's like what new things can I ever expect to be on the horizon you know

434
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,040
and I realize these are all kind of cliched sentiments that you've probably

435
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,760
heard before but but it's it's true you know and like I said a story is nothing

436
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,360
but sort of a re-encapsulation of the same ideas and a lot of this is what

437
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,920
that story that I'm working on that I talked about in the earlier part of

438
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:58,440
this podcast is dedicated to exploring not in as direct terms as I've painted it

439
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,840
but this I honestly think that this story I'm working on is kind of a

440
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:10,320
fictionalization of the decompression chamber it's it's it's a similar style

441
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,680
of presentation well not of presentation but of ideas like the

442
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,800
kinds of things that the story will be exploring are the same kinds of things

443
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,200
that I talk about on this podcast it's really going to be dedicated to how this

444
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,160
character the main character of the story like thinks about their life and how

445
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,960
exploring what is going on in their life and what that ultimately means to them

446
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:44,000
emotionally and so not like most of what happens in this story is not

447
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,080
particularly noteworthy it's not so much about what happens as what of what

448
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,400
that thing happening signifies about this person's personality you know it's

449
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,600
not necessarily exciting for me to say like I did this thing but when you think

450
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,560
of it in the greater context of like how I think about that thing I did that's

451
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,400
where it becomes interesting if you catch my drift how about I put it this way

452
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:16,080
if I say I watched Kill La Kill and I liked it not a very interesting sentiment

453
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,720
but if I say I watched Kill La Kill and I liked it because of you know how it made

454
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,800
me think about something else then that can be interesting that's sort of vague

455
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,640
but that's what the story is kind of like I don't want to give too much away

456
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,200
about it but I think that the audience who will be most primed to understand

457
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,960
this game and where it's coming from did I say game this thing and where it's

458
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,000
coming from they will be the people who listen to this show the people who

459
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,800
listen to decompression chamber will probably most readily get exactly what

460
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,680
this game yeah why do I keep saying game they will get exactly what this thing

461
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:06,920
is ignore the fact that I said game because that maybe a mischaracterization

462
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,960
um nonetheless you guys will get it I'm repeating myself I should be probably

463
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,400
doing something right now it's very humid in my room I feel like shit physically

464
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,560
by the way I'm just gonna talk about that a little bit that for the past week I

465
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,160
felt like garbage I've been smoking too much I need to stop again because when

466
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,400
when that whole thing happened with the vape where I broke the vape and then I

467
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,840
immediately like something clicked in my brain when I broke that vape which it's

468
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,440
been fixed now for a while but when I broke it something snapped and the part

469
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,960
of me that was like I'm vaping to quit smoking just stopped caring like that

470
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:56,120
that the whole all these years like five years of resistance to smoking full

471
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,600
time five years of smoking like once a day maybe twice and then quitting if I

472
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,600
even get close to three times that part of my brain just died when that vape

473
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:13,440
broke and I started smoking way more and even after the vape was fixed I have

474
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,320
continued smoking and now I like I'm smoking more than I'm vaping and it's

475
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,960
like it's kind of the point where now it's starting to affect the way my

476
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,240
brain feels and I'm like okay hold on that's that that little that little

477
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,800
worry guy is reforming the guy who I killed when the break the vape broke he

478
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,440
starting to come back to life and realize that this is a problem I should

479
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,440
not be smoking this much so I'm gonna quit that again that's gonna be rough

480
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,720
but you know especially cuz it's gonna be rougher than ever before because if

481
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,560
it's smoking more than ever before but it needs to stop after I finish this pack

482
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:54,440
I'm gonna go to just straight vaping and and just yeah quit smoking again

483
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,120
cuz it's starting to affect the way my brain feels I've also just not been

484
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,400
eating well me and Ben haven't worked out in like two weeks we just completely

485
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,240
dropped the ball on that it's been raining a lot and I get headaches when

486
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,920
it rains that's a fucking obnoxious thing and also the weather is all the fuck

487
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,720
over the place it got really cold it had got it had finally gotten like winter

488
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,160
cold and I was like I had considered stopping smoking then because it got so

489
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,880
cold the standing outside sucked so I was like well this is not fun anymore you

490
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,360
know I'm gonna stop doing this but then it suddenly got fucking way warm today

491
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,920
it's like 70 or something it's not even chilly outside and it's December so the

492
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,160
weather is all over the fucking place it won't stop raining it's always wet I've

493
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:46,000
always got a fucking headache yeah so I felt I have felt physically completely

494
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,600
off for like probably five or six days now and that fucking sucks that makes

495
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,520
everything else difficult I mean thankfully as I said in the first part

496
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,960
of this I work on such autopilot at this point that I can I can still get

497
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,640
things done it used to be there was a time even in my video making career where

498
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,800
if I felt off I could not work and that was kind of often you know like

499
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:15,200
probably at least a day out of every week I just felt not up to life I just

500
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,480
felt like either my stomach hurt or I had a headache or I just felt this sort of

501
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,160
dysphoria with my own life like not understanding who I am or why I'm here

502
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,480
and in that mood I'm not good at creating things but these days I'm just so

503
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,640
used to it that nothing can stop me I mean the last like three days all three

504
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,280
of those days individually I thought I'm not getting anything done today I feel

505
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,000
sick and I slept for most of the day and I still managed to make something

506
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,040
because I can't help myself like yesterday I'm like I feel like shit I

507
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,280
don't want to do anything I guess I'll just play sort of mana I guess I'll edit

508
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,720
this entire handfuls of Zen video I guess that's out and then I went and

509
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,560
passed out like immediately afterwards I think I passed out listening to it I

510
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,080
think I put it on and did not survive the whole video it was either that or

511
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,720
something else that I listened to in the same way I think it was that I think I

512
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,800
passed out listening to handfuls of Zen gross I feel terrible but you know

513
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:24,320
doesn't affect you guys you still get content and and here's another thing

514
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:33,600
please guys don't do this thing where you try to extrapolate more psycho

515
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,920
analysis out of the things I've said than what I've already presented because

516
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,480
this these shows I do this is already a psychoanalysis of myself and I've

517
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,320
already come to conclusions about myself and I'm presenting them here and then

518
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,480
I'll get people who comment things that kind of like take it a step further but

519
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,000
that's not how I feel like I've already taken it as far as it can go you know

520
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,520
this is already a full-blown examination of how I feel so extrapolating more out

521
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,960
of it can be bothersome and here's an example of what I mean like and I get

522
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,080
this in response to a lot of the issues I bring up in my life where people will

523
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,800
say it sounds like you're burned out it sounds like you burned yourself out like

524
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,320
you've been doing too many of whatever it is if I say I can't find any anime I

525
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,120
really love people say well it sounds like you burned out from watching too much

526
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,160
anime or if I say I can't find any uh like you know I'm getting stressed out

527
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,840
from working so much you burned you burned out if I was burned out I'd say

528
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,040
so I know that feeling I know what burning out feels like I know what it's

529
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,720
like to be sick of anime you know when I was reading all those comics I was a

530
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,720
little burned out on anime like that was and I said so I was like I'm kind of

531
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,480
burned out on watching seven out of tens I'm gonna watch or go read comics

532
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,520
right now I'm not burned out on anime I haven't been fucking watching any for a

533
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,640
little while I just want to see a new favorite you know that's just something

534
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,800
I want to experience that's why I said so I didn't say I'm burned out on anime

535
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,160
and when I talk about anytime I talk about how many projects I'm doing and

536
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,560
like if I say something like I feel physically sick people will say maybe

537
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:09,040
it's because of all the projects you're working on but the thing is that that's

538
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,920
a constant in my life at times when I feel amazing it's often attributable to

539
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,040
the fact that I'm working on so many things at once you know the beginning of

540
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,480
the decompression chamber I was talking about how like yeah man I've been

541
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,760
I've been making a thousand videos and working out and all this other stuff

542
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,600
I mean this is something this is just my lifestyle I'm just super productive

543
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:34,240
and I feel way worse when I'm not making things like in a lot of ways my happiness

544
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,520
and self-worth are tied to how many fucking things I can get done so the

545
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,440
physical illness is definitely not a result

546
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,840
of the working of the overworking it's a result of everything surrounding it

547
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,920
it's a result of a bad diet not working out anymore

548
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,400
uh you know frustrating climate it never is the right temperature in my room

549
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,160
um because when it gets cold I put on the heat

550
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,960
but then the heat goes stronger to my room than it does to the rest of the

551
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,360
house so then it just gets really hot then I

552
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,040
turn it off and it gets really fucking cold there's no winning with the the

553
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,240
heat in my house and then today because of a situation I won't even get into

554
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,840
where I was on hold for an hour and a half trying to call into the dick show

555
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:26,400
I uh I fucking had my window open and I because I I was stressed out because

556
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,120
I've been vaping for half an hour like non-stop and then I my fucking vapes

557
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,320
battery died so I smoked a cigarette in my room

558
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,080
and I had the windows open to let the smoke out which did not work

559
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,520
I left them open for like an hour smoke room still full of smoke

560
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,800
and it's humid as shit because I had the window open and it's been raining

561
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,720
so now I've got like maximum humidity in here so I just

562
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,480
that's why I feel physically wrong you know it has nothing to do with the work

563
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,880
it's the work environment it's how I treat myself and my body

564
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,320
and how the weather treats me you know those are the reasons I feel sick

565
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,520
so just I just don't I just I I know that people

566
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,120
worry about me sometimes and sometimes that's okay

567
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,520
worry about me for the reasons stated not for the other reasons that you've

568
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,000
read into it because believe me I know how to psychoanalyze

569
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,040
myself you know it's something I've been doing my whole

570
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,880
life and I've had I've been to psychologists I've

571
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,120
been through all the ring moral I I've studied psychology

572
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,720
I I think I know what's wrong with me better than anyone

573
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,320
you know and when I feel something's wrong I state it

574
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,960
I state what I think is wrong that's not to say I share absolutely everything

575
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,320
but you know you're not if it's something I'm not sharing you're not

576
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,000
going to extrapolate it from the things I've said you know

577
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,160
so yeah that's just something I find a little bit annoying it's not that big

578
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,360
a deal because I know it's well-meaning I know people just

579
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,200
want to help but I I do feel like when someone says

580
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,720
oh it sounds like you're doing this I'm like no I'm doing what I said I was

581
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,320
doing you know the problem is exactly as stated

582
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,280
and and so much of it is because people are reading in

583
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,640
what would be the problem for them you know it's always someone saying like

584
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,760
I especially get this when people like have the really far-reaching ones where

585
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,280
it's like a like a some kind of mental issue they think I might have where it's

586
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,560
always exactly the one they have you know or

587
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,320
like did you I know you're probably burning out because I burn out all the

588
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,640
time and this happened like yeah that's you

589
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,840
I you know I get it but it's it's it's a little annoying

590
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,600
anyway that's enough for that point I'll probably record one more section of

591
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,200
this at some point and release it later because PCP came out today I don't want

592
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,120
to sandwich the releases together even though this is an hour

593
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,560
already but you know maybe I'll have something else to talk about tomorrow

594
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:04,560
who knows

595
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:10,960
oh baby I sure am glad that I decided to hold off

596
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,680
on releasing this podcast because if I got a story for you guys

597
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,040
a fun little piece of shat and Freud for all you

598
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,640
fucking tech geeks out there who are going to lose

599
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:29,760
your shit hearing this little this little what I spent six hours on today

600
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,640
oh god so um you know in light of me trying to become

601
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:43,120
a draw boy I decided to buy a tablet and not just any tablet but a one with a

602
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,400
screen the the big the big boy expensive

603
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,680
tablets um you know I had I had a Wacom bamboo

604
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,400
that I bought way back in like when I back when I worked at Target it was one

605
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,080
of the first things I bought because when I first started making videos for

606
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,200
YouTube I thought I was going to teach myself to do

607
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,200
animations because I wanted to be ego raptor

608
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,680
and do sequelitis didn't really work out I didn't end up using the tablet much

609
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,080
and eventually it stopped working after sitting in shades room for a couple of

610
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,560
years and getting abused um it doesn't work anymore

611
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,400
so I decided I want to buy one of these ones at the screen partly because

612
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,960
uh fellow pcp member Tom who runs the rebel pixels channel has been doing

613
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,800
all these videos on Cintiq alternatives all these you know tablets with

614
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,840
screens that are uh that don't cost as much

615
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,720
so he just put out a holiday buyer's guide his mid-range one was the d13

616
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,800
the artisal and so I bought one uh for 500 bucks

617
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,040
and it showed up it's fucking massive it's way bigger than I thought it was

618
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,840
going to be it's beautiful uh so I decided to try and

619
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:05,280
hook it up now the artisal it has this driver you

620
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,240
know you have to you have to install a driver to make it work

621
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,520
but the driver will not install unless you don't have any other tablet drivers

622
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,040
on your computer so I'm trying to install this driver

623
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,880
and it's not working it keeps telling me that it's detecting another tablet

624
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,200
driver so I start going this took hours hours of

625
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,240
going a shit through my computer trying to find these

626
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,680
fucking tablet drivers because they're not in the uninstall list

627
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,920
they're not in my programs list I I fucking I

628
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,520
uninstalled drivers for like every device that had ever been plugged into my

629
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,960
computer that wasn't currently plugged into it you know I went found all the

630
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,640
hidden drivers I'm saying all this because I know

631
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,160
that someone someone listening who's a tech expert

632
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,200
is going to say well did you try this did you try that

633
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,680
yes I spent hours googling everything you can possibly do

634
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,440
and trying everything now the only thing that's anywhere in my computer that I

635
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,920
could find that even resembles a tablet driver is this

636
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,520
windows driver it's like part of a windows driver pack

637
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,440
and it says graphics tablet on it so I was like okay

638
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,720
this seems to be it but if you try to uninstall that

639
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,520
it's in the uninstall list but when you try to uninstall it it says that it

640
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,080
doesn't exist it says you don't even have this thing on your

641
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,720
computer I don't know why it's listed in the uninstall

642
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,000
list but it claims I don't even have it

643
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,280
and it would give me this error message you know I'm searching around I find

644
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,600
other people who've had the same issue but no one's really resolved it

645
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,640
and I'm looking at all this information about how to uninstall drivers

646
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:47,040
so what I end up doing is going into the command prompt

647
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,440
getting a driver's list as a text file

648
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,280
fucking you know control effing my way through there and finding anything that

649
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,320
says tablet on it and there are two different things but they're both system

650
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:04,400
32 drivers right so I go into system 32 I learn how to

651
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,080
change permissions on files and I go into the drivers

652
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:15,680
and I delete two of them first one nothing changed

653
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,560
second one nothing changes in regards to the tablet

654
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:25,120
but I now can't connect to the internet so

655
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,000
what I believe I did was I misread the drivers list

656
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,160
and uninstalled or deleted some other driver

657
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,920
and of course I didn't know about system restore before doing any of this

658
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,200
so I didn't set a restore point for my computer which would have solved this

659
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,200
whole problem um well this it wouldn't have solved

660
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,880
the the weird tablet driver problem but it wouldn't have

661
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,120
it would have not made it so I just uninstalled or deleted a system 32 file

662
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,720
that makes it so I can't connect to the internet and no one's sure why

663
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,920
and there's no way to replace it or anything turns out

664
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,200
uh manipulating system 32 files such an uncommon occurrence

665
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,640
that no one on the internet has helped for it uh you can't just download system

666
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,320
32 drivers and put them on your computer that that's

667
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:19,920
not a thing apparently I go what I start doing is

668
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,640
taking all the drivers from my laptop system 32 put those on a flash drive

669
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,400
put them all in my computer didn't help um

670
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,440
this is the over the course of hours by the way at this point I've got shade

671
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,280
helping me shades got windows 7 but even after changing permissions I can't

672
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,960
write any of his system files onto a flash drive for some reason it won't

673
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,920
give me permission eventually I remember hey wait a minute

674
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,280
my computer is partitioned between two different

675
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,560
solid state drives at the time I'd forgotten the other one the solid

676
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,360
state but because when my computer was built it

677
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,000
had a 250 gigabyte solid state drive and I later wanted to upgrade to a

678
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,400
terabyte one so I've been using the terabyte

679
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,160
there's a 250 gig one that's still in there and it still has all the

680
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,000
it's exactly as it was before I bought the new one you know we

681
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,200
didn't delete anything off of it or anything thank god because

682
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,720
originally I bit I was going to format it um and my tech friend was just like

683
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,240
let's not and you know just in case something goes wrong um

684
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:24,000
we'll wait a few weeks and then we'll we'll do it and I never did

685
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,600
so thank fuck I never formatted the other uh hard drive

686
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,440
because we also we couldn't we couldn't just boot for something like for

687
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,280
whatever reason my my fucking DOS has a password

688
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,080
and I don't know what it is and it's not the password of anything else on my

689
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,040
computer so couldn't get into DOS so we had to

690
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,800
open up the computer and fucking change the damn cords

691
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:56,800
around also that I could boot off of my old solid state drive

692
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,280
and I tried copying the system 32 files from the from the old solid state to

693
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,560
the new one that didn't work either nothing worked

694
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,640
so now my main my main SSD just can't connect to the internet and no one

695
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,240
knows why so I'm probably gonna have to reinstall

696
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,840
windows on that one which you know I don't want to fucking

697
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,560
go to the process of backing up everything and reinstalling windows

698
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,440
now especially if that doesn't even help the problem

699
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,080
because even after all of this I never solved

700
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,440
the tablet problem I never solved the issue

701
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,880
of it still thinking it has tablet drivers so finally and in the meantime a

702
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,280
mid-stall this happening I plugged the fucking new the tablet into my laptop

703
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,200
and it worked instantly you know like I got the drivers on there it's perfect

704
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,480
and I so I already know the thing works it works just fine

705
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,000
it's just something whatever reason my main SSD

706
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,280
has this problem so we routed to the other SSD

707
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,440
it works on that one um it's I fucking had to deal with

708
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,200
still even though the drivers installed it still took me half an hour to get the

709
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,400
fucking thing to detect the pen for some reason

710
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,080
eventually it was just like a matter of switching which usb port it was plugged

711
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:15,360
into god it was a waking

712
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,360
nightmare six hours it took before I got this thing working

713
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,360
on my computer and even still it's at the caveat of

714
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:30,160
I now am just using my old solid state drive I now just have now the one

715
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,640
terabyte is the partitioned one you know just I mean thank god nothing

716
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,320
worse happened with me fucking with system 32 files it

717
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,800
could have been much worse um and you know and and thankfully the

718
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,320
partition is is easily enough that I can just copy like you know I just had to

719
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,600
copy the decompression chamber from the other SSD to this one

720
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,600
and of course this SSD is from like you know I changed I'm like

721
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,840
early in the year so it's got all these like like it's missing a bunch of

722
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,880
programs that I now use and has all this stuff that has to be changed it

723
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,280
remembers all my old passwords and stuff so I have to fucking update

724
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,120
everything now huge fucking pain in the ass but at

725
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,160
least I got the damn thing working Christ

726
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:20,080
oh god I am the I am the biggest idiot in the world

727
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,280
I fucking immediately after I finally got it to work

728
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:29,840
I rushed out because I was just like fuming I could not contain

729
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,960
my rage at this point I was like I need to eat I was hungry

730
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,000
had you know been sitting there for six hours working on this thing

731
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,440
so I immediately went out to Arby's bought some big ass

732
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,520
shit which was disgusting I don't know why I did that then I had a cigarette

733
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,640
now I'm having a beer it's like somehow the fact that I had failed so badly

734
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,720
meant I had to continue the failure and just like make it like

735
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,120
if I'm if I'm this retarded I might as well go full in and just eat fast food

736
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:03,040
and smoke a cigarette and have a beer and just destroy myself I need to die now

737
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,200
oh god

738
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,720
I guess I've had worse tech problems in the past

739
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:19,520
this is the worst one in a while though anyway I hope you enjoyed that little

740
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,600
story I needed that I needed the decompression this was a real

741
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,320
this became a real decompression chamber at the very end here where I actually

742
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,920
needed to decompress not that that not the telling

743
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,440
that story like I mean it's just there for you to

744
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,240
laugh at me and there's no silver lining to it

745
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:43,440
but I guess I just needed to vent and now I'm remembering I can't get drunk

746
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,520
yet because I got to go pick up the view at the airport in like four hours so

747
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,280
yes I'll just drink half of this beer and then leave it around

748
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
oh see you in the next one

749
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:33,280
you
