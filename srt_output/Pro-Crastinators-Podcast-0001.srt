00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello everyone, welcome to the inaugural podcast from The Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm here with my internet friends. Everyone introduce yourselves.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm Digibro, and I, uh, spoke a lot of weed and promote Black stereotypes.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,100
Yep, uh, who else?

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm Hippocrit, I'm an African animal from the Africa, and I review video games.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,900
I'm Ben Saint. I do a comic called The Vapors. Go read it.

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Nice, and I guess I'll be Guy from Best Guy Ever. Go watch my YouTube anime videos, they're the coolest thing.

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm so unsure of yourself.

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Well, you know, it's one of those, I don't know. Anyway, so this is a new thing we're going to do.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,900
We're doing podcasts on some general sort of theme that hasn't been decided yet,

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:05,900
but today we've got a topic, and our topic today is what constitutes a best game ever.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,900
There was recently a poll on game facts, as there is like every five years or something for the best game of all time.

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,900
And so the first one to win in like 2005 or something was Final Fantasy 7,

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
and then the next one was Ocarina of Time, which are some of the two most beloved games ever.

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:34,900
And this year, to the surprise of all, Undertale, the new, that new meme game, Undertale, has taken the crown.

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,900
After being out for what, like three months or so?

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Yeah.

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:46,900
And so, you know, it's quite an interesting situation. Possibly it was just rigged, but nonetheless raises some interesting questions.

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,900
Depends what you mean by rigged.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,900
That's true. There's lots of ways to rig or not rig.

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,900
It was, it got won because of like rallying from Tumblr and other places.

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Well, I mean, it really is.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Someone could have made a bot, but probably not.

24
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,900
I mean, it isn't.

25
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
I guess.

26
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
There's a conspiracy going on.

27
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
I guess.

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Speaking as the only person in this group who actually votes in every game FAQs poll and has done so for fucking eight years.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,900
I know that two days ago, there was a poll called, did the best game ever contest convince you to try Undertale?

30
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Oh, cool.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,900
The answers went, the first answer was it might have, but I already owned it before the contest started, which had 21% of the votes.

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Yes, I picked it up after it was featured in the contest battles, had 3% of the votes, 3.8.

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,900
Some, somewhat, I might have to at least try out the demo now was 20.32%.

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Not really, it's not my style of game, not something I'd ever get, it was 29.61%.

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,900
And no, and I refuse to ever buy it purely out of spite, got 24.71%.

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,900
So you're telling me that less than 50% of those people said they had played it or wanted to play it at all?

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Yes.

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,900
That's, okay, that's extremely interesting.

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,900
You know what, it's the kind of game that lots of people wouldn't play anyway, so I don't think it's going to make any difference.

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Well, I mean, okay.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
For old Toby Fox.

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I know, the whole popular opinion thing is just interesting, but really it's not the focus of what we're going to talk about here.

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:32,900
So, you know, to make a comparison between like the other two, like the games that had previously won the polls, Final Fantasy VII and Ocarina of Time,

44
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,900
are both like complete game changers at the time they were released, which was around the same time anyway.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Undertale could be real influential, but like time, we have to wait and see.

46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
That's the thing.

47
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Final Fantasy VII and Ocarina of Time were both like technical marvels, absolutely blew away anything else that had come out at the time in their own ways.

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Undertale is like not at all that way technically, but you could certainly make a case that it is that way in terms of like narrative and storytelling and like game immersion, that sort of stuff.

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
That's all really vague shit you just said.

50
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,900
I know, I know it is.

51
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
It's totally vague and subjective, but that's, you know.

52
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:27,900
The thing about Undertale is that Undertale does a lot of things that are all very interesting, but I think it only actually does like one thing that's totally new, which is...

53
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Does it do anything?

54
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
I don't know if it does anything that's totally new.

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I think the only thing it does that's very new is offering the meta commentary on save scumming.

56
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:52,900
That I don't think there's ever been a game that weaves your save scumming into the narrative in a way that you are changing the story by resetting your save.

57
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,900
You know, spoiler alert for anyone who didn't know that about Undertale, but for fuck's sake, it's already won a best game ever, Poland.

58
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
It's a six hour game.

59
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Fucking play it if you're interested at all.

60
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Now, that's a very interesting point, and it certainly has a unique twist on it.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,900
However, there have been games that incorporate the death mechanic into the gameplay, which is a very interesting way to go.

62
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Yeah, but just incorporating death is like step one.

63
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Incorporating the act of save scumming is like a next level beyond that.

64
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Even if we talked about a game like Dark Souls where they have written death into the story, that if you give up playing, then it means you hollowed.

65
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,900
If you keep going, it means that you're continuing to be reincarnated.

66
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,900
But Dark Souls handles this by saving constantly.

67
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
There is no save scumming in Dark Souls.

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
It's always saving for you.

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Whereas, I don't think I've ever heard of an RPG where you can restart and you can redo things, but the game is keeping track of it.

70
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I think there might be other games that do keep track of that kind of thing, but not for the reasons that Undertale does.

71
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Not for narrative reasons.

72
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I don't think it's hugely important whether or not it was the first game to do it or not.

73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
I think it's important.

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Well, I would make the argument that it's much more about the sum of its parts and how it works.

75
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,900
No, if it did something before anyone else did it, that's important.

76
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Okay, it deserves credit, but like long term, I don't really think that's...

77
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
I know it's important.

78
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,900
I just think that Undertale is much more than just any one of those mechanics.

79
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay, well you're moving the goalpost, so I'm not saying it's whatever.

80
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,900
This is not an adversarial thing, Ben.

81
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
We're all friends here.

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,900
We're all friends, I'm telling you.

83
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Fine, fine.

84
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,900
Okay, but I kind of don't want to go into too much specifics here,

85
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,900
because I'm currently making a video called Best Game Ever Undertale, so go watch it when it's up.

86
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
This was your podcast idea.

87
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
I know, I know.

88
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,900
And you don't have to release this before Best Game Ever Undertale if you don't want to.

89
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
Maybe I'll save it till afterward.

90
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
You know what? Okay, I'm gonna go with that.

91
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
I'm going full out with this.

92
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,900
The whole save scumming thing, and the way that the characters respond to it,

93
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
is definitely the most special thing about the game.

94
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
And the way that it...

95
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Is it totally subjective?

96
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,900
Well, alright. Okay, I'm gonna...

97
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Warning, these are just my opinions.

98
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
They are not facts.

99
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
I cannot validate them objectively.

100
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Alright.

101
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Why, Ben? Do you think there's something else that's more important?

102
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Well, just because you said definitely.

103
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Yeah, I don't...

104
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Well, definitely to me.

105
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Yeah, just because it innovates in that way,

106
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,900
doesn't mean it's the thing that recommends the game.

107
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I wouldn't recommend that game to someone on the basis that it's meta about its save states.

108
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I would recommend it on the basis that it's a good story,

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,900
and it's really hype, and it innovates in a number of ways, that being one of them.

110
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Well, I would. I just wouldn't use those terms.

111
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I'd say it's really good.

112
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I mean, that's what I like about it.

113
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,900
I mean, in discussing why it's good, that would definitely come up.

114
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Well, yeah, but I wouldn't really want to describe that to someone before they play it.

115
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay, you know what? We're getting on to our topic here.

116
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,900
The focus here is to discuss what it means to be a best game of all time.

117
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
And what was the motivations people had for voting for it?

118
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
So, let's just talk about that now.

119
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,900
So, I mean, just comparing the winners of this poll,

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,900
there's the technical innovations,

121
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,900
and then there's the classics,

122
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,900
and then there's this one game that's been out for a couple months that is completely taken over.

123
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Was it reasonable to vote Undertale as a best game ever?

124
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
I mean, obviously it was a popular...

125
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Some people's favorite game of all time.

126
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Okay, okay, that's true.

127
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
But will we look back on it in...

128
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
It's been like 20 years since Thomas VII and Ocarina of Time came out.

129
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,900
And that's the conversation that I've been having with the DeVue,

130
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
and I think you have as well.

131
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Yeah, we probably should have just brought him in this, but...

132
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Sorry, DeVue.

133
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
He can be on some other time.

134
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:24,900
That, like, yeah, it is the best game ever right now.

135
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,900
And it might not be six months from now.

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Well, right now is when we're voting.

137
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Right, exactly.

138
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
That's true, that's true.

139
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
That's the issue, that, like, this poll...

140
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
Because this poll only happens once every five years,

141
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,900
and I guarantee you that if Undertale had come out one year ago,

142
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
it would not have won this poll.

143
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
Yeah.

144
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
This poll happened at a time when this game was at maximum hype,

145
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,900
when the highest number of people possible care about it,

146
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,900
because it's had three months to build up, you know,

147
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,900
where, like, the initial fan base exploded,

148
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,900
more and more people care, more and more people are creating things,

149
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,900
and a lot of that, all the ideas that have been had by the Undertale fandom

150
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,900
have sort of been realized by now,

151
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
or they will be within the next few months,

152
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,900
and six months from now, it will not be hype like this.

153
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
There will probably be something else

154
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,900
that a lot of the people who were super into Undertale have gravitated towards,

155
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,900
you know, maybe a new season of Steven Universe or something,

156
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,900
or the next bomb from that, you know,

157
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,900
and people will be talking about something else,

158
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,900
and the specific circumstance of a best game ever poll happening

159
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,900
and then someone campaigning really hard to make that game win

160
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
would not have happened.

161
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
And, you know, when you look at the voting,

162
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
like the way it was going,

163
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,900
because I turned you guys on to the fact that it was in the running early on,

164
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,900
and it had narrowly beaten Mass Effect 3 at the beginning,

165
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
and I remember that my impression was like,

166
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,900
huh, Undertale won, but I had marked it as winning

167
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
just because no one likes Mass Effect 3.

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,900
It's a game that's widely disliked

169
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
by even fans of the franchise.

170
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
So Undertale winning against Mass Effect 3 was kind of reasonable,

171
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
but every single round, its margin got bigger,

172
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,900
and it was beating games that are more and more considered classics

173
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
that more and more people love by wider and wider margins.

174
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Suddenly, it's beating Fallout 3, which is a game everyone loves,

175
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,900
and suddenly it's crushing Ocarina of Time in the last round.

176
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,900
The numbers were crazy by then.

177
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,900
And the fact that it so barely even beat Mass Effect 3

178
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:55,900
says to me that the game FAQs for people who would have voted for this

179
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,900
would not have voted for Undertale.

180
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,900
And no question, there was a surge of outside influence

181
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
for the normal voting.

182
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:11,900
And I think it speaks to the influence of Undertale's popularity right now

183
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,900
that no other game got.

184
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Because obviously there was tons of people who were mad about it.

185
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,900
There was a huge counter move against Undertale,

186
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,900
but it didn't work against Undertale.

187
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Love Trump's Hate, Hillary, 2016.

188
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,900
No one was building up a counter force of people voting for Ocarina of Time.

189
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Right, certainly not in the numbers of the influence.

190
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Because if Ocarina of Time was relevant enough right now

191
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,900
that it could have beat Undertale, then it would have beat Undertale,

192
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
because there would have been enough people going,

193
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,900
no, Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever,

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
and after fighting it.

195
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Well, you gotta ask yourself,

196
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,900
you gotta look at who's voting in the poll

197
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,900
and what percentage of them are making a legitimate vote based on favorite game,

198
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
and who's just coming in specifically.

199
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Oh, someone told me to vote for Undertale to mess this thing up.

200
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,900
So it doesn't necessarily say anything about Ocarina.

201
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
I kind of agree.

202
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Yeah, Ocarina could have been, if popular enough,

203
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
that that might have happened,

204
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,900
and the fact that it doesn't say that Ocarina maybe isn't that relevant,

205
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,900
or whatever, compared to Undertale.

206
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,900
You know, there was that post one of you guys linked,

207
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,900
of the guy who said that, like,

208
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900
he said something to the effect that he voted for Undertale

209
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,900
just because he didn't want the same old games to be winning again and again.

210
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah, right, right.

211
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
And just it feels that way too.

212
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
And all I could think was, you know, noble goal,

213
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,900
why didn't you vote for Dark Souls, the actual best game ever?

214
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Yeah, I think that Dark Souls,

215
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
and this gets to the heart of kind of what I want to talk about,

216
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,900
you know, what exactly makes a best game ever.

217
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
And I really think that something like Dark Souls,

218
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I absolutely love Undertale, I'm crazy about it right now,

219
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,900
though the fan base, I find a bit obnoxious these days,

220
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:28,900
but Dark Souls has not only completely changed the game of making games,

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,900
it's had a huge influence, and nobody expected it.

222
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,900
And there's just, there's like a post and pre Dark Souls World,

223
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
and it's one of those milestone games,

224
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
like Final Fantasy VII, like Ocarina of Time.

225
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Maybe we'll be saying the same thing about Undertale in a year.

226
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Right, that's true, we might.

227
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
And you know, this is only my opinion, but we don't know.

228
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
It seems to me too early to say.

229
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,900
I don't think I could honestly make a case that I think it's the best game ever.

230
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,900
I can't help the feeling for me personally,

231
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,900
that like, if Undertale is bringing in a new revolutionary idea,

232
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,900
then it's not the game that's gonna have done it the best.

233
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,900
You know, like, I think if there's a game that takes the ideas of Undertale,

234
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,900
and then does it in the full package,

235
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
where it's not like an 8-bit indie game,

236
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,900
and it's not like 6 hours long,

237
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,900
and you know, and really, like, while the...

238
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I don't know that I agree with you.

239
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Hang on, here's where I'm going to completely 100% disagree,

240
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,900
because in no way do I think a game has to be anything more than the presentation Undertale has.

241
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I think a game could look exactly like Dwarf Fortress,

242
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,900
and be the best game of all time, if it was built in such a way.

243
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,900
I just don't agree with the whole idea of a best game.

244
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Like, I either want to play it, or I don't.

245
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
That's how I see it.

246
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Like, it's good because I remember the fun times I had playing it,

247
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,900
and or I want to play it again right now.

248
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Having like a best is just sort of pointless.

249
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,900
It's entirely masturbatory, that's true.

250
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
It's also as pointless as having scores.

251
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,900
They're kind of a little bit more helpful, but it all still boils down to

252
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
do I want to play it, yes or no?

253
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Yeah, like, look at the poll.

254
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Final Fantasy 7 one, then Ocarina one.

255
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Like, they'd both been out the whole time.

256
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Only thing to change was people's opinions,

257
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
and that's just how it's going to be forever.

258
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Well, for me, I love having a best,

259
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,900
and I like having a most favorite thing, because...

260
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
It's very fun to...

261
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,900
I can look at it, and I can say, like, this explains my taste.

262
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
You know, like, this explains what I want.

263
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
This is what I want games to be.

264
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Like, for me, I consider Dark Souls to be the best game ever,

265
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,900
because, like, it represents everything I value in video games.

266
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,900
It has, you know, it's a game that, at the same time,

267
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
has a deep and involving narrative,

268
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
but one that you can engage with on your own terms.

269
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
It has, it incorporates the way that you play the game

270
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,900
into the narrative and style of the game,

271
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
where, you know, if you die, that's part of the narrative.

272
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
If you give up playing, that's part of the narrative, you know?

273
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,900
There's nothing that you can do in the game

274
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,900
that would break your immersion with the game,

275
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,900
other than, like, glitches and stuff, you know?

276
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Which that's super important.

277
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I think that's what really makes Dark Souls a greatest game contender.

278
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Like, that's what I really value in games.

279
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Well, you know, I just want to throw out there.

280
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
That's fine, but I'm 13,

281
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,900
and my favorite game is Call of Duty Black Ops 2,

282
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
because it's the game I play every single day for six hours after school,

283
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
and I get more enjoyment out of that than anything else in the world.

284
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
But, I mean, and yeah, that's fair.

285
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Yeah.

286
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,900
And, again, I think if we're judging,

287
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,900
if we're saying best game ever is anything other than personal opinion,

288
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
that just means it's consensus, right?

289
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
And that's the answer to our whole,

290
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,900
that we just answered the question of this whole discussion here.

291
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
It's consensus, there is no objective...

292
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Well, podcast over.

293
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Go on, Digi.

294
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Yeah, well, you know, I think, yeah,

295
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,900
the reason Undertale wins in this contest is that, right now,

296
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
there's enough people who care about it,

297
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
but that's the funny thing.

298
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
And those people are able to galvanize votes,

299
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
because I bet a lot of those people, you know.

300
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
But that's the funny thing about it, though,

301
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,900
is that, like, six months later, if you ran this poll again,

302
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
it won't be Undertale.

303
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
And you have to wonder, like...

304
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,900
I think what that does is it puts into perspective

305
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,900
how, like, how subject to change the idea of the best is,

306
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,900
because, like, I think on-game FAQs,

307
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,900
as someone who's been on there for a long time,

308
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,900
like, the Legend of Zelda franchise and anything by Square Enix

309
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
are extremely overpowered for these contests.

310
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,900
They are franchises which people have set in their mind long ago

311
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
that they are the best thing ever,

312
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
and they will continue to vote that they are the best thing ever.

313
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,900
You know, like, the fact that fucking The Legend of Zelda,

314
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,900
a link to the past, beat Dark Souls in this whole,

315
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,900
you know, this game that is, what, God,

316
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
nearly 30 years old?

317
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
No, it can't be 30.

318
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,900
20 years, around 20 something years old.

319
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,900
And it's a game that literally every Zelda since

320
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
has iterated on and improved on, you know.

321
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Every 2D Zelda has tweaked the controls to be a little better,

322
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,900
has tweaked the way the world building is a little better.

323
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Every 3D Zelda game has used the same formula,

324
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
has used the same, you know, structure.

325
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Well, you could say it's attachment to the original,

326
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
the, you know, originator of the formula.

327
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,900
You could, but like, I just think that,

328
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,900
that that game is like, it makes it that far,

329
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,900
mostly because people think it's a link to the past,

330
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
it's the classic, it's the original,

331
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
it's, you know, automatically great,

332
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,900
but not because they would actually play it today

333
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,900
and it would be their favorite game, you know.

334
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Sure, yeah.

335
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,900
I think people voted up because it's the OG

336
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
and not because they legitimately think

337
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
that it's a better game than Dark Souls, you know.

338
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Well, that makes me, that reminds me,

339
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,900
I want to go back to your point that in the future,

340
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,900
games may iterate on Undertale's ideas and do them better.

341
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Because I don't think that's necessarily the case

342
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,900
because the thing, because like, like Guy was saying before,

343
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
the things that Undertale did better than anything else

344
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
were not technical things, they were creative things.

345
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,900
And they were, and anything technical that was going on there

346
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
was done in service of its particular narrative.

347
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
And so I'm not sure that's the kind of thing

348
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,900
that can actually be improved upon in like, any measurable way.

349
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,900
And only in an artistic way, which is entirely subjective, yeah.

350
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I could see that, I guess for me,

351
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
because out of anyone in this call,

352
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I am the least impressed with what Undertale is.

353
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Because for me, like my biggest problems with this game were like,

354
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,900
I appreciate like the graphics and everything,

355
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
but to me they felt like a limitation.

356
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,900
It didn't feel like this was the ideal presentation.

357
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,900
No, absolutely not.

358
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
You're completely a limitation.

359
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Look, the great things about Undertale were like,

360
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,900
like the resetting and the keeping in memory of the things you've done

361
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,900
and the way that it closes itself when you like lose to Flowey later on.

362
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,900
And the way the game, you know, permanently fucks up everything

363
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,900
if you do the genocide route and then try to do it again.

364
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,900
None of those are particularly impressive feats of programming

365
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,900
or game development, but to apply the ideas

366
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,900
in those kinds of meaningful ways shows just the creativity of Toby and all that good stuff.

367
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Some of the art in the game is bad,

368
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
and that's because it was done by Toby before he got kickstarted

369
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
and had the money to pay artists.

370
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,900
That I think is a limitation, but like the fact that it's 2D pixel graphics

371
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
and you know, like white enemies in the Blackfield,

372
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
I don't think those are limitations.

373
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I think even with all the money in the world, it would have still had that aesthetic.

374
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I have no problem with 2D pixel art,

375
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,900
but if you went and played like a old, like let's say Super Nintendo game,

376
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:56,900
like Super Metroid or even, well, I guess Mario RPG wouldn't really be 2D pixel art per se,

377
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,900
but like they're really nice looking games that hold up really well.

378
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,900
The game that always comes to mind for me is like a Valkyrie profile for the PS1.

379
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,900
That game has like these luscious environments, gorgeous pixel art,

380
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,900
or if you were going modern, Muramasa or like Skullgirls or something,

381
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:27,900
like do you think that Undertale would not be better if it had the art budget to be a beautiful 2D game?

382
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
That's fair, and you can improve the art of anything?

383
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I don't really think it would be any better.

384
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Well, that's exactly what I was going to say.

385
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,900
What I really care about is the ideas,

386
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,900
you've got a sprite that conveys the idea that this is Heath's Flamesman.

387
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Do not forget his name.

388
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,900
What if you had the exact same game?

389
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,900
All the ideas are the same, but the graphics are better.

390
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
I'll give it to you.

391
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
That would be better, I guess.

392
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
I guess that'd be better.

393
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Would you say Hippo?

394
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
I don't like good graphics.

395
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,900
Yeah, I agree.

396
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,900
I mean, the best looking place in the game is the core.

397
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,900
The core has all these really fancy cloud effects and lighting effects

398
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
and everything looks really nice and crisp and shiny,

399
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,900
and I don't like it any more than the ruins,

400
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,900
which is like 2D, piece of crap drawn by a totally isn't an artist.

401
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
See, I feel the opposite.

402
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
I thought the ruins looked like shit,

403
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
and I didn't feel invested in the game yet because it looked like shit.

404
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
They do look like shit, but in a way that I'm totally fine with.

405
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
The thing that bothered me the most in Undertale design-wise

406
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,900
is that the whole game to me felt like a very long horizontal hallway,

407
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,900
because you always see, especially in the ruins,

408
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,900
you continually see a black border,

409
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,900
like you are walking through a tunnel that exists in a void.

410
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,900
In my mind, I'm picturing, like, designing this map

411
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
on the backdrop of nothingness,

412
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,900
because you're drawing a tunnel through,

413
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,900
like you're just drawing a tunnel and putting a game in it.

414
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,900
I agree, and let me add to that

415
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
probably the worst thing for that,

416
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
and it's so bad that even I was slightly bothered by it,

417
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
is that in the very final area,

418
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
in the walk up to the last boss,

419
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
you're walking along this gray platform,

420
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
and around you is just blackness

421
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,900
with a couple of really shitty-looking stone buildings

422
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,900
copy-pasted in a perfect grid on either side of you,

423
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
and I think what it's supposed to be suggesting

424
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,900
is that you're walking through and or over a city,

425
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,900
but it really just looks like these rectangular things,

426
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
like stuck on a black background.

427
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
It really is terrible.

428
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
I think if this game didn't feel...

429
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,900
because the moments that it really sinks in

430
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,900
are when you backtrack or you go back and forth,

431
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
and you really feel this sense of,

432
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
like, this is just a left-to-right motion.

433
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,900
There's no... you never really go far, up and down.

434
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,900
You never really go much in opposite direction.

435
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
And I mean, that could be on some level symbolic

436
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,900
that this whole game is one long trip to the right, you know?

437
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,900
But, like, I just felt like if this world felt more integrated

438
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,900
and less like a hallway and more like a, you know,

439
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
maybe like a Zelda-type thing,

440
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
which even Zelda, you know, feels like a fucking square,

441
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
so, like, once you really explore the map.

442
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Now, see, I'm glad we're talking about this

443
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,900
because none of this had the slightest bit

444
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,900
of detrimental effect to me in my experience.

445
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
I don't think...

446
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Like, what Undertale is does not need to be an open world.

447
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Like, the story Undertale is trying to tell

448
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
is successfully told via a hallway.

449
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I don't think it needs to be open world,

450
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,900
but I think that the...

451
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,900
I think that by having...

452
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,900
if that black space off to the side was drawn in

453
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,900
and, like, you could tell that there's a world right outside

454
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
this hallway you're in,

455
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
then that would sell me on it more.

456
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
So, I've always been a big fan.

457
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,900
There are places where the art could have sold things a little better.

458
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Here's a video game.

459
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Here's an RPG conceit that always bothers me, right?

460
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
That the Final Fantasy games do this much better

461
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
than any other JRPGs, in my opinion.

462
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,900
I hate it when I show up in a town in an RPG

463
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
and there's five houses.

464
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
And, like, those five houses are the only relevant,

465
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
like, you know, people live there

466
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
and they sell items or whatever,

467
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,900
but I'm meant to believe that in this world,

468
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,900
there are towns that literally consist of five buildings

469
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
and five people, you know?

470
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Even a game like Skyrim,

471
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
like, there's towns in that game where you'll show up

472
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
and it's, like, a handful of houses and that's it.

473
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
And because, you know, the limitations

474
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,900
of building a game with that system.

475
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,900
But if you look at a Final Fantasy game,

476
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
there's always a huge amount of city

477
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
that you're just not exploring.

478
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Like, Final Fantasy IX especially, you know,

479
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
like, the actual gameplay takes place

480
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,900
within, like, three or four streets in that city.

481
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
But you can see this huge, sweeping city,

482
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,900
so you feel like it's a real living, breathing place

483
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
in this world, you know, that would make sense

484
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,900
whether it was a video game city or not.

485
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,900
And, like, I think Undertale could have had some of that

486
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,900
and I think it would have been better for it.

487
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Well, Snowden was a pretty big town.

488
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Yes, Snowden felt pretty good.

489
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,900
I like some of the areas where you do see more background,

490
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,900
you know?

491
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,900
Obviously, like Ben said, the grey area towards the end

492
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,900
could have looked better, but it did at least suggest

493
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,900
that there was this city you were walking over

494
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
and, like, that you were in a place,

495
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
that you were walking through a place, you know,

496
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,900
as opposed to, like, the part where you're in the caves

497
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
where you turn on the lights and everything

498
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,900
and it's just, like, suspended hallways in a black void,

499
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
you know, like, where is this? What is this?

500
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Now, this isn't really an excuse for the game design,

501
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
but there is at least the idea that things were sort of

502
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,900
deliberately constructed in a, it's a lampshade hang, I guess,

503
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
that monsters love puzzles and, like, winding dungeons and things.

504
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Yeah, the puzzles are definitely an element of that

505
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
and, like, the ruins are definitely designed

506
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
in a way that is like that

507
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,900
and is a single hallway full of puzzles

508
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,900
and the game, like, points that out for sure.

509
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
The caves, though, I don't think there's really any defense.

510
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Well, you know, are the caves...

511
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
I don't know. I don't know, maybe.

512
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,900
I don't know if that excuse covers the caves and everything,

513
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
but, yes.

514
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,900
There's a lot of things about this game that are minimal

515
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,900
in a really good way that I don't think would have been better otherwise.

516
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,900
This game would not be better with voice acting.

517
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Oh, certainly not. I don't think those games would.

518
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,900
The sound design is perfect because they used sound effects

519
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
that sound like the fonts that they're showing, you know?

520
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
The sound design is perfect.

521
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,900
The sound design is like...

522
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,900
I think the sound design might be the one thing about this game

523
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,900
that's, like, completely beyond reproach.

524
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,900
Yeah, I think the moment that...

525
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Because, like, when I think about this game,

526
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,900
the dramatic moment in the game that sticks out the most to me

527
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
is when it says...

528
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,900
It's a dramatic moment where it says you are filled with determination,

529
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,900
but it spells it out one letter at a time with spaces between it.

530
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,900
You are filled with determination, and I was like...

531
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,900
I just remember feeling like, oh, fuck, yeah, you know what, I saw that,

532
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,900
and you could not have done that with voice acting or without text.

533
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Along with the musical beat that plays at that moment.

534
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
It's like that...

535
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Man, that fucking fight, dude.

536
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,900
I don't think the music could have been any better

537
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Dude, these beats are banging, bro. These beats are off the charts.

538
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
They're radical.

539
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,900
I'm just saying that I think it is possible

540
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
for Undertale to have been a better game

541
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,900
just by having little things that it could have done,

542
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,900
like having more graphical budget

543
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,900
or a more imaginative layout of its world,

544
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,900
or just being able to spend maybe a little more time

545
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
with the characters and in the story

546
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,900
to really feel like you knew them and what they were about.

547
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Here's another point that we've previously discussed,

548
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,900
which is, I mean, I would call Undertale a 10 out of 10 game for me.

549
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,900
And you convinced me previously that that doesn't mean

550
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
that it has to be perfect.

551
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,900
It's just one of those legendary games that you really love

552
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,900
and that you'd play again, and super good.

553
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,900
And so on that basis, and that applies to best game ever.

554
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,900
It could still be the best game ever, theoretically,

555
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
despite not being perfect.

556
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
It just can be topped.

557
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
If another game comes out that's even better,

558
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
then that has to be the best game ever.

559
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
That's absolutely possible, and that will always be possible.

560
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
I might be totally out of whack here.

561
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,900
I might be the only person in the world,

562
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,900
but I think maybe there are some technical things

563
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,900
that could have been improved on the graphics and the layouts.

564
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
I think the one thing that I actually would have preferred

565
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,900
to be a little different would be the writing.

566
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,900
Not in every way, but in certain parts,

567
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,900
where certain parts tried a little hard

568
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,900
through their writing to sell the emotional thing.

569
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
What's an example of that?

570
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
Mostly towards the end.

571
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Just the sheer number of lines that Asgore gets as he's dying,

572
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,900
trying to sell him as the nicest guy.

573
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,900
And the sheer number of times that Azrael has to say,

574
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
like, why do I feel this way?

575
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Why are you being so nice to me?

576
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
What's happening to my heart?

577
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Here's a series of questions that were raised for me throughout the game.

578
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,900
When I'm going through the caves,

579
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,900
why does it just so happen that there's a bunch of text scrolls

580
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,900
on all the walls that just happen to be in order

581
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,900
and tell me the story of this world?

582
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Oh, come on. That's totally understandable

583
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
that they record their history.

584
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
I don't have an answer for you.

585
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Why do they record it that way, though?

586
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,900
It's a bunch of text scrolls in order just because you're passing through this area.

587
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
Or when you're on your way to Asgore

588
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
and you keep running into monsters

589
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,900
and each one is picking up the story where the last monster left off

590
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,900
and telling you what happened in the past,

591
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,900
which isn't even in character for these monsters,

592
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,900
for them to be telling you this part of the story

593
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,900
and speaking normally, you know?

594
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Those little things took me out of it in a way

595
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,900
where I was like, this is a way too convenient way to do exposition,

596
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,900
to have it, you know, dimed out just right at the right pace,

597
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,900
but it's not in a way that makes sense in the context of what's actually happening.

598
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,900
I think that both of those things that you mentioned are like deliberately...

599
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Okay, whether they're successful or not, I don't know,

600
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,900
but I think that those are both like deliberate immersion breaks.

601
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
That's possible.

602
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,900
With deliberate gamey moments.

603
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
With a scene like that, you're making a trade-off

604
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,900
of keeping the world feel 100% intact

605
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,900
to, in the case of the monsters delivering the lines,

606
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
which is one of my favorite parts in the whole game,

607
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,900
you're making a trade for an emotional payoff.

608
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,900
And in my personal opinion, I think it was totally worth it.

609
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,900
I like how this podcast has just become a review of Undertale.

610
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
Yeah, that's fine.

611
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,900
It's all to getting to the core of the matter here.

612
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Well, I mean, at least we're still talking about what makes a good game.

613
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Right.

614
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Here's what I want to know, actually.

615
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,900
What I really want to ask each of you is that

616
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,900
if you got to choose the winner of Best Game Ever, what would you have picked?

617
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Final Fantasy VII.

618
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
Like, and I can pick any game at all.

619
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,900
Yeah, you can pick any game. What would you pick as the winner of Best Game Ever?

620
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
That's a good question.

621
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Hippo, do you have an answer?

622
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Probably Dark Souls.

623
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Cool.

624
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Because I could play that over and over again forever.

625
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Ben?

626
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,900
I mean, Dark Souls is a pretty strong contender.

627
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Oh, God.

628
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,900
I came into this podcast about the Best Game Ever

629
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,900
without having prepared an answer to this question.

630
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,900
You know, now that I'm thinking about it,

631
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,900
I think right now I might fucking pick Undertale.

632
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Yeah.

633
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Even though I fucking railed against it

634
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
and was like, this is fucking bullshit.

635
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,900
It could never beat Final Fantasy VII.

636
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
It can't beat Ocarina of Time.

637
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
I think I might, right now I'm kind of feeling like

638
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Undertale is like my favorite game ever.

639
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
You know, I'm kind of with you.

640
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,900
I think it needs some time to sit and like, you know,

641
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,900
we need the benefit of hindsight to really know if it's the best game ever.

642
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
But its pedigree is impressive

643
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,900
and its list of accomplishments is long.

644
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,900
I have always held like the idea that my favorite game

645
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,900
is whatever I can think of when somebody asks me that question.

646
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Because I'm never thinking of it at any other point.

647
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,900
So it's just because something I...

648
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,900
I might have to, I might fit Binding of Isaac.

649
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
That's cool.

650
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
So that's your Call of Duty.

651
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,900
I fucking love Binding.

652
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Yeah, it is.

653
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
But better.

654
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,900
That's fine.

655
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I fucking love Binding of Isaac.

656
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
I think it's like a brilliantly designed game.

657
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Well, let me...

658
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,900
It appeals to me in like every way that a game can.

659
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
I'm with you.

660
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,900
I love the shit out of it

661
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
to the point that I might even call it the best game ever.

662
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,900
My...

663
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,900
You know, I was thinking about this

664
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
and I talk about this in the review.

665
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
One of my...

666
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Probably my favorite thing in a game

667
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,900
is that feeling of like slow progression

668
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,900
up to an ultimate SuperDuper awesome best ending ever.

669
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
And so like in that sense, like Chrono Trigger

670
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
is one that does that.

671
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,900
You can get like good endings along the way in various ways.

672
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,900
But if you really work at it

673
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
and really do the extra mile in the game,

674
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,900
you are rewarded with like the ultimate SuperDuper

675
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,900
best ending everything works out.

676
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,900
Another game like that is Radiant Historia.

677
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
And I really like it when they fake you out.

678
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
You get like a good ending, but it's not perfect.

679
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
And then you go investigate.

680
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,900
And you actually...

681
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Both those games happen to be time travel games

682
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
like Undertale is.

683
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,900
It's a good formula for that, I guess.

684
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
And so you put in the work

685
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
and you get your best ending ever.

686
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
You don't have time to travel at Undertale.

687
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Well, sure you do.

688
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
When you reset the game,

689
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
you're going back in time.

690
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Oh, okay, sure.

691
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
But Undertale...

692
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Man, Undertale does that too.

693
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
But like Undertale does that

694
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,900
to get the true pacifism ending.

695
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
The ending where you meet Azrael.

696
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Like, that's where Chrono Trigger

697
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,900
or Radiant Historia ends.

698
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
They end with the Azrael fight.

699
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
But Undertale, in my opinion,

700
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,900
continues after that with a whole new thing

701
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
with the genocide ending.

702
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
And in playing that,

703
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
there's all this other shit

704
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
that comes out of the woodwork

705
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,900
that really puts it like way over the top

706
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
in its own category

707
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
in a way that no game I've ever played

708
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
has done before.

709
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
So it's like...

710
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,900
It gave me every single thing I wanted

711
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
and then just a fuckload more.

712
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
So, you know, there's nothing like it for me.

713
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,900
It was by far the most big life experience

714
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,900
out of probably any game I've ever played.

715
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Yeah.

716
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,900
You know,

717
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
I kind of just want to go over all the reasons

718
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
that I don't love Undertale as much.

719
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Sure.

720
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
What's your favorite game?

721
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
I think Undertale is great.

722
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Oh, I already said it was Dark Souls.

723
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,900
Oh, yeah, right.

724
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
But it's funny because Dark Souls,

725
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
my reason is opposite of Gibbons

726
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,900
because, or Hippos, rather,

727
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,900
because Hippo said that

728
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
Dark Souls is a game he feels he can always...

729
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
I'm back. I'm back. I'm back.

730
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
Okay, good.

731
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
I didn't even know you were gone.

732
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Yeah, no one knew.

733
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Alright.

734
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
God damn it.

735
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,900
Hippo was saying how Dark Souls is a game

736
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
he can pick up and play anytime.

737
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,900
He can play it over and over again

738
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,900
and keep playing it.

739
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,900
I actually don't really like playing Dark Souls.

740
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
You still haven't beaten it, right?

741
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Yeah, I've never beaten it.

742
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
I've played up through Ornstein and Smo.

743
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,900
But I like it more because

744
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,900
I like watching it and I like thinking about it,

745
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
and I find it so...

746
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
Which is so you. It's so you.

747
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,900
I find it so naturally pleasing

748
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,900
because I love the way the controls are,

749
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
the way that the game feels,

750
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,900
that it's a game about running up to an enemy

751
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,900
and timing your attacks right

752
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,900
and dodging, and that even though it's an RPG,

753
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,900
it completely plays like an action game.

754
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,900
It's sort of the best of both worlds.

755
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,900
I love that every environment is so different,

756
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,900
and yet it all feels right together.

757
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Dark Souls is a game where there's a lava level

758
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,900
and there's an ice cave type place.

759
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
There's this and that.

760
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Highly original level designs.

761
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Right. They're all these different stuff

762
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
that you usually see in games,

763
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,900
but they all flow together so logically

764
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,900
that you don't really question it that much,

765
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
even though it would be weird

766
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
for some of those things to exist in the same place.

767
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
It doesn't even make sense, like,

768
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Ash Lake where is that, but it's not important.

769
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
But that's what's even cool.

770
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Ash Lake is my favorite.

771
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Yeah, it's the best.

772
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Ash Lake for me is like...

773
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
I've always said it's like the keystone

774
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
for what I appreciate about Dark Souls,

775
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,900
which is that...

776
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
And the fact that it's hidden behind two invisible walls.

777
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Yeah, the fact that you would never see it

778
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
unless you were really into it.

779
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Either you heard about it from someone

780
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,900
or you were just exploring this game

781
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
down to the fucking teeth.

782
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,900
And it's this magical, ethereal, strange world

783
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,900
that seems to be underneath the world.

784
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,900
It's a lake that's underneath the entire world somehow.

785
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,900
And you go down there and there's two fucking hydras,

786
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,900
and then this ancient dragon king who doesn't say anything

787
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
and he just gives you a dragon head

788
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
and now you can breathe fire.

789
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,900
It's insanity.

790
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,900
But that's the most magical feeling place in the game.

791
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
Totally.

792
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I don't think...

793
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,900
For me, the coolest things about games,

794
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,900
these are the things I value the absolute most,

795
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,900
are the cathartic feeling of movement.

796
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Just feeling good controlling your character

797
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,900
and having a world that I'm interested in.

798
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Pretty much world building and catharsis.

799
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,900
Those are the two biggest things.

800
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,900
So I'm a huge fan of Ocarina of Time.

801
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
It's actually my second favorite game

802
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,900
because in comparison to all of the other Zelda games,

803
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,900
I feel like this is something that no one talks about enough

804
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
when they talk about Zelda.

805
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,900
They all have totally different controls.

806
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,900
Even though they're all the same basic controls,

807
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,900
the way Link moves changes a lot.

808
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,900
If you play, say, Twilight Princess or the Wind Waker,

809
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Link kind of controls a motorcycle where you hold forward

810
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,900
and you steer him left and right

811
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,900
and he moves in a weird circular fashion.

812
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Whereas in Ocarina of Time, he moves more like a 2D character.

813
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,900
He moves exactly as much as you press the control stick.

814
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
When you let go, he stops.

815
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,900
When you touch to the side, he turns to the side.

816
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,900
You just have a more direct control.

817
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,900
I could see thinking it feels a little stiff, maybe,

818
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
but I don't know.

819
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,900
I always feel like every step has weight to it.

820
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Everything Link does in that game has a certain weight to it.

821
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,900
The way controlling him feels is so good

822
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,900
that there was a point when I was playing that game

823
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,900
and I was taking song requests

824
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,900
and people were telling me songs to sing.

825
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I was doing side flips and back flips

826
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,900
in Kakariko Village for 45 minutes.

827
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
I was doing back flips and side flips.

828
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,900
Was it a good time?

829
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,900
Yeah, it was great.

830
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,900
You can just flip off of everything.

831
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,900
You can start flipping off of ledges

832
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,900
and watching how he reacts to different elevation changes

833
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,900
and stuff.

834
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,900
It feels so good to watch him flip around in that game.

835
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:30,900
The Wind Waker has almost the same feel,

836
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,900
but the Wind Waker is also...

837
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
You have to get in a boat.

838
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,900
You're on this little island and you can roll around a little bit,

839
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,900
but then you get in a boat and you sail somewhere.

840
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
Being in the boat is cool as an idea,

841
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
but it doesn't feel as good.

842
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,900
In Ocarina of Time,

843
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,900
I could just literally side flip across the whole world

844
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
if I wanted to.

845
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
That's what all the speedruns are,

846
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
because side flipping is the fastest way to travel.

847
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
If you watch a speedrun,

848
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
they'll just side flip through the whole fucking game.

849
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,900
It looks crazy.

850
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,900
The world is very dense and intricate,

851
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,900
and everyone in it has their own story

852
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,900
that they're living out that has nothing to do with you

853
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,900
unless you make yourself a part of it,

854
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,900
which is a great thing about Dark Souls.

855
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,900
All the NPCs have their own game they're playing.

856
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Each of them is the main character of their own story,

857
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,900
and each of them is basically, if you failed,

858
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
this is what you would become.

859
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,900
They're all other heroes from other timelines.

860
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,900
As Sunbro points out,

861
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,900
time is fucked up in Lordran,

862
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,900
and everyone here is from their own game,

863
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,900
but they all fuck up.

864
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
They all die, except Sunbro,

865
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,900
if you keep him alive through the whole game.

866
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,900
I like that.

867
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,900
I like it when the world sort of exists without you,

868
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
and Undertale does a pretty good job of that,

869
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
where it has the characters show up in the bar,

870
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,900
and they continue to have their own dialogue together

871
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,900
and their own things that they're up to,

872
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,900
even though the game is so short

873
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,900
that they can't really get up to a lot.

874
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,900
You don't see a lot of things going on in the world,

875
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,900
but it's nice that they have those things.

876
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
In that sense,

877
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
I definitely think that

878
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,900
all the characters of the game exist

879
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
to make you like them.

880
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,900
Like you said, it might not have been as much time as would be ideal,

881
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,900
but their function...

882
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,900
Are you back to talking about Undertale now?

883
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,900
Briefly, yes.

884
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,900
It's just that the characters, to me,

885
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
I like them all,

886
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
but they really are simply a tool

887
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
to attach you to the world

888
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,900
to put you through the exercise

889
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,900
of playing Undertale

890
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
and making the decisions

891
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,900
that you make when you play that game

892
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
based on those feelings,

893
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
and it really is most effective

894
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,900
if you really care about the characters.

895
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,900
And for me, I was totally on board.

896
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
I like every single character there a ton,

897
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
except for Alphas, who's kind of an asshole,

898
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,900
but she's okay.

899
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,900
But you know what? I want to talk for a second,

900
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
just to finish up what you were saying before.

901
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,900
The way you were describing all those things

902
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,900
and the way each of us have talked about

903
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
our favorite games,

904
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,900
I really think shows the kind of person we are

905
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,900
and as a result, why we like

906
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,900
the kind of games we like.

907
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,900
You're describing all these...

908
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,900
your appreciation for the construction of the world

909
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,900
and the way it all feels,

910
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,900
even though you don't really play

911
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
a ton of games, like Dark Souls, if you've never played it,

912
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,900
it's your favorite game,

913
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,900
but you like to step back and appreciate it

914
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,900
as a big piece of art altogether.

915
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,900
And then Ben, like Binding of Isaac,

916
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
is his favorite game,

917
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,900
and Ben likes to just sit down for hours

918
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,900
and just play a game and just get into it,

919
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
like master it.

920
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
He played...

921
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Orbezatben, you played that?

922
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
Oh, a fucking Dungeon Crawlstone soup.

923
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
Yeah, yeah.

924
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,900
It took me a year and a half to beat it.

925
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Congratulations.

926
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,900
And then Gib, I don't know,

927
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,900
Gib seems like he's looking for light-hearted,

928
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,900
fun most of the time when he's playing games.

929
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,900
He plays fucking Dark Souls.

930
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,900
It was his favorite game.

931
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
To kind of goof around.

932
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Is that wrong?

933
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,900
I don't think that is right.

934
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,900
I think he's doing the same thing I'm doing

935
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,900
and just getting immersed in a day-old game.

936
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,900
You don't talk about it that much.

937
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
Yeah, there you go.

938
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,900
I want to kill things in Dark Souls.

939
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,900
And then there's me,

940
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,900
who, more than anything,

941
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
likes to play games where

942
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,900
a hero goes on a journey and achieves self-actualization,

943
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
clearly a projection

944
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,900
of my deep personal insecurities

945
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
and a desire to fulfill them.

946
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
You know, all of these things

947
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
are what make each of our favorite games

948
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,900
and it's completely a projection

949
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,900
of our values

950
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
and the kind of person we are.

951
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,900
I would feel a little guilty

952
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,900
picking Binding of Isaac as a game of all time

953
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
because it's so deficient

954
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
in the story category.

955
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,900
And I do like game stories,

956
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,900
but I don't, yeah,

957
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,900
I guess I just don't feel like there

958
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,900
what I really play games for.

959
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Because I, like,

960
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
with Dark Souls, I can kind of

961
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,900
rest assured that I do think

962
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,900
it's a cool story,

963
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
but I don't really value

964
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,900
the actual narrative that much.

965
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,900
I like that it's so,

966
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
that there's so much going on

967
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,900
and that it sort of feels like it exists without me,

968
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
but the actual specifics

969
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
of who the characters are

970
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,900
and what they mean,

971
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,900
the lore has never really grabbed me that much.

972
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,900
And because of that, it's fun.

973
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
There's no way that you'd love

974
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,900
a game like Undertale as much as someone like me.

975
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,900
Just because our priorities are so different

976
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,900
in that sense.

977
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,900
Or like Jesse, I guess.

978
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
My little brother Shade, who's a big fan of both Dark Souls

979
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,900
and Undertale, he gets deep into

980
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,900
lore and deep into knowing

981
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
the background info.

982
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,900
I like the lore a lot in Dark Souls, that's probably my favorite thing.

983
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,900
He really only started getting into

984
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,900
Undertale once he started

985
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
learning all the crazy

986
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,900
background stuff.

987
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,900
Did he get into it after playing it or to

988
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
start to play?

989
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,900
He played through it.

990
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
He did the pacifist run, he was doing the genocide run.

991
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,900
But then he just started coming up to me

992
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,900
every day with all these new facts

993
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
he'd learned about the game.

994
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,900
And telling me all this stuff that he'd heard.

995
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Because I didn't watch anything

996
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,900
of the game after beating it.

997
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,900
I just kind of played through and was done.

998
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,900
But then I kept hearing new things about it from other people.

999
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
And all of it is very cool

1000
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
to know that it's all there.

1001
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
That kind of stuff doesn't make me

1002
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
love the game more.

1003
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,900
I'm just like, oh, that's really neat.

1004
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,900
It's cool that it's there.

1005
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,900
It itself is not like anything mind-blowing.

1006
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,900
The only thing about the Dark Souls

1007
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,900
story that I think really stands out to me

1008
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,900
is great is the whole fire metaphor.

1009
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,900
And everything

1010
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,900
that they try to do with that.

1011
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,900
Yeah, that was very effective.

1012
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
Like, Ocarina of Time, I could not give a

1013
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
single fuck about the narrative of that game.

1014
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Even though when I was a kid it was the

1015
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,900
greatest narrative I'd ever seen before

1016
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,900
in my life.

1017
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,900
When I was a kid, growing up...

1018
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
You don't think that now just have not explored?

1019
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,900
Growing up, Ocarina of Time was my

1020
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900
favorite game purely from having

1021
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,900
watched my cousin play it and having never

1022
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,900
seen a game with a story before.

1023
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,900
And I literally never

1024
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
heard of a game having a story.

1025
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
What, like 1998?

1026
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,900
It was probably 99 or 2000

1027
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
when I watched him play through it.

1028
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,900
You got to play more Final Fantasy past Digi.

1029
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,900
My dad was an N64. I'd never

1030
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,900
seen any other console.

1031
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
Uh, Conker's Bad Fur Day. Greatest story ever told.

1032
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Yeah, and I found out about that one later

1033
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,900
and I always wanted to know the story

1034
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,900
because the story seemed really interesting.

1035
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,900
I'm making that up. I've never even played it.

1036
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,900
Oh, it's got a phenomenal...

1037
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,900
I don't know about the story, but the

1038
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,900
dialogue and the voice acting

1039
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,900
is fucking incredible in that game.

1040
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Unfortunately, I don't like playing the game at all.

1041
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,900
I think it's boring and shitty, but

1042
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,900
the dialogue is great.

1043
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Like Banjo?

1044
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,900
Is it a collectathon like Banjo?

1045
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
It is exactly like Banjo because

1046
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,900
it's not, though, because Banjo-Kazooie

1047
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,900
is more of a platformer

1048
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,900
that's more skill-based.

1049
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
It has platforming challenges.

1050
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,900
Conker feels, to me,

1051
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,900
more like an adventure game.

1052
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
It's sort of like Psychonauts

1053
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,900
where every level is just something

1054
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,900
different and I think that's the biggest

1055
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,900
problem, is that it constantly...

1056
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,900
every single place you go has a new mechanic

1057
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,900
for you to learn, but none of them are like

1058
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,900
fun, you know?

1059
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Oh, and speaking of best game ever, Psychonauts

1060
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,900
too, guys, go give your money to Tim Schaefer,

1061
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,900
the whole fucking hack himself,

1062
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,900
3 million, and it'll make Psychonauts

1063
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
too. Fuck you, Tim Schaefer.

1064
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,900
I think Psychonauts is super overrated.

1065
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,900
It's like that weird underrated, overrated sort of game.

1066
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Well, the story and story loves it so much.

1067
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,900
But the actually playing

1068
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,900
the game is just frustrating as fuck,

1069
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,900
especially the last level is the worst thing

1070
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
I've ever played before.

1071
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,900
And remember that time in that game where you're

1072
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,900
like talking with the girl and you're like,

1073
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,900
oh, we gotta come up with a plan. And she's like,

1074
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
yeah, we gotta do something. Oh, we gotta go save everyone.

1075
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,900
We should make out.

1076
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,900
That was probably the funniest thing

1077
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
in any game I've ever played.

1078
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,900
My favorite part is when you find the two

1079
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,900
like quiet kids sitting up on the roof.

1080
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1081
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
It's not in the story. It's not a cutscene.

1082
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
It's just at some point you're walking around.

1083
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,900
You can go up on a roof and like the two

1084
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,900
like nice, quiet, like I think maybe

1085
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
they're implied to be religious kids.

1086
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,900
The boy and the girl, they're sitting up there.

1087
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,900
And if you listen to them, they're just like,

1088
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,900
look at all the people down there.

1089
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,900
They look like tiny little ants.

1090
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,900
And the other one's like, they are ants.

1091
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,900
Worthless little ants.

1092
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,900
And if you hit them,

1093
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
they like respond to it,

1094
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,900
but in a real like, they try to be nice

1095
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,900
about it. You can tell they're really hurt

1096
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
emotionally.

1097
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
By the way, like you use this way,

1098
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,900
you do a psychic punch on them and one of them's like,

1099
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,900
hey, look who's still punching.

1100
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,900
And then your character's like,

1101
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,900
and your character's like, oh God,

1102
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,900
what have I done?

1103
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,900
You know, I told that kissing story once

1104
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,900
when me and my friends were in line for lunch

1105
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,900
in college somewhere.

1106
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
And like as I got to the end and just yelled at like,

1107
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
we should make out this guy behind me in line.

1108
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,900
You're just like, dude, you do that too?

1109
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,900
Like, yeah, I just,

1110
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,900
if you go up to, if you're in a party

1111
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,900
and you go up to enough girls and you say that,

1112
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,900
what I was gonna make out with you?

1113
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
Yeah, that guy was alpha as fuck.

1114
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,900
My role model.

1115
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
It led you to some important life lessons.

1116
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,900
Some important game.

1117
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,900
Anyways, you know, there's

1118
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,900
there's only ever for me been one

1119
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,900
game that like I legitimately

1120
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,900
care about the story and that's

1121
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
the Mass Effect.

1122
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Mass Effect 1 and 2.

1123
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Is that just because it did so much

1124
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,900
to give the characters and make them

1125
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,900
like fleshed out people? Yeah, it's the only game

1126
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,900
I've played where like, I just

1127
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,900
honest to God found it

1128
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,900
really interesting.

1129
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
Like the characters in the world

1130
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,900
are so fleshed out

1131
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,900
and just like

1132
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,900
it's a game that

1133
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,900
has like any

1134
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,900
story I could name that like

1135
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,900
like any like HBO drama or anything

1136
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,900
like that that's considered to be like a great

1137
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
narrative or something.

1138
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
It's as good as that.

1139
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Like the story is legitimately as good

1140
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,900
as any story I've ever heard before.

1141
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Yeah, Commander Shepherd, I'm

1142
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,900
the Asari lady. Nice to meet you.

1143
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,900
I'm super attracted to you.

1144
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
I love you more than anyone I've ever known

1145
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
in my entire life. You've completely

1146
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,900
opened me up and let's

1147
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,900
immediately have sex right now.

1148
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,900
10 out of 10 writing, dude. Sounds like a

1149
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,900
10 out of 10 writing. I will say

1150
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
that not

1151
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,900
not everything in Mass Effect is

1152
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
equally interesting.

1153
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,900
My favorite in the trilogy is the second

1154
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,900
game and there are some of the characters

1155
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
you meet like late into the game

1156
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
are just kind of whatever who cares.

1157
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Yeah. But like

1158
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
you know, I think Garrus is a

1159
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
fantastic character. His whole arc is great.

1160
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
Tali's pretty

1161
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,900
is a really fun character. I have a deep affection

1162
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,900
for the quarry and papal.

1163
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,900
Rex is great, you know, throughout

1164
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,900
all the games and like the entire

1165
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,900
everything that has to do

1166
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,900
with the Genophage

1167
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
and the fucking

1168
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,900
what are they called?

1169
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,900
Not a sorry.

1170
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
The other guys. Rex's race.

1171
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,900
The Krogans. Everything that has to do with

1172
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
the Krogans and the Genophage

1173
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,900
and Mordyn Solis is like

1174
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
the most interesting shit ever.

1175
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
Mordyn especially is my favorite character

1176
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,900
in like any game because

1177
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
he's in the second game. You'll meet him

1178
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
pretty early on and he's a doctor

1179
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,900
who he literally

1180
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,900
created the Genophage and committed the

1181
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,900
genocide of killing all of the Krogans

1182
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
and he joins your team

1183
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,900
and that's going to cause some

1184
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,900
tension. The thing about it is though

1185
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,900
that he did it because

1186
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,900
he was trying to save the galaxy.

1187
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,900
Just like when we nuked Hiroshima

1188
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,900
and Nagasaki. To him it was like

1189
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,900
deciding to choose

1190
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,900
the needs of the many over the needs of the few

1191
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,900
but then the long term consequences

1192
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,900
of it make it questionable

1193
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,900
whether it really was better

1194
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,900
or worse.

1195
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
He sort of has to grapple with

1196
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,900
deciding whether or not he

1197
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,900
still feels that way and then has

1198
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,900
a fantastic payoff in the third game.

1199
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,900
It's by far the best thing about the third game

1200
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,900
is the end of Mordyn and

1201
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,900
the Krogans story.

1202
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,900
I've heard.

1203
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,900
It's just legit fascinating and the game

1204
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,900
just has so much information about everything

1205
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
because not only

1206
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
do you go to planets and you can like read

1207
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,900
little, you'll find text logs in places

1208
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,900
and learn little details here and there

1209
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,900
but then the game has like

1210
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
an insanely huge codec

1211
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,900
that you can read through and it's like

1212
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,900
a lot of it's voiced so you'll have like

1213
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,900
a narrator telling you like audio books

1214
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,900
about the world.

1215
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,900
Another game that has a massive

1216
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,900
log like that

1217
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,900
is Final Fantasy 13

1218
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
and all the seasons.

1219
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Why is it that it's so much more enjoyable

1220
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
to read through the codecs of Mass Effect

1221
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
than Final Fantasy 13?

1222
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,900
Probably because the...

1223
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,900
I haven't played 13 but I am playing

1224
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,900
Lightning Returns and I have been

1225
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,900
reading all the codecs in that

1226
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,900
and having a great time with it.

1227
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,900
Well that blows me away that you actually read through them all

1228
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
because man I hated reading them

1229
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,900
that Lightning Returns

1230
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,900
is batshit insane.

1231
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,900
Like the story is the craziest

1232
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
thing that I've ever heard of

1233
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,900
because it takes place in a world

1234
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
where everyone has become immortal

1235
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
and no one new has been born in

1236
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
500 years and everyone who is still alive

1237
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,900
has been alive for 500 years

1238
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,900
and Lightning has become...

1239
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,900
great. That sounds like a fucking

1240
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,900
crazy fantasy world to me.

1241
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,900
I would love to live in that world.

1242
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,900
It's fucking insane and Lightning is now

1243
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
like an angel working for God

1244
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,900
trying to save everyone's souls

1245
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,900
because the rapture is about to happen

1246
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
and reset the world.

1247
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
I wish that was an original game and did not

1248
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,900
involve Lightning.

1249
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,900
Did you the way you're describing

1250
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Final Fantasy 13.2 Lightning Returns to me

1251
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,900
sounds awesome.

1252
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,900
It's the third one, not the second one.

1253
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,900
The thing is, the thing about Lightning Returns

1254
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
I mean the characters themselves

1255
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
are like planks of wood.

1256
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
Like they're not

1257
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
interesting characters but the world

1258
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,900
is just so insane

1259
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
that I'm like fascinated

1260
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
with it and I keep learning new things

1261
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
and there's like there's so many like gods

1262
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,900
and random bits of

1263
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,900
like lore that

1264
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,900
have nothing to do with anything and I'm like

1265
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
what the fuck is this like I'm not

1266
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,900
necessarily saying that it's like a great story

1267
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,900
but it's just fascinating that a game

1268
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,900
is like this and to me it's sort of

1269
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,900
like how every RPG kind of

1270
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,900
ends with you like killing God

1271
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,900
and it feels like this game is what happens

1272
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
like if you had already killed God

1273
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,900
and then the world got really weird afterwards.

1274
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,900
Kind of like the end of God of War 3

1275
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,900
I guess. Yeah a little bit.

1276
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,900
I always thought that was interesting and they just don't describe

1277
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,900
like the world is fucked but

1278
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,900
they just that's the end. Yeah he just kind of ruins

1279
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,900
everything and like yeah and

1280
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,900
you know most of these RPGs

1281
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,900
they don't really usually have much

1282
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,900
of a day-new-mon. They don't really show you

1283
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,900
what happened after you

1284
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,900
changed the entire nature

1285
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,900
of reality and like this

1286
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:52,900
kind of... You just get

1287
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,900
all your party members, stand them on the bow

1288
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,900
of their airship and have them all look up

1289
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
at the sky as like the

1290
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,900
rubble of their past world

1291
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,900
and then have the main character jump off and disappear

1292
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
and not be heard of again. Well nobody cares

1293
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,900
about like how

1294
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,900
lock, marry cellies

1295
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
and settles down to like become

1296
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,900
you know and it started venturing

1297
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,900
like mercenary business. Nobody

1298
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,900
gives a shit. We just know that they won

1299
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,900
and then they can just do whatever. You can just fill it in.

1300
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,900
It's really hilarious because

1301
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,900
on the one hand I feel like

1302
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,900
the reason they can get away with

1303
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,900
doing this story in Lightning Returns

1304
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,900
is that it's a sequel to a popular

1305
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,900
game so people will buy it.

1306
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900
But I think it's

1307
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,900
a terrible sequel because

1308
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,900
it takes place 500 years later and everyone's

1309
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
totally different now because they've aged

1310
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,900
500 years. Not to mention

1311
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,900
the fact that 13.2 ends on a huge

1312
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,900
cliffhanger and to wait

1313
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,900
like 500 years is just the worst

1314
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
fucking thing you could possibly do.

1315
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,900
I'm still mad. If it wasn't

1316
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,900
like 50 hours long

1317
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
I'd be tempted to play

1318
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,900
Final Fantasy 13 and the sequels

1319
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,900
just to see because sometimes

1320
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,900
I end up liking things that nobody else like

1321
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,900
and I would be curious if I could find anything

1322
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,900
to love about it. Here's the thing, Lightning Returns

1323
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,900
is a lot more well-liked

1324
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,900
by critics in the first two.

1325
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,900
I don't know about if fans like it

1326
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,900
but critics in general were like

1327
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
this game is actually kind of fun to play

1328
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,900
and it's... I'm not

1329
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,900
far into it but it seems

1330
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,900
like it's very short

1331
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
but it also seems like you can

1332
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,900
fuck up so badly so early on

1333
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,900
that you will need to play it twice. This is a game

1334
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,900
you can fail. It takes place

1335
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,900
over the course of 13 days

1336
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,900
and you basically have to

1337
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,900
save enough souls by the end of 13 days

1338
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,900
by doing like... you have to get through

1339
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,900
all the main missions and then you can do a certain

1340
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,900
number of side missions if you want to get like a perfect

1341
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,900
run but if you

1342
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
fuck up and you don't do the missions in time

1343
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,900
then you just lose and you get a game over

1344
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,900
but you're allowed to do like

1345
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,900
a new game plus and like even if you

1346
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,900
fail and sort of keep all your weapons

1347
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,900
so I don't feel too bad about the idea

1348
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
that I'm probably gonna fail because I fucked up

1349
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,900
so bad on day one that I feel like

1350
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
I'm already set back forever

1351
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,900
and it's a little bit confusing because the game

1352
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,900
like as if

1353
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,900
in response to the previous games is like

1354
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,900
totally open like you just go

1355
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,900
wherever you want and do whatever you want

1356
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,900
to an extent and so

1357
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,900
like I got lost. This is obviously a reaction

1358
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,900
to the whole...

1359
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,900
I kind of got lost trying to find my way around

1360
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,900
and like figure out where everything is

1361
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,900
and I felt like oh shit I don't really like

1362
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,900
I actually I kind of don't like the

1363
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,900
mechanic of the time thing because I feel like I really

1364
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,900
wanted to get engrossed in this world

1365
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
and instead I'm running around like crazy

1366
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,900
you know it's a

1367
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,900
it's a lot like Dead Rising where you

1368
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,900
it's so strict about

1369
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,900
being on time that you

1370
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
like it's almost at odds with what you actually want

1371
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,900
to do in Dead Rising which is to just go

1372
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,900
fucking kill zombies with weird

1373
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,900
you know weapons and shit. Yeah I've heard

1374
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,900
mixed things about the Dead Rising

1375
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,900
I think Dead Rising is a

1376
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,900
fantastic game after watching them play it

1377
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
on Game Grumps and being reminded of it

1378
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,900
I think it's fucking awesome.

1379
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
If I if I might bring this conversation

1380
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
back to the topic of the best

1381
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,900
sure sure let let me

1382
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,900
I'll just I'll just start a whole new thing

1383
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,900
Okay. My pet peeve

1384
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,900
is people who think

1385
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,900
that a best game

1386
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,900
and a favorite game should be two

1387
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,900
different things. Those people deserve to be firebombed.

1388
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,900
I think they should all be consigned to the flames.

1389
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,900
I think they can be two different things.

1390
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
No you're different

1391
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,900
from your own face are you recording Jesse?

1392
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,900
I am recording.

1393
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
What the fuck? Jesse's here?

1394
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,900
I showed up. Okay.

1395
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,900
The count of three say Misty. One, two, three

1396
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,900
Misty. Misty. Misty.

1397
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,900
Okay good.

1398
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,900
No okay Jesse defend your position.

1399
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
Why is it okay to separate them?

1400
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,900
Well okay.

1401
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,900
I wouldn't call Crazy Taxi the best game ever made.

1402
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,900
Well that's just objectively wrong.

1403
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,900
Okay. But I would totally call it my favorite

1404
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,900
game ever made.

1405
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,900
Why isn't it the best? Isn't the game's function

1406
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,900
to give you enjoyment? Wait I have a question Jesse.

1407
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Yeah. Would you say it's exclusively

1408
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,900
your favorite game?

1409
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,900
No. I have like five

1410
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,900
favorite games ever made.

1411
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,900
Is one of those your also your pick for their

1412
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,900
best game?

1413
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,900
I guess. I don't fucking know.

1414
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,900
Is it Lion King? Yes.

1415
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Lion King for Sega Genesis

1416
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
is the best game ever made

1417
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,900
objectively. No.

1418
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
And that's the end of the conversation.

1419
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,900
The monkeys cost at all

1420
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,900
of its points.

1421
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,900
But it's got the hippos.

1422
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,900
Right? Hippocrates.

1423
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,900
It's your favorite game.

1424
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,900
I'm with you Ben.

1425
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,900
I hate when people try to like

1426
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
to make...

1427
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,900
I hate any best game ever list

1428
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,900
that goes by impact

1429
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,900
and then has like games that aren't even

1430
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,900
good anymore on the list.

1431
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,900
Like oh this year

1432
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,900
I played

1433
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,900
down well for five hundred hours

1434
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,900
and fucking loved every second of it.

1435
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
On the other hand

1436
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,900
I thought Undertale was a pretentious piece of shit

1437
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,900
but you know everyone likes Undertale

1438
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,900
and it made such a good thing

1439
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,900
for the indie scene that I'm going to name it

1440
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,900
the best game of the year. Fuck that.

1441
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,900
I'm glad you guys are talking about this now

1442
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,900
because I sort of mentioned before

1443
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
I'm going to sound like a hypocrite now

1444
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
but I really do take

1445
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
impact on the world

1446
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,900
into my examination

1447
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,900
of what I think is the best game ever.

1448
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Well that's wrong. That's wrong of you.

1449
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,900
What I value in a game is

1450
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,900
the influence it's going to have

1451
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
not only on just me but on everyone.

1452
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
Bullshit. Like I really love Undertale

1453
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,900
but I think that it has

1454
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,900
more implications. I like Undertale

1455
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,900
because I see it. That doesn't make it a better game.

1456
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,900
Undertale is a quiz

1457
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,900
that I want everyone to take to learn about themselves.

1458
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,900
That doesn't make the game any better than it is.

1459
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
It does. What?

1460
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,900
Do you think that Undertale is

1461
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,900
the best game ever

1462
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,900
because of its impact

1463
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,900
or because of your value

1464
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
of its impact?

1465
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,900
Definitely because of my value.

1466
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,900
If you didn't give a fuck about Undertale

1467
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
but it had a huge amount of impact

1468
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,900
would you still call it the best game ever?

1469
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Definitely not. I would certainly say that.

1470
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,900
So it is ultimately

1471
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
just you saying that it's the game you like the most

1472
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,900
and therefore it's the favorite.

1473
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,900
The reason it's the game you like the most

1474
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,900
is because it has impact.

1475
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
I guess that just happens to be my

1476
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,900
what I value.

1477
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,900
What I've been talking a lot is that I feel

1478
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,900
so weakly about this whole subject.

1479
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,900
I just don't care.

1480
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,900
Get out of my podcast!

1481
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,900
It is kind of totally stupid and pointless.

1482
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Well, we're fair enough.

1483
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,900
Okay, yes.

1484
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
Games are fun. I like them.

1485
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,900
I agree.

1486
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,900
I said Binding of Isaac before.

1487
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,900
I'm not super committed to that choice.

1488
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,900
I really wouldn't say that I have a strong pick

1489
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,900
for a best game ever.

1490
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
Hey guys, go make a Procrastinator's Wiki

1491
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,900
because this is Binding of Isaac.

1492
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,900
It's official.

1493
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,900
Whatever.

1494
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
If I'm picking one,

1495
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,900
I honestly don't see how you can defend

1496
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,900
any other position than mine

1497
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,900
because there's no objective standard

1498
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,900
for how good something is.

1499
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,900
Therefore, the only metric

1500
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,900
of how good it is is how much you like it.

1501
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,900
Therefore, your favorite and the best

1502
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
should be synonymous.

1503
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,900
I agree.

1504
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,900
I think that the best game of 2015

1505
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,900
was Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax.

1506
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,900
Fine.

1507
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
Is Mage here?

1508
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,900
Yes, Mage is in the call.

1509
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Are you recording? Are you recording your audio?

1510
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,900
Mage, we can barely hear you.

1511
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,900
Wait, you are recording your audio, right?

1512
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,900
Well, you gotta record your audio.

1513
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,900
It's gonna be all fucked up.

1514
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,900
Don't speak until you're recording your audio.

1515
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,900
It sounds like you're talking into a headset

1516
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,900
that's on the opposite end of the room.

1517
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
Guys, it's gonna be blank sounds.

1518
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:38,900
Somebody say something.

1519
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,900
What's...

1520
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,900
Well, I don't know what the hippo was trying to say earlier.

1521
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,900
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1522
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,900
What do you say something?

1523
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
Was I...

1524
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
You got mad at me for cutting you off.

1525
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,900
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1526
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,900
Oh, I forgot.

1527
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
Okay.

1528
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,900
You're recording, right?

1529
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,900
You're recording?

1530
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Ah, you got it. You're recording right now.

1531
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,900
You're recording? Okay, let's sync up.

1532
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,900
Okay. On the count of three, say,

1533
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,900
Misty's my favorite Pokemon trainer.

1534
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,900
I like red, blue, the best is the best game.

1535
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,900
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

1536
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,900
Misty's my favorite Pokemon trainer.

1537
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,900
Fuck you, man, you piece of shit.

1538
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Okay, go on, Gib.

1539
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,900
Hippo.

1540
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,900
I have no idea.

1541
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,900
What I'm doing here...

1542
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Mage, what is your opinion on the best game ever?

1543
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,900
Yeah, what's your favorite game?

1544
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
Undertale?

1545
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,900
Yeah, yeah, what do you think is the best game ever?

1546
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,900
And is it the same as your favorite game?

1547
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,900
Yeah, yeah.

1548
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,900
I mean, I don't

1549
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,900
particularly believe in the best game ever,

1550
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,900
what I'm calling, but

1551
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,900
my favorite game is definitely Undertale.

1552
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,900
And I...

1553
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:48,900
Really? Yes.

1554
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,900
Shock. Would you say of all time?

1555
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,900
Fair enough. Yeah, of all time.

1556
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,900
Of all time, would you say?

1557
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,900
At this moment in time, yes.

1558
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,900
Okay, okay.

1559
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,900
I think I have one favorite game of all time,

1560
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,900
because it's going to change.

1561
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,900
Yeah, but you know, all of these

1562
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,900
questions are in the context of the time.

1563
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,900
The phrase of all time is a weird

1564
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,900
phrase, because it's

1565
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,900
never of all time.

1566
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,900
That's the thing.

1567
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
I mean, it means up to now.

1568
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,900
It means right now.

1569
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,900
That's the phrase we should adopt.

1570
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Instead of saying my favorite of all time,

1571
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
we should be saying my favorite now, currently.

1572
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
That doesn't sound as impressive.

1573
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,900
That's the whole point.

1574
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,900
Because I feel like of all time...

1575
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,900
Well, I feel like of all time implies

1576
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,900
and I think this is how people think

1577
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,900
of it and this is why people sometimes

1578
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,900
vote for those older games that they don't care about anymore

1579
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,900
is that they think of it in terms of

1580
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,900
what game they liked the longest.

1581
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,900
Which is a perfectly valid way

1582
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
to like a game. To be honest,

1583
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,900
that's why I'm picking Isaac. I haven't played

1584
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,900
the new Isaac, but I loved

1585
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,900
it so much and I played it for so long

1586
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,900
and I still think it's a great

1587
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,900
and amazing game.

1588
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,900
Like right now I care way more about

1589
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,900
Undertale than about Binding of Isaac

1590
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,900
and yet I'm not comfortable picking Undertale

1591
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,900
just because it's so new.

1592
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,900
I'm glad you brought this up. I wanted to talk about this too.

1593
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,900
And it seems like...

1594
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,900
I think this shows kind of maybe

1595
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,900
the context of the gaming industry

1596
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,900
or maybe just us as consumers of it

1597
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,900
with like YouTube and Let's Plays and all the stuff now.

1598
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,900
So like the previous winners of the poll

1599
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,900
were Final Fantasy 7 and Ocarina of Time,

1600
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,900
which are really old games that have

1601
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,900
their like legends.

1602
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,900
I was here talking about the game path, I think.

1603
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,900
Yeah, the concept of a best game ever and what it means.

1604
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,900
So those games won.

1605
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,900
That's kind of what inspired the discussion.

1606
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
Those games won kind of based on their

1607
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
legacy status

1608
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,900
and I think that maybe it had something to do

1609
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,900
with the way that games were coming out

1610
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,900
and the way people appreciate games.

1611
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,900
But these days, like what are the most

1612
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,900
popular games in the world? Like League of Legends?

1613
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,900
Stuff that's like

1614
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,900
quickly consumable

1615
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,900
and can be like

1616
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,900
completed rapidly

1617
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,900
and is like mass consumable.

1618
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,900
And I wonder if it

1619
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,900
doesn't say that as a culture of people

1620
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,900
playing games, we have more

1621
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,900
interest in something like Undertale

1622
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,900
that's super new and might

1623
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,900
not even last very long.

1624
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
But our focus is

1625
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,900
attuned to these sort of

1626
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,900
you know like spurts of popularity

1627
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,900
less so than it is to the big

1628
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,900
context of all the games we've

1629
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,900
ever played. Our focus is shifting

1630
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,900
I'm wondering.

1631
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,900
It's an interesting point.

1632
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,900
I think

1633
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,900
a big part, now that you've made me think

1634
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,900
about it, I think a big part of the reason

1635
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,900
that we're going to see a shift away from

1636
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,900
Zelda and Final Fantasy winning everything

1637
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,900
forever is that

1638
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,900
right now

1639
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,900
it's happening and in five years

1640
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,900
it will be the case that

1641
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,900
gamers are not mostly

1642
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
in their late 20s anymore.

1643
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
That's true. Because the thing is

1644
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,900
there's a very clear bias

1645
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,900
towards the year 1997

1646
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,900
here.

1647
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,900
A time

1648
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,900
period when

1649
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,900
the majority of

1650
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,900
I've seen enough GameFAQs polls to

1651
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,900
know the general age of

1652
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,900
the site because they'll ask you how old you are

1653
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,900
and things like that. Right, around our age

1654
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,900
it's like the median

1655
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,900
age of the website.

1656
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,900
And it's a lot of people

1657
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,900
who are in their late 20s

1658
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
who played these games and they were young

1659
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,900
and the reason that I know that has to be the case

1660
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,900
because on the one hand I do think

1661
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,900
that Ocarina of Time and Final Fantasy 7

1662
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,900
hold up extremely well

1663
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,900
and that both of them are games that can compete

1664
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,900
with all the modern games right now

1665
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,900
and the sort of

1666
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,900
oldest games that still

1667
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,900
get to the top of the list are

1668
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,900
Super Nintendo games.

1669
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Super Metroid

1670
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,900
and Chrono Trigger

1671
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,900
and Mario RPG and A Link to the Past

1672
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,900
but they're all games from the 90s

1673
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,900
and like you never see

1674
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,900
NES games getting in here

1675
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,900
and if you were trying to make the

1676
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,900
the like

1677
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,900
if you were trying to say that these games were legacy games

1678
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,900
that it was just because of how influential it was

1679
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,900
we would have

1680
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,900
NES games, we would have those old

1681
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
games and there's people from that era

1682
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,900
who still legitimately feel

1683
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,900
as strongly towards those games as we do

1684
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,900
towards Ocarina of Time

1685
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,900
like how come Mario 1 isn't on the pole

1686
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,900
but don't you think

1687
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,900
that it's gonna

1688
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,900
nobody says

1689
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,900
that the best movie ever made

1690
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,900
is like anything made in the last decade

1691
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,900
everyone always says you know Citizen Kane

1692
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,900
that really depends on who you ask though

1693
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,900
okay okay

1694
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,900
but I'm talking majority, I'm talking cultural consensus

1695
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,900
on the best movie ever

1696
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
is definitely old movies

1697
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,900
there's this great article

1698
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,900
that I'd love to dig up

1699
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,900
or something for this but like

1700
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,900
there's a huge

1701
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,900
identity crisis when it comes to video games

1702
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,900
where people don't look back

1703
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,900
people don't play

1704
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,900
this article

1705
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,900
it was written by a guy who was teaching a game design

1706
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,900
class and he asked

1707
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,900
everyone in the class to raise their hand

1708
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,900
if they're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series

1709
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,900
and like

1710
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
a majority of the class raises their hands

1711
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
right and then he asks them

1712
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,900
like how many have played Skyrim

1713
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,900
and like most of them have their hands up

1714
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,900
and then he asks like how many of you have played Oblivion

1715
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,900
and like more than half of them lower their hands

1716
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,900
and then he asks how many have played Morrowind

1717
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,900
and he gets down to like two people

1718
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,900
and he asks how many of you have played

1719
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:22,900
Daggerfall and it's nobody

1720
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
and like what a fucking hipster

1721
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,900
well that's just a shameful degradation of the time

1722
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,900
right I'm so glad you brought this up Digi

1723
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,900
cause it really reminds me of

1724
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,900
the whole conceit behind

1725
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,900
the remake of Final Fantasy 7

1726
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,900
and the question is

1727
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,900
why is it being made from an artistic perspective

1728
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,900
there is no reason

1729
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,900
the game is fine because it'll sell

1730
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,900
and people don't want to look back at the old one

1731
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,900
there is absolutely nothing preventing

1732
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,900
anyone from playing that game

1733
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,900
they just want to you know make it again

1734
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,900
so they can sell it again

1735
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,900
and you know

1736
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,900
I think the reason that some of the

1737
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,900
like a link to the past and Ocarina of Time

1738
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,900
specifically are the

1739
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,900
like the older Zelda's that always succeed

1740
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,900
but like personally

1741
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,900
you know I've played all the old Zelda's

1742
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,900
just two years ago

1743
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,900
and I liked the first game

1744
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,900
more than a link to the past

1745
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,900
I thought it had like more

1746
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,900
interesting ideas it had more interesting mechanics

1747
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
and I think there's a huge contingent

1748
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,900
of people who just think

1749
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,900
it's old and they don't

1750
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,900
want to play it cause it's old

1751
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,900
I'll be honest that's why I haven't played it yet

1752
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,900
right people look at the first game

1753
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,900
and they think well isn't a link to the past

1754
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
pretty much the exact same thing except

1755
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
better and the answer is no

1756
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
it doesn't play anything alike

1757
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,900
I think the first game has better controls

1758
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,900
because a link to the past is really

1759
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,900
floaty it has a bad knockback

1760
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,900
when enemies hit you it's really frustrating

1761
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,900
sometimes whereas the first game

1762
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,900
is like whatever you input is exactly

1763
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,900
what happens on screen you know

1764
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,900
exactly how your character moves stuff like that

1765
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,900
the game is completely open-ended

1766
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,900
it never tells you where to go

1767
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,900
it's all about like just exploring this

1768
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,900
world and sort of getting lost in it

1769
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,900
whereas a link to the past is very

1770
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,900
streamlined it tells you exactly

1771
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
where to go next you know

1772
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,900
and you know you use this item

1773
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,900
on this specific dungeon whereas

1774
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,900
in the first game like the items are useful forever

1775
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,900
you always use everything forever

1776
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,900
and like

1777
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,900
it's just it's a different game

1778
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,900
but people don't look at Zelda 1

1779
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,900
they look at the games that they've

1780
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,900
heard of that you know Ocarina of Time

1781
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,900
and a link to the past were so influential that people

1782
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,900
like the people just ignore them

1783
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,900
but like if the people voting in game FAQs

1784
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,900
polls were born

1785
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,900
like 10 years earlier

1786
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,900
like if there were more people

1787
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
from like for instance

1788
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,900
the game grump Danny Sex-Bang

1789
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,900
he's like in his late 30s

1790
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,900
and all the games he likes are NES games

1791
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,900
like every game that he considers

1792
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,900
like a classic that he knows how to play

1793
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
that he's amazing at you know he loves

1794
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,900
Zelda 1 he likes Zelda 2

1795
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,900
you know and he's

1796
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,900
he loves the link to the past as well

1797
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
but like when you see him play the newer games

1798
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
you can tell he doesn't feel as strongly about them

1799
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,900
and it's like if more people

1800
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,900
his age were voting we'd get stuff from the 80s

1801
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,900
when people our age are voting we get stuff from

1802
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,900
the 90s and I think we're entering a period

1803
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,900
now where there's a lot of kids

1804
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
who are voting in game FAQs

1805
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,900
polls who were like my brother

1806
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,900
Shade who is 18 now

1807
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:18,900
he is a legal adult

1808
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
he was born in 1997

1809
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,900
he was born the year Final Fantasy 7

1810
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,900
came out so there was

1811
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,900
never a world for him where Final Fantasy 7

1812
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,900
wasn't an old ass game

1813
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,900
you know or Ocarina of Time

1814
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,900
you know the first Zelda he would have seen

1815
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,900
would have been Twilight Princess

1816
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,900
oh my god I cannot believe that

1817
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,900
I guess the idea

1818
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,900
I mean I guess the idea with games is that because

1819
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,900
there's like there was technological

1820
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,900
improvement happening for a while there

1821
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,900
new entries in the series

1822
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,900
are basically just

1823
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,900
improvements on the previous ones

1824
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,900
even though everyone loves

1825
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,900
Morrowind and everyone hates Oblivion

1826
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,900
you say improvements

1827
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,900
but like

1828
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,900
I made that video about Final Fantasy 7 and the remake

1829
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,900
like the remake is just

1830
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,900
it's not going to have so many

1831
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,900
of the things that I love about

1832
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,900
Final Fantasy 7 like the janky weird animations

1833
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,900
that are only done

1834
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,900
because they couldn't express things the way that

1835
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,900
I'm sure they wanted to but that as a result

1836
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,900
are like one of my favorite things about that game

1837
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,900
there's no way to

1838
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,900
incorporate that sort of thing into the remake

1839
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,900
it's just going to be replaced by

1840
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,900
is really awkward, stilted

1841
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,900
anime dialogue

1842
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,900
I know dude I know

1843
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
that's why I fucking hate voice acting

1844
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,900
I hate voice acting in every sense

1845
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,900
in games it should not be there let me

1846
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,900
read the text because my imagination

1847
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
is so much better than the best

1848
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,900
voice actor you could possibly find

1849
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,900
quick quick note on that

1850
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,900
I understand why everyone

1851
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,900
reads Papyrus' lines

1852
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,900
like snidely whiplash but to me

1853
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,900
in my head he never sounded like that

1854
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,900
and it's really weird

1855
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,900
like I get it I get it he goes

1856
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,900
sounds like an evil laugh

1857
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
he's tall and thin so he has

1858
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,900
a reedy voice I get it but he never

1859
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,900
sounded like that in my head

1860
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,900
he's clearly Skeletor

1861
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,900
no man that's

1862
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,900
that's just not how he sounds to me

1863
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,900
if you watch

1864
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,900
like Skeletor

1865
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,900
literally goes

1866
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,900
he literally does that

1867
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,900
inform Papyrus' character

1868
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,900
those ne'ers were purposely put in there

1869
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,900
I understand

1870
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,900
the logic behind that

1871
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,900
when I watch an undertale

1872
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,900
fan like thing on youtube

1873
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,900
and they're doing any kind of voice

1874
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,900
for him that's not Skeletor I get pissed off

1875
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,900
well I get pissed off but they do do

1876
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,900
Skeletor

1877
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,900
my life is suffering

1878
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,900
he's objectively Skeletor and I'll fight

1879
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,900
I'll fight anyone

1880
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,900
here's here's head canon

1881
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,900
Skeletor burned off the rest of his skin

1882
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,900
and became Papyrus exactly now we know

1883
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,900
there you go

1884
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,900
I forgot the fuck I was gonna say

1885
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,900
I'm talking about Final Fantasy 7 and Legacy

1886
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,900
oh yeah you know the thing Ben

1887
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,900
that you mentioned about like film

1888
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
that people like old films

1889
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,900
but there actually is a sort of

1890
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,900
cutoff people like films from like the

1891
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,900
fifties onwards because

1892
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,900
it is the same with

1893
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,900
technology advanced people don't go back

1894
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,900
like you don't see a lot of

1895
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
unless it's a real film you don't see

1896
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,900
a lot of silent movies on this you might see

1897
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,900
like Metropolis or something

1898
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,900
like if the person is really

1899
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,900
it like you know or that one about going

1900
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,900
to the moon yeah like how come Pong

1901
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,900
never comes up on like best game ever when it

1902
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,900
did it all baby it started

1903
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,900
you know Digi Digi you

1904
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,900
make a good point I guess there is like a cutoff

1905
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,900
in technology whereas like before that

1906
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,900
no one like really considers them watchable

1907
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,900
but then if but that's the funny

1908
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,900
thing though is that it's it those

1909
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
movies aren't worse

1910
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,900
like because if you do know film bus like

1911
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,900
go watch you know every frame of painting

1912
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,900
talk about Buster Keaton's films and like

1913
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,900
all the the technicality of those that

1914
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,900
like hasn't even been topped today

1915
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,900
you know and and yet you don't see them

1916
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,900
on anyone's favorites list you know people

1917
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,900
don't talk about them as much they talk about

1918
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,900
Casablanca and Citizen Kane because

1919
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,900
everyone knows about them and you know

1920
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,900
they're they're famous

1921
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,900
you know people don't talk as much about

1922
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,900
the older movies I mean some critics

1923
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,900
do I mean if you get like Roger Ebert

1924
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,900
he's going to talk about all those old ass

1925
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,900
fucking movies that make a great you know

1926
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,900
he is dead but like he his great

1927
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,900
movies reviews would span the whole

1928
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,900
history of film because he knew the

1929
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,900
medium and he knew that even

1930
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,900
silent movies could do things that

1931
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,900
movies now can't do you know

1932
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,900
I actually watched a bunch

1933
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,900
of metropolis although I was

1934
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:32,900
playing a coheedy camera music

1935
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,900
over it and

1936
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,900
I was really interested in like

1937
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,900
the makeup effects and stuff that are totally

1938
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,900
different from what they would be now because

1939
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,900
like to look right on film they would like

1940
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,900
take on tons of like dark makeup

1941
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,900
under their eyes and stuff and it looks

1942
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,900
really cool and I was like man this

1943
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,900
movie has a look that I would love

1944
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
to see emulated in modern

1945
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,900
technology but like I don't think it has

1946
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,900
been and

1947
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,900
you know so like even those ancient fucking

1948
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,900
movies still have things that are interesting

1949
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,900
that can teach you about film and inspire

1950
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,900
new things and

1951
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,900
games can do the same you know I've

1952
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,900
going back and playing a game like

1953
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,900
Zelda 1 really made me think about like

1954
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,900
man I would love to see the Zelda

1955
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,900
franchise kind of like get back

1956
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,900
to this and then like they released

1957
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,900
the what's it called

1958
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,900
the fucking A Link Between Worlds

1959
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,900
which is interesting

1960
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,900
because it plays more like

1961
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,900
it's a sequel to A Link to the Past

1962
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,900
and they were playing it up like oh you can

1963
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,900
choose whichever order you want to do the dungeons

1964
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,900
and it's like A Link to the Past had that

1965
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,900
in Dark World but this game

1966
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,900
does it much more similarly to the first

1967
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,900
game where it was like you just kind

1968
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,900
of find things on your own and pick up

1969
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,900
whatever weapons you want and use them here

1970
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,900
and there you know it's sort of a hybrid of

1971
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,900
Zelda 1 and A Link to the Past

1972
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,900
like taking the best elements of each

1973
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,900
and sort of hybridizing them and

1974
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,900
it's like cool I don't think a lot

1975
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,900
of people would have even known

1976
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,900
that because they haven't played Zelda 1

1977
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,900
you know but yeah

1978
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,900
I think looking back can be interesting

1979
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,900
and I think that's why so many indie games

1980
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,900
that look back and have like

1981
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,900
you know retro feel but they take

1982
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,900
like retro ideas and put new spins

1983
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,900
on them are so big right now

1984
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,900
because

1985
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,900
you know a lot of people think it's like oh it's nostalgia

1986
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,900
but it's like Shovel Knight's not popular

1987
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,900
because everyone who played Shovel Knight

1988
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,900
had also played Mega Man in Castlevania

1989
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,900
it's popular because it took those

1990
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,900
ideas and did something interesting

1991
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,900
with them you know

1992
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,900
I want to disagree I think that is part of the reason

1993
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,900
why it's popular is because it harkens

1994
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,900
back to those games from the day

1995
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,900
well okay okay but I think that has

1996
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,900
a lot to do with the context of games

1997
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,900
coming out today in the way like

1998
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,900
all these big games are these big like

1999
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,900
3D

2000
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Unreal Engine

2001
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,900
like action adventure shooter games

2002
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,900
that's like when you want to make a game to sell

2003
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,900
like that's what you go to

2004
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,900
if you want to make a big AAA game

2005
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,900
and people are getting kind of bored with it

2006
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,900
and so when someone makes a game that appeals

2007
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,900
to some other aspect

2008
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,900
what's happening with AAA games

2009
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,900
is that they're all homogenizing because

2010
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,900
they have to sell them

2011
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,900
they have to sell so many fucking copies

2012
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,900
that they can't afford not to sell them to literally everyone

2013
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,900
so the game has to appeal to literally

2014
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,900
everyone and then the indie games

2015
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,900
don't have to appeal to basically anybody

2016
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,900
except for like 10 people

2017
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:18,900
except the one making it basically

2018
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,900
okay let me

2019
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,900
I found a blog the other day

2020
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,900
actually I was looking at Davoo's Twitter

2021
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,900
and Davoo follows these guys

2022
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,900
called the Indie Game Advisors

2023
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,900
oh yeah it's like a troll

2024
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,900
and one of their tweets was like

2025
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,900
there's only one place for your game

2026
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,900
Zero Feedback

2027
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,900
and it was a link and it linked to a

2028
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,900
blog called Zero Feedback

2029
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,900
that is a blog that collects and reviews

2030
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,900
games that have been made

2031
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,900
and posted online

2032
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:48,900
and three months or more after being

2033
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,900
posted have gotten zero comments

2034
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,900
from anyone

2035
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,900
gone completely unnoticed

2036
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,900
amazing

2037
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,900
wait what were we just saying that got me on this topic

2038
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,900
that games cost a million dollars to make

2039
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,900
and that they're all appealing to the same

2040
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,900
don't have to appeal to anybody

2041
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,900
I was scrolling through the list and some of them were really interesting

2042
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,900
but one of them started was like

2043
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,900
games are made for different audience

2044
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,900
some games are made to be

2045
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,900
a meta commentary on gaming in general

2046
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,900
some games aren't meant to be played at all

2047
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,900
and

2048
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,900
the game is like a birthday present

2049
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,900
like the dev just made the game

2050
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,900
it's an interactive cake blower

2051
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,900
like candle blower out some matter

2052
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,900
made for his friend as a birthday

2053
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,900
and there's two versions

2054
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,900
like made on two different years and like

2055
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,900
the second one is like this weird like

2056
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,900
like lion puzzle

2057
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,900
but the one that was like

2058
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,900
Jesse beating up um

2059
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,900
who was it, what critic was it that you beat up Jesse

2060
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,900
oh I don't even remember

2061
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,900
Razor Fist I don't know

2062
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,900
it was that um

2063
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,900
every time you hit them their sub count

2064
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,900
was subtracted and put into your sub count

2065
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:54,900
oh yeah

2066
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,900
wait Davoo made a game

2067
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,900
Davoo's made a bunch of games

2068
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,900
I know he's made games but I haven't seen any of them

2069
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,900
he's made a few RPGs that he said

2070
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:04,900
actually have a lot of the ideas that

2071
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,900
Undertale did and he realized it later

2072
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,900
that's interesting

2073
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,900
it was the cinemasins people

2074
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,900
yeah it was cinemasins he made a game where Jesse

2075
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,900
Jesse said he wanted to beat up cinemasins

2076
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,900
and then Davoo made a game where Jesse

2077
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,900
beats up cinemasins and takes their subscribers

2078
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,900
that reminds me of

2079
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,900
my idea about a youtuber

2080
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,900
gambling ring where you can gamble your subscribers

2081
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,900
and if you lose

2082
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,900
your subscribers go to the winner

2083
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,900
what a great idea

2084
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,900
I know right

2085
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,900
but anyway

2086
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,900
if only there was some way to transfer subscribers

2087
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,900
it would totally work

2088
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,900
I'll agree with you on the idea that

2089
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,900
I'm sure Shovel Knight was like

2090
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,900
initial success is based on

2091
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,900
nostalgia but like both of my little brothers

2092
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,900
played that game and neither one of them has played

2093
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,900
fuck all old games

2094
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,900
they have not played a single NES or Super Nintendo game

2095
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,900
in their fucking lives

2096
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,900
Victor's never played a Super Nintendo game

2097
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,900
Victor is like super against

2098
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,900
going back to old games

2099
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,900
he finds it so hard

2100
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,900
to play a game that doesn't look pretty

2101
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,900
that it's like

2102
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,900
kills him

2103
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,900
I have done God's work

2104
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,900
by way of Nintendo

2105
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,900
and gotten him Final Fantasy 7

2106
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,900
and he's starting it up now

2107
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,900
if he likes pretty games

2108
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,900
forget the Legos

2109
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,900
those pre-rendered backgrounds man

2110
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,900
they're gorgeous

2111
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,900
get the fuck out of here whoever said that

2112
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:28,900
I'm just saying I think by most people's

2113
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,900
definition of what a pretty game is

2114
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,900
most people are literally retarded

2115
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,900
I'm a really big fan of

2116
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,900
static pre-rendered

2117
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:38,900
backgrounds

2118
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,900
best environments

2119
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,900
fuck anyone who says the graphics are bad

2120
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,900
they don't know what the hell they're talking about

2121
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,900
when you're fucking walking and shit's going on in the background

2122
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,900
and there's fucking like cannons

2123
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,900
flying and like the weapon is coming towards you

2124
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,900
remember how when you walk outside of Eris's church

2125
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,900
and it's like tiny and it looks like

2126
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,900
so out of proportion it's so adorable

2127
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,900
and I love it and it's the best

2128
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,900
the best

2129
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,900
when it zooms out in the intro

2130
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,900
it shows the logo on the screen

2131
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,900
and then it zooms right back into the train

2132
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,900
and then directly to gameplay

2133
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,900
seamlessly

2134
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,900
how did they do that with the camera

2135
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,900
they can't even do that

2136
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,900
nowadays I've never seen that in any game ever

2137
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,900
since then before then

2138
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,900
the best game ever made and we finally

2139
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,900
solved the problem it is objectively

2140
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,900
look at red13's dad

2141
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,900
look at his character model

2142
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,900
it's a piece of shit

2143
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,900
you gotta admit though

2144
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,900
that it would have been

2145
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,900
look at the fucking aliased jagged edges

2146
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
sometimes when the camera is moving

2147
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,900
and how fucking janky it is

2148
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,900
fucking complete a total biscuit

2149
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,900
about your anti-aliasing

2150
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,900
I wish

2151
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,900
I will say this

2152
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:50,900
I wish that if they were gonna do a Final Fantasy 7 remake

2153
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,900
then you know

2154
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,900
you said that the scene where the train stops

2155
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,900
and it seamlessly transitions to gameplay

2156
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,900
you can tell

2157
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:00,900
the moment where the train stops

2158
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,900
being a 3D model and starts being

2159
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,900
part of the background

2160
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,900
you can see that moment

2161
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,900
that's the kind of thing

2162
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,900
that if they were gonna do a remake of Final Fantasy 7

2163
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,900
just fix that

2164
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,900
just make it look like the train is the same train

2165
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,900
that's such a small thing

2166
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,900
that would just enhance the immersion

2167
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,900
it wouldn't change anything

2168
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,900
it doesn't change the artistic nature of the game

2169
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,900
it's just now the train is the same train

2170
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,900
I'm gonna be that guy

2171
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,900
and just say that changing anything about the original

2172
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,900
will make it worse

2173
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,900
I don't care if it's improvement

2174
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,900
I don't care if you fix any bugs

2175
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,900
I love every bug

2176
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,900
every glitch, every bit of shitty anti-aliasing

2177
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,900
only because it's tied to that experience

2178
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,900
so any change will be

2179
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,900
it'll feel wrong

2180
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,900
Jesse's motto, you're supposed to love the flaws

2181
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,900
in someone you love

2182
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,900
I keep referencing

2183
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,900
in my videos because I love them so much

2184
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,900
the real Silent Hill experience guys

2185
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,900
Twin Perfect

2186
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,900
I love the HD remake

2187
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,900
they say it all

2188
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
I was gonna say it's like Silent Hill

2189
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,900
changing anything

2190
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,900
even changing the things that suck about it

2191
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,900
they make that point

2192
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,900
that every flaw, every mistake

2193
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,900
whatever is a mistake to you

2194
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:16,900
who's redoing it

2195
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,900
but it was put there, they made a choice to leave it there

2196
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,900
and all that was the context for making the game

2197
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,900
and to change it is just disrespectful to the original

2198
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,900
you know a game that I should play

2199
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,900
are you talking about Silent Hill Shattered Memories

2200
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,900
because I love that game

2201
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,900
the HD versions of

2202
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,900
2 and 3

2203
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,900
they're garbage

2204
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,900
I haven't played the original

2205
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,900
so Jesse I know you have

2206
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,900
I don't know about the other guys

2207
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,900
but I wanna know your opinion on Resident Evil 1

2208
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,900
versus the GameCube version

2209
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,900
the GameCube version

2210
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,900
is the exception that proves the rule

2211
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,900
because it's superior in every way

2212
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,900
because when I was watching Nate's video

2213
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,900
and I was like

2214
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,900
on the one hand I agree

2215
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,900
conceptually that changing things is a bad idea

2216
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,900
but the GameCube version of Resident Evil

2217
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,900
is a fucking masterpiece

2218
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,900
yeah well okay

2219
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,900
what was the situation for that game being made though

2220
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,900
I'd really like to know because I don't know

2221
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,900
it's the exact same game except they

2222
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:12,900
made the controls not tank controls

2223
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,900
and they made the

2224
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,900
the pre-rendered backgrounds just

2225
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,900
utterly beautiful

2226
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,900
they were still tank controls on the GameCube

2227
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,900
I think they took that out

2228
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:24,900
in the HD version

2229
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,900
they didn't remove the fantastic

2230
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,900
cutscenes or anything did

2231
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,900
they made new cutscenes

2232
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,900
they put like whole new

2233
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,900
stories of them

2234
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,900
they did change the dialogue

2235
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,900
to make it less corny

2236
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,900
do you like it better that way

2237
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,900
cause a lot of people love the corny ones

2238
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,900
I was gonna say there's things about the original

2239
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,900
still that you can't duplicate

2240
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,900
the corny dialogue is pretty

2241
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,900
fucking cool in the original

2242
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,900
he does not say you were almost a Jill

2243
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,900
sandwich this time

2244
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,900
are you the master of unlocking

2245
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,900
yeah he doesn't say that

2246
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,900
but like

2247
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,900
I definitely don't see the remake as

2248
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,900
being something that could replace the original

2249
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,900
I think that's good

2250
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,900
that's what matters

2251
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,900
mmhmm

2252
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,900
but I think

2253
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,900
I think

2254
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:16,900
would you say that if someone

2255
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,900
told you that they've only played

2256
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,900
the remake of Resident Evil

2257
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:22,900
and that they're not interested in playing the first one

2258
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,900
do you think you would say

2259
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,900
you would be like okay with that

2260
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,900
I'd think less of them but I'd be okay with it

2261
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,900
I guess

2262
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,900
sadly I think I do want to play that game

2263
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,900
I will probably play the remake

2264
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,900
but I don't want it to

2265
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,900
I would rather have been in a situation where there was only one

2266
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,900
to play so that I could get the experience

2267
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:42,900
just by playing the game

2268
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,900
the thing is Resident Evil on the GameCube

2269
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,900
is like the

2270
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,900
most gorgeous fucking game ever

2271
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,900
like it is

2272
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,900
the most beautiful game

2273
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
I've ever seen

2274
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,900
and I think it does a lot

2275
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,900
for the game that it looks that way

2276
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,900
where like

2277
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,900
there's parts in that game where you walk

2278
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,900
into a room and just the

2279
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,900
level of detail and the way the lighting

2280
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,900
is fucking terrifying

2281
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,900
just the way the room looks

2282
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,900
you walk into a room and

2283
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,900
you'll be like facing the camera

2284
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,900
and your character model looks

2285
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,900
really realistic and the lighting looks

2286
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,900
realistic and it just puts you in this weird

2287
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,900
frame of mind where you're like oh god

2288
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,900
I'm really here and things are really

2289
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,900
killing me

2290
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,900
because it looks so hyper real and they got away with it

2291
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,900
because it's all pre-rendered

2292
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,900
so they could draw as much detail

2293
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,900
into the backgrounds as they wanted

2294
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,900
they didn't have to worry about lighting

2295
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,900
that's the joy of pre-rendering dude

2296
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,900
why doesn't anyone do pre-rendering anymore

2297
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,900
god it's a shame

2298
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,900
I think you can

2299
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,900
that's what's so cool about like

2300
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,900
nobody big does it

2301
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:50,900
what's so cool about 2D games like Muramasa

2302
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,900
is that they can do shit like that

2303
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,900
every single background be like

2304
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,900
the most opulent thing you've ever seen

2305
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:58,900
but I think it fell out with

2306
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,900
3D games because people bitch about the cameras

2307
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,900
people don't want to have the camera

2308
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,900
constantly changing modes

2309
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,900
that's why tank controls are

2310
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,900
important

2311
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,900
in the HD version

2312
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,900
it doesn't have tank controls

2313
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,900
but I never found it confusing

2314
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,900
like I was just

2315
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,900
I thought it worked perfectly fine

2316
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,900
even in Final Fantasy 7

2317
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,900
it can get confusing sometimes walking between screens

2318
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,900
and it doesn't have tank controls

2319
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,900
and I remember several times

2320
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,900
I'll walk back through a place

2321
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,900
just because the camera changes completely

2322
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,900
the worst in Final Fantasy 7

2323
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,900
is that tunnel

2324
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,900
in the beginning where

2325
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:38,900
it's really confusing to tell

2326
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:40,900
if you're supposed to go forward or backwards

2327
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:42,900
I know exactly what you're talking about underground

2328
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,900
I've actually heard that

2329
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,900
referred to as the noob tunnel

2330
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,900
where people have gotten so lost

2331
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,900
in that tunnel that they quit playing the game

2332
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,900
because they couldn't figure out what to do

2333
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,900
is that the long tunnel that just goes

2334
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,900
really far in both directions

2335
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,900
it's like when you're waiting

2336
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:00,900
to Shinra HQ

2337
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,900
and you're trying to get there

2338
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,900
and you go through all these subway tunnels

2339
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,900
I kinda like that

2340
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,900
I mean it's a cool place

2341
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,900
but it is confusing

2342
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,900
that's true

2343
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,900
I'm changing my vote

2344
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:16,900
my favorite game of all time is frog fractions

2345
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,900
I like number munch

2346
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,900
math plaster

2347
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,900
have you guys played frog fractions

2348
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,900
no I've never heard of it

2349
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:26,900
I have played it on your suggestion

2350
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,900
and it was great

2351
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,900
I must have made you play frog fractions

2352
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,900
you guys should play frog fractions

2353
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,900
another frog game that goes crazy

2354
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:36,900
am I thinking of this

2355
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,900
there's a dragon

2356
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,900
oh yeah I have played that

2357
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,900
I remember that game

2358
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,900
where it turns into like a million different games

2359
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,900
yeah that's right

2360
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,900
so I'm looking at this article

2361
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,900
and apparently frog fractions too

2362
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,900
is coming out

2363
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,900
but it's coming out

2364
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,900
by way of some insanely

2365
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,900
convoluted alternate reality game

2366
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,900
that involves like

2367
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,900
weird

2368
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,900
real life performance art pieces

2369
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,900
guys let's all play frog fractions

2370
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,900
that sounds fucking awesome

2371
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:10,900
I'm reading about it right now

2372
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,900
holy shit I'd forgotten about frog fractions

2373
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,900
but god damn

2374
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,900
you know what you're right I'm changing my vote

2375
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,900
frog fractions is objectively the best game ever

2376
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,900
I'm so glad we were able to come to consensus

2377
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,900
this is a progressive

2378
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,900
not even that this convoluted release method

2379
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,900
means that frog fractions too is the best game ever

2380
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,900
and it doesn't even exist

2381
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,900
certainly the best franchise

2382
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,900
that is a phenomenal game

2383
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,900
that honestly probably would make my list of

2384
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,900
like top 5 games ever

2385
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,900
my game of the year

2386
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,900
for 2015 is

2387
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,900
dengeki bunko fighting climax

2388
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,900
technically it came out last year in Japan

2389
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,900
but it came out this year in the US

2390
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,900
and it's

2391
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,900
possibly my favorite fighting game

2392
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,900
that's not called super smash brothers

2393
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,900
I play as kozaka kirino

2394
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,900
from ore no we motoga

2395
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,900
nani kawai wake ganai

2396
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,900
or my little sister can't possibly be this cute

2397
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,900
and she's

2398
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,900
I kick everybody's ass with her

2399
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,900
and she has

2400
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,900
really fun moveset

2401
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,900
and she's like the most satisfying character

2402
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,900
to play in a video game

2403
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,900
I've ever played

2404
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:20,900
I'm going to give you guys a spoiler

2405
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,900
I'm going to give you guys a spoiler

2406
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:24,900
for future best guy ever

2407
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,900
episode

2408
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,900
kirino

2409
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,900
the worst creation

2410
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,900
in the history of mankind

2411
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,900
she is an abomination

2412
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,900
she is an utterly

2413
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,900
reprehensible

2414
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,900
piece of human garbage

2415
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,900
and it is my mission in life

2416
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,900
to obliterate her memory

2417
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,900
from the face of the earth

2418
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,900
I'm going to fucking recreate Hiroshima

2419
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,900
if it means one more person

2420
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,900
will not

2421
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,900
fuck kirino

2422
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,900
I'm surprised you haven't bought

2423
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,900
dengeki bunko fighting climax

2424
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,900
just so you can beat her up

2425
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,900
I'll go pirate it

2426
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,900
I can't give money to the people

2427
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:06,900
who created kirino

2428
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,900
but I will get it

2429
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,900
you're misrepresenting

2430
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,900
the problem guy

2431
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,900
the problem is not that she's a terrible person

2432
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,900
the problem is that

2433
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,900
the show is a terrible show

2434
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,900
that wants you to like her

2435
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,900
the biggest problem

2436
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,900
are the people around

2437
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,900
kirino who enable her

2438
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,900
but if we eliminate her

2439
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,900
and who the show then goes on to celebrate

2440
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,900
as having done the right thing

2441
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,900
I feel like if we kill her

2442
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,900
that's at least one scourge

2443
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,900
of

2444
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
badness

2445
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,900
I want to fight you

2446
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,900
with kirino

2447
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,900
I will be kirino

2448
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,900
you be kirino

2449
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,900
we will have the ultimate fucking battle

2450
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:52,900
see the problem is that

2451
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,900
kirito sucks

2452
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:56,900
and kirino is like the god tier character

2453
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,900
I'll do whatever it takes

2454
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,900
I've got determination man

2455
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,900
oh he's bringing it back undertale

2456
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,900
yes we did talk about

2457
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,900
that's why I wanted to bring up

2458
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,900
my favorite game is dengeki bunko fighting climax

2459
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,900
it's not undertale

2460
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,900
even of this year

2461
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,900
I also like axiom verge more than undertale

2462
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,900
but I don't know

2463
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,900
axiom verge is a game

2464
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:20,900
I don't like undertale made me think

2465
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
more

2466
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,900
axiom verge did not make me think

2467
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,900
a lot but it's a game

2468
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,900
that I definitely see myself playing again

2469
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,900
in a year or two

2470
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,900
undertale I don't think I will ever play again

2471
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,900
I find the

2472
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,900
gameplay to be extremely

2473
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:38,900
frustrating and I hate it

2474
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,900
I'm going to play undertale the way I play

2475
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,900
final fantasy 7 I think

2476
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,900
which is just every couple of years

2477
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:46,900
just take the journey and just do it

2478
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,900
just to re-immers

2479
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,900
yeah I know

2480
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,900
I don't really see myself playing it again

2481
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:54,900
I think I've gotten

2482
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:56,900
all there is to get out of the

2483
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:58,900
I think I'll play it again

2484
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,900
I already played it a third time and didn't even intend to

2485
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,900
was that mage?

2486
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:04,900
I want to say I play undertale again but I feel bad

2487
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,900
you don't have to do

2488
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:10,900
genocide or anything

2489
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,900
oh right but if you reset

2490
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,900
me and Shade were going to do

2491
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,900
a let's play

2492
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
because we were drinking and he was big

2493
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,900
into undertale so he was like why don't you just start

2494
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,900
up another undertale run and then I turned on the

2495
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,900
game and Flowey showed up

2496
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,900
and started talking to me and literally asking me

2497
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,900
not to do it and I was like

2498
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,900
well if I'm not supposed to do it in the context

2499
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,900
of the narrative then I won't do it

2500
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,900
oh that's so great

2501
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:36,900
that's why I love undertale

2502
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,900
you all this time

2503
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,900
have been saying

2504
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,900
you guys keep saying oh you didn't do a genocide run

2505
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,900
you weren't here

2506
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,900
you have been heckling me for a week

2507
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,900
telling me I have to kill everyone

2508
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,900
you piece of shit

2509
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,900
you are definitely a better person if you do not play

2510
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,900
genocide but you do not

2511
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:56,900
get the game you just don't

2512
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,900
you don't know everything

2513
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,900
that's stupid you're accepting

2514
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,900
the game's logic uncritically

2515
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,900
playing a genocide run does not

2516
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,900
make you a worse person no matter how much the game tries

2517
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,900
to tell you it does

2518
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,900
you killed all your friends

2519
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:12,900
even Toby said why would you do a genocide run

2520
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,900
he put it there

2521
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,900
I don't think that it makes you a worse person

2522
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,900
it's a temptation you're supposed to resist

2523
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:20,900
I think that it means

2524
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,900
the game's putting one over on you

2525
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,900
and it refuse

2526
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,900
to play by its rules

2527
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:28,900
all of those things

2528
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,900
you are constructed as temptations that you are supposed to resist

2529
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,900
you can do what you want

2530
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,900
I don't even think it's tempting

2531
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,900
I did not reach the end of the game

2532
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,900
I sure want to kill all these guys

2533
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,900
that would be interesting

2534
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,900
that's why I did it

2535
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,900
I wanted to know

2536
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,900
it's that there's additional content

2537
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,900
and it's honestly really good content

2538
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,900
that's why it's such an effective tool

2539
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,900
I think the reason

2540
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,900
the reason that there's

2541
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:56,900
like a divide of people

2542
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,900
that don't want to do it

2543
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,900
don't even think that it would be a fun time

2544
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,900
not like it would be fun

2545
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,900
but like they don't want to do it

2546
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,900
not just because it's nasty

2547
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,900
but because they just don't care

2548
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,900
and I think it's like

2549
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,900
the game

2550
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,900
undertale

2551
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,900
if you end up wanting

2552
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,900
to not do the genocide run

2553
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:20,900
it's like it's affected you in that way

2554
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,900
it just speaks more to

2555
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,900
like the character

2556
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:26,900
writing

2557
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,900
if you don't feel a desire

2558
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,900
to do the genocide run

2559
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,900
I think the game has kind of failed

2560
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,900
in what it was trying to do

2561
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,900
I think it's trying to incentivize you to do it

2562
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,900
I think, no, you know what

2563
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,900
I'm gonna say it like this

2564
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,900
I think there are

2565
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,900
two equally valid endings

2566
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,900
to undertale

2567
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:48,900
one where you keep going and you do genocide

2568
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:50,900
and one where you don't

2569
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:52,900
and I think that

2570
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,900
you could say that the genocide run

2571
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,900
has a lot of the interesting content in the game

2572
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,900
but I think it's equally interesting

2573
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:00,900
to play a game and then for that game

2574
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,900
to actually convince you

2575
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,900
you don't want to play it again

2576
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,900
I totally agree with you

2577
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,900
that is legitimate

2578
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:10,900
I think every single ending

2579
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,900
is totally fine

2580
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:14,900
my whole thing is

2581
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,900
I love that the genocide run exists

2582
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,900
and I respect what it does

2583
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,900
as a work of art

2584
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:22,900
the fact that it gives you that choice

2585
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,900
and tries to tempt you is like the coolest

2586
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,900
most unique artistic thing that

2587
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:28,900
in many years, however

2588
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,900
me personally

2589
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,900
Toby Fox is not smarter than me

2590
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,900
I'm not going to fall for his shit

2591
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,900
I'm not going to let him browbeat me

2592
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,900
and talk down to me for doing something

2593
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,900
that he tried to get me to do

2594
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,900
so he can suck a dick

2595
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,900
I'll never play the genocide run

2596
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,900
he'll never fucking trick me

2597
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,900
and I'll never fall for his metal bullshit

2598
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,900
because I'm better than him

2599
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,900
the problem is you know everything already

2600
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,900
so you don't have any desire to play

2601
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:56,900
like Toby

2602
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:58,900
it's weird for the game

2603
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,900
to look down on you

2604
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,900
when he programmed this

2605
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,900
into the game

2606
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,900
he's the bad guy

2607
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,900
he made the genocide run

2608
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:10,900
a choice into the game

2609
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,900
so of course there had to be a negative choice

2610
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,900
it's up to you to do what you want

2611
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,900
let me just explain to me the logic

2612
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:18,900
he's like God

2613
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,900
judging me for masturbating when he gave me a dick in the first place

2614
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,900
that's right

2615
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,900
when I played through the game

2616
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,900
on my first run

2617
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:28,900
even though I was going for pacifist

2618
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,900
I ended up killing some people

2619
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,900
and resetting

2620
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,900
I killed Toriel and then I reset to do it again

2621
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,900
and got the happy ending

2622
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,900
I killed Undyne because I couldn't figure out what to do with her

2623
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,900
and I saw her fucking death

2624
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
which is awesome by the way

2625
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,900
if you haven't seen her neutral death

2626
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,900
it's fucking heartbreaking

2627
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,900
it's wicked cool

2628
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,900
sad as well

2629
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,900
okay spoilers

2630
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,900
you know how in

2631
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,900
Jesse don't listen if you don't want to spoil

2632
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,900
you know how in genocide

2633
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,900
when you kill her she starts melting

2634
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:02,900
but she's like no everyone's counting on me

2635
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:04,900
I've gotta defeat you

2636
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,900
it is the best moment in the game

2637
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,900
and then she wills herself back to life through determination

2638
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,900
and becomes the ultimate champion

2639
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,900
in a neutral run

2640
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,900
she tries to do that

2641
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,900
but because you're not the ultimate monster

2642
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:18,900
she can't summon the determination to do it

2643
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:20,900
and she's like no I won't die

2644
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,900
I can't die I won't die

2645
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,900
that's genius

2646
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,900
brilliant I love it

2647
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:28,900
she's like no

2648
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,900
I can't and then she just melts away

2649
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,900
I would suck that dog's dick any day

2650
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,900
no it's wicked good

2651
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,900
so I saw that and I loved it

2652
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,900
but I was sad so I

2653
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,900
reset and undid it and saved the game

2654
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,900
saved her

2655
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,900
and then I got to the end

2656
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:46,900
and

2657
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,900
and if Toriel dies

2658
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,900
she has a good scene too

2659
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,900
so I really wanted to see the ultimate content

2660
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,900
so I was like of course I'm gonna do the genocide

2661
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,900
because

2662
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,900
I want to see

2663
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,900
and that is exactly the point

2664
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,900
that's sort of the point the game's making

2665
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:04,900
the funny thing is I hate games

2666
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,900
having multiple paths

2667
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,900
I never do multiple paths in a game

2668
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,900
like if it's a game that has

2669
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:12,900
three endings I'll take the ending I got

2670
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,900
I don't give a fuck

2671
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:16,900
I think

2672
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:18,900
there's a lot of people who they get to the end

2673
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:20,900
and they're like you have to get

2674
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,900
the true ending the perfect ending

2675
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,900
you have to get the one where you did everything right

2676
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,900
and you saved everybody and I'm like

2677
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,900
I'm just gonna take whatever ending I get

2678
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,900
if I played in a way

2679
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,900
where I fucked up then this is the ending

2680
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,900
that my story has

2681
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,900
I'm one of those people who always

2682
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,900
does whatever it takes to get the true ending

2683
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,900
on the first playthrough

2684
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:42,900
I don't know if I'm going to be able

2685
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,900
to put in the time

2686
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,900
to do it again

2687
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,900
and I never risk that I'll

2688
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,900
get about and have to play through another game

2689
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:52,900
I feel like the world we live in

2690
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,900
you can't restart anything

2691
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,900
right you go through

2692
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,900
you're totally right

2693
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:00,900
I get why for video games

2694
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:02,900
it's an escape from the real world

2695
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:04,900
it's a world where you can do everything again

2696
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,900
you can make everything perfect

2697
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,900
and have your Groundhog's Day loop

2698
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,900
you saved everybody and the end is great

2699
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:12,900
but like

2700
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,900
for me I just kind of like to take

2701
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,900
what comes and be like

2702
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,900
I mean mostly out of impatience

2703
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,900
I don't want to fucking play through the whole game

2704
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:22,900
twice or redo things

2705
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,900
I never save scum in any game

2706
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,900
unless it's fucking Fire Emblem

2707
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:28,900
cause I'm not going to let any of my characters die

2708
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,900
I also do it out of impatience

2709
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,900
it's exactly the same as Fire Emblem for me

2710
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,900
I cannot let any character

2711
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,900
die in Fire Emblem ever

2712
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:38,900
it's an impossibility for me

2713
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,900
we'll never do it and I cannot

2714
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:42,900
to me it seems like if you let a character die

2715
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,900
you lost the game

2716
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,900
that's right

2717
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,900
you could win any battle

2718
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,900
if you just do enough soldiers at it

2719
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,900
that's my obsession with getting the true best ending

2720
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,900
I totally understand

2721
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,900
obviously because in Fire Emblem

2722
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,900
all the characters are characters and individuals

2723
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,900
you don't want any of them to die

2724
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,900
because it would feel really terrible

2725
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:04,900
and not only that

2726
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,900
but at least just try again

2727
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:08,900
so there's no excuse for letting them die

2728
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,900
and so I'm totally with you

2729
01:47:10,900 --> 01:47:12,900
on why you would want to redo it

2730
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,900
however in games like that

2731
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,900
I think it really ups the stakes

2732
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,900
and makes it a lot more engaging

2733
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,900
and ultimately fun

2734
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,900
if you decide ahead of time

2735
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,900
I will not reset to save anyone

2736
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,900
if I fuck up and die

2737
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:28,900
I have a thought about that

2738
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,900
but I suck at Fire Emblem

2739
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:32,900
so like if I tried to play that way

2740
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,900
I'm fucked

2741
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,900
it would obviously

2742
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,900
make things a lot harder

2743
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:40,900
it'd be like Nuzlocking

2744
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,900
doing a Nuzlocke run

2745
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:44,900
of a Fire Emblem

2746
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,900
I love Nuzlocke runs

2747
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,900
and I love the idea of Nuzlocke runs

2748
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,900
but the game is so not balanced for it

2749
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,900
and it takes so much grinding that I don't think I'll ever do another one

2750
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:54,900
you don't have to restart your game

2751
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,900
when you lose your Pokemon

2752
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:58,900
you just pick up a new Pokemon

2753
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:00,900
and just play with that one

2754
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,900
if your Pokemon dies

2755
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,900
you have to pick up one of your other ones

2756
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,900
I think that is a lot more

2757
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,900
convenient than trying to do Fire Emblem

2758
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,900
without a character

2759
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,900
you're a fool

2760
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,900
because it's the opposite of convenient

2761
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:16,900
everything about a Nuzlocke run

2762
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:18,900
will destroy you forever

2763
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,900
if you lose a character in Fire Emblem

2764
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,900
and you go to the next level

2765
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:24,900
and you save your game

2766
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,900
then you are fucked forever

2767
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,900
because you can never get that character back

2768
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:30,900
if you keep losing characters

2769
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,900
you're just going to have to restart the whole game

2770
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,900
with Nuzlocke

2771
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,900
you will have to grind excessively

2772
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,900
but you will never have to actually just reset the game

2773
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,900
you know

2774
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,900
in Fire Emblem

2775
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,900
they give you way more characters than you can ever use

2776
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,900
in one match

2777
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:48,900
I've never gotten far enough

2778
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:50,900
in Fire Emblem that I had the huge stock of characters

2779
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,900
you can lose Pokemon

2780
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,900
you can lose enough Pokemon

2781
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,900
you can easily lose enough Pokemon

2782
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:58,900
in a Nuzlocke run that you're completely fucked

2783
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,900
you can also lose Pokemon

2784
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:02,900
or just not gain Pokemon in the first place

2785
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,900
through bad luck

2786
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,900
so as to not have Pokemon on your team

2787
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,900
so there's a rule that you can only use

2788
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,900
each type of Pokemon once

2789
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,900
oh you're talking about Nuzlocke now

2790
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,900
no you can

2791
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,900
you just catch the first

2792
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,900
every area you come to you can catch the first one

2793
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,900
so if you end up with

2794
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:22,900
and if you fail to catch it

2795
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,900
then you just don't have one

2796
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,900
and if you start gold in Nuzlocke

2797
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,900
I got to the Dragon Trainer

2798
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,900
and I had

2799
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,900
well I mean there's a whole terrible story

2800
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,900
I had an Ice Pokemon

2801
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,900
I had an Ice Pokemon

2802
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,900
Brunswick the Mammoth Swine

2803
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,900
he died tragically in a horrible Wabafit accident

2804
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,900
disgusting piece of shit Wabafit worst Pokemon ever

2805
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,900
but then because I went

2806
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:46,900
and because of that

2807
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,900
I was completely fucked against Claire the Dragon Trainer

2808
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,900
got my shit wrecked

2809
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,900
didn't actually game over

2810
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,900
pretty much the next climactic encounter

2811
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,900
where was I going?

2812
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,900
we are way off the topic of what the best game ever is

2813
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,900
well what's your point are you making a point with that?

2814
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:04,900
well no but I will now

2815
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,900
and I'll say

2816
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,900
I think that it's highly

2817
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,900
recommends Pokemon as a game

2818
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,900
for best game ever

2819
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,900
or some title like it

2820
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,900
the way that it's systems are broad enough

2821
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
that you can play it in multiple different ways

2822
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,900
interesting though

2823
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,900
how much of this like what do they call it

2824
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,900
expanded gameplay

2825
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,900
emergent gameplay

2826
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,900
how much of that can be factored into

2827
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,900
all of it

2828
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,900
absolutely all of it

2829
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,900
there are games

2830
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,900
if you played God of War

2831
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,900
you cannot do anything differently

2832
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,900
from what the game is

2833
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,900
there's no where to go

2834
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,900
there's no other abilities you have

2835
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:46,900
you just play through

2836
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,900
I'm not criticizing God of War

2837
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,900
if you play Dark Souls

2838
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:52,900
you can play it in so many hundreds of different ways

2839
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,900
that completely change it

2840
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,900
where you can play a run where you only use the whip

2841
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,900
and you're Simon Belmont

2842
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,900
and it's Castlevania

2843
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,900
I've watched people beat the game like that

2844
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:04,900
I've watched a guy beat the game with a guitar hero controller

2845
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,900
I've watched a guy

2846
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,900
beat Dark Souls with voice commands

2847
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,900
he was saying left, right, jump, dodge

2848
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:14,900
left like that

2849
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,900
I've watched him beat Ormstein and Smough

2850
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,900
fucking voice commands

2851
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,900
I've watched a guy

2852
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,900
one of my friends beat the game at level one

2853
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,900
he beat the game using only

2854
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:26,900
shields, only two shields

2855
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,900
for weapons

2856
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,900
I've watched him

2857
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,900
there's just so many ways

2858
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,900
that you can beat the game

2859
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,900
there's different ways that you can speedrun it

2860
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,900
where you can do a natural speedrun

2861
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:40,900
where you go all the way through or do a glitch speedrun

2862
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,900
where you skip half the bosses

2863
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
by jumping through the first flame

2864
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,900
or whatever

2865
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,900
what's the big one called

2866
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:50,900
the giant bonfire

2867
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,900
whatever, you know what I'm talking about

2868
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,900
the Lord Vessel

2869
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,900
there's a glitch you can do where you just go through that door

2870
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:58,900
and completely bypass the whole

2871
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,900
second half of the game

2872
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,900
which is how the early speedruns were done

2873
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:04,900
there's just a million

2874
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:06,900
ways to play Dark Souls

2875
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,900
and it makes it endlessly replayable

2876
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:10,900
and super awesome

2877
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:12,900
you're never done with the game until you decide

2878
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:14,900
you're never done with the game

2879
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,900
and even the nature of the story

2880
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,900
supports that until you go hollow

2881
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:20,900
the game is still going

2882
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,900
and the cyclical nature of it

2883
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,900
especially, I mean

2884
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:26,900
I'd say that if there's one flaw

2885
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:28,900
with Dark Souls that's not like a technical flaw

2886
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,900
it's that the dark ending

2887
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:32,900
doesn't seg you well into New Game Plus

2888
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,900
because...

2889
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,900
I like saying seg you, okay

2890
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,900
seg way, god damn it

2891
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,900
this podcast is over

2892
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:42,900
I like saying seg you

2893
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,900
anyway, but that's not the word

2894
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:46,900
I just like saying it, it's my version

2895
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:48,900
of the word

2896
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,900
people give me shit about this all the time

2897
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:52,900
but I like the word

2898
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,900
the dark ending

2899
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,900
does not seg way

2900
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,900
and people won't stop giving me shit about it

2901
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,900
what's going on?

2902
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,900
the dark ending does not seg way well

2903
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:04,900
into New Game Plus

2904
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,900
whereas the light ending makes sense

2905
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:08,900
as the cycle continues and you are the new

2906
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:10,900
guy or whatever

2907
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,900
I guess it doesn't make perfect sense because it's still Gwyn

2908
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:14,900
at the end and it's not like your player character

2909
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,900
or whatever, but like

2910
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,900
it makes more sense

2911
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,900
it feels more natural

2912
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,900
I'm not sure the light ending particularly segways very well

2913
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,900
into it

2914
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,900
it would be like a cycle much later

2915
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,900
segways well into what

2916
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,900
into New Game Plus

2917
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,900
Gwyn is back

2918
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,900
and he shouldn't be back

2919
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:36,900
I don't think that the New Game Plus

2920
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,900
is part of the story

2921
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:40,900
I don't think it's meant to be

2922
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,900
people have argued this over which ending is better

2923
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,900
for seguing into New Play Plus

2924
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,900
I think the dark ending

2925
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,900
both of them, all the bosses come back

2926
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,900
and it doesn't make any sense

2927
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,900
it's as much of a different world

2928
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,900
does not make any sense

2929
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:56,900
it's as much of a different world as someone else

2930
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,900
who you summon, they come from their version of Lord

2931
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
but if it wasn't

2932
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,900
for that you could

2933
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:04,900
isn't it supposed to be like an alternate dimension

2934
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,900
that's right

2935
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,900
because time is convoluted

2936
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,900
you're a different guy who is on the same quest

2937
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,900
so I think it's fine

2938
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,900
whatever

2939
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,900
I'd say that

2940
01:54:16,900 --> 01:54:18,900
but the game is pretty much

2941
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:20,900
only over when you say it's over

2942
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,900
and you can keep doing so many

2943
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,900
new things with it

2944
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,900
I feel like

2945
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,900
I've watched my friends do upwards

2946
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,900
of 40 runs of Dark Souls

2947
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:32,900
and doing it

2948
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,900
in so many different ways

2949
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,900
there's a lot of ways to chug through the early part

2950
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,900
first, there's a cool video

2951
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:40,900
that I saw early into

2952
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,900
when I was learning about all the different ways to play Dark Souls

2953
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,900
that was everything you can do before the Gargoyles

2954
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,900
and this dude just like

2955
01:54:46,900 --> 01:54:48,900
plows

2956
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,900
he does like pretty much everything

2957
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,900
aside from Sen's Fortress and Anor Londo

2958
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:54,900
can be done before

2959
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,900
and everything that comes after those

2960
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,900
can be done before the Gargoyles

2961
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,900
and

2962
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:02,900
it's like mesmerizing to watch

2963
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:04,900
people do shit like that

2964
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,900
that's really cool but to bring it back

2965
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:08,900
to the topic at hand

2966
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:10,900
all that stuff is like

2967
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:12,900
you really enjoy how the game

2968
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:14,900
is open

2969
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:16,900
to doing whatever you want

2970
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,900
all these ways you can explore it

2971
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:20,900
whereas in my opinion

2972
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,900
I sort of am more focused on the story

2973
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:24,900
and the

2974
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,900
sort of the point of the game

2975
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,900
like the specific story

2976
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,900
it's just different ways of looking at it

2977
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,900
and that's kind of the consensus here

2978
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,900
everyone's got their own way of looking at shit

2979
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:36,900
you want to know where best game ever debate becomes

2980
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:38,900
really really interesting

2981
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,900
is when you involve mods

2982
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,900
and you have to argue for whether or not

2983
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,900
you think that a game

2984
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:46,900
is qualified to be compared

2985
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,900
or to be like you know

2986
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,900
celebrated when it has mods

2987
01:55:50,900 --> 01:55:52,900
on that basis like Skyrim

2988
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:54,900
would probably be a lot of people's best game ever

2989
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:56,900
just because it's got so much shit

2990
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,900
I think that it is totally fair

2991
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:00,900
I do too

2992
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,900
you just have to specify

2993
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,900
what you're talking about

2994
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,900
for instance Super Bunny Hop

2995
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,900
when he made his video on Fallout 4

2996
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,900
he was saying on twitter

2997
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,900
and in the video he kept saying

2998
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,900
it's advisable to play this game 6 months from now

2999
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:16,900
when it's been modded to the point

3000
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,900
that it fixes all the issues

3001
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:20,900
and I was like

3002
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,900
what I want you to do Super Bunny Hop

3003
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:24,900
and I said this on twitter I was like

3004
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,900
6 months from now about the new game

3005
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:28,900
because it is a new game at that point

3006
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:30,900
it's a totally different game

3007
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,900
now that it's got all these mods

3008
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:34,900
and I think it's worth

3009
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,900
celebrating

3010
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,900
if you can mod a game

3011
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,900
and make it the best game ever

3012
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,900
then that's worth celebrating

3013
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:44,900
and with Dark Souls the PC version

3014
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,900
was definitely better than the PS3

3015
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,900
because they made it so you could play it in 1080p

3016
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:50,900
you could play it

3017
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,900
but when it came out

3018
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:54,900
they had it locked at 30 frames per second

3019
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,900
they had it locked at

3020
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:58,900
I don't think it was locked at 720

3021
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,900
but like

3022
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:02,900
the thing is there was a fix for it

3023
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:04,900
the day the game launched

3024
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,900
and Steam put

3025
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,900
a link to that patch

3026
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:10,900
on the front page of Steam

3027
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:12,900
if you bought the game

3028
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,900
it literally told you

3029
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,900
the patch is right here

3030
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,900
to fix it and so from day one

3031
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,900
Dark Souls PC

3032
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:22,900
even though like if you were writing a consumer review of it

3033
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:24,900
people would be like

3034
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,900
oh well the game has these locked frame rate issues

3035
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,900
and it's a big problem and like

3036
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,900
people want to punish the company

3037
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:32,900
for not releasing it right

3038
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:34,900
but from the very beginning

3039
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,900
you could mod it in 5 seconds

3040
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:38,900
and have it look beautiful

3041
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,900
now see I have no problem with including that

3042
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:42,900
as like a general review of the game

3043
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:44,900
but the only thing and this is an aside

3044
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,900
is I don't want the company to get that credit

3045
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,900
it doesn't deserve the credit for

3046
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,900
yeah but I think games should transcend

3047
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:52,900
who created them

3048
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,900
ultimately yes but just as a matter of like

3049
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,900
economics it's you know

3050
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,900
saying that mods don't

3051
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:00,900
count in terms of determining

3052
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,900
how good a game is or whether it's the best game ever

3053
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:04,900
or whatever really smacks of like

3054
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:06,900
I'm not saying that though

3055
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:08,900
really I know you're not but

3056
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,900
someone that did it really smacks of like objective

3057
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:12,900
like you know best versus

3058
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:14,900
favorite bullshit

3059
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:16,900
well I think the problem with it

3060
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,900
is that it turns

3061
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,900
calling a game great

3062
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,900
into just like an award

3063
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:24,900
for the people who made it

3064
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:26,900
as opposed to an award for the game

3065
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,900
like you know we're trying to figure out

3066
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,900
what is the best game

3067
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,900
for us

3068
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:34,900
we're not trying to find the best game ever

3069
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,900
so that we can give a fucking trophy

3070
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:38,900
to the people who made it

3071
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:40,900
we're doing it to say like

3072
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,900
according to us

3073
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,900
is the most fun game to play

3074
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:46,900
if mods make a game the best game ever

3075
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,900
then it's the best game ever

3076
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,900
regardless of you know

3077
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:52,900
just credit the guy who made the fucking mod

3078
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:54,900
if you're giving the trophy

3079
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,900
to everybody just give it to the mod guy too

3080
01:58:56,900 --> 01:58:58,900
it's the best game ever

3081
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,900
can you imagine like them ever share

3082
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,900
like the Skyrim devs ever like sharing credit

3083
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,900
with like the modding community

3084
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:06,900
did you not hear about like this huge

3085
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,900
controversial thing that happened where they tried to

3086
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,900
make a like

3087
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,900
they tried to monetize mods

3088
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:14,900
yeah build a community of like

3089
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:16,900
like oh we're gonna support the mods

3090
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,900
and people have to pay for them

3091
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:20,900
and it completely bombed and fell apart

3092
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,900
that was just another way to like capitalize

3093
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,900
on other people's work by the company

3094
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,900
it didn't work out well

3095
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,900
it was not a good idea

3096
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:30,900
it'll be back though it'll be back

3097
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:32,900
give it a couple years

3098
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,900
in some form it might return

3099
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,900
well

3100
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,900
we've been going for two hours now

3101
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:40,900
feel like we've covered a pretty good

3102
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,900
of shit how do you guys feel

3103
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,900
anybody got anything else to say

3104
01:59:44,900 --> 01:59:46,900
I can't believe I'm awake

3105
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:48,900
I want to go back and retroactively

3106
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,900
change what I said about Crazy Taxi

3107
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,900
it is objectively the best game ever made

3108
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,900
not just my favorite I'm on Ben's side now

3109
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,900
it's both the same

3110
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,900
good all right

3111
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:00,900
good hippo man

3112
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,900
what do you got to say

3113
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:06,900
Undyne is the best girl

3114
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:08,900
and I want to kiss her

3115
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:10,900
fishy

3116
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,900
vagina

3117
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:14,900
why does Undyne have more hair

3118
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,900
when she's on the date

3119
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,900
because she's more attractive that way

3120
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,900
she is to me

3121
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:22,900
she was wearing it in a ponytail

3122
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,900
but if you look at her head even from the back

3123
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,900
the top of her head is blue

3124
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,900
no she is obviously more attractive

3125
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,900
that way but I'm saying why

3126
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:32,900
in universe what is the explanation

3127
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,900
for the fact that she has more hair

3128
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:36,900
she grows the hair from the back

3129
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:38,900
to the front

3130
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:40,900
that is possible

3131
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,900
it could just be resting not growing

3132
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:44,900
she's got the

3133
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,900
she's got the Prince Zuko top

3134
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,900
thing going on

3135
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,900
and Zuko looked like he had long hair

3136
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,900
when it was down right

3137
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,900
I don't know

3138
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,900
he did Zuko looked

3139
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:58,900
like he was bald everywhere but

3140
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:00,900
when it was down

3141
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:02,900
her little

3142
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:04,900
battle sprite looks like

3143
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:10,900
Undyne's

3144
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:12,900
out of battle sprite looks almost completely bald

3145
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,900
that's true it's just got the little tough

3146
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,900
but you know what the fan art

3147
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,900
looks a million billion times better with a

3148
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,900
really tight ponytail

3149
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:22,900
and if one thing's canon

3150
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,900
it's fan art

3151
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,900
there's also the scene later where she pulls her hair

3152
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:28,900
for whatever

3153
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,900
everyone thanks for joining

3154
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,900
this was the first

3155
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,900
possibly not even going up version

3156
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,900
of the

3157
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,900
oh I forgot you were here

3158
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,900
mage

3159
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,900
what do you got to say mage go on

3160
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:44,900

3161
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,900

and we'll maybe do another one of these

3166
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,900
some time soon

3167
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,900
thanks for watching guys
