00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello. It's the amazing Atheist here. What does he sound like?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's about, right? It's like, well, you know.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's TJ here and I just, you know, video games are okay. It's okay to be bad at video games, women.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll still date you.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Maybe he talks about video games.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He must mention them. He must mention them occasionally.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't think he's a gamer. I think he...

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come on. Maybe he's played Fallout New Vegas or something.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I genuinely don't remember. I mean, was he involved in Gamergate at all?

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He must have talked about it in some capacity.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, he definitely talked about it. I can't remember his content from back then.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He's sort of, he's strange. He was like anti SJW to a point and then sort of turned into like a leftist more recently.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's friends with Lush and stuff. He's always been like pro the people and fuck the police.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it just so happens that at the time it was like...

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He's like even more milk toast than like shoe on head now.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah. Well, I don't actually know. I don't watch his stuff too much.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I just see him on Twitter. I don't know. Whatever.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was gonna do hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I was like, no, no, that's old. That's old hat.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We've all heard that before. What's someone else?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, no, but we gotta go back though, you know.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're right.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're right. We have to...

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're one might say we have to go back to the past.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I remember the past so you don't have to.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have. So you don't have to the past.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Man, did you... You saw my tweet, right? You saw my tweet about...

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, the chin. His fucking beard.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His goatee that is slid like it's wispy on his chin, but it's like more built up on his neck underneath his chin.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That picture that I tweeted, it's usually like... That one, it's like particularly short.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think that picture is from... I think it's from To Boldly Flea. It's from one of the movies, but yeah.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He always... It's consistent. I think it... I'm not sure if he thinks...

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, I think he thinks it looks good. I don't think it's supposed to be like,

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I made my character look bad on purpose or anything.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But he consistently... When he's the critic, he consistently cuts his beard that way.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And the goatee extends like down under the chin, like onto the neck.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And I don't know if it's an attempt at like sculpting a face shape.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I mean, you can tell if he shaves around that area. Like he deliberately makes it that shape.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was confused because I had not noticed that. I googled image like nostalgia critic or Doug Walker.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I couldn't see an angle where that was as prevalent as the one you posted.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah. Yeah. You can't see it in Google Images because all the Google Images pictures are like head-on.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can't see it head-on. You have to see it from the side or slightly underneath.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And then you can't... You can't miss it.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hold on. It was... This was...

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm only looking at my discord because someone posted a retrospective...

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, yes. Jess from my server posted a retrospective from a YouTuber called DireGentlemen.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That is a... Dan Olsen did his thing about the wall pretty recently.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then a little after that, DireGentlemen posted this thing about the review must go on, which I didn't even know existed.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you know what that is?

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Mulan Rouge review, wasn't it?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've seen a lot of his stuff.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No. The review must go on is... I'm going to recap.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's a bunch of retrospectives on this specific topic, which I've watched like three of them like yesterday.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I just think they're so funny.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Was it just like about the drama?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No. It's more specific even than that. It's about when he did...

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Was Toboldly Flea the one where he kills the critic?

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes. That was the last canonical big stupid movie.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah. They did Toboldly Flea, killed the critic, and then this was an attempt at sort of jumping...

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yig Studio style, changing the channel to making content that nobody wanted in the form of...

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He started a new series called Demo Reel.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And he did two episodes of it. Nobody liked it.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mike Michaud, the guy that owns his character, was like, you got to go back to the thing that makes me money, dude, right now, or I'll kill you.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And he said, fuck.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So then in defeat, Revue Must Go On is basically the finale to Demo Reel, in which it is a post.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It is sort of a retroactively decided that actually Demo Reel was only like a fantasy in the mind of the critic.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And like the demonic spirit of the critic visits the main character of Demo Reel and tells him like, you're fake.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I am what's real. Bring me back. You must do it. And Doug says, no.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, I hate reviewing movies.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's so dramatic. And he does the face. He does the dreamworks face so much to be like badass.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't remember that video now that I think about it.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But it's...

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But when like...

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, it's a fake out. The nostalgia critic's back. Oh my God.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But it's really, it's really clear.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was actually based at the time.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I mean, there were definitely things to say about it.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't remember. I think I must have been, I think I must have been excited at the time because I was still a fan of his.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean, if you wanted to see more critic, if you wanted to see more critic than I'm sure you were like, yes, he's bringing it back.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But...

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A pog.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But when you really think about it and this, I'm sort of spoiling, I'm doing the opposite of burying the lead.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm kind of digging up the lead and spoiling it.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But like, basically the thesis of this video and it's, it's, it seems other videos have had the same thesis.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's like, when you hear how he talked about it at the time, it's really clear that he wanted to move away from the critic and start making original content

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and failed so spectacularly that, that demo reel and the review must go on is basically a huge, it's just a huge cope in which he on screen sort of grapples with

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and like in real time sort of convinces himself that, no, I actually really wanted to do the critic the whole time all along.

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That was just burnout.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I mean, it could be kind of half true.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I mean, the demo reel from what I remember hearing about it was just like the sorts of skits he would put in Nostalgia Critic but without the movie review aspect of it.

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So like, what if we just had a skit about like Batman doing something and I was Batman.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I went, haha.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like that, that's the extent of like the intellectual content of demo reel.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And so it's like, well, as long as I can do that while I do reviews, then I can do Nostalgia Critic again.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And that's what he's been doing.

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Terrible skits with actors dressing up in silly bad costumes on shitty green screens acting out things from the movie so they could say, ah, it's not very good, is it?

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I see those other people in his stuff, like all those other people that are in like the wall review and I'm like, what's their story?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like, what do they think about all this?

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like the post scandal, like new crop of people who are all there and all sort of really look the same.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think, well, I remember that there was a lady who was there for like a few episodes of Nostalgia Critic.

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Nostalgia Critic was like, okay, I'm ending Nostalgia Critic, I'm going to start a new show, we're going to get a studio, we're going to get actors, we're going to do skits about fucking movies or whatever.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He hired, I don't know their names, he hired the black guy and then a lady.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I know the black guy's name is Malcolm and that's the only one whose name I know.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Malcolm, yes.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's a staple, I think he generally likes it but he seems more of a normal human being, so he gets paid so why not?

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That guy seems like a freaking nerd, that guy's got big dweeb energy.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A big old fucking dork on screen every time I see him, I want to shove him in a locker if you ask me.

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, go on.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
True, true.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
She left and to like go and do real acting work, she had like a goodbye video.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's like, yeah, I'm going to move on to like a brighter future because it was so obvious that she was like, I don't want to be stuck working under the Nostalgia Critic.

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm trying to get an acting career going, so I'm gone and then there was a new lady.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This was a lady who was on like three episodes of Nostalgia Critic, he said.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
She was on, I think she was on Demoreal and then on like a few episodes of Nostalgia Critic, maybe for one, maybe for a year.

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can't remember exactly and then she left and then there was the new lady, the shorter one.

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
She's been there for years afterwards.

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This was pre-scandal or post-scandal?

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think this was pre-scandal, the not so awesome document, yeah.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Definitely pre-scandal, I think she was just like, oh god, this sucks.

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I kind of want a different acting job and thank fuck, I found something, I'm gone.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Goodbye.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's not the Dire Gentleman video, there's another video that he links by a YouTuber called LadyEmily,

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
called the Failure of Channel Awesome's Demoreal, that is more specifically in depth about what the series is.

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's a part where the lady in Demoreal goes on what seems to be a sort of improvised and presumably heartfelt rant

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
about how people don't take women in acting seriously and how it bothers her.

131
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And so I can believe that maybe this was someone who was really serious about acting,

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
who Doug picked up from a, I don't know, a casting call service or something,

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and maybe she was getting started and then after a while she was like,

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
this isn't the legit gig I was looking for when I signed up for this, I've had enough.

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Which does make it curious why Malcolm is still there after all this time.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Could he not escape or did he actually enjoy it? That's the question.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean, I've heard people say that Malcolm is pretty much just like a normie,

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
like I don't think Malcolm is like an aspiring actor or anything, like he's just a guy.

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've heard he's a furry too.

140
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, it was, we talked about Fena and The Wall Review last week

141
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and then I think it was Discount Gumshoe and my server was talking about it

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and people were saying that the word on the street is that Malcolm is a furry

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and that Doug probably knew about Fena from Malcolm.

144
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's like, people think that's the connection there and I don't know.

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is just what I hear.

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
How embarrassing, it's true.

147
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I mean, well, I don't know.

148
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, he'd have to hear about it.

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Imagine knowing Fena.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, yeah, I mean, sure.

151
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I mean, yeah, I'd never heard of this person before The Wall.

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I wonder what Fena thinks about, like I wonder if being in The Wall Review

153
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
has been like a net positive?

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Because like, I'm sure that tons of people would never have known about Fena.

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know, like there's a niche that surely would have known

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but I'm sure there's a whole new audience that is aware of it.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But I think that like the number of people who, of all the people who learned of Fena

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
from The Wall Review, most people probably hate it.

159
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, they're...

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I mean, you were talking about the Nostalgia Critic fan base,

161
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
like the people who actually watch every video and enjoy them.

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But The Wall Review transcended just the fan base.

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like The Wall Review made it a wider impact than that.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That was largely not good, you know?

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, absolutely.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But like of the Nostalgia Critic fan base,

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think more of them than less of them would have like seen Fena

168
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and been like, ah, interesting.

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe so.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Maybe going to check them out.

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I wonder if the kind of person who's still like an unironic

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that guy with a glasses fan in, you know...

173
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
God, when did that The Wall Review drop out?

174
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, it's older than that, right?

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think it was 2020.

176
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, let me check.

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Wait, this is crazy.

178
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's crazy.

179
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Maybe it was 2019.

180
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh no, it was September 2019.

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean, I wonder if the kind of person who's still an unironic

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that guy with a glasses fan in 2019,

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
like is that Fena's demographic?

185
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Like, is there already crossover there?

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know.

187
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I just don't know.

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He talks about satellite city in The Wall Review

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
as though it's just expected that you know what that is.

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So, I mean, I don't know.

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Maybe they had already cross-pollinated and there was no...

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It could be that everyone who knew Doug already knew Fena

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
for whatever reason.

194
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And only the haters now are learned of it through that.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
God, it's so funny.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
People with no self-awareness are so funny.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm so glad.

198
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm so thankful for people like Doug.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's always been a little weird,

200
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
because I don't think Doug is totally not self-aware,

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but he does continue the show and the character

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that he does all this stuff.

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He's not 100% not self-aware.

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He's like the character of the critic

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
is an exaggerated version of himself,

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but himself is still kind of a weird guy

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and that doesn't realize how awkward he sounds

208
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in vlogs where he's talking normally.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He's sort of like,

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that's sort of a cringy nerd kind of person,

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
but I don't know.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's something about Doug

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
when he's like...

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It would be hard to think of...

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If I listened to Doug talk in any of his videos

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for more than a few minutes, it always happens.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It consistently happens.

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The one that's coming to mind is...

219
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's the Wall Review when he describes...

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
When he's like, quote,

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the movie ends on such an open vagueness.

222
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's like a weird way of constructing that sentence

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that's like, you know what he means,

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
but it's not quite right.

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And it's just the way that someone who's not very smart talks.

226
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's like, he doesn't quite...

227
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He just doesn't quite like value...

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Language enough to respect its rules.

229
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And this is a script.

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's not like he's going off the cuff

231
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and speaking off the cuff and that just came out.

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He wrote that down in a script

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and then delivered the line deliberately.

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's what he thought he should say.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's an obvious...

236
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He was there first,

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
so his clout is mostly luck-based.

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Sure.

239
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He built...

240
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then since he's got an audience,

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
it's like the amount of effort he needs to put in

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
didn't ever really need to increase.

243
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Because he got such an early big audience

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that as long as I'm wacky,

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
then it'll work.

247
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It doesn't need to be smart, really.

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Just like the Procrastinators podcast.

249
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I tell ya.

250
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I tell ya.

251
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We got our fans.

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Our expectations have been set so low.

253
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The bar is so low.

254
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
These piggies will just keep turning up every week

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and eat more slop from the trough.

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Got them.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's nothing you can do.

258
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hey, when it works, it works.

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's free.

260
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's just free.

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Rent-free.

262
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Rent-free, am I right?

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
We upload to YouTube rent-free.

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know what that means.

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I mean, we're in their heads rent-free.

266
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I mean, they think to themselves,

267
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
God, what are those guys going to talk about?

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They think to themselves, oh, God.

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What is this fucking show?

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It sucks.

271
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't like any of it.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
God, it's so bad.

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Clicks on your video.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Rent-free.

275
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Rent-free.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We think PZP.

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
More like Pussy.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They say it.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They say it to their friends, and they tell their friends,

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and that's how words spread.

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, God.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You don't want to listen to this podcast.

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's bad.

284
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It sucks.

285
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's right, but that's just how we get it.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We're so bad that you can't shake it,

287
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
that you just can't stop.

288
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
God, I heard like five seconds of that one podcast,

289
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and I just keep thinking about how annoying it was,

290
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
how annoying.

291
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is called the PZP?

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I got a complaint about it.

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey, make an angry review of our podcast.

294
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Make a video talking about the fall of the PZP,

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and about how it's bad now.

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It used to be good, but it's bad now.

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And then post it on Reddit.

298
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There are people, I forgot we have a subreddit.

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I also never ever check it, but yes.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I used to look at it occasionally,

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and then the other day, someone linked me one of the,

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
it was tectonic improv, actually.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He wanted to mention something to me,

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and to illustrate his point,

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
he linked me to a thread on the PZP Discord server,

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and I was like, oh, my God, that's right.

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We have one of those.

308
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Is it r slash the pro...

309
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
r slash the pro...

310
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, it's r slash the pro procrastinators.

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Still somewhat active, believe it or not.

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Unbelievable.

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Wait.

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
New threads every few days.

316
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There they go.

317
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There they freaking go.

318
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm actually...

319
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Shit.

320
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We could read this on stream.

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I mean, there's not...

322
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Someone asked, Ben, Davoo, and Trixie,

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
parentheses did you used to live together, right?

324
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Uh, yes.

325
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Steve, Steve Nuge, the answer is yes.

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Um...

327
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Is anyone, is anyone, is anyone subbed

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to best guy ever's Patreon?

329
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Does he go into detail about the recent PZP

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Canton situations in his solo podcast?

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Uh, I don't know.

332
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, this isn't...

333
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is actually not...

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is all stuff that you could know.

335
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If you just listened to our four hour podcast

336
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
where we answer voicemails for two and a half hours,

337
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it would be easy.

338
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There'd be no need.

339
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There'd be no need to suffer through the wasteland

340
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that is r slash the pro procrastinators.

341
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But, I mean, you do you, I guess.

342
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah.

343
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, and I'm a moderator.

344
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's cool.

345
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know, speaking of our crumbling, dying show

346
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
where we are in the grave,

347
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
both feet in the grave, hands in the grave,

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
only our mouths are sticking out of the ground

349
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and that's how we're talking.

350
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Sucking air, yeah, sucking air and talking a little bit.

351
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I am a little bad in medical ways.

352
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm okay for this show.

353
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, you're still sick, huh?

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, the fact that I'm still sick is the problem.

355
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to the hospital tomorrow morning

356
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
with like a...

357
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I printed out a list of like tests that a doctor said,

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you should get these tests done

359
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
just to make sure we know what is going on with you

360
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
because this shouldn't have been going on for so long.

361
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because I had, I'd gone to the hospital already.

362
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'd taken medicine for the thing

363
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and it hasn't cleared up.

364
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, if this is maybe the last time you'll ever hear

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
on the internet, I'll die in fact.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No, no, no.

367
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No, no, I wouldn't...

368
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If I was actually dying...

369
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know, I think the worst thing it could be

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is like diabetes out of nowhere.

371
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Diabetes?

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Because I've been like dehydrated

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and being unable to keep water,

374
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
getting into my body no matter how much I drink.

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That feels like...

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is that a diabetes thing?

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's a diabetes thing.

378
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's like a kidney thing.

379
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I've been looking up a lot of things.

380
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's like, what is exactly going on with me?

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's basically been the last week.

382
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's like...

383
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I got...

384
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It sucks.

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It sucks, but it's all been on my mind.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't want to get too scared

387
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
because you know how it is.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You look on medical sites, you say,

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
so I have this one thing.

390
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The worst possible things it could be are at the top.

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You look up...

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
My tongue's kind of itchy.

393
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You go on WebMD and it's like...

394
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Tongue cancer.

395
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Brain cancer.

396
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

397
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So, I've narrowed it down to a few things it could be,

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
but I'm obviously not a professional,

399
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
so I'm just going to go to the hospital,

400
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
say, please figure out what's wrong with me.

401
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't know what to do, and then they'll go, okay.

402
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So, are you just dehydrated all the time

403
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and that's the issue?

404
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Kind of, but it's like a gastrointestinal something or other.

405
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's maybe something wrong with my kidney.

406
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There's something causing the dehydration.

407
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't know whether that's linked to whatever's happening

408
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
with my kidney.

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I don't even know whether my kidney is involved.

410
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Dehydration causes kidney problem because if you're dehydrated,

411
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
your kidney has no...

412
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It gets fucked up because it needs...

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Your kidney has to filter your blood or whatever

414
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and dehydration makes it less dilute,

415
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
which makes it more concentrated

416
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
in whatever bullshit it's got to do.

417
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, the thing with diabetes, I skimmed it,

418
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
so I'm not entirely sure.

419
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I couldn't recite what is diabetes,

420
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but I think what it is is the water goes straight through you

421
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
without getting absorbed into the body

422
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
because the kidney is trying and failing

423
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
to do something with the blood sugar level,

424
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and so it thinks, oh, I've got to flush something out.

425
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's too much sugar here.

426
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I've got to flush it out.

427
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You go to the toilet more often,

428
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
but the water doesn't stay in you,

429
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
so you don't get hydrated even if you drink

430
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
like more than two liters of water a day.

431
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And that's what's been happening.

432
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm dehydrated right now as I'm drinking.

433
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It sucks.

434
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know what to do about it.

435
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you take like a multivitamin or anything?

436
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I take the multivitamin tablet thing a couple times.

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Maybe I could take one out a day.

438
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
A couple times.

439
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't know.

440
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, I don't know how bad or good it was doing.

441
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Maybe I should just be doing it anyway.

442
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I mean, I feel like almost everyone

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
should take multivitamins.

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
There's basically almost no reason not to.

445
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I guess what I was thinking is I didn't want to...

446
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Multivitamins, they say on them is like,

447
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
it's not a food substitute.

448
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's like to go with food.

449
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
If I eat the right food,

450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
it should actually clear up the problem.

451
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If I just take multivitamins all the time,

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I might be just sort of delaying something

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
instead of actually fixing anything.

454
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And so I've been trying to eat better.

455
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I've been cooking spinach and whatever.

456
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sure.

457
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But if you're like, maybe before,

458
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
maybe you were eating bad

459
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and you were getting 25% of the vitamins you could be getting,

460
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
but then you're like, I'm going to eat better.

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And then it's like, okay, now I'm getting 75%.

462
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's like, okay, great.

463
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But if you take the multivitamin,

464
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
then that's guaranteed 100%.

465
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So why not?

466
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I guess I should take it.

467
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I mean, I'm not sure what the correlation,

468
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the link between the vitamins and the dehydration would be.

469
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I feel like vitamin deficiency

470
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
might result in not being able to retain water.

471
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know.

472
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I could be wrong.

473
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There's such a thing as being pre-diabetic,

475
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
which is like you're not actually diabetic,

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
but you're like at risk of it.

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So I don't know.

478
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's probably good to find out sooner.

479
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So maybe if you're in some stage of pre-diabetes,

480
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
something can be done about it.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It would be a shame if you let it sit

482
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
and you just became diabetic when you didn't have to.

483
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, that's why I'm going to go to the hospital.

484
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But that's basically the reason why

485
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't have anything to talk about this week

486
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
is because basically every day it's just been like,

487
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
oh, I'm still ill.

488
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
God, I've got to do something about that.

489
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, jeez, I'm so weak.

490
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I feel like I can't move.

491
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I can barely do stuff.

492
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, I did something, but it's like 6 p.m.

493
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Maybe I should call a doctor.

494
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, jeez, Rick.

495
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, boy.

496
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And that's been it.

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's all I've been trying to do.

498
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm just trying to exist.

499
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I mean, I've been procrastinating

500
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
on making that dentist appointment.

501
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I've been saying for a long time,

502
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I've got to go to the dentist.

503
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I got cavities.

504
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I know I got to get them drilled.

505
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I would like to get a whitening or something on my teeth.

506
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
My teeth are looking a little dingy.

507
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I want to go to the dentist.

508
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And the last time I saw my parents, my mom,

509
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
my sweet old mom was like,

510
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
oh, here's some, don't tell your father

511
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm giving you this money.

512
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm giving you some money for a dentist appointment.

513
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't forget to schedule your dentist appointment.

514
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I said, thanks, mom, and I haven't done it.

515
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And I got these several $20 bills

516
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that she handed me sitting in my desk drawer

517
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
that I promised I would use to get a dentist appointment.

518
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And I haven't done it yet.

519
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I promise I'm going to do it.

520
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I swear, but I'm lazy.

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And I have been, I know I keep saying this.

522
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I know I keep saying this,

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
but I have been, I really am in the final stretches

524
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
of working on the secret project.

525
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It is like, I wish I could say what I've been doing with it,

526
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but that would be given the game away.

527
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm not ready to give the game away quite yet,

528
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but I am like, I'm on the cusp.

529
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm on the cusp and I've been like,

530
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that's all I've been doing the last couple of days.

531
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's really been annoying me

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
because this whole month has basically been,

533
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
okay, I'm a bit sick.

534
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I should wait until I get better, try to get better.

535
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh God, when am I going to get better?

536
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I haven't been working enough on anything.

537
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
One, because I feel like I need to rest in order to recuperate.

538
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And other times it's just because I feel so weak

539
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
that I can't even do anything.

540
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And it sucks.

541
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
My secret project is definitely on hold

542
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and that's annoying me a little bit

543
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
because it's quite close to being presentable

544
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and I can't yet do anything.

545
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Can't yet tell anyone.

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I think mine might be ready

547
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
by the time this episode comes out.

548
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I feel like I might have said that before,

549
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
but God damn it, this time I really mean it.

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
This time I really mean it.

551
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You better do it.

552
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
One of us has to have a project that isn't secret anymore.

553
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
No, I know.

554
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, but I can't say anything else about it just yet.

555
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Another unfortunate casualty of me being debilitated

556
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is that I'm probably not going to be able to draw the comic

557
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
for the deadline, the Kato Anthology.

558
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I did want to mention that I think the day this episode comes out

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
this Friday is the last day of April

560
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and I think that's the deadline for the Kato Institute.

561
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's the deadline.

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Anthology, the Kato Anthology, link in the description.

563
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
If you want to see that on the day that your submission is due.

564
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah.

565
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
On the one hand, there's like,

566
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
in order to feel good, you must set goals and complete them.

567
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, that's true.

568
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I should try and finish this goal I set

569
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
doing these six pages in a month.

570
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
For context?

571
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Surely that would be doable.

572
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
In case anyone doesn't know,

573
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
it's a comic anthology that's looking for submissions

574
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and going to submit something and it's open to everyone.

575
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Everyone's encouraged to look and then draw a comic in one day.

576
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Get it in by midnight. Bam.

577
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Do it.

578
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay, sorry.

579
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think that the best case scenario is that I go to the doctors tomorrow,

580
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
they do all the tests, they say,

581
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
okay, you have this or you don't actually have this,

582
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
but I clearly have something.

583
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So they say, here's the medication for it.

584
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I take it, I feel good.

585
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And then for the rest, I can like cram,

586
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
like drawing into the end of the month.

587
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That's like, how many days is that?

588
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So like after Monday, I've got one, two, three, four.

589
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Four days, draw six pages.

590
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Ah, geez, that's quite a lot actually.

591
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Because I've got to draw and then color them.

592
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I want them to look nice.

593
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I can fucking do that though.

594
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Four days, four full days.

595
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
As long as I feel good, then everything will be fine.

596
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But the most important thing is my health comes first.

597
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I was kind of stressing out over getting this comic done.

598
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And I've sort of, on the one hand,

599
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
dismissed the idea that I will like force myself to get it done.

600
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because at the moment, it could be bad for me to work hard.

601
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't want to get worse.

602
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But yeah, if I feel good, then I can sprint right at the end.

603
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Right on.

604
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm sure they...

605
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I feel like those guys would be super chuffed

606
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to put something of yours in there.

607
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
In that their anthology.

608
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I think they're PCP heads.

609
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think they like us.

610
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh, no.

611
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, it's true.

612
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh, yeah.

613
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Wow.

614
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Actually, they specifically asked me for one.

615
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Actually, they specifically wanted to put the white lion in there.

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Which, I don't know, if you don't know, that's a comic that I made like...

617
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
God, it must be like seven years ago now.

618
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
They were like, can we put that in the anthology?

619
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And I was like, yeah, I mean, sure.

620
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Why not?

621
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Why the heck not, my dudes?

622
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So that's what I'm putting in there.

623
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
They wanted it. They wanted to see it.

624
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I want them to see as well.

625
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah.

626
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And then I guess that will be concluding the deadlines on that.

627
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And then I got to draw the cover.

628
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I should probably draw the cover before the end of the month, actually.

629
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And then I guess they're going to be launching the Kickstarter for that soon after.

630
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Probably pretty soon after that.

631
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm not exactly sure when.

632
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, hey, I am sorry that you're feeling shitty, Gib.

633
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That sucks. And I hope they can fucking sort you out.

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah, I mean, I hope so.

635
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It was confusing because I like, at the call 111, the emergency hotline for like medical stuff,

636
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
you say, what's the problem?

637
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I tell them the problem and they say, okay, we're going to get a doctor to call you

638
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and then you can talk to the doctor on the phone about it.

639
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And I did that.

640
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I told him what was going on.

641
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I told him how long it had been.

642
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And then he said, hmm, that seems a little strange.

643
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And at that point, I was like, fuck, I've probably given him the wrong impression.

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I probably exaggerated the wrong thing, made him think it's one thing where it couldn't be like a contradicts.

645
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's like, shit, have I made an error in observing my own self and what's going on?

646
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Because that's the biggest thing I always worry about when I go to the doctors

647
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
because they ask you questions about what's been happening.

648
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And I don't know.

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I just feel bad.

650
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You just like stick a needle in me and call it like cured.

651
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Like, can you just do all of it?

652
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
No, I have to be the one to give them the information.

653
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Otherwise they can't fucking do anything.

654
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They don't know anything about what's going on.

655
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And then he says, okay, this seems a bit strange.

656
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm not sure why this would be happening.

657
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And then he gives me a bunch of tests in a text and I printed those out.

658
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And I'm going to just go to the hospital and give them.

659
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm going to go up to the lady or the man or whoever is at the front desk and say please.

660
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know what these papers mean.

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
There's just loads of words on them.

662
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They just say test.

663
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Just do them.

664
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Please just do these tests.

665
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know where I am.

666
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

667
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then they'll be like, okay, shut up, calm down, go to the waiting room.

668
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's probably what's going to happen.

669
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I get a little anxious about like doing it properly because I'm like, oh God,

670
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
what if I go to the wrong hospital?

671
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
What if they want me to go to this other hospital that's closer to where I used to live?

672
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Because that's where my name is on record still.

673
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do they want me to go to a specific hospital?

674
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Can I just go to a hospital and say please?

675
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I have no idea how this is going to work,

676
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
but I'm sure they will be able to point me in the right direction anyway.

677
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And it shouldn't be a problem.

678
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I should stop worrying about it.

679
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And you know, the best thing is I don't need to worry about it cussing anything.

680
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's the main thing.

681
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I just need to be socially anxious and awkward in real life and that's the main problem.

682
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And then they're going to stick with me.

683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Rub it in.

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Rub it in, why don't you?

685
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah, yeah, you know, I'm just like, you know, I'm going to patch up as good as new

686
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and I'm going to be fucking rich because of it.

687
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They're going to give me money, in fact.

688
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They're going to give me money.

689
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Fucking communist Europe.

690
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They pay you to get sick.

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Why would you want to incentivize that?

692
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We need innovation, not infection.

693
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
That's my slogan that I'm going to run for fucking governor of, I don't know,

694
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
some shithole Southern state on.

695
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The, the, the, you know, that remind, remember, stop me if I've talked told you this before,

696
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
but remember when I got the kidney stone and I went to the hospital and then I got a bill.

697
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
They sent, they sent me a, yeah, they sent me a bill for like $6,000.

698
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Because I didn't have insurance.

699
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, they sent me a bill for like $6,000 because they didn't have insurance.

700
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And then I was like, well, I'm just going to ignore this.

701
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

702
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
No, this is not, this is not necessarily smart, but this is what I did.

703
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I said, like, I'm just going to kind of hope this goes away.

704
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I didn't, no, this, this story has a surprise ending.

705
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Well, I mean, you know, the story goes on.

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Who knows if it's actually over, but I think it has a surprise.

707
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
A surprise ending.

708
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This, so I was like, I just, I just, I, this must be a joke, you know, $6,000 for like

709
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
spending like three hours in a hospital bed.

710
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This is like a joke.

711
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And I think it's stupid.

712
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I'm just going to ignore it.

713
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm laughing.

714
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
God.

715
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So it's $6,000.

716
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Presumably it would have been less because if I had insurance, because like the insurance

717
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
companies have covered something and also like insurance companies just have like, they

718
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
have it all like pre worked out.

719
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
My understanding is that hospitals just have like unbelievably huge prices that things

720
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
cost all the time.

721
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But like insurance companies just have it all sort of pre negotiated that it's like

722
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
less than that.

723
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So they don't have to pay what a normal human has to pay because it's just, and it's

724
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
just expected that everybody has insurance.

725
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Something.

726
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So if you don't, it's like your quadruple fuck.

727
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But so yeah, I got a bill for $6,000.

728
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then I was like, ignore it.

729
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And then like weeks later, I get a bill from a collections agency that's like, no, we're

730
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
we're fucking serious.

731
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We got a fucking, you got to send us this money.

732
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I was like, um, okay, I'm scared.

733
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So I went and I Googled it and they can't, it's not like a charging interest.

734
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I believe it's illegal to charge interest on a medical bill, at least in Massachusetts.

735
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It is.

736
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So I'm like, it's not like I'm losing more money by not paying it.

737
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So I'm just, I'm just going to ignore it and, and just see what happens because I'm

738
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
like, I don't think the situation will can get any worse.

739
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The worst thing that can happen is I take like a credit hit, like my credit score goes down

740
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
because I don't pay this bill.

741
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But I think that it worked and the bill is gone.

742
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And I, the reason why I think this is because at some point I was browsing Twitter and I

743
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
saw like a, a TikTok, I think a reposted TikTok of someone asks, what is something you know

744
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
about?

745
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Like what's a law that you know about that feels illegal or something you, you learned

746
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that feels illegal to know.

747
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
The guy answers and he says, in America, most hot or hospitals are nonprofits.

748
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Technically, which means that by law, they must have a charity care clause, which means

749
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,500
that if you are poor to a certain degree, they are obligated to give you care without

750
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,000
making you pay for it.

751
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,500
And I think that maybe I, because this was like a couple of years ago, I was making like

752
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
$12,000 a year or something.

753
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
So like very, very little.

754
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
I think I definitely was below the poverty line.

755
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Definitely would have, if anyone would have qualified for that, I think I would have.

756
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
So I think I just technically qualified for charity care.

757
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,500
And probably the reason why I haven't heard anything about this bill in months is that

758
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,000
the collections agency in the hospital were like, if they did any digging on my finances

759
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,500
at all, looked at my tax records at all, they were like, oh, this guy doesn't make any money.

760
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,500
He's like, he cleared the bar that we like legally can't charge him this money.

761
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,000
I think I won.

762
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,500
I think I beat the system.

763
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
All you gotta do is to be very poor.

764
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
It got him.

765
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,500
I'm not going to say, I don't know, how do I say it?

766
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
It does make certain problems go away.

767
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
It does.

768
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,500
I'm not being poor enough.

769
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Yeah, it's weird though.

770
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:24,500
Imagine if I had made like a few more thousand dollars a year.

771
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Again, this is just what I think happened and maybe tomorrow I'll get another letter

772
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
that like this collections agency is garnishing my wages or something.

773
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I kind of don't want to look into it because I don't want to kick the hornet's nest on this.

774
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Maybe they're just really busy with shit and it's COVID and now they have all these claims

775
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,500
and I'm just low on the priority list and they'll get me in due time or something.

776
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,500
I mean, it's one of those things where it's like, in order to follow up on something like this,

777
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,500
they need people hired to do all of that digging and finding you and asking you and like sending

778
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,500
a tough guy around to your house to like put the kidney stone back, like shove it down your throat.

779
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,500
Shove it up my dick again.

780
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Well, I mean, that's what a collection agency is.

781
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:23,500
A collection agency is the fact that such a thing exists is like humanity truly exists in a fallen state.

782
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,500
If you're a business, you're like, hmm, well, this guy owes me money,

783
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,500
but collecting on it would be work.

784
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,500
One of our employees would have to contact this guy.

785
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,500
We have all these legal, we have to send them a certain number of notices

786
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,500
and give a certain amount of notice before filing suit against them and that's all labor.

787
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,500
So we're going to outsource that labor of harassing this guy for the money that he owes us

788
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,500
and in return we give them a cut, basically, is what a collection agency is.

789
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,500
And so you would think that they'd be prepared to do that work unless there's some legal technicality

790
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,500
that means that I actually don't have to pay it, which means that they won't get anything

791
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,500
or there's just other, there's so many other claims that they think are either for more money

792
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,500
or are more likely to actually pay out that they're going to prioritize them over me.

793
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I would imagine that even if you are liable to pay.

794
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
It's kind of the same principle that lets you get away with shoplifting

795
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
because a lot of the time the minimum wage employees that work at a store,

796
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
it's just not worth their time.

797
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
They're not paid to stop you from stealing.

798
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,500
So I think a lot of the time, even if they saw you doing it, they're not going to do anything

799
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,500
because why would they?

800
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,500
This is a principle that holds true across society.

801
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,500
If there is some legal precedent for like sometimes if somebody's poor enough,

802
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
you can't collect from them, that would sort of dissuade collection agencies

803
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,500
from following up on leads that would require money

804
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,500
or at least it would dissuade the hospital from paying the collection agency

805
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,500
that money to go and do that work if there's a chance that you don't have the money.

806
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,500
And they're just like, it's been long enough. Fuck it.

807
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,500
We've got other things to worry about.

808
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:23,500
I don't know if this TikTok is to be believed, then it seems like I definitely...

809
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,500
You know, the TikTok says like go to the hospital's website

810
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,500
and you can look up their policies and you can find it.

811
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,500
And I never actually did that for the hospital I went to, which I should have.

812
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,500
I am tempted to do it on stream now, but it would probably take too long.

813
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
So maybe I will do that afterwards.

814
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
We're not streaming, Ben.

815
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
Whatever.

816
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Oh, but you know what? I'm going to stream because I need to pee.

817
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,500
No. No.

818
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
No.

819
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I'm going to pee. I'm going to do it.

820
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,500
God, are you still on microphone?

821
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Do I need to distract the audience for a while?

822
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,500
I'm going to give you a preview of the voicemails that are coming up.

823
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,500
The first voicemail this week is called Ben Gay.

824
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
So that's exciting.

825
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,500
By the way, I'm really relieved there's not...

826
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Let's see. Speakfibes sorts them into pages.

827
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,500
How many per page? It's 20 per page.

828
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Last week we had like three full pages of voicemails, so that was dog shit.

829
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Fuck all of you.

830
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
I don't care about you that much.

831
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,500
This week we've only got a page and a half, so we've got...

832
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
I'm telling them about voicemails.

833
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
This week we have a more reasonable amount.

834
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
We're back to reality.

835
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,500
So that's good.

836
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Okay.

837
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
What were we talking about?

838
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Hospitals.

839
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:02,500
I meant to check that hospital's charity care policy, but I never did.

840
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
I'm just kind of...

841
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,500
I kind of just am hoping that my theory, that that is what happened, is true.

842
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Because it would be very convenient for me if that bill just like,

843
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
eh, we technically can't make and pay that.

844
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Eh, damn.

845
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
But damn, imagine...

846
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
It's fucked up, though.

847
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
People...

848
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,500
If you have more bills, if you have a house that you got to pay taxes on,

849
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,500
and you got a family, and you got kids you got to take care of,

850
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
and you got all these...

851
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Maybe you got parents, elderly parents or something, or whatever it is,

852
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,500
that makes your expenses higher.

853
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Such that you need like a job, like a real job,

854
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
because I don't have like a quote-unquote real job.

855
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
You need...

856
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Some people got expenses that only a real job can pay for,

857
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,500
and if you are like that, you might be...

858
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,500
You might have less disposable income than I do,

859
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,500
even though you make more money,

860
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,500
and therefore also...

861
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,500
I might qualify for such a thing as this, but you don't,

862
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
because your income is higher,

863
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,500
even though you're maybe poorer than me,

864
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,500
because your money is going somewhere that you have to be putting it into.

865
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,500
And that is frustrating.

866
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
That sucks. That sucks so bad.

867
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,500
I guess it's difficult to gauge what is your disposable income,

868
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,500
because you can decide how much you want to spend on things like food.

869
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
You know, it's like...

870
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
To an extent.

871
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,500
It's like you could go out to fancy restaurants, I guess.

872
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
There's a...

873
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
I would say...

874
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
There's an upper and lower limit to these things.

875
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,500
I mean, I would say if you are making a choice to spend more on food

876
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
than you need to be spending on food,

877
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,500
then I would say that that extra you're spending is part of your disposable income.

878
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:11,500
I guess, but what is the threshold for the minimum amount of food money?

879
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,500
What if you just live in a place where the food is a little more expensive?

880
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
It would be what...

881
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
Well, I mean, you can't really...

882
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Yeah, I would say it's...

883
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
I don't know.

884
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
The minimum amount of food you have to spend is what I spend.

885
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,500
They sell food per dollar to calorie ratios.

886
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
I wish they did.

887
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
That's how I choose what I buy.

888
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
I looked because I looked it up and I'm like,

889
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,500
ah, no, this pack of like three dozen hot dogs from Costco

890
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,500
is like the best calorie two dollar ratio.

891
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:52,500
So now what I eat for half my meals is two hot dogs and a slice of cheese.

892
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
It's good.

893
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
It's good. I like it.

894
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Fuck.

895
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
What was I saying?

896
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
No, I had a thought.

897
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Oh, I don't know.

898
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Yeah, some people can make...

899
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,500
You can make more money, but still...

900
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Oh, because Bernie, it's like Bernie always said,

901
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,500
you know, most people in America, like they can't afford a $500 expense.

902
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,500
And then that includes people who are like working jobs.

903
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500
They work harder than I do.

904
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,500
They probably make more money than me,

905
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,500
but they also have expenses it goes to.

906
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,500
And those people would be completely fucked if they had a kidney stone

907
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:40,500
because suddenly they would be hit with a $6,000 hospital bill

908
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:48,500
and they wouldn't have what I hope is a genuine ability to wriggle out of it

909
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,500
through a financial technicality that I'm hoping that I have successfully done.

910
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,500
This is a real sword of Damocles right here.

911
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
For who?

912
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
$6,000 sword over you.

913
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
You're not sure whether it's there.

914
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,500
It's like a shrodinger sword, sword of Damocles.

915
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,500
You're right.

916
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,500
I assume it's no longer there, but if I...

917
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Yeah, I'm like, hmm, you know, if I...

918
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Imagine you're Damocles and you're just like,

919
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,500
I haven't seen that sword in a while.

920
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,500
No one's mentioned it in a while, so maybe it's not hanging over me.

921
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
I just won't look up.

922
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
I'm just not going to look up because, you know, if it is there,

923
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
I don't want to know about it.

924
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,500
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

925
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,500
I will look...

926
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,500
I'm going to look up the hospital's policy and see if I can find it

927
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,500
because the TikTok said...

928
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,500
No, this TikTok says I'm good.

929
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
No, this TikTok says that I'm going to be okay.

930
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Maybe look up the rule, like the law that they said in the TikTok

931
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
instead of looking at the TikTok again.

932
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Yeah, well, the TikTok says...

933
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,500
The TikTok says where to look for these policies,

934
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
so I should do that.

935
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,500
Just?

936
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Definitely.

937
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Just to see.

938
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Yes.

939
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
I mean, I guess in the way you put it,

940
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:12,500
is looking it up the policies would be looking up at the sword of Damocles

941
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,500
to check whether it's there and you don't want to do that.

942
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Yeah, I mean...

943
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
But you should do it.

944
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
God.

945
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
I mean, I could...

946
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,500
I mean, the real look would be like...

947
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,500
I could literally call the hospital or contact the collections agency

948
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,500
to ask, do I still owe you all that money?

949
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,500
But no, I'm not going to do that.

950
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
No.

951
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,500
No.

952
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
No fucking way.

953
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Everyone told me...

954
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Especially looking over your shoulder, seeing this as an assassin,

955
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
a kidney stone assassin.

956
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,500
My parents told me...

957
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,500
To sure it can up your dick again.

958
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,500
My parents told me, like, Ben, you got to pay that bill

959
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
because, like, you know, they're going to charge you interest

960
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
or, like, oh, it's going to affect your credit score.

961
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
But I think they were wrong.

962
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I think I fucking outsmarted it.

963
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,500
They told me, like, oh, Ben, your aunt is an accountant.

964
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
Contact your aunt.

965
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
She can help you pay the bill.

966
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
She can help you get a payment plan.

967
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,500
You know, they'll have...

968
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
They're happy to get anything.

969
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,500
You can agree to a payment plan that's only, like, $20 a month or something.

970
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,500
And I was like, oh, okay, I don't want to pay $20 a month,

971
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
but, like, I guess if it's that or nothing, I guess I'll do it.

972
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
I think I...

973
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
And now I'm glad.

974
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,500
I'm kind of glad that I didn't do what everyone told me

975
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
was the responsible thing,

976
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,500
which is contact the hospital,

977
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,500
get on a payment plan for $20 a month.

978
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,500
I think I wriggled out of the whole thing.

979
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,500
I think I fucking warmed my way out of...

980
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Even the mildest of consequences.

981
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
The furtive Ben St. so easily forgotten.

982
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
For the audacity...

983
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,500
For the audacity of having a kidney stone

984
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
that I needed to...

985
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
That I was in such extreme pain for that I had...

986
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,500
They put me on a morphine drip for it.

987
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I survived.

988
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
I think...

989
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,500
The bill included things like a scan.

990
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,500
And I honestly don't remember them, like, doing a scan.

991
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,500
Like, some sort of, like, magnetic imaging to, like, see, like, is my kidney...

992
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Is my fucking ureter blocked by a kidney?

993
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
I don't remember them doing a scan.

994
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
The bill says that they did,

995
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,500
and that's what cost, like, several of the thousands of dollars.

996
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,500
It's horseshit. It's bullshit if that's true.

997
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
But, like, that's what they said.

998
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,500
I don't know.

999
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,500
I don't know, but every time, every time, like,

1000
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
one of my parents, like, brings up,

1001
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
they're like, did you ever contact the hospital?

1002
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
I'm like, no.

1003
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Well, I did, I did for a while, because I was at...

1004
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
I did a few times to contest the bill.

1005
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
To be like, I called them up and I'm like,

1006
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
it says that I got a scan.

1007
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
I don't think you gave me a scan.

1008
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
I'm pretty sure that's a false charge.

1009
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,500
I'm pretty sure you just, like, charged me for a scan that you never did.

1010
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Is that true? I don't know.

1011
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I could have been zonked out on morphine and they did it,

1012
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
and I don't even remember.

1013
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
That's possible.

1014
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,500
I'm just gonna go with the narrative that this is a fake charge that they fucked up.

1015
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,500
I'm gonna gum up the works by contesting as much as this as I can

1016
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,500
before it moves on to, like, they're garnishing my wages

1017
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
and taking me to court or whatever.

1018
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
So I did that, and then I contested it.

1019
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
They were like, okay, we'll look into it,

1020
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,500
and then I never heard from them again.

1021
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Never heard from the collections agency again.

1022
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,500
So I could call them up and be like,

1023
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
hey, whatever happened with that dispute I filed,

1024
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,500
but no, I won't.

1025
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I don't know. I feel like I won.

1026
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
I guess it's a good thing that nobody listens to the PCP,

1027
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,500
otherwise they'll find out if this was like a Matt and Mega podcast.

1028
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Fucking HR person, like some pencil pusher at that hospital

1029
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
is like listening to this show and they're like, wait a minute,

1030
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
that's that one guy.

1031
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
That's that guy. I have his file right here.

1032
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I remember that voice of that Ben St.

1033
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
What a, I don't know.

1034
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Fingers crossed, I guess.

1035
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Fingers crossed that I scraped by.

1036
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
I don't know, man. I don't know.

1037
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,500
You know, I got a different topic.

1038
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,500
I got something to talk about.

1039
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
I said I didn't have anything to talk about this week,

1040
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
but I got something.

1041
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Maybe this is like stupid,

1042
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,500
but I was thinking about my characters from Veilhape.

1043
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,500
We got Pump, we got Alleyoop,

1044
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,500
we got Siby,

1045
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
and then we got Tiki,

1046
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
and I was thinking, hmm,

1047
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
the blue lady, yes.

1048
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,500
Oh, Tiki, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
Is Sib the little purple thing?

1050
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Siby's the little purple guy, yeah.

1051
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1052
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Siby and Tiki both, actually.

1053
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Siby less so, but I was thinking about

1054
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
how they are

1055
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
based off of video game characters

1056
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
that were themselves based off of

1057
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
sort of reductive

1058
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
racial stereotypes.

1059
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
I was realizing that Tiki

1060
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
does have a bit of a black face

1061
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
going on with her lips.

1062
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
And I was like, ah, jeez.

1063
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Wait, hold on.

1064
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Is that a bad thing?

1065
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Am I harassed?

1066
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
I mean, she looks like a Tiki mask,

1067
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
and like, I don't know,

1068
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
when I google Tiki mask,

1069
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
they kind of look like that.

1070
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
They do.

1071
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
But like, I was just thinking,

1072
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
because like, Siby is like,

1073
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
you know,

1074
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Inspiro, the little guys who have the eggs

1075
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
or whatever and you chase them

1076
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,500
they're always running away from you.

1077
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1078
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I think that is like

1079
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
an Arabian stereotype

1080
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
of some kind where it's like,

1081
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
ah, like the Middle Easterners

1082
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
with their cloaks

1083
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,500
and shrouds

1084
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
and stealing treasure

1085
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
and running around with it.

1086
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
And I'm like, ah, jeez.

1087
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Like, obviously it's not terribly racist

1088
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
in like the portrayals of the game.

1089
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Oh, these little blue guys

1090
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
with the nasty little faces.

1091
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Yeah, the little blue guys.

1092
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
It's not like a malicious, intense sort of thing.

1093
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
It's just sort of like a racial coding

1094
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
that has survived from times when they were

1095
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
I mean,

1096
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
portrayed like that in media and it's like,

1097
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
okay, I liked that game

1098
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
and I liked the little funny guys,

1099
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
but like, I realized where it comes from

1100
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
and I don't necessarily know whether it's a bad thing

1101
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
if I keep Siby.

1102
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
But Tiki's a little more like,

1103
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
I don't know,

1104
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
I don't know anything about this.

1105
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
This is just me coming to some sort of realization

1106
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
that it might be construed as a bit

1107
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
like coded

1108
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
African tribe

1109
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,500
and insensitive with the lips thing.

1110
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,500
I don't know.

1111
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,500
It was like that

1112
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
when you got canceled for the fucking

1113
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,500
tweet about

1114
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,500
how to draw

1115
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
African characters

1116
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
or like those sorts of lips

1117
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
in anime or whatever.

1118
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
The Usob tweet.

1119
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
I was realizing that Tiki has those lips.

1120
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
I'm like, ah, shit.

1121
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
I got a redesigner, but I was trying to redesign her.

1122
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
I couldn't figure out exactly

1123
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,500
what would be the best way to do it.

1124
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
I don't know.

1125
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
What do you think? What do you think about all that?

1126
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Well, isn't

1127
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,500
I mean, Tiki masks

1128
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,500
are a Hawaiian thing, right?

1129
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
They have

1130
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
similar like African masks,

1131
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,500
but

1132
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
it's a different style.

1133
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
This thing in my head at the time

1134
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
is like Tiki totems

1135
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,500
and also African masks

1136
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,500
and

1137
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
it's sort of Akua Kuu from Crash Bandicoot

1138
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
and the Shaman from Populous

1139
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
the Beginning.

1140
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Tiki.

1141
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Let's see.

1142
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Is there like a Wikipedia page

1143
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
on Tiki masks? I don't even know

1144
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,500
like what

1145
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,500
I think they're Hawaiian.

1146
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Tiki masks are Hawaiian

1147
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
but they don't look like

1148
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
they're a little different.

1149
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
They seem to have a lot of open mouths

1150
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
like screaming.

1151
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
When I Google it

1152
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
I'm not sure

1153
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
which of these images

1154
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
are authentic

1155
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,500
what does a Tiki mask

1156
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,500
historically look like

1157
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
versus what is

1158
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
an image someone made based on

1159
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
maybe like a bastardized

1160
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
sort of

1161
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,500
version that

1162
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
a pop culture conception

1163
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
of what it is.

1164
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
So I don't know.

1165
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
I mean, I feel like

1166
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
the general gist is pretty

1167
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
clear.

1168
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
If she's supposed to be Hawaiian

1169
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
and she's got big lips like

1170
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
the masks and the masks

1171
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
have that

1172
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
I mean

1173
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,500
Usopp is actually supposed to be

1174
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,500
half black so I don't know

1175
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
there's the

1176
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,500
I really hate this

1177
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,500
I really hate this whole thing.

1178
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,500
I know

1179
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,500
I kind of hate it as well

1180
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
but I can't see it now.

1181
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
I guess I'm just sort of like

1182
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
I'm wondering about

1183
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
the right thing to do

1184
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
because like

1185
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,500
obviously my intent was

1186
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
pure I did not

1187
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,500
in any way

1188
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
it didn't mean it to be like

1189
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
racially coded in a bad way

1190
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
because Tiki is cool so I like her anyway

1191
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,500
so it's not even like a negative

1192
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,500
stereotype it's just that

1193
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
she looks kind of like

1194
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,500
the lips thing the fish lips

1195
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,500
as they say.

1196
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
I mean it's not even her human face

1197
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
it's like a wooden mask

1198
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
true yes

1199
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
I do have a canon face underneath

1200
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,500
so it's not like

1201
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
it's not like you drew a human

1202
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,500
with like exaggerated

1203
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
you know gollywag lips

1204
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
this is like a mask

1205
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
from a culture

1206
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
which again I'm not exactly sure

1207
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,500
what the masks look like

1208
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,500
native historically

1209
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,500
well there's so many types

1210
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
I guess it's sort of

1211
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,500
mostly it's very simplified

1212
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,500
in my drawing

1213
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,500
but like the

1214
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,500
meant to depict faces for various reasons

1215
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,500
so many different types

1216
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,500
of cultures

1217
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,500
all over the world I think

1218
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
some African masks are like

1219
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
the equivalent of like the Greek

1220
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
happy

1221
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
and sad faces for like theater

1222
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
so it's just sort of a thing

1223
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,500
it's just like an exaggerated version of a face

1224
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,500
I don't know

1225
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
I don't think anybody

1226
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
would ever have a problem with it

1227
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,500
but maybe there's a chance

1228
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,500
so like there's maybe a way to

1229
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
to

1230
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,500
like change her design

1231
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,500
in a way that's just slightly

1232
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,500
less bad or

1233
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
slightly more good or I don't know

1234
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,500
if you're a viewer of the Procrastes

1235
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
podcast you should read

1236
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,500
and then tell me what you think

1237
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,500
of this

1238
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
I think

1239
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,500
I'm gonna

1240
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,500
risk a slightly controversial opinion

1241
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
here but I think

1242
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
that maybe if no one

1243
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
has been offended

1244
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
that it's not worth

1245
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
thinking

1246
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
about how to avoid offense

1247
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
I don't know unless it's like

1248
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,500
unless you know for sure

1249
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,500
that something would bother people

1250
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,500
why even worry about it

1251
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,500
and I mean usually the way that you know

1252
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
that is because someone says

1253
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
I am bothered by this

1254
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,500
well I

1255
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,500
I mean I'm going mostly off of the

1256
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,500
the tweet thread

1257
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
with the people talking about the lips

1258
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
I'm like yeah I guess that is

1259
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,500
like even if it's unintentional

1260
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
even if it's like just how it is

1261
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
for the record I don't

1262
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,500
I don't think I was completely

1263
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
wrong in what I was trying to say

1264
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,500
I just think I said it in an overly

1265
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,500
hostile way

1266
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
which is needless

1267
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
yeah

1268
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
but regardless

1269
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
the main guy, the first guy

1270
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
sort of had a point and at least some people

1271
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
they just

1272
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
react to these things in a way

1273
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
so it's like

1274
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,500
obviously belljap is very very very

1275
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
niche only a small portion

1276
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
of even my fanbase has read it

1277
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
so it's like

1278
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
like if there were

1279
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,500
people who didn't like it

1280
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,500
they probably haven't just found them yet

1281
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,500
like they probably haven't found me

1282
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,500
I don't know

1283
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,500
you could

1284
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
ugh god

1285
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
I

1286
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
I just think that if there's

1287
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,500
since I

1288
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,500
have an inkling that maybe it could be

1289
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500
a problem

1290
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,500
it's not that I

1291
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,500
want to avoid cancel culture

1292
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
before it happens or anything because like whatever

1293
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
um

1294
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
it's that I want to

1295
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
just solve the

1296
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,500
problem before it becomes one

1297
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,500
before somebody finds it to be offensive

1298
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,500
if you know what I mean

1299
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,500
um

1300
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,500
yeah

1301
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500
like I can see that it's like

1302
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,500
it's on the level

1303
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,500
it's on what do you call it

1304
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,500
on the boundaries of like potentially

1305
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,500
being a thing

1306
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
it's not like I could be destroyed

1307
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
by this character design or anything

1308
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
I just feel like it's like

1309
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
it's

1310
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
what's the word?

1311
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
it's pushing it

1312
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,500
if you were worried about getting in trouble

1313
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
I would say don't

1314
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
nothing bad is going to happen

1315
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
if you're worried about like

1316
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
yeah okay

1317
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
if you're worried about like is this

1318
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
perpetuating something I don't want to perpetuate

1319
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,500
then I don't know maybe

1320
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,500
I mean yeah I'm sure you could probably

1321
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,500
take a little bit to just to not even

1322
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
remind

1323
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
anyone of that it wouldn't take

1324
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
it wouldn't even take that much I don't think

1325
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
I don't know exactly how you do it

1326
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,500
yeah I mean I was

1327
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
I was trying for a bit and I was like

1328
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
coming up to a brick wall I had like some

1329
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,500
little ideas where it's be like

1330
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,500
changing

1331
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,500
the reason I drew it like that in the first place

1332
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
is just because it's the easiest way

1333
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,500
to depict a like

1334
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,500
a lip

1335
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
shape but bigger

1336
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,500
and I didn't really think about what that was implying

1337
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,500
potentially

1338
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,500
but like if you look at like masks

1339
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
they don't all have

1340
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,500
I mean the tiki masks

1341
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,500
I wasn't really going for them even though she's

1342
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
cool tiki which is kind of like another thing

1343
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,500
it was like conflating

1344
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
just like oh it's tribal so it's like it's

1345
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
multiple whatever cultures

1346
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,500
just throw them all together

1347
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,500
it's mostly a video game character thing

1348
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,500
than it is like a cultural

1349
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
thing and that's I feel like that was a mistake

1350
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
well not

1351
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,500
a terrible mistake but like it's something

1352
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
I can work on to like

1353
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
if I'm gonna draw from real life

1354
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
culture in the future

1355
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
I should be a little more accurate

1356
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,500
with it so that it's not like a character

1357
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,500
of that culture

1358
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,500
you know what I mean

1359
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,500
yeah I guess

1360
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
I guess it's a common pitfall

1361
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
that uh

1362
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,500
yeah you're right

1363
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,500
yeah I just

1364
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
like imagine you're a

1365
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,500
you're a Maori tribesman or something

1366
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
and you see this and it's like

1367
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
this like I don't know

1368
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,500
Hawaiian or African style mask

1369
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,500
and it's like oh yeah this character's name is tiki

1370
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,500
like a tiki mask and you'd be like

1371
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
oh there's another fucking idiot

1372
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
there's another fucking idiot white person

1373
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,500
who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about

1374
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,500
yeah I mean it's true

1375
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
I really wasn't thinking about it

1376
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,500
yeah like yeah now that I can't

1377
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,500
now that I have a brain I could think about it

1378
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm like well

1379
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,500
I should just change her just change her somehow

1380
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,500
I want to keep her the same

1381
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,500
mostly I like the mask

1382
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
like rectangle head shape

1383
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
yeah the eyes are cool

1384
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,500
mm-hmm

1385
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,500
maybe her name can change

1386
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,500
I don't know whether I want to go back and like retroactively

1387
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
change Belle Jape as well

1388
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
because it's a little little edits to do

1389
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
I don't know whether it's worth it

1390
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,500
wait like what

1391
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
like every instance of her name

1392
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
if I change her name I have to

1393
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,500
I wouldn't have to but I could go back

1394
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,500
and like change it on the website

1395
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,500
I don't really know what I want to bother with that

1396
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,500
mm-hmm it could just be like

1397
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500
oh that was just a thing I did

1398
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,500
yeah I mean

1399
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,500
I don't know on the one hand

1400
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,500
yeah I don't know

1401
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
that's like

1402
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
I guess I would

1403
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,500
if you decide like the name

1404
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
is different I guess changing the character's name

1405
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,500
is one thing

1406
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,500
that would just be just basically a big

1407
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
like a find and replace job

1408
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,500
um yeah

1409
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
I don't know I'm neutral about that

1410
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,500
uh okay as long as

1411
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
as long as it's not like

1412
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,500
oh I gotta go back and I gotta like you know redraw

1413
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,500
this panel and redraw this panel and redraw this panel

1414
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
oh yeah I'm probably not gonna redraw

1415
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
yeah like that's a that's a fucking trap

1416
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,500
that's a fucking black hole

1417
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,500
and also yeah it's finished

1418
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
it's it's not like a

1419
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,500
yeah yeah

1420
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
replacing the text is simple enough

1421
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,500
it'll just take a few hours

1422
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,500
for an hour I don't know

1423
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,500
um I don't know

1424
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
her full name was tiki wiki mickey mouse

1425
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,500
which was like

1426
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,500
like supposed to be silly

1427
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,500
yeah and uh

1428
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,500
like it's a wikipedia it's mickey mouse

1429
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,500
like mickey mouse

1430
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
and her first name is tiki

1431
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
it's just like uh that's dumb

1432
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,500
that's like the sort of thing you come up with

1433
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,500
when you just sort of like uh

1434
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
name uh I don't know

1435
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
tiki wiki

1436
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
on the one hand

1437
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
I don't know

1438
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,500
I don't I don't

1439
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,500
say this to like double down on the idea

1440
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,500
that like this character is a deeply

1441
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
deeply problematic and offensive

1442
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,500
I'm not trying to do that but it is

1443
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,500
what jumps to mind is like

1444
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,500
is that name sort of like a

1445
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
ching chong ching chong ching kind of like

1446
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,500
yeah that I was thinking

1447
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
about that it's like

1448
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
I was just like

1449
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,500
when did I make that

1450
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,500
I think but because belgium was like

1451
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
I don't fucking know I'll make a comic

1452
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
I guess I started drawing stuff

1453
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
I put her in there because I wanted

1454
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
that sort of a character

1455
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
god I don't know

1456
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
she had potions hell I mean if you're

1457
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
when brood they were scientifically brood

1458
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
ooh how interesting if you're

1459
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,500
if you're serious about it I would

1460
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
say honestly I don't know

1461
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,500
if there's anyone like this that listens

1462
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,500
to the show but if anyone is

1463
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
like Maori which is where tiki

1464
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
comes from I don't like ask if you

1465
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
could find someone like that and be like

1466
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,500
what do you think about this character like is this

1467
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
does this is this like

1468
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
offensive looking is the name offensive like

1469
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,500
what could be

1470
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
changed

1471
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
it's yeah the

1472
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,500
whole thing about it being offensive like I know

1473
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,500
people will hear me talking

1474
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,500
about this and they'll be like oh you're so scared

1475
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,500
it's not there's nothing wrong with it

1476
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,500
yeah just

1477
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,500
you're just scared of the mob the twitter mob

1478
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,500
like you're just you're just

1479
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,500
look at look at give virtue signaling

1480
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
over here like yeah it's not

1481
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
I want it's that I'm I'm

1482
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,500
I'm more conscientious of these sorts

1483
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
of things than I used to be when I made it

1484
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,500
and I'm like

1485
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
I understand I understand

1486
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
the process is zero

1487
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
it's not

1488
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
okay if I if I may if I may opine

1489
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
for a moment I think what you're saying

1490
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
what I'm getting

1491
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,500
is that it's not that you're like

1492
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
afraid of the twitter mob

1493
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
afraid of being cancelled afraid of

1494
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
backlash or whatever

1495
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
and it's not that you're like oh no

1496
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
I gotta I gotta virtue signal I gotta

1497
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
show everyone how woke I am

1498
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,500
by now I gotta show ever I gotta

1499
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
show everyone how woke I am by erasing

1500
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
by erasing this

1501
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
this Polynesian representation

1502
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,500
from my media or white people

1503
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,500
only

1504
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
it's that like

1505
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
it's that you've thought about it and you've been like

1506
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
maybe this characterization

1507
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,500
to some people who know

1508
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,500
something about it

1509
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,500
maybe they would think I look stupid

1510
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
by this right

1511
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,500
yeah yeah I understand

1512
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,500
it's just there's ways to be

1513
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,500
to be more based

1514
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
about these things

1515
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,500
sure I would genuinely

1516
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,500
if you if you can find anyone I would

1517
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,500
I would ask someone who knows about this

1518
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
stuff

1519
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
I'd be curious what do they have

1520
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,500
to say about it what is their opinion

1521
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
yeah

1522
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
fascinating because then I was looking

1523
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
at like Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot

1524
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
and he is like even more

1525
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500
but like there hasn't been as much

1526
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,500
I think I found one article

1527
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
people being like

1528
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot

1529
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,500
yeah

1530
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
I don't even know what he looks like

1531
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
oh okay it's that guy

1532
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
right it's that guy he's a

1533
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
wooden mask he's got the feathers in his head

1534
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
and you know

1535
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
eyes but he's got like the big red

1536
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,500
lips and it's like he does

1537
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
he does if you never

1538
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
if you never thought about it before you may have never noticed

1539
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
but whoops

1540
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,500
yeah could be kind of

1541
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,500
could be kind of a

1542
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
could be kind of a huh moment

1543
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
so like well I don't know

1544
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
I don't know I don't know I don't know I want to

1545
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
push back on this I want to push back on this a little bit

1546
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,500
a little bit because if he's supposed

1547
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
to be

1548
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
like a fucking eastern

1549
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
what's the islander if he's supposed to be

1550
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
like an islander

1551
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
then like it doesn't make sense

1552
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
to be like that's an offensive african

1553
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
stereotype because like he's not

1554
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
I mean that's another aspect of it

1555
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,500
is the the conflation of

1556
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,500
like different cultures just because

1557
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,500
they are not western

1558
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,500
which is the thing I am also doing

1559
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
in this whole thing I'm like

1560
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
yeah you know it's only

1561
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
so based I can be I can't I can't erase

1562
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,500
all of my faults

1563
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
but like I don't know

1564
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
no certainly I think

1565
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,500
most people like most of everyone

1566
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,500
just enjoys Crash Bandicoot and it's a fun

1567
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,500
game and nobody cares about the idea of cancelling

1568
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
a ku a ku because who cares it's just like

1569
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,500
yeah you jump around you're a crazy

1570
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
fucking

1571
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,500
orange guy in that game

1572
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,500
true that's what I'm

1573
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,500
that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying

1574
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
yeah but just because

1575
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,500
it you know

1576
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,500
it's I guess it's just

1577
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
just because nobody necessarily

1578
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
gives a shit I give a shit

1579
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,500
just because nobody gives a shit

1580
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
about changing my own thing because I have the power

1581
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,500
to do it just because nobody gives a shit

1582
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,500
that's a funny thought

1583
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
what I'm trying to phrase it

1584
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,500
in a way that's making me laugh like just just because

1585
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,500
nobody gives a shit that it's wrong

1586
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,500
or something or bad

1587
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,500
doesn't mean that I

1588
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,500
that it's not a problem or I don't know

1589
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,500
it doesn't mean that it can't be

1590
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,500
fixed even though nobody thinks it's a problem

1591
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,500
it's really just like

1592
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,500
there's a way to be more based

1593
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
that that's my main thing

1594
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,500
yeah sure because it's it's lazy

1595
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
it's a lazy

1596
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,500
a cartoony like no

1597
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,500
thought put into it

1598
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,500
facsimile of that kind of a

1599
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,500
tribal

1600
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,500
mask wearing person

1601
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,500
is ticky

1602
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
there's so much

1603
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,500
more nuance to the cultures that

1604
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,500
this is very vaguely

1605
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,500
derived from that I could put into the character

1606
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
design that would be better

1607
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,500
I think

1608
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,500
yeah

1609
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,500
I can't say that there's like

1610
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
absolutely none

1611
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,500
that no aspect of it is like

1612
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
like worried about

1613
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
cancel because like

1614
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,500
there's a little bit there's a tiny little bit

1615
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
I mean that's the spark that started it

1616
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,500
nothing's gonna happen

1617
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,500
the worst literally the worst

1618
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
case scenario would be

1619
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,500
someone like

1620
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
someone repost it

1621
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,500
and is like this is a this is deeply

1622
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,500
offensive and then people

1623
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,500
say like I am yes I am offended

1624
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
and it gets spread around a lot and a bunch

1625
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
of people see it they're like this

1626
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
this give and take character

1627
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,500
this give and take character so fucking

1628
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,500
racist and then they come and they harass

1629
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,500
you about it and the New York Times

1630
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,500
and the New York Times

1631
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
literally literally and I

1632
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,500
don't say this to be like

1633
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
actually you should be more racist because

1634
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,500
it's actually gonna help you because it gets more eyes on

1635
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
you but at the same time

1636
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,500
no it's like it's literally just free publicity

1637
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,500
and then it gives you

1638
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,500
and then it get no I'm serious this is why

1639
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,500
it's bullshit all the all the right wingers

1640
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,500
that are all like the cancel mob is come

1641
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,500
for another it's all bullshit because they know

1642
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
they know that the cancel mob coming

1643
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
for you is literally just an opportunity to

1644
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
grandstand about how canceled you are

1645
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,500
and to perform

1646
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,500
and to perform

1647
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
well you have one or two choices you can either perform

1648
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,500
like an apology and have a redemption arc and

1649
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
make people like you or you can

1650
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,500
publicly defy the

1651
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,500
you know the vitriol you can publicly

1652
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,500
be like hey fuck you woke mob

1653
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
hey I'm conservative and then

1654
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
and then your fellow morons will be like

1655
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,500
I respect that so much like oh yes

1656
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,500
yeah he's pretty he's defending

1657
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,500
my western culture I love this man I'm

1658
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
gonna I'm gonna subscribe to his substack

1659
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,500
yeah it's it's it's not

1660
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
I think when I say that there's a like

1661
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,500
a little bit of me that's like worried about

1662
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
the cancel thing it's not about

1663
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,500
the mob coming after me

1664
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,500
and saying you're bad it's about

1665
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
me hurting someone in the

1666
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
first place I just rather not

1667
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
that have that happen ever

1668
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,500
if somebody has like a grievance with

1669
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,500
me or something I do that is

1670
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,500
like I don't agree with

1671
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,500
like there's no way that that could be

1672
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,500
like construed as bad

1673
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,500
it's obviously not bad and then

1674
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,500
the mob comes after me then I'll be like

1675
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,500
shut up but if it's like

1676
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,500
something like Tiki like

1677
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,500
that's kind of that's a little bit

1678
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,500
and I'd be like yeah that is a little bit

1679
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,500
I would just I would just agree with it

1680
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500
if it's a criticism like that and if

1681
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,500
I can agree with that idea

1682
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
then I think I

1683
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,500
I think it's worth working on it

1684
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500
before anything happens just because I

1685
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,500
can that makes sense

1686
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,500
yeah if you if you are thinking

1687
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,500
about it and you're like hmm

1688
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,500
here's a hypothetical criticism that

1689
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,500
someone could give me and

1690
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,500
you know what I agree with it

1691
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,500
I guess that's that says something

1692
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,500
it's

1693
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,500
like I don't know I think it's

1694
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,500
pretty pretty obvious that

1695
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,500
it could be a problem at some point for

1696
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,500
some person I'd rather it not

1697
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,500
yeah well that's it

1698
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,500
that's that's my you know

1699
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,500
get cancelled now I feel I feel like

1700
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,500
I feel like you've I feel like

1701
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,500
you're giving I feel like

1702
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,500
you're exploring the question

1703
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,500
in the in a

1704
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,500
in the in the way it

1705
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,500
deserves to be interrogated

1706
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,500
so that's good

1707
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,500
I guess

1708
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,500
good virtue signal points

1709
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,500
get mmm yeah

1710
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,500
you're 100 damn I didn't

1711
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
know Gib was so woke oh my god

1712
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,500
but

1713
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,500
if you get so if you get enough woke

1714
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,500
points you get your third eye

1715
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,500
you can start to see the the the

1716
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,500
the blood-borne beasts all over the place

1717
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
the insight finally

1718
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,500
finally

1719
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,500
you can start to you can start to

1720
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,500
um

1721
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,500
you can start to see all the offensive

1722
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
racial caricatures that we erased

1723
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
they all they start appearing

1724
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,500
like ghosts they were there

1725
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,500
all along invisible

1726
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,500
and then I get my Zenpacto

1727
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,500
and I start slaying them that's a whole

1728
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,500
other thing

1729
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,500
there's like I'm just imagining like

1730
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
you you get woke you

1731
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
get woke you go on Twitter you get woke

1732
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,500
you virtue signal about

1733
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
like you know whatever

1734
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,500
and then suddenly your third eye opens

1735
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,500
and there's just all the there's all these ghostly

1736
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,500
just like gollywogs just like

1737
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,500
I don't know

1738
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,500
lumbering around just like in your in your

1739
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,500
house

1740
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,500
I don't know

1741
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,500
they were just just waiting

1742
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,500
just waiting to be discovered

1743
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,500
oh my oh man

1744
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,500
the ghost the ghost

1745
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,500
the ghost of Aunt Jemima the ghost of Aunt

1746
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,500
Jemima is there it's like now you're ready

1747
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,500
you're ready to receive your quest

1748
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,500
I get

1749
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,500
my Zenpacto I go Bankai and it's

1750
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
reparations that's the name of the sword

1751
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,500
I don't know anything

1752
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,500
about bleach

1753
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,500
but I think it's funny

1754
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Bankai

1755
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,500
is just like the like Super Saiyan

1756
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
but Bankai

1757
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
is a super sword that you what like manifest

1758
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,500
in the spirit realm or something

1759
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,500
Zenpacto is your like spirit

1760
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,500
blade and it just does like a special

1761
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,500
something or other

1762
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,500
and then everyone's got a special

1763
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,500
second form and it's got a different

1764
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,500
special ability and it changes shape

1765
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,500
or whatever

1766
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,500
and all Zenpactos have a name

1767
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
all your swords have a name

1768
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,500
and mine would be reparations

1769
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,500
so every Zenpacto

1770
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,500
has a Bankai

1771
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,500
which is like a Super Saiyan version

1772
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,500
of the sword

1773
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,500
you have to be woke enough that's what they do in Bleach

1774
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,500
that's right that's how

1775
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,500
you unlock the it

1776
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,500
that's how you get it yes

1777
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,500
we should genuinely

1778
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,500
idea for a manga

1779
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,500
it's bleach but

1780
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,500
the way you unlock your powers is by being more

1781
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
woke

1782
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
whoever has the most virtue

1783
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
unlocks the power

1784
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,500
oh god there's a

1785
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,500
there's a story there's kind of how it is in every

1786
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,500
like hero story like you need to be

1787
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,500
the most virtuous

1788
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,500
courageous hero

1789
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,500
yes you need to say

1790
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,500
um

1791
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,500
I think things are a little fucking bad

1792
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,500
and then you get your

1793
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,500
super powers well you get

1794
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,500
no

1795
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,500
most stories like that you get super power

1796
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,500
it's not by it's not by like recognizing

1797
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
the problems in the world it's by like

1798
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
it's by like

1799
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,500
becoming I don't know

1800
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,500
protecting any given love interest

1801
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,500
or protecting your love interest

1802
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,500
oh the town is going to get flattened by

1803
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,500
a big guy with a foot

1804
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,500
I'm going to kill him oh I'm so

1805
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,500
fucking woke right now

1806
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
it's either about your interpersonal

1807
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
bonds with your friends or whatever

1808
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
or it's about your um

1809
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,500
your like confidence

1810
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,500
your believing in yourself

1811
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
it's about

1812
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,500
whether you have the whether you have

1813
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
the wherewithal to ask the

1814
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,500
cute girl on a on a date

1815
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,500
I think you may you can probably

1816
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,500
unlock in certain media you can probably

1817
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,500
unlock super powers by doing that

1818
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
yeah it's that or you're like

1819
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,500
um you go to

1820
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,500
demon power

1821
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,500
you just have something

1822
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
um

1823
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
if you if you if you're if you're just like

1824
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,500
I don't know is that is there any

1825
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
is there any like shonen

1826
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,500
that's like I have super powers

1827
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,500
but only when I'm being like a completely

1828
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
immoral like douchebag

1829
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,500
like I have a demon

1830
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,500
inside of me that gives me

1831
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,500
super strength and lets me shoot laser beams

1832
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,500
but only

1833
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,500
when I am like

1834
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,500
but only when I'm being like a

1835
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,500
base randy and objectivist

1836
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,500
and like just acting in my

1837
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,500
um what's the what's the phrase

1838
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,500
my rational self-interest

1839
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,500
only when I'm disregarding

1840
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,500
the the the well-being of others

1841
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,500
I

1842
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,500
I can't think of anything specific

1843
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,500
but I feel like that character type

1844
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,500
probably does exist in like a

1845
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,500
an anti-hero there should

1846
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,500
there should be the villain that has a redemption

1847
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
arc where the power is derived

1848
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,500
from bad things but when they change

1849
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,500
sides they become weak for a bit

1850
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,500
imagine imagine like use their power

1851
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,500
remember um at the end of bakuman

1852
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,500
when they basically just make

1853
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,500
death note but their version of death note

1854
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,500
is the thing with like the white demon

1855
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,500
and the black demon um

1856
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,500
the angels yeah their angels

1857
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,500
or whatever I imagine

1858
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,500
like is it called a fellow

1859
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,500
I think would that would be a clever name

1860
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,500
maybe that's just what I would name it

1861
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,500
um whatever

1862
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
the board game no it's called

1863
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,500
revered yes

1864
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,500
yes no it's called reversi

1865
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,500
but reversi is another

1866
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,500
name for the game a fellow so

1867
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,500
I'm like right but but only sort of

1868
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,500
yeah yeah yeah it's called reversi

1869
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,500
um I imagine

1870
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,500
that but like the the white demon

1871
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
the white demon gains his power

1872
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
from like being communist from

1873
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,500
like I don't know from like

1874
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,500
collect collective

1875
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,500
thinking and like

1876
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,500
valuing like like like

1877
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
everyone whereas like the black one gains

1878
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
his powers from like from disregarding

1879
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,500
others will be I don't know there's maybe

1880
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,500
maybe someone's done that before I don't know

1881
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,500
the ultimate communist

1882
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,500
the ultimate communist or socialist

1883
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,500
or whatever like

1884
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,500
super power of all time is

1885
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
Goku's spirit bomb where he has everyone

1886
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500
put their hands up

1887
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,500
it's literally

1888
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,500
it's literally democratizing

1889
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,500
the battle because like if

1890
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
enough people like really want Goku

1891
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
to win this fight

1892
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,500
against Frieza or whatever because like the entire

1893
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,500
universe is like hmm

1894
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,500
so you're saying I can I can choose whether

1895
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,500
I can vote for Goku by giving him some of my spirit

1896
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,500
energy yes please

1897
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,500
fill out the ballot put it in the mail

1898
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,500
and

1899
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
yeah it's

1900
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
literally just like voting

1901
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
voting with your power

1902
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,500
yeah a good a based

1903
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,500
a based

1904
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,500
a based socialist base

1905
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,500
realized Goku

1906
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,500
he still believes in the power of

1907
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,500
electoralism it's a little cringe

1908
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,500
uh

1909
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,500
is that character arcs

1910
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,500
archetype sort of because he's like

1911
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,500
he's a villain who uses firebending

1912
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,500
hatred to fuel this firebending

1913
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,500
but when he comes a good guy

1914
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
he loses his ability to be

1915
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,500
strong with fire and he has to figure out

1916
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,500
a different way from the dragons

1917
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,500
to firebend

1918
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,500
like the base way

1919
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,500
Zuko loses his firebending

1920
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
when he becomes good

1921
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,500
when he joins the good guys

1922
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
he used to

1923
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
just fuel it by anger and rage

1924
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,500
and then he learns with

1925
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Aang at the dragon temple

1926
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,500
the dragon dance to like

1927
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,500
get pure firebending

1928
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,500
like the the cool kind

1929
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,500
I don't even remember that at all

1930
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,500
that was a really cool god I love

1931
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
I have a child I've been such a good show

1932
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
wait does he get

1933
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
does it like change his firepower

1934
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,500
when he's like getting it

1935
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,500
from like a pure place or something

1936
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,500
when he's getting it from like

1937
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,500
it's

1938
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,500
I don't know if maybe it changes

1939
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,500
visually but like it's more

1940
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,500
powerful

1941
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,500
it's sort of like the

1942
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,500
the difference between the

1943
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,500
I don't fucking remember

1944
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,500
it's good pretty bit yeah

1945
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
cool

1946
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,500
hey that was a pretty good show

1947
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,500
that was a pretty good show I think I watched

1948
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,500
college or something

1949
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,500
it's been a long time I've seen it

1950
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,500
my roommate's rewatched it last year

1951
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
I haven't watched it like a couple years ago

1952
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
it's a good

1953
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500
fucking ride because it's

1954
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
like obviously

1955
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,500
starts off a little

1956
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,500
slow with the few

1957
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,500
filler-esque episodes

1958
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
but like the

1959
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
the narrative builds upon itself

1960
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
like everything that happens

1961
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,500
you know it's all part

1962
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,500
of the one big story and the longer it goes

1963
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,500
the more stuff gets called back

1964
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,500
to and things that have happened

1965
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,500
come crop up again and characters you've seen

1966
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,500
before it's like ah

1967
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,500
it's just been building it's like an escalating

1968
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,500
tension

1969
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,500
goes all the way to the end and there's no

1970
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,500
bullshit unlike in Korra where there's

1971
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,500
lots

1972
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,500
yeah I never watched Korra

1973
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,500
heard a lot of mixed things so

1974
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,500
I probably never will

1975
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,500
Korra's okay

1976
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,500
but that's just the thing

1977
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,500
it's okay in this in the universe

1978
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,500
that had Avatar the last day and but

1979
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,500
Korra is like a disappointment

1980
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,500
but it's fine there's a few nice moments

1981
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
there's some characters I like

1982
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,500
a lot of them are just sort of minor

1983
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,500
like enjoyment

1984
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,500
like the comic relief characters

1985
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,500
the new

1986
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,500
soccer the new Zuko kind of

1987
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,500
they're

1988
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,500
they're whatever

1989
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,500
I think Tenzin

1990
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,500
Tenzin is like Aang's son

1991
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Aang's second son

1992
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,500
or third son

1993
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,500
he's the coolest

1994
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
he's trying to re-resurrect the air nomads

1995
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,500
Korra herself

1996
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,500
is alright and then there's

1997
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,500
some other funny characters

1998
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,500
I remember

1999
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
there was like an evil airbender

2000
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,500
at one point he did some really fucked up stuff

2001
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
in like season 3

2002
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,500
damn that's messed up

2003
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,500
he stole the air out of a person

2004
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,500
fucked up stuff

2005
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,500
it's like he airbended the air out of

2006
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
someone's lungs and they suffocated to death

2007
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,500
like dude

2008
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,500
Aang would never do that

2009
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,500
that's pretty good

2010
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,500
this is new airbending

2011
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,500
this is new fucked up airbending

2012
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,500
it's like evil airbending

2013
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,500
it's like bloodbending

2014
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,500
but the air version

2015
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,500
it was cool

2016
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,500
say we've been going for an hour and a half

2017
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,500
do we want to go to voicemails

2018
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,500
yeah

2019
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:38,500
I think I'm done with things I gotta say

2020
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,500
I got

2021
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,500
I've said too much

2022
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,500
I've said too much

2023
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,500
yeah let's just get started

2024
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,500
whatever

2025
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,500
alright you got them open you got them ready

2026
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,500
I'm getting to them

2027
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,500
okay

2028
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,500
alright I'm here

2029
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
the first one is called Ben Gay

2030
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
3 2 1

2031
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,500
go

2032
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
Ben Saint more like

2033
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,500
Ben Gay

2034
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,500
nice

2035
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,500
next voicemail is called

2036
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,500
RV can still happen

2037
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,500
3 2 1 go

2038
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,500
hey Ben so last week you were going on

2039
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,500
about how the void grifters can't afford

2040
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,500
an RV because they don't have the money

2041
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,500
well first of all you're right

2042
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
they can't afford an RV

2043
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:26,500
but that doesn't mean they necessarily

2044
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
can't get an RV

2045
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,500
I mean they can open a credit card and then max

2046
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,500
it out or they can

2047
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,500
go to a money lending service and then deal with the consequences

2048
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,500
later I mean

2049
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,500
it's a bad decision to end up in a shit ton of debt

2050
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,500
but I mean

2051
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,500
what has Yig ever been known for making good

2052
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
decisions

2053
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,500
there's a will there's a way Ben

2054
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,500
it can still happen

2055
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,500
you don't get enough credit on a credit card

2056
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,500
to max it out that much

2057
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,500
like I opened a credit card

2058
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,500
last year

2059
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,500
and they gave me like $2,000 worth of credit

2060
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,500
so that would never be

2061
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,500
enough

2062
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,500
some people have suggested that

2063
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,500
they could rent the RV

2064
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,500
and I have looked into it

2065
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,500
and RV rentals

2066
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,500
seem to cost like $100

2067
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,500
a day

2068
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,500
or more so

2069
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,500
that just seems insane

2070
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,500
if the RV was gonna happen I think

2071
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,500
someone would have to be buying it for them

2072
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,500
so

2073
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,500
are they like still having

2074
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,500
are they still saying like we're gonna do the RV

2075
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,500
it's funny

2076
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,500
was that just a thing they said once

2077
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
and they've just let it sit

2078
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,500
they said it over and over again

2079
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,500
like they said it they said it a lot

2080
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,500
that they were gonna do they were gonna get an RV

2081
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,500
and move into it

2082
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,500
they are on a trip

2083
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,500
right now

2084
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,500
to Elco Nevada

2085
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,500
and there is

2086
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,500
they have not shown the vehicle

2087
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,500
they have they have not shown the vehicle

2088
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:02,500
that they are traveling in

2089
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,500
uh

2090
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,500
perhaps deliberately

2091
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,500
Riley made a tweet the other day

2092
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,500
that was like damn

2093
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,500
the RV lifestyle

2094
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,500
is awesome I would recommend it

2095
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
but he doesn't actually say

2096
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,500
that there is an RV

2097
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,500
and I think there is definitely not one

2098
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,500
but it's like

2099
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,500
I hope I'm not reading too much into it

2100
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,500
but it kind of reads like he's sort of pretending

2101
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,500
that they have one

2102
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,500
I don't know if they had one

2103
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,500
they probably would have shown it

2104
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,500
wouldn't they?

2105
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,500
of course you would

2106
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500
well they said

2107
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,500
in one stream they said

2108
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,500
if we get the RV

2109
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,500
oh we're never gonna show the RV

2110
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,500
because then if you knew

2111
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
what our RV was then people could

2112
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
call the cops on us and report us

2113
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
and fuck with us and dox us

2114
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
which is just huge

2115
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,500
cope

2116
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,500
just laying the groundwork for them to pretend

2117
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,500
you wouldn't need to

2118
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,500
take a picture of

2119
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,500
the license plate

2120
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,500
take a picture from the inside

2121
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,500
RV is just

2122
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,500
you could take a picture from the inside

2123
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,500
you could take a picture

2124
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,500
out the window

2125
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,500
you could show the make and model

2126
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,500
nobody could fuck with you unless they knew

2127
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,500
exactly where you were

2128
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,500
and they could maybe call

2129
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,500
if someone really wanted to fuck with you

2130
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,500
and they knew

2131
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,500
exactly where you were

2132
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,500
even narrower than the town

2133
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,500
they would have to know exactly what town you're in

2134
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,500
and what part of town you're in

2135
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,500
and maybe they could call the local police department

2136
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,500
and be like there's a stolen RV

2137
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,500
in this one parking lot somewhere

2138
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,500
got em

2139
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,500
that's what it would take

2140
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,500
there's no reason not to show

2141
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,500
the RV

2142
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,500
anyway

2143
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,500
but

2144
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,500
let's hold aside the point because all you need to know

2145
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,500
is

2146
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,500
about the RV is you just need to go to

2147
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,500
isthereanrvyet.com

2148
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,500
and just to keep

2149
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,500
yourself updated on the

2150
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,500
RV status

2151
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,500
and I'm just checking it right now

2152
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,500
is there an RV yet? No

2153
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,500
it still says no so there's no RV

2154
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,500
I've staked my entire reputation on it

2155
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,500
so you know it's trustworthy

2156
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,500
the first time you tweeted this

2157
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,500
I was like ah gee

2158
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,500
this is a little far

2159
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,500
but at this point the longer it goes on

2160
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,500
the funnier it becomes

2161
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,500
see

2162
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,500
I knew that's what would happen

2163
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,500
I said this because

2164
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,500
they said they're getting this RV

2165
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,500
they

2166
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,500
last month they said they were getting it at the end of the month

2167
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,500
this month they're saying

2168
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,500
they're getting it at the end of the month

2169
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,500
I know they won't do it

2170
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,500
it's a game of chicken

2171
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,500
how long

2172
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,500
are they going to insist

2173
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,500
see I know something

2174
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,500
about saying you're going to do things at the end of the month

2175
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,500
myself how long are they

2176
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,500
going to keep saying end of the month end of this month

2177
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,500
end of this month we're really doing it

2178
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,500
and every single month that it goes on

2179
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,500
in which I'm just over here like

2180
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,500
hey

2181
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,500
there's no RV there's never will be

2182
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,500
there's even a website now

2183
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
by the way Crack made the website

2184
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,500
he's a genius

2185
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,500
they're together in like minutes

2186
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,500
he

2187
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,500
and like the longer there's a website and the longer

2188
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,500
the longer they insist upon

2189
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,500
this one version of reality

2190
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
while I am over here championing

2191
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,500
uh

2192
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,500
facts over feelings

2193
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,500
the funnier it gets

2194
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,500
so I've done this whole bit

2195
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,500
I've done this whole bit with an eye toward the future

2196
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,500
and it's

2197
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
it's paying off in spades

2198
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,500
it kind of reminds me of Nate

2199
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,500
telling me in Munchy that we'll never

2200
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,500
make

2201
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,500
a Gay for a Day the album

2202
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,500
we said we would make an album at Radcon 3

2203
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,500
and it took us a long time

2204
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,500
it took Munchy coming to London for us to record

2205
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,500
the album

2206
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,500
but Nate would always say you'll never do it

2207
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,500
I don't believe you will do it

2208
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,500
I was like cut you

2209
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,500
you're an asshole

2210
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,500
talking about us like that but then we did it

2211
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,500
I think it was

2212
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,500
was he being serious

2213
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,500
just like you won't do it or was he like

2214
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,500
I think it was his way of like encouraging us

2215
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,500
to do it by

2216
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,500
not believing

2217
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,500
outwardly that we could

2218
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,500
or that we would because it's like

2219
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,500
it's one of those things that does

2220
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,500
require a lot of effort and we

2221
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,500
after Radcon 3 was over we were far apart

2222
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,500
it was like how are we gonna coordinate this

2223
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,500
I've never made an album before I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

2224
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,500
Munchy

2225
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,500
does not know how to sing at all

2226
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,500
so he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing

2227
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,500
so the only way it could exist

2228
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,500
is if we're in the same room and we're just

2229
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,500
fucking around with instruments

2230
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,500
so it was a terrible terrible album

2231
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,500
but we did do it

2232
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,500
yeah

2233
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,500
like I kind of

2234
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,500
know

2235
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,500
that by making a thing out of it

2236
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,500
and being like there's no RV

2237
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,500
there's no RV

2238
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,500
there is a

2239
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,500
they won't do

2240
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,500
this won't happen but there is an outside chance

2241
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,500
that maybe like it'll push them

2242
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,500
to actually do it to just

2243
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:14,500
approve me wrong which they won't

2244
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,500
they can't do it they don't have the means

2245
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,500
but if through some weird

2246
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
chicanery they did

2247
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,500
and I was proven wrong

2248
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
I would still consider that a win

2249
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:26,500
because I want the RV saga

2250
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,500
to happen because it would be so

2251
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,500
much funnier than

2252
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,500
them just

2253
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,500
than what's actually going to happen

2254
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,500
which is they just kind of like stop mentioning

2255
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:38,500
it less and less

2256
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,500
and then

2257
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,500
maybe one day they're like

2258
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,500
we never really meant to do that

2259
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
that was just kind of a joke that we were saying

2260
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,500
that was just kind of a what if

2261
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,500
we didn't really say we were

2262
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,500
that's what's really going to happen

2263
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,500
and that's boring and lame so I hope that they do prove me wrong

2264
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,500
but they will

2265
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,500
pressure's on and they're going to fold

2266
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,500
I'm in it for the long haul

2267
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,500
I've already won

2268
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,500
the game

2269
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,500
was won already

2270
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,500
before it even began

2271
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,500
that's my

2272
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,500
tactical genius

2273
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,500
ok anyway

2274
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
next one is called

2275
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,500
plus three two one

2276
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,500
go

2277
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,500
horrible it is

2278
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,500
ooh I want to know

2279
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,500
to the best of my knowledge

2280
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,500
Nate has like never

2281
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,500
even spoken to Riley

2282
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,500
I could be wrong

2283
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,500
but I am not aware of like

2284
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,500
any interaction at all

2285
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,500
yeah I mean even if

2286
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,500
he had he wouldn't come on the pcp

2287
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,500
to talk about it

2288
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,500
he definitely wouldn't do that

2289
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,500
he didn't want to talk about it in our like

2290
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,500
he is nothing

2291
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:06,500
zip

2292
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,500
no Nate never wants to say anything about anything

2293
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,500
next voicemail is called

2294
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,500
ten dabs out of ten void chaser

2295
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,500
review

2296
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,500
three two one go

2297
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,500
so I just watched the

2298
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,500
first hour of void chasers

2299
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,500
oh my god

2300
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,500
well hi I assume that's how it's meant to be

2301
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,500
consumed in the first episode of void chasers

2302
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,500
you know I went in with

2303
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,500
kind of pretty low expectations

2304
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,500
but I like the concept

2305
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,500
I didn't hate it

2306
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,500
I'll probably watch more

2307
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,500
so here's some of my notes

2308
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,500
so they wrap a bit

2309
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,500
I think it seemed like

2310
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,500
it was tough to tell when it was edited

2311
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,500
in or not but there were definitely

2312
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,500
some sections that were just kind of like

2313
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
music videos in the middle

2314
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,500
I skipped those

2315
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,500
they go to Houston

2316
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,500
that's where JFK was shot

2317
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,500
and they walk around there for a bit

2318
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
Riley has like one joke

2319
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,500
he tells people in Houston

2320
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,500
that he's the

2321
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,500
super spreader and it's just because he's wearing a cape and all

2322
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,500
Dallas

2323
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,500
ends with a really bad B roll section

2324
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,500
this is like the first long section of the music

2325
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,500
and then they spend

2326
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,500
way too long at an Arizona rest stop

2327
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,500
and then their car gets stuck in a ditch

2328
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,500
and

2329
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,500
and B says the N word

2330
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,500
no

2331
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,500
overall it wasn't awful but

2332
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,500
the audio was going to fucking stab me

2333
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,500
and I hate it

2334
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,500
like they could do good audio

2335
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,500
they have the equipment to do decent audio

2336
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,500
they just don't know how to use it

2337
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
so

2338
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,500
I mean

2339
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,500
I guess thanks for watching it so I don't have to

2340
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,500
I know

2341
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,500
I'm the

2342
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,500
I'm the void critic

2343
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,500
I don't know

2344
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,500
I avoid it

2345
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,500
I

2346
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,500
I annoyed it so

2347
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,500
you can avoid it

2348
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,500
what?

2349
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,500
okay

2350
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,500
next voicemail is called call of the void

2351
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,500
3 2 1 go

2352
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,500
dangers

2353
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,500
all around us

2354
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,500
and we are acutely

2355
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,500
aware of it

2356
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,500
the fear that steel beams might fall

2357
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,500
and crush your head

2358
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,500
the awareness that you could throw your phone

2359
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,500
out of your car window and never see it again

2360
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,500
seeing a cop's firearm and imagine yourself

2361
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,500
being a small child of color

2362
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:38,500
so as to tempt him into executing you

2363
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,500
the momentary impulse

2364
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,500
followed by fear and revulsion

2365
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,500
at the notion is called call of the void

2366
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,500
call of the void

2367
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,500
I had to listen to the whole podcast

2368
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,500
to see if y'all figured that out but you didn't

2369
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,500
so okay here I am doing this

2370
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,500
alright love you bye

2371
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,500
yeah okay

2372
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,500
the thing we were talking about last time

2373
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,500
about like

2374
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,500
thinking about

2375
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,500
stuff killing you and shit

2376
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,500
I guess it's called call

2377
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
is there maybe there's a joke to be made

2378
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,500
about the void gazers there

2379
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,500
I don't know

2380
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,500
whatever thanks for the info

2381
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,500
buddy

2382
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,500
next voicemail is called incoming

2383
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,500
transmission 3 2 1 go

2384
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,500
eh

2385
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:32,500
colonel I've infiltrated the base

2386
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,500
security was tight

2387
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,500
but I managed to sneak into the vents

2388
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,500
the mission to execute

2389
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,500
tactical espionage on

2390
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,500
Nate's succulent boy pussies

2391
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,500
progressing smoothly

2392
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,500
his chambers are just up ahead

2393
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,500
what the

2394
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,500
I invite you

2395
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500
into my room

2396
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,500
my boudoir of sex objects

2397
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,500
that you may enjoy please

2398
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
oh fuck

2399
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,500
oh fuck

2400
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,500
I don't even know who died there what happened

2401
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,500
but he

2402
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:14,500
I mean

2403
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,500
okay well he didn't

2404
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,500
this was not a Nate fucker

2405
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,500
he was not there to fuck Nate

2406
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:22,500
he was there to perform espionage

2407
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,500
on the boy pussy

2408
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,500
so I guess he

2409
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,500
covered and he got in there

2410
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,500
and then did Nate kill him

2411
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:32,500
no I think Nate fucked him

2412
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,500
this was a rare case of this guy

2413
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,500
didn't want to fuck Nate

2414
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,500
but then he had no choice

2415
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,500
that's the trick you have to not

2416
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,500
want it you have to play hard to get

2417
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,500
that's the all yes it's the only way

2418
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,500
it's the only way to capture his

2419
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,500
interest

2420
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,500
okay next voicemail is called crushed

2421
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,500
joy 3 2

2422
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,500
1 go

2423
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,500
hey guys

2424
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,500
it's crusher a long time listener

2425
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,500
well you know until

2426
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,500
Trixie decided to make the

2427
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,500
why I should say the inward video

2428
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,500
about 2 years back and then I stopped

2429
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,500
but after learning about the information

2430
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,500
that they were no not kicked off

2431
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,500
more left angrily from the

2432
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,500
podcast I started listening again

2433
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,500
I gotta say it's great to hear all your voices

2434
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,500
I missed y'all for about 2 years now

2435
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,500
hey anyway I wish you guys the best of luck

2436
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,500
with however this

2437
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:28,500
goes thank you

2438
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,500
thank you did she

2439
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,500
make that video

2440
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,500
the is that was that on her channel

2441
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,500
I don't I don't remember I vaguely remember

2442
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,500
that well I think

2443
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,500
there was a video was it a rant

2444
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,500
no no no I think

2445
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,500
that on the studios it was

2446
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,500
like a conversation between Trixie and Riley

2447
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,500
about how they're like trans

2448
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,500
black no no

2449
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:52,500
but that was more recent

2450
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,500
but I mean I don't know

2451
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,500
this guy said it was 2

2452
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,500
years ago so it must

2453
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,500
have been older than that

2454
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,500
I vaguely remember

2455
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,500
her talking about like

2456
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,500
I was raised in like

2457
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,500
black schools black neighborhoods

2458
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,500
and I grew up saying the word

2459
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,500
so it's okay and I'm like

2460
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:14,500
yeah yeah I remember that

2461
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,500
I there's um

2462
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:18,500
I someone

2463
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,500
was doing a I'm sorry

2464
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,500
I forget who it's someone in my discord

2465
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,500
was doing a

2466
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,500
a rewatch of

2467
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
PCP and keeping an N word

2468
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,500
tally

2469
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,500
who

2470
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,500
it was like

2471
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,500
yeah it was um

2472
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:38,500
they were just seeing who says it the most

2473
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,500
and I think like

2474
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,500
early on it was Nate

2475
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,500
surprisingly was the one who says it the most

2476
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,500
early on but then there's that

2477
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,500
Trixie goes on like the rant about it

2478
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,500
and she like flies ahead

2479
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,500
of the competition

2480
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,500
um

2481
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,500
I don't but that was like still early that was like

2482
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
within the first like you know few dozen episodes

2483
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:00,500
or so so I assume the

2484
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,500
counter has been updated since then

2485
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,500
um

2486
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,500
yeah I don't

2487
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:08,500
specifically remember I remember that

2488
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,500
a video about

2489
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,500
why she should say the N word

2490
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,500
exists on somewhere

2491
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,500
but I don't exactly remember the content of it

2492
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,500
um

2493
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,500
anyway glad you're listening and glad you're having

2494
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,500
fun

2495
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,500
my dude

2496
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,500
the next voice mail is called fix your server

2497
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,500

3 2 1 go

2499
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,500
Ben the people in your server

2500
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,500
are unhinged

2501
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,500
and need to be checked

2502
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:38,500
there's this guy in the server

2503
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,500
fucking Tony Tony chopper

2504
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,500
oh wait

2505
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,500
fucking

2506
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,500
Trixie

2507
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,500
this is the opposite of what I thought you were saying

2508
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,500
by accident apologizes

2509
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,500
corrects himself

2510
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,500
and everyone fucking jumps down his throat

2511
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,500
fucking oh it's not good enough

2512
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,500
your total voice was too defensive

2513
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,500
you know all this stupid bullshit

2514
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,500
and then Doon Koon comes in

2515
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:04,500
who is trans by the way

2516
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,500
tries to defend the guy

2517
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,500
give him the Ben for the doubt and they ban Doon

2518
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,500
you need to get your people in check

2519
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,500
because they're fucking insane

2520
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,500
no

2521
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:16,500
see

2522
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,500
I can see why you would say that

2523
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,500
devoid of context

2524
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,500
but these people

2525
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,500
like

2526
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,500
the pro and on people have like specifically

2527
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:28,500
like irritated my mods

2528
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,500
they have like specifically antagonize them

2529
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,500
before I don't blame

2530
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:34,500
I don't blame my mods

2531
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,500
for having

2532
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,500
no patience with them because they have like

2533
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:40,500
they have gone out of their way to annoy here

2534
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,500
in the past so

2535
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,500
I feel like that's an important

2536
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,500
detail that maybe you are not privy to

2537
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,500
but it's true

2538
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,500
uh

2539
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,500
yeah

2540
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,500
no I support

2541
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,500
I support all these decisions

2542
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:58,500
next voicemail

2543
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,500
is called where are the blue rays

2544
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,500
Beatrice 3 2 1

2545
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,500
go

2546
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:06,500
hey so do you know if the bleep

2547
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500
in the weed blue rays ever came out

2548
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,500
um no because

2549
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,500
if they didn't then that's two sets of blue rays

2550
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,500
a certain someone knows her fans

2551
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,500
uh

2552
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,500
two can't wait till she calls them entitled

2553
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:20,500
and stupid for wanting a thing they paid

2554
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,500
for again

2555
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,500
anyway don't rebrand the show

2556
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,500
uh

2557
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,500
just keep going with the pcp it's fine

2558
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,500
um

2559
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,500
what does he mean two sets I thought the plebe in the

2560
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,500
weed was the one

2561
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,500
the plebe in the weed

2562
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,500
yeah it was I mean I assume

2563
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,500
one blue ray for all the different

2564
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
seasons of the plebe in the weed they plan to

2565
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,500
film

2566
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,500
oh maybe

2567
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:48,500
okay um

2568
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:50,500
yeah I mean

2569
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,500
I have no more to add

2570
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,500
that was the thing we talked about is that Digi

2571
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,500
got uppity

2572
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,500
that people

2573
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,500
this guy knows

2574
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,500
but yeah whatever

2575
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,500
yes it was it was partially about

2576
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,500
this guy know he knows the answer

2577
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,500
he knows the answer

2578
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,500
that she already did all these things

2579
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,500
and said all these things and feels this way

2580
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,500
and isn't going to do anything about it

2581
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,500
you'd know you don't need me to

2582
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,500
explain this to you you cheeky fuck

2583
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,500
um

2584
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,500
um

2585
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,500
uh

2586
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,500
seetol from

2587
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,500
the proanon

2588
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,500
did personally buy

2589
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,500
and send Trixie

2590
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,500
a blue ray

2591
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
burner

2592
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,500
I promise

2593
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,500
nothing will happen as a result of that

2594
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,500
um

2595
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,500
but it is a funny

2596
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:46,500
there should be a

2597
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:48,500
there should be a sister site is there an rv

2598
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,500
yet dot com needs a sister site

2599
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,500
is there a blue ray burner

2600
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,500
dot com

2601
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,500
to which the answer is yes did the blue ray

2602
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
a ray a blue ray burner arrive

2603
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,500
it did it did

2604
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,500
so we already know

2605
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,500
um

2606
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:06,500
well wait

2607
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,500
why would you see it

2608
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,500
well is there proof

2609
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
that they picked it up or brought them

2610
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,500
brought it with them on their road trip like

2611
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,500
well

2612
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,500
how do we know Trixie has it right now

2613
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,500
maybe maybe she sold it in the yard sale

2614
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,500
I think okay I believe

2615
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,500
that seetol got confirmation

2616
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,500
from Trixie that she did receive

2617
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,500
the

2618
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,500
I don't I I think

2619
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,500
so I guess I could be wrong but I feel

2620
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,500
like

2621
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,500
or at least that like the package was

2622
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,500
delivered or something yeah

2623
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,500
because there's been

2624
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,500
not there's been like at least

2625
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,500
one moment I can think of where like

2626
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,500
Trixie has not checked the

2627
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,500
p.o. box that she has for a long time

2628
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:50,500
yeah like maybe it would

2629
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,500
have been stuck there or something but if there's

2630
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:54,500
confirmation then that's fine it's possible

2631
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,500
I believe so

2632
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,500
um

2633
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,500
I just need to

2634
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,500

blatantly use slurs

2650
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,500
don't spam try to be

2651
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,500
creative

2652
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,500
to get banned from the server as quickly

2653
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,500
as possible make sure you record it

2654
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,500
obviously

2655
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,500
post it somewhere

2656
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,500
and yeah

2657
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,500
good luck okay first

2658
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,500
this is so annoying

2659
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,500
um

2660
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,500
so

2661
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,500
this is

2662
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,500
don't use any slurs don't spam

2663
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,500
a few people did this they were

2664
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,500
making sock puppet accounts doing it over and over again

2665
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,500
they were

2666
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:08,500
just spamming the chat and they were using slurs

2667
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,500
so both of those

2668
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,500
things were happening

2669
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,500
I literally had to lock down

2670
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,500
my discord because people just kept doing it

2671
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,500
so I had to

2672
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,500
like un

2673
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,500
yeah

2674
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,500
so there's no longer any active invites to my discord server

2675
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,500
and it's specifically because

2676
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,500
of this

2677
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,500
and honestly

2678
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,500
the goal

2679
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,500
to like grandstand and pretend

2680
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:36,500
that you're doing this in like some kind of ethical way

2681
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,500
no you're an

2682
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,500
asshole you're just obnoxious

2683
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,500
the discord server

2684
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,500
is locked so good job

2685
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,500
good job

2686
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,500
on this whole speedrun

2687
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,500
it was such a funny joke

2688
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,500
well it's over it's over because

2689
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,500
you were shitty about it

2690
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,500
not even funny

2691
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,500
it's just annoying

2692
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,500
stupid

2693
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,500
that was another one about my

2694
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,500
it was another one about my pro and on people

2695
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,500
they were doing a get banned

2696
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,500
from bends discord speedruns

2697
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,500
funny idea in

2698
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:12,500
concept in practice it's just really

2699
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,500
annoying and offensive and just

2700
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:16,500
disgusting and

2701
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,500
yeah I've never really understood

2702
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,500
like the speedrun getting banned

2703
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,500
like I know it's supposed to

2704
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,500
illustrate like oh this discord is

2705
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:26,500
like unreasonably

2706
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,500
ban heavy but like

2707
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:30,500
if you go into any place and you break the rules

2708
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,500
and you get banned really quick

2709
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,500
that just means that the moderation team is on

2710
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,500
on their game I guess

2711
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:38,500
it would be really easy

2712
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,500
to pretend that the ban chord

2713
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,500
is just like such a like a hyper

2714
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,500
woke or whatever just like

2715
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,500
just like a hyper reactive like

2716
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,500
uh step out of line and we bring the

2717
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,500
ban hammer down kind of place

2718
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,500
if you pretend like this individual does

2719
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,500
that you don't spam the chat and you don't

2720
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:56,500
use slurs but be honest you do

2721
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:58,500
you all do you kept doing it

2722
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,500
jokes over you ruined it

2723
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,500
uh next voicemail

2724
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,500
I'm mad I'm fucking mad

2725
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,500
next one is called just an opinion

2726
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,500
three two one go

2727
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,500
just finished

2728
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,500
rewatching the one piece lecture

2729
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,500
good lecture

2730
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,500
bad topic

2731
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,500
I don't think one piece is a good lecture

2732
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,500
topic it's like a

2733
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,500
900 chapter

2734
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,500
something manga that's better

2735
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,500
experienced first hand

2736
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:28,500
than second hand you're absolutely

2737
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:30,500
I think the other lecture topics like

2738
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:32,500
kingdom hearts was a great one

2739
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:34,500
because you don't want to play through

2740
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,500
the 10 different games on five different

2741
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,500
consoles with like

2742
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,500
25 different mechanics

2743
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,500
to learn the story

2744
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:44,500
it's long and convoluted

2745
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,500
and written by an insane person

2746
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,500
guilty gear

2747
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:50,500
you don't want to play through the fighting game

2748
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,500
and then you're not oh there's

2749
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,500
canon lore and non canon lore

2750
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:56,500
and we won't tell you which switch

2751
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,500
you can play all the guilty gear games and not

2752
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,500
understand the story at all

2753
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,500
sonichu almost impossible

2754
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,500
to read due to like the type setting

2755
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,500
and like non sequiturs

2756
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,500
and chris just deciding

2757
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,500
this is happening now

2758
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,500
great when it's told to you second

2759
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:14,500
hand by another person

2760
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:16,500
so I decided to put it out there

2761
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,500
you guys do great work I love

2762
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,500
the lectures

2763
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,500
think one piece was a bad topic I think

2764
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:24,500
it should have stayed on the cutting room floor

2765
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,500
I agree

2766
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,500
100% yeah that

2767
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:30,500
was a lot of the issues I was having with

2768
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,500
like ideas I would have

2769
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,500
for lectures because it's like

2770
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,500
that it needs to be something

2771
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:38,500
that you would otherwise not want to

2772
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:40,500
experience like even tales gets trolled

2773
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,500
is maybe a bad idea for

2774
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,500
a lecture because it's fun to read

2775
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,500
yeah tales gets trolled is a

2776
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,500
I agree yeah I agree

2777
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,500
I mean it's

2778
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,500
I think fewer people

2779
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,500
I don't know

2780
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,500
I mean I think that one is a little bit redeemed

2781
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,500
by the fact that less just the story is

2782
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,500
so bonkers and bizarre

2783
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,500
someone just kind of tell it to you is at least

2784
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:04,500
entertaining

2785
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,500
one piece is like

2786
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,500
I mean it's just

2787
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,500
I mean it's like a traditional shonen

2788
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,500
manga it's basically just like

2789
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,500
relating the story of just like a good

2790
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:16,500
manga it's fine

2791
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,500
like it's fine and all it's not

2792
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:20,500
imagine doing like a lecture

2793
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,500
lecture

2794
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,500
just read berserk

2795
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,500
you don't need to yeah just read berserk

2796
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,500
like the

2797
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,500
endless war rfck

2798
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,500
lecture that you and munchie did

2799
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,500
I can't remember how like effective it

2800
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,500
was because it was very like rambunctious

2801
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,500
but like that is a perfect

2802
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,500
topic because it's so much stuff that happens

2803
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,500
that is hard to like

2804
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,500
it's not very well archived

2805
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,500
and documented that's yeah yeah yeah

2806
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,500
not at all you would like there's so much lore

2807
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,500
that has happened there and at this point

2808
01:56:50,500 --> 01:56:52,500
like there's so many inside jokes

2809
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,500
and like references to like previous things

2810
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,500
that like would be so

2811
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:58,500
difficult to get caught up

2812
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,500
on that's why I was like

2813
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:02,500
I think yeah endless war lore

2814
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,500
is like a perfect that's

2815
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,500
something that is like extremely

2816
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,500
like complicated and

2817
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,500
difficult to get to grips with

2818
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,500
on on your own

2819
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,500
without someone explaining it to you

2820
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,500
one piece is not like that I mean it's long

2821
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,500
but I mean the lecture is

2822
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,500
long honestly

2823
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,500
separate issue is just that the one piece lecture

2824
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:24,500
is too fucking long even if it were a perfect

2825
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:26,500
topic like five hours is just too long

2826
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,500
but yeah I mean it's a huge

2827
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,500
as a YouTube video you can

2828
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,500
get it in chunks I guess

2829
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,500
I guess sitting there for five

2830
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:38,500
hours was too was too long for sure

2831
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:40,500
I guess I guess that's true

2832
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:42,500
anyway yeah my

2833
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,500
my risk a lecture was like it was

2834
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,500
it's on the cusp because

2835
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,500
Homestuck is very complicated but I don't think

2836
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,500
I got enough

2837
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,500
into the complicated stuff to

2838
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:54,500
make it interesting

2839
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,500
and a lot of a lot of that

2840
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,500
you can just get from reading Homestuck

2841
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,500
yeah

2842
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,500
I mean

2843
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:04,500
at least

2844
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,500
I mean it's easy if you just

2845
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:08,500
want to understand risker

2846
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,500
then

2847
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:12,500
yeah but it's not that hard to make I just

2848
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,500
I just read the comic and I understand risker

2849
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:16,500
and so I'm just really telling

2850
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,500
pirates yeah it's like I think it's kind

2851
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,500
of the same as tells gets trolled it's like

2852
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,500
if you did if you didn't want

2853
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,500
to read it then sure

2854
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:26,500
you might get something out of

2855
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,500
the lecture about it

2856
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,500
it is probably better to just read it

2857
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,500
but I can imagine someone who's like I don't want

2858
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,500
to read Homestuck it's like

2859
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,500
it's like it's like five thousand pages

2860
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,500
long it's like a million pages

2861
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,500
it's yeah if that one's like

2862
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,500
medium medium

2863
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,500
topic choice

2864
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,500
but next voicemail is called

2865
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:48,500
friggin

2866
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:50,500
colon cooties

2867
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,500
friggin cooties okay

2868
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,500
three two one go

2869
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,500
hey procrastinators it's friggin

2870
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,500
so I realized recently that out of the 30

2871
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:00,500
of us at the rad con meetup no less than

2872
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,500
five have come out as trans girls

2873
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,500
most recently myself

2874
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:06,500
no I'm not saying that you're responsible

2875
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,500
same for us that's one in six

2876
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,500
there's certainly some correlation so like

2877
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,500
what the fuck

2878
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,500
any theories as to what's going on

2879
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,500
and most importantly who's

2880
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,500
next

2881
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,500
I got

2882
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,500
I got two words

2883
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,500
for you

2884
01:59:24,500 --> 01:59:26,500
the Jews no I'm sorry

2885
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:28,500
terrible

2886
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:32,500
I don't even understand that's

2887
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,500
a complete non sequitur

2888
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,500
well that's what

2889
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,500
that's what people say though

2890
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:40,500
I mean it's the joke is like

2891
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:42,500
that's what people say it's like

2892
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,500
it's all a plot like it's all a Jewish plot

2893
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,500
it's this

2894
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:48,500
yeah that's people say it's the same

2895
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,500
it's like oh they too I don't know

2896
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,500
we can traditional

2897
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,500
traditional masculinity or something

2898
01:59:54,500 --> 01:59:56,500
I don't know

2899
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
no um

2900
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,500
I don't understand this either

2901
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,500
um

2902
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,500
what's your what's uh Minerva

2903
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,500
oh the double double cast I

2904
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,500
think it's I think it's sort of like

2905
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,500
yeah it's a it's a culture yeah

2906
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,500
the Jews the Jews have

2907
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,500
created a cultural movement

2908
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:16,500
in which in which every man

2909
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,500
now must be a woman or else be

2910
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
canceled by the woke mob for the crime

2911
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,500
of being a white man so everyone is

2912
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:24,500
becoming a woman to avoid that

2913
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,500
and this is going to destroy

2914
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:28,500
the white race

2915
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:30,500
clipped

2916
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,500
yes

2917
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,500
yes uh no I think it's

2918
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,500
it's just because

2919
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,500
people who

2920
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:40,500
uh trans

2921
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,500
tends to follow

2922
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,500
similar circles

2923
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,500
like they they they resonate

2924
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:48,500
with similar topics and groups

2925
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:50,500
I think the PCP

2926
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,500
it's like it's it's sort

2927
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,500
of uh sort of really

2928
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,500
I mean it's for for one

2929
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,500
comes mostly initially

2930
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,500
from Brony culture from us being

2931
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,500
Brony youtubers you know what

2932
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,500
a lot of people in that culture

2933
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:06,500
are you know what anyway so it's like

2934
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,500
I was gonna say I don't I was gonna say I don't

2935
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,500
understand it and I don't get like

2936
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,500
why the like so many

2937
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:14,500
of like the PCP

2938
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:16,500
and the PCP audience are trans

2939
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,500
but now that you say it no if I had

2940
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:20,500
to condense it down to one word yeah brony's

2941
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,500
brony's is probably the reason

2942
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:24,500
why it's like every

2943
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:26,500
like it brony's was

2944
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:28,500
going around before

2945
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:30,500
being trans was known as a thing

2946
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:32,500
like I think if it went the other way

2947
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:34,500
around brony the the

2948
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,500
pony show would come up and then

2949
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:38,500
trans people would but I wonder

2950
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,500
maybe I don't know but I

2951
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,500
I wonder

2952
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,500
I wonder

2953
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:46,500
because a lot of our audience came from

2954
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:48,500
the brony days but not all of it

2955
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,500
I wonder if

2956
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:52,500
a lot of the people who are trans

2957
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,500
were also brony's

2958
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:56,500
I wonder if like

2959
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,500
I wonder if it's like the people who were brony's

2960
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,500
are also those people

2961
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:02,500
and like not so much well that's why I'm

2962
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,500
saying it's like it's

2963
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:06,500
it would have been those people and

2964
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,500
yeah yeah yeah yeah

2965
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:10,500
people like we made the PCP

2966
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,500
we're still the same people that we were

2967
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,500
in the horse cast we had our audience

2968
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,500
made the PCP we made

2969
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:18,500
that kind of content

2970
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:20,500
Trixie was doing anime stuff so we got a lot of anime

2971
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:22,500
fans in there

2972
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,500
and you know all that sort of mixes

2973
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,500
like it's niche cultures

2974
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:28,500
sort of quote unquote

2975
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,500
social outcasts you know not

2976
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,500
normies

2977
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,500
and then

2978
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,500
there's like a base of people

2979
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:38,500
who follow the PCP

2980
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:40,500
from finding it and liking it

2981
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,500
and it's just the

2982
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:44,500
similar types of people

2983
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,500
congregate to the same types of

2984
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,500
things I think

2985
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,500
I would imagine that the incidence of

2986
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,500
transness

2987
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,500
among the terminally online

2988
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,500
is much higher than

2989
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,500
among the general population

2990
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,500
just for starters

2991
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:02,500
for I mean I think

2992
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,500
definitely a lot of it is just

2993
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,500
knowledge like

2994
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,500
exposure to the ideas because

2995
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,500
people

2996
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,500
thought about it if they hadn't

2997
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,500
heard other people

2998
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,500
I mean I think it's two reasons

2999
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:18,500
I mean one I would say that

3000
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,500
people who are less

3001
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:22,500
just less

3002
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,500
normy inclined to begin with

3003
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,500
just less

3004
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,500
what's the word I'm looking for

3005
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:30,500
people that are less like

3006
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,500
normal

3007
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:34,500
I don't know just less like

3008
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,500
social outcast

3009
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,500
yeah yeah people that are social

3010
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:40,500
outcasts are more likely to be terminally

3011
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:42,500
online and probably

3012
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,500
a lot of trans people are just like

3013
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,500
that for just various reasons

3014
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:48,500
a lot of trans people like I mean I can

3015
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,500
speak for myself and then in bronies

3016
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,500
in particular never felt right

3017
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,500
never felt comfortable

3018
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:56,500
in my own skin

3019
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,500
especially in

3020
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,500
teenage years with puberty and all that

3021
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,500
I don't know

3022
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,500
whether that necessarily means anything

3023
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,500
like I feel like that's a common

3024
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:08,500
a common thing with trans

3025
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,500
at least trans women

3026
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,500
I think trans men as well

3027
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,500
probably or it's just like

3028
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,500
you just feel

3029
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,500
a lot of

3030
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,500
social unease

3031
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:22,500
because the thing you're expected to be

3032
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:24,500
is uncomfortable but you don't know

3033
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,500
that there's another way to live

3034
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,500
yet

3035
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,500
so there's that

3036
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,500
but then the other side of it

3037
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,500
is probably that like if you are

3038
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:36,500
terminally online

3039
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,500
you have more exposure to

3040
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:40,500
trans culture and trans people

3041
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:42,500
and people talking about it

3042
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:44,500
and therefore you

3043
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:46,500
there are probably people who are not

3044
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:48,500
very online

3045
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:50,500
who will never come out as trans

3046
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:52,500
who might if they were

3047
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,500
exposed to it

3048
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:56,500
maybe because they just don't know

3049
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:58,500
which you know

3050
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:00,500
that's what they say

3051
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,500
people would point to this

3052
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:04,500
my enemies

3053
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,500
would point to this and be like

3054
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:08,500
there it is

3055
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,500
this is the cultural Marxism at work

3056
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:12,500
they're spreading the virus

3057
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,500
of thought that is corrupting

3058
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,500
our

3059
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,500
white people

3060
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:20,500
but

3061
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,500
right this is what they would say

3062
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,500
I would characterize it differently

3063
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:26,500
I would say like okay

3064
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:28,500
that's one

3065
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,500
you could call it but like

3066
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,500
consider that this

3067
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:34,500
being trans

3068
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,500
is a

3069
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:38,500
I don't know you could choose to look at it

3070
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:40,500
like before

3071
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,500
they found out about it on the internet

3072
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:44,500
this person was not trans

3073
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:46,500
and now they are they have been

3074
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:48,500
changed or

3075
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,500
look at it like this person

3076
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:52,500
had a problem

3077
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:54,500
or this person felt a certain way

3078
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:56,500
didn't understand it

3079
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:58,500
or like the way

3080
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,500
but then like you know

3081
02:06:00,500 --> 02:06:02,500
online discourse or whatever

3082
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:04,500
recontextualized the way they thought about it

3083
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,500
in such a way that

3084
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,500
they came up with a solution

3085
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,500
that they would not have otherwise

3086
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,500
which is being trans

3087
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:14,500
right coming out as trans

3088
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:16,500
and it's

3089
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:18,500
really just like

3090
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:20,500
I don't know

3091
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:22,500
it's not that the person is different

3092
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:24,500
it's that like a solution

3093
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:26,500
or a course of action

3094
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:28,500
was suggested to them

3095
02:06:28,500 --> 02:06:30,500
and I mean it's up to the person

3096
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:32,500
whether

3097
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:34,500
if that's what makes them happy right

3098
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:36,500
if they're happier

3099
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,500
if they're happier being out as trans

3100
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:40,500
being a woman or whatever

3101
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,500
then I would how can you look at that

3102
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,500
and be like oh the world would be better

3103
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:46,500
you know I'm a transphobe

3104
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,500
I think it would be better

3105
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:50,500
because they

3106
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:52,500
they're doing

3107
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,500
everyone's got to do

3108
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:56,500
what is good for them makes them happy

3109
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,500
and if you

3110
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:00,500
it's not good if you just

3111
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:02,500
never get exposed to it then you never

3112
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,500
come to that conclusion

3113
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,500
like you're not happier

3114
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:08,500
for it

3115
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,500
with regards to transphobia

3116
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,500
I think a lot of it is just sort of

3117
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,500
a difference of empathy

3118
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:16,500
like the idea that

3119
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:18,500
being trans is just sort of

3120
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,500
changing who you are

3121
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,500
so that you could be happier with yourself

3122
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,500
regardless of what you end up

3123
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:26,500
being or where you start

3124
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:28,500
it's just sort of like doing things that

3125
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,500
you know socially or societally

3126
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:32,500
it's like

3127
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,500
you're not expected to be like that

3128
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,500
but now it's more okay

3129
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:38,500
to try things to make yourself feel better

3130
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,500
and it's like the end goal is to feel happier

3131
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:42,500
with yourself

3132
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:44,500
people who are transphobic

3133
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:46,500
usually I think just don't care about

3134
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,500
other people they care about themselves

3135
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:50,500
and a lot of the male transphobes

3136
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:52,500
hate trans women because

3137
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:54,500
they are

3138
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,500
they are basically

3139
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,500
just misogynists who want women to be

3140
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,500
pretty for them they don't care about

3141
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:02,500
people

3142
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:04,500
they're just like I don't find

3143
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:06,500
these women who are trans to be

3144
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:08,500
sexually attractive enough for me

3145
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,500
that's why I hate them

3146
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,500
that's why they shouldn't exist

3147
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,500
that's why they should stay as depressed males

3148
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:16,500
and it's like that's

3149
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,500
I feel like it's just that they don't have empathy

3150
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:20,500
for other people generally speaking

3151
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:22,500
I mean the transphobes

3152
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:24,500
line of thinking is like

3153
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:26,500
okay

3154
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:28,500
you see

3155
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:30,500
like a trans woman

3156
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,500
and you're like

3157
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,500
they're like I don't know

3158
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,500
maybe they're like I was depressed

3159
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:38,500
but now I'm out as trans

3160
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,500
and I'm happier and they're like

3161
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,500
you

3162
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:44,500
they're like you made

3163
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,500
I don't know they think that you become

3164
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,500
sad

3165
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,500
you become unhappy

3166
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,500
by becoming

3167
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:54,500
exposed to

3168
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,500
the idea that you can be trans and that's real

3169
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:58,500
and they think that that is the source

3170
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:00,500
of the unhappiness

3171
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:02,500
versus like

3172
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:04,500
what I think most people

3173
02:09:04,500 --> 02:09:06,500
would say is that you

3174
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:08,500
you

3175
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:10,500
recognize that you had something that was making

3176
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:12,500
you unhappy and being trans

3177
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:14,500
is something that you do

3178
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,500
to

3179
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,500
to alleviate it

3180
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:20,500
yes and this is like a

3181
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,500
fundamental misunderstanding

3182
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,500
that underlies a lot of transphobia I think

3183
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,500
I see it all the time

3184
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,500
but I think the root cause of

3185
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,500
the dislike of it is

3186
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,500
the misogyny

3187
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:34,500
there is like

3188
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:36,500
hatred of trans men

3189
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,500
but it seems less loud

3190
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,500
because

3191
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:42,500
I don't know just various things

3192
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,500
well that was a

3193
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:48,500
that was a rabbit hole

3194
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,500
I don't remember what we were talking about

3195
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,500
oh cooties yeah yeah yeah

3196
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,500
wait I don't even remember what this

3197
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,500
that was the voice from

3198
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:58,500
bronies the short answer it's cause you were all bronies

3199
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,500
and now your girls

3200
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,500
get over it

3201
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:04,500
okay next voicemail

3202
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,500
is called

3203
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:08,500
see see the way

3204
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:10,500
see the reason why I have

3205
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:12,500
definitely dodged the trans bullet

3206
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:14,500
is because

3207
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,500
I was never in it for the ponies I was only in it

3208
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:18,500
for the money baby I was only in it for the clout

3209
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,500
I was just faking the whole time

3210
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:24,500
oh boy

3211
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:26,500
okay next next one is called

3212
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:28,500
the jelly trials

02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:30,500
three two one go

3214
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:32,500
hi PCP

jelly beaner here

3216
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:36,500
I wanted to make a clarification

3217
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,500
on the quote unquote

3218
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:40,500
Ben cord raid has this been referred to

3219
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:42,500
I was not making

3220
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,500
multiple alts

3221
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:46,500
and repeatedly going into the server

3222
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,500
and also

3223
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,500
the speed runs the first one was

3224
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:52,500
Eleazar the editor of the PCP

3225
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:54,500
and the second one was

3226
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,500
Dune

3227
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:58,500
full disavow

3228
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,500
they're awful people stay away from them

3229
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,500
agreed

3230
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:04,500
I don't know who I don't know who made what

3231
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,500
account I don't know who made what account

3232
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,500
was there a whole thing

3233
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,500
there was a whole yeah there was a whole thing I had

3234
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,500
oh you were in the bathroom

3235
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:14,500
yeah I had to shut my discord

3236
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,500
not shut it down I had to lock it down and delete

3237
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:18,500
all the invites because people

3238
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,500
I don't know I don't know who did what

3239
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:22,500
I don't know which individual

3240
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:24,500
said what or spammed what

3241
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:26,500
made accounts named what or whatever

3242
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:28,500
but people kept doing

3243
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:30,500
it

3244
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:32,500
and it was it was despicable

3245
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,500
it was disgusting I had to

3246
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,500
I had to shut down all the invites and lock my server

3247
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:38,500
down to stop it

3248
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:40,500
um cringe

3249
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:42,500
maybe maybe you had

3250
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:44,500
it's I it's a funny

3251
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:46,500
concept it's a funny concept

3252
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:48,500
and if you had the best of intentions

3253
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,500
when you

3254
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,500
made the speed run

3255
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,500
joke I get it

3256
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:56,500
I'm not mad about that

3257
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,500
I am I am a little upset about

3258
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,500
the lengths to which it was taken but I understand

3259
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:02,500
everyone is only responsible

3260
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,500
for their own actions

3261
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:06,500
and I don't know who did what so I can't really

3262
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,500
assign blame to anyone in particular

3263
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:10,500
um I did blow up a jelly beaner

3264
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:12,500
in the discord about

3265
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:14,500
this because I thought it was like

3266
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:16,500
entirely his thing I'm sure it wasn't

3267
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,500
entirely him doing it though

3268
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:20,500
in hindsight so whoops

3269
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,500
um but yeah

3270
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:24,500
game's over discord's locked down

3271
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:26,500
get fucked everybody

3272
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:28,500
um next voicemail is called

3273
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:30,500
uh it's an arrow it's a left

3274
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,500
arrow okay

3275
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:34,500
three two one go

3276
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:36,500
the left

3277
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:38,500
yes that's the

3278
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,500
left agreed

3279
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,500
next voicemail is called

3280
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,500
mozilla fennekin plural

3281
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:46,500
three two one go

3282
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,500
hey

3283
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:50,500
sorry about the mess

3284
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,500
everyone knows that the voicemails are the main

3285
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:56,500
content of the podcast so

3286
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,500
why do I do a live episode with live colleagues

3287
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:00,500
would be an interesting change of the form

3288
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,500
for now anyway gotta go

3289
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,500
I have a meeting with a mind switch

3290
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:06,500
so why does that have to do with

3291
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:08,500
understanding what you're saying

3292
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,500
I got it um I mean

3293
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:12,500
I mean we could

3294
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,500
yeah I mean we've done we did live

3295
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,500
PCPs at radcons

3296
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:18,500
before so it's not like we've never done one

3297
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,500
I think it's just the call in

3298
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,500
feature we would need to

3299
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,500
have a discord server for it oh wait

3300
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:26,500
no we didn't do that in redcon

3301
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,500
for we had people

3302
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,500
we had super chats

3303
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,500
we had super chats

3304
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:34,500
yeah which are kind of the same

3305
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:36,500
um

3306
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,500
maybe

3307
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,500
I don't know we'd have to set up

3308
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,500
like a discord server we couldn't do it through

3309
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,500
wait we did all oops all guests

3310
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:46,500
I think that's

3311
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,500
that was something wasn't it

3312
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:50,500
yeah like a ton of people

3313
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:52,500
it's not yeah I mean it's not exactly

3314
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,500
um

3315
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:56,500
live call ins

3316
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,500
but it's something

3317
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:00,500
I guess I guess the thing would be

3318
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:02,500
is that the show would have to be live

3319
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,500
and then we would do like call ins

3320
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,500
this person people would have had to listen

3321
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,500
to what we were talking about to have a relevant thing

3322
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:10,500
to say about it mozilla fennekin

3323
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:12,500
mozilla fennekin just wants to turn the

3324
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,500
PCP into void gazers because

3325
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:16,500
they do live call ins

3326
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,500
um

3327
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:20,500
and uh I don't

3328
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:22,500
I have in the

3329
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:24,500
I haven't found them very I haven't found them very

3330
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:26,500
interesting live call ins

3331
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:28,500
the call just goes on and on and on I like

3332
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,500
that they're pre called so that they're like

3333
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:32,500
the person just says what they need to

3334
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:34,500
say and then they're done I don't need to have

3335
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:36,500
a whole back and forth with every fucking

3336
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:38,500
one of you freaks

3337
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:40,500
um

3338
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:42,500
okay yeah

3339
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,500
sounds like a lot of work

3340
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:46,500
uh next one is called

3341
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,500
bass joker five

3342
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,500

go you know

3345
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:56,500
Batman

3346
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:58,500
you say that you're a master

3347
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,500
in jiu jitsu

3348
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:02,500
but I have to wonder

3349
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:04,500
are you a master in

3350
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:06,500
push it soon

3351
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:08,500
that uh

3352
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:10,500
um

3353
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:12,500
I don't know joker

3354
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:14,500
I don't know about that one I feel

3355
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:16,500
I'm not laughing that one's a little

3356
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:18,500
I'm not I'm not no that one didn't hit

3357
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,500
that one didn't hit query he's lost

3358
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,500
his luster oh no he's his first

3359
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:24,500
ever his first ever flop

3360
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:26,500
bass joker's impeccable

3361
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:28,500
win streak

3362
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:30,500
has been uh has been

3363
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,500
sully I think it was a little

3364
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,500
a little too strange because Batman

3365
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,500
doesn't do jiu jitsu it is not a thing

3366
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,500
he does

3367
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,500
that there's no there's no like it's

3368
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,500
true like there's no aspect of that

3369
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:44,500
it's just like what rhymes with

3370
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:46,500
shit and poo and the joker

3371
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,500
says it

3372
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:50,500
I I

3373
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:52,500
I I bet in at least

3374
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:54,500
one uh story

3375
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:56,500
somewhere references made

3376
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:58,500
to Batman knowing jiu jitsu because he is

3377
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:00,500
like a martial artist you know okay

3378
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:02,500
he grab he grapples but that

3379
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,500
that would be more

3380
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:06,500
um uh what's the word

3381
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,500
hidden

3382
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:10,500
knowledge what's the word for that

3383
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:12,500
hidden hidden power obscure

3384
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:14,500
uh the the

3385
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:16,500
hmm

3386
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,500
didn't he well I mean I guess

3387
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,500
in in dark night I don't know

3388
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,500
if they talk about jiu jitsu specifically

3389
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:24,500
well I know about Batman is that he

3390
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,500
punches guys and he's

3391
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:28,500
Batman and that's all I know

3392
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:30,500
those are two important facts

3393
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:32,500
about Batman

3394
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:34,500
uh okay

3395
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:36,500
the next one is called

3396
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:38,500
be autism opinion

3397
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,500
meh 3 2

3398
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:42,500
1 go

3399
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:44,500
hi um I'm very very sorry

3400
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:46,500
um I'm I'm the DS guy I'm

3401
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,500
very sorry that I said I didn't care

3402
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:50,500
about B but now I kind of care because I just

3403
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:52,500
got to the autism debate and here's my here's

3404
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:54,500
my two cents um okay I feel

3405
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,500
like B has kind of

3406
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,500
like

3407
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:00,500
taken the meme too far

3408
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:02,500
how do I even explain

3409
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:04,500
I feel like I feel like she's like

3410
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,500
uh she's

3411
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:08,500
she's been in like autism

3412
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:10,500
meme culture for so long that it kind of

3413
02:17:10,500 --> 02:17:12,500
like became reality

3414
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:14,500
like yeah I'm pretty sure she's undiagnosed

3415
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,500
if she is diagnosed and like I'm just stupid

3416
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,500
I'm just like an idiot I'm pretty sure she's

3417
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,500
undiagnosed it just feels like she's

3418
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:22,500
like exhibiting the things

3419
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,500
that like she knows I don't know maybe

3420
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:26,500
this is really insulting no if it is

3421
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:28,500
then I agree

3422
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,500
sorry

3423
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,500
sorry

3424
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,500
this is

3425
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,500
no I

3426
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,500
I don't know I can't read minds

3427
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:42,500
I can't see into B's

3428
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,500
thoughts or anything

3429
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:46,500
I mean are they saying like

3430
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,500
potentially the

3431
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:50,500
she's playing up

3432
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,500
autism because I feel like

3433
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:54,500
yeah I

3434
02:17:54,500 --> 02:17:56,500
that's the feeling I get is that she is that

3435
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:58,500
she believes is that she believes

3436
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:00,500
in it

3437
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,500
she believes that her undiagnosed

3438
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,500
autism is such a real

3439
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,500
thing that she like makes it real

3440
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,500
in her own mind

3441
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:10,500
at least by sort of acting in a way

3442
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,500
that is like I don't know

3443
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:14,500
weird in a way that I think

3444
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:16,500
reinforces the idea

3445
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:18,500
that she's autistic or something

3446
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:20,500
I don't see evidence for that

3447
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,500
but I can see why you would think

3448
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:24,500
that's possible

3449
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:26,500
I can't point to any like

3450
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:28,500
there's the proof there's when she did it

3451
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,500
it's just you can't know

3452
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:32,500
when I think about that I think

3453
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,500
like that sounds right

3454
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,500
that sounds accurate

3455
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:38,500
but I can't prove it

3456
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:40,500
damn

3457
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,500
I can't prove anything

3458
02:18:42,500 --> 02:18:44,500
in particular but like

3459
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:48,500
the word neurodivergent

3460
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:50,500
is vague enough

3461
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:52,500
that I feel like it fits

3462
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,500
like Digi is not

3463
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:56,500
totally normal

3464
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:58,500
in the way she interacts

3465
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:00,500
nobody's totally normal

3466
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,500
we had this conversation before

3467
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:04,500
I know I know but like

3468
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:06,500
you can't

3469
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,500
you can't just say like

3470
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:10,500
I'm just pushing back on the idea that she's faking it

3471
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,500
like how could she be faking

3472
02:19:12,500 --> 02:19:14,500
like being into this

3473
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:16,500
it's more subtle than just faking

3474
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,500
that's why I'm not sure

3475
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:20,500
what I'm talking about here

3476
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:22,500
I think

3477
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:24,500
what I'm extrapolating from this voicemail

3478
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:26,500
is it's sort of like a self

3479
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:28,500
sort of like a self fulfilling

3480
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:30,500
kind of like thought process

3481
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:32,500
wherein

3482
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:34,500
a belief

3483
02:19:34,500 --> 02:19:36,500
a belief or a desire

3484
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,500
or something

3485
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:40,500
to have a certain condition

3486
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:42,500
creates an incentive to act

3487
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:44,500
in a way that would

3488
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:46,500
suggest that it's real

3489
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:48,500
and it's sort of like

3490
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:50,500
auto hypnosis kind of thing

3491
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,500
I don't know

3492
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:56,500
I don't know

3493
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:58,500
you can't just be like oh this person acts weird

3494
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:00,500
this person is

3495
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:02,500
different

3496
02:20:02,500 --> 02:20:04,500
hence neurodivergent

3497
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,500
I mean

3498
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:08,500
that's like

3499
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:10,500
there could be any number of reasons

3500
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,500
a person could have

3501
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:14,500
a perfectly normal

3502
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:16,500
neurology

3503
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,500
bizarrely

3504
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:20,500
I don't know because they've been

3505
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:22,500
conditioned

3506
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:24,500
I guess I just don't know what is the end

3507
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,500
goal of understanding this

3508
02:20:26,500 --> 02:20:28,500
like if it turns out that

3509
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,500
this is true

3510
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,500
what would Trixie need to do

3511
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,500
or is there anything you would have her do

3512
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,500
differently

3513
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:38,500
well I would try to act more normal

3514
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:40,500
like I don't know

3515
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:42,500
no I would just refrain

3516
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:44,500
I would just refrain from

3517
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,500
refrain from

3518
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,500
giving

3519
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:50,500
diagnoses

3520
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,500
that you have no

3521
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:54,500
expertise or basis for

3522
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:56,500
for

3523
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:58,500
giving

3524
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:00,500
that's it

3525
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:02,500
I mean I don't know

3526
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:04,500
I can agree with the diagnosis thing

3527
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:06,500
yeah okay

3528
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,500
thank you for the voicemail

3529
02:21:08,500 --> 02:21:10,500

ragging on Fena I fucking hate Fena

02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:20,500
in the world I fucking hate Fena

3535
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:22,500
I fucking hate Fena

02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:24,500
I hate Fena I hate him

02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:28,500
so thank you

3539
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:30,500
I mean yeah

3540
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:32,500
I mean thank Dan Olson

3541
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:34,500
I guess for like

3542
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,500
I mean I guess I had seen

3543
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:38,500
I had watched the jar

3544
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,500
I hope I'm not repeating myself

3545
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:42,500
I had watched the jar podcast

3546
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:44,500
about the Doug Walker

3547
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,500
wall thing so I had seen the cartoons before

3548
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,500
they don't really

3549
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,500
talk as much about

3550
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:52,500
they don't criticize the animation as much

3551
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,500
as like Doug does or as Dan did

3552
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:56,500
but

3553
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:58,500
yeah no it was when Discount Gumshoe

3554
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:00,500
was like there's more to this whole

3555
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:02,500
he directed my attention to the channel

3556
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,500
itself and I just went and I looked at it

3557
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,500
and like the more I looked at it

3558
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:08,500
the more I'm like

3559
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:10,500
this is this is bad and it's uncanny

3560
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:12,500
and it's like

3561
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,500
and it's fucked up and I

3562
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:16,500
and I hate looking at it

3563
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:18,500
and I don't know

3564
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:20,500
you're

3565
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:22,500
I hope

3566
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:24,500
I would hope that most people can see it

3567
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:26,500
I

3568
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:28,500
I think there's a

3569
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:30,500
certain level of like polish

3570
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,500
there's a certain level of polish on the way

3571
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:34,500
that it looks that like at first glance

3572
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:36,500
I think a lot of people's

3573
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,500
gut reaction is to think that it is like

3574
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:40,500
professional it has a certain

3575
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,500
veneer of professionalness to the way it looks

3576
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:44,500
but like the more you

3577
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:46,500
look at it the more you start to be like

3578
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:48,500
something's off something is

3579
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:50,500
weird and I can't quite put my finger on it

3580
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:52,500
something's bugging me about the way the stuff

3581
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,500
looks and then of course like

3582
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:56,500
the dialogue is all is awful

3583
02:22:56,500 --> 02:22:58,500
you know of course

3584
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:00,500
that's

3585
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:02,500
anyone should be able to see that

3586
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:04,500
unless you're like an unironic Doug

3587
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,500
Walker fan in the year of our lord

3588
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:08,500
2021

3589
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:10,500

02:23:14,500 --> 02:23:16,500
love it next one is called

3593
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,500
welcome to the underwater world what kind of

3594
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,500
creature are you

3595
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:22,500

oh god

3597
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:54,500
has this something from before

3598
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,500
I

3599
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,500
be a dramatic organ

3600
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:16,500
I mean

3601
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:18,500
if I could choose one I would choose

3602
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:20,500
I mean probably something

3603
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:22,500
that lives a really long time and has few natural

3604
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:24,500
predators like blue whale

3605
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:26,500
or something I'd be a brain eating

3606
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,500
amoeba

3607
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,500
awesome

3608
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,500
I would be a

3609
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,500
a krill a single krill

3610
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,500
in a in a cloud

3611
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,500
or a yeah

3612
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:40,500
I've always loved sharks

3613
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,500
so sharks are cool

3614
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:44,500
I really

3615
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:46,500
like

3616
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:48,500
I do really like Nautilus's

3617
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,500
just because they're so like weird looking

3618
02:24:50,500 --> 02:24:52,500
like you look right at them and you're like what is

3619
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:54,500
going on with this thing like what

3620
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,500
why is it shaped like that

3621
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:58,500
so I'm tempted to say Nautilus

3622
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:00,500
Nautilus

3623
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:02,500
yeah

3624
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:04,500
I mean

3625
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,500
oh yeah yeah

3626
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:08,500
the thing that's like a pokemon is based

3627
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,500
off it

3628
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:12,500
yes um

3629
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:14,500
which I think so

3630
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:16,500
I don't remember which pokemon

3631
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:18,500
uh yeah

3632
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:20,500
wait

3633
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:22,500
which fucking pokemon is it

3634
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,500
it's got like a oh god I don't

3635
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:28,500
just type in Nautilus pokemon

3636
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:30,500
yeah that's shellmet I think

3637
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:32,500
a little bit or

3638
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,500
no

3639
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:36,500
it's a little cross between shellmet

3640
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:38,500
and omenite

3641
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:40,500
no it's not no not

3642
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:42,500
shellmet shellmet is a bug omenite

3643
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:44,500
yeah yeah omenite is

3644
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:46,500
I mean omenite is more of a

3645
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:50,500
does a Nautilus have a shell

3646
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:52,500
I think it's that hard back

3647
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,500
thing is like the exoskeleton shell

3648
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,500
thing

3649
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,500
like he grows it

3650
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,500
no yeah it is

3651
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:02,500
uh yeah

3652
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:04,500
no omenite is basically a Nautilus

3653
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:06,500
you're right

3654
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,500
I like these but

3655
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,500
I think they're probably like not

3656
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:12,500
good to be

3657
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:14,500
like they don't do anything and they probably don't live very

3658
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:16,500
long and they probably are

3659
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,500
easy prey they look

3660
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:20,500
they look pretty useless

3661
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:22,500
no I'd probably go with a blue whale

3662
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:24,500
or whatever kind of whale lives the longest

3663
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:26,500
wait I would be

3664
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:28,500

couldn't see any image results

3748
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:16,500
and I typed in scariest sea creatures

3749
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:18,500
and I just scrolled down ever so slightly

3750
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:20,500

02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,500
like those creepy Garfield animations

3764
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:48,500

a little spooky it's a little creepy

3786
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:32,500
it's a little creepy yeah

3787
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:34,500
it's a little spooky if you want to get spooked

3788
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:40,500
where was I

3789
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:42,500
oh yes um the next yeah

3790
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,500
blue whale blue whale for me

3791
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:46,500
next one is

3792
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:48,500
alt-right propaganda

3793
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:50,500
this is exciting three two one

3794
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:52,500
go

3795
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:54,500
Howdy

3796
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,500
about the shoplifting thing

3797
02:30:56,500 --> 02:30:58,500
I understand you know

3798
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:00,500
if you shoplift from Walmart

3799
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:02,500
right I know what he gets hurt

3800
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:04,500
it's a victim who's crying

3801
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:06,500
however I don't know

3802
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:08,500
if this is just a southern thing

3803
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:10,500
but

3804
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:12,500
people who work retail

3805
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:14,500
are held responsible for the

3806
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:16,500
shoplifting so even even

3807
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:18,500
Walmart especially in say

3808
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:20,500
gas stations

3809
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:22,500
I worked at a Walmart for

3810
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:24,500
a while and

3811
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:26,500
there was a

3812
02:31:26,500 --> 02:31:28,500
shoplifting epidemic

3813
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:30,500
on the level of Ben St. walking in

3814
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:32,500
to a Walmart

3815
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:34,500
and I got fired because I did not

3816
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:36,500
see people shoplifting

3817
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:38,500
but they figured it out

3818
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:40,500
victimless crime

3819
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:42,500
more like victim is dying

3820
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:44,500
what

3821
02:31:44,500 --> 02:31:46,500
I don't get it um

3822
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:48,500
okay

3823
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:50,500
I

3824
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:52,500
am like

3825
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,500
I don't know how fucking gas stations run their business

3826
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:56,500
right

3827
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:58,500
but like

3828
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,500
I am pretty sure

3829
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:02,500
I am pretty sure that that is should be

3830
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:04,500
is and should be like a labor violation

3831
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:06,500
I don't think

3832
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:08,500
I mean maybe people do it

3833
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:10,500
but I don't think you're legally allowed

3834
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:12,500
to like fire your employees

3835
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,500
because like

3836
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,500
a shoplifter stole something

3837
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:18,500
well I can

3838
02:32:18,500 --> 02:32:20,500
believe that it's not legally allowed

3839
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:22,500
but I can also believe that they could

3840
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:24,500
come up with some other reason

3841
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:26,500
to get rid of them

3842
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:28,500
if they felt like they were slacking

3843
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:30,500
during their shift

3844
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:32,500
they've got stolen

3845
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:34,500
like I can imagine it also does happen

3846
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:36,500
why would I mean

3847
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:38,500
why would you think

3848
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:40,500
I mean is the I mean

3849
02:32:40,500 --> 02:32:42,500
if you're a boss I guess you'd be like

3850
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:44,500
hmm my employees

3851
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:46,500
are too lax

3852
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,500
about this shoplifting thing I need

3853
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,500
to hire a new team

3854
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:52,500
that is like

3855
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:54,500
gonna give it a more of 110%

3856
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,500
that's gonna be like more

3857
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:00,500
active about preventing shoplifting

3858
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:02,500
or something I don't know

3859
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:04,500
maybe

3860
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,500
it probably does happen

3861
02:33:06,500 --> 02:33:08,500
I'm sure it's happened before

3862
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:10,500
but it's just

3863
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,500
it's just like a doomed I mean

3864
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:14,500
the problem there is the boss

3865
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:16,500
the problem there is not the shoplifter

3866
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,500
the problem is the boss who thinks that they can

3867
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:20,500
just cycle through employees

3868
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:22,500
and hire people to do

3869
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:24,500
work

3870
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:26,500
outside of their pay grade

3871
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:28,500
and IE

3872
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:30,500
apprehending shoplifters

3873
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,500
like that's not in the job description

3874
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:34,500
of like a Walmart floor employee

3875
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:36,500
and it shouldn't be expected of them

3876
02:33:36,500 --> 02:33:38,500
so I understand

3877
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:40,500
I understand that this consequence

3878
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:42,500
might occur

3879
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:44,500
but I would I mean I would put the blame

3880
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:46,500
at the boss's feet

3881
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:48,500
not the shoplifter

3882
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:50,500
yeah

3883
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:52,500
there's like there's a greater evil here

3884
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:54,500
next

3885
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,500
this mail is called

3886
02:33:56,500 --> 02:33:58,500
hypotheticals

3887
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:00,500
3, 2, 1, go

3888
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:02,500

3889

procrastinators podcast for a while now

3890
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:06,500
and Ben's saint guy is always

3891
02:34:06,500 --> 02:34:08,500
going on about these hypotheticals

3892
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:10,500
well

3893
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:12,500
Ben, what if I hypothetically

3894
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,500
put my dick in your ass

3895
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:16,500

3896
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:18,500

3898
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,500
I guess

3899
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:26,500
I guess

3900
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:28,500
that's how it works right

3901
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:30,500
the dick touches the prostate

3902
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:32,500
and that's and game over

3903
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:34,500

evidence

caller may in fact

3929
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:30,500
be endless chess

we

3936
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,500
we can say with almost

3937
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:48,500
entire certainty

3938
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:50,500
that this caller

3939
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:52,500
is so rancher from the loudest podcast

3940
02:35:54,500 --> 02:35:56,500

3943
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:02,500

I miss you dearly

3945
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:06,500
I'm a little curious

3946
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:08,500
about the one he said could be endless jazz

3947
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:10,500
because I have no idea why there's no way

3948
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:12,500
fucking voice mail into the pc

3949
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:14,500
there's no way Jesse would ever make

3950
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:16,500
a voicemail

3951
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:18,500
it's impossible

3952
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:22,500
I don't know if the DS

3953
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:24,500
the DS person was the same one

3954
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:26,500
okay they were the DS from earlier

3955
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:28,500
they called him this time too

3956
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:30,500
I mean I've met so rancher in real life

3957
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:32,500
and talked to her I honestly

3958
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:34,500
it could I don't know it could be her

3959
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:36,500
if it was her would I know

3960
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:38,500
I probably wouldn't

3961
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:40,500
I don't know

3962
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:42,500
it's her in fact yes it's canon

3963
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,500

3964
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:46,500

3975
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:08,500
um two quick questions

3976
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:10,500
you said last week

3977
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:12,500
that the brony lecture was going to be

3978
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:14,500
the story of how you guys became friends

3979
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:16,500
partially was that like

3980
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:18,500
actually a big part of it

3981
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:20,500
or is it just you guys became friends through brownies

3982
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:22,500
it partially touches on the formation

3983
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:24,500
of the horses that's something I've always

3984
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:26,500
been kind of curious about

3985
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:28,500
and would love to hear the details of that

3986
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:30,500
so like

3987
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:32,500
do that as like a topic

3988
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:34,500
kind of thing please

3989
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:36,500
we've talked about this

3990
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:38,500
also

3991
02:37:38,500 --> 02:37:40,500
I don't remember

3992
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:42,500
what my other question was

3993
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:44,500
yeah we've definitely talked

3994
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:46,500
about the formation of

3995
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:48,500
our stupid group

3996
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:50,500
before multiple times

3997
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:52,500
the lecture

3998
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:54,500
it talked about like the formation of

3999
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:56,500
the um

4000
02:37:56,500 --> 02:37:58,500
the brony analysis community

4001
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:00,500
in general but you know special

4002
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:02,500
emphasis was placed on the horseshoe crew

4003
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:04,500
and us forming the pcp

4004
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:06,500
because that was a whole you know obviously

4005
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,500
she was like more privy to that and that was

4006
02:38:08,500 --> 02:38:10,500
central to her experience of it

4007
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:12,500
so yeah it does go into that

4008
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:14,500
if you don't know analysis community

4009
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:16,500
uh there was there was

4010
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:18,500
Trixie

4011
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:20,500
um and I think

4012
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:22,500
Jesse had made drowning in horse shoes

4013
02:38:22,500 --> 02:38:24,500
or or like a drowning in footwear

4014
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:26,500
video where he dressed up as

4015
02:38:26,500 --> 02:38:28,500
Colt Corona

4016
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:30,500
for that one thing

4017
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:32,500
um Tommy Oliver

4018
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:34,500
well they were they were all

4019
02:38:34,500 --> 02:38:36,500
Tommy and Trixie

4020
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:38,500
were like the first

4021
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:40,500
of our group doing it

4022
02:38:40,500 --> 02:38:42,500
it became famous and then it was

4023
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:44,500
uh t-bap give and take

4024
02:38:44,500 --> 02:38:46,500
uh drowning in horseshoes

4025
02:38:46,500 --> 02:38:48,500
came up around season 4

4026
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:50,500
at the same time

4027
02:38:50,500 --> 02:38:52,500
making similar sort of an analytical

4028
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:54,500
content

4029
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:56,500
we noticed each other we all preferred

4030
02:38:56,500 --> 02:38:58,500
each other's content over

4031
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:00,500
like the rest of the community

4032
02:39:00,500 --> 02:39:02,500
we all had we all had the same

4033
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:04,500
we all like had an attitude

4034
02:39:04,500 --> 02:39:06,500
about it where we didn't take it too seriously

4035
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:08,500
and yeah we were

4036
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,500
like we were fucking around and we were

4037
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:12,500
silly and we were self-aware and a lot

4038
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:14,500
of the other in the brony community

4039
02:39:14,500 --> 02:39:16,500
of the analysis community were like

4040
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,500
not as

4041
02:39:18,500 --> 02:39:20,500
self-aware or just generally

4042
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:22,500

messaged me said that like

4099
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:24,500
it was because Trixie's going through a

4100
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:26,500
lot but like yeah I

4101
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:28,500
have seen some people share the sentiment of

4102
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:30,500
like oh don't criticize Trixie

4103
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:32,500
she's going through a lot she's transitioning

4104
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:34,500
and like yeah true

4105
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:36,500
on the one hand true but on the other hand that

4106
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:38,500
kind of stuff is like that's your fucking

4107
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:40,500
responsibility like

4108
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:42,500
it's you're responsible for your own

4109
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:44,500
shit like if you if you made

4110
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:46,500
a if you made a promise

4111
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:48,500
or an agreement beforehand the fact that

4112
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,500
like oh you've you've discovered

4113
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:52,500
that you're trans and you're going through that doesn't

4114
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,500
like alleviate any of that at all

4115
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,500
yeah like it's not it's not trans related

4116
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:58,500
what like it's it's not

4117
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,500
a trans related thing if it's like

4118
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:02,500
oh I promised I would make a video

4119
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:04,500
saying I am a man and now I'm trans

4120
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:06,500
and I don't want to release that and just like

4121
02:42:06,500 --> 02:42:08,500
I you know what I don't worry about

4122
02:42:08,500 --> 02:42:10,500
it um that's a strange promise to

4123
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,500
to have but like

4124
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:14,500
trans doesn't mean your promises

4125
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:16,500
other than like other things

4126
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:18,500

02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:34,500
yes pride is

4160
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,500
like a blade

4161
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,500
leech volume 8

4162
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:40,500
the blade and me

4163
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:42,500
wow

4164
02:43:42,500 --> 02:43:44,500
wow

4165
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:46,500
that's so deep

4166
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:48,500
it's true though

4167
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:50,500
just like

4168
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:52,500
if it rusts

4169
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:54,500
it's not true I disagree

4170
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:56,500
because

4171
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:58,500
you know what can rust

4172
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,500
is iron

4173
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:02,500
the iron

4174
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:04,500
the weight on the bar

4175
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:06,500
the weight on the bar in the

4176
02:44:06,500 --> 02:44:08,500
squat rack that can rust

4177
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:10,500
but you can always trust the iron

4178
02:44:10,500 --> 02:44:12,500
the iron never lies to you

4179
02:44:12,500 --> 02:44:14,500
god I gotta start working out again

4180
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:16,500
I'm so fucking pathetic

4181
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:18,500
I'm such a fucking pathetic little man baby

4182
02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:20,500
yep with my little body

4183
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:22,500
that only moves normal amounts of

4184
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:24,500
true true

4185
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:26,500
um

4186
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:28,500
it's it's time

4187
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,500
it's warm again I can go back

4188
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:32,500
to my basement without suffering

4189
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:34,500
next voicemail is called

4190
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:36,500
little Christians running to

4191
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,500
megalovania

4192
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:40,500
one go

4193
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:42,500
so my my my dad

4194
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:44,500
is a gym teacher

4195
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,500
at a small christian school

4196
02:44:46,500 --> 02:44:48,500
and

4197
02:44:48,500 --> 02:44:50,500
for the for running for

4198
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:52,500
he has music play right

4199
02:44:52,500 --> 02:44:54,500
and so then he has like you know

4200
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:56,500
christian rock whatever

4201
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:58,500
he thinks of my childhood

4202
02:44:58,500 --> 02:45:00,500
and uses that as a basis for what music to play

4203
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:02,500
so like you'll hear like

4204
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:04,500
smooth mcgroove legend of

4205
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:06,500
zelda tracks going on

4206
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:08,500
you'll hear like children running to the

4207
02:45:08,500 --> 02:45:10,500
fairy fountain theme

4208
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:12,500
it kind of echoes through the school a little

4209
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:14,500
and not only that

4210
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:16,500
but I thought this was a

4211
02:45:16,500 --> 02:45:18,500
this was my time snatch opportunity

4212
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:20,500
I told him

4213
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:22,500
to use megalovania

4214
02:45:22,500 --> 02:45:24,500
and it happened

4215
02:45:24,500 --> 02:45:26,500
in this small christian school

4216
02:45:26,500 --> 02:45:28,500
on almost a daily

4217
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:30,500
basis you can hear megalovania

4218
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:32,500
playing through the halls

4219
02:45:32,500 --> 02:45:34,500
as as as children

4220
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:36,500
from from pre-k

4221
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:38,500
to senior

4222
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:40,500
in high school and they must know

4223
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:42,500
they must know what it is to run to megalovania

4224
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:48,500
things can look bad in the world but

4225
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:50,500
this shows that there can be true happiness

4226
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:54,500
unfathomably based

4227
02:45:54,500 --> 02:45:56,500
unfathomably incredibly based

4228
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:58,500
god levels of base right there

4229
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:02,500
a lot of those kids must know what the song

4230
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:04,500
is

4231
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:06,500
definitely some of the older kids

4232
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:08,500
if it's just children

4233
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:10,500
who are going to have memories of that song

4234
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:12,500
and they will eventually discover it

4235
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:14,500
it would be way funnier

4236
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:16,500
if it's like little kids

4237
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:20,500
if it's like teenagers

4238
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:22,500
I think a lot of them would be like

4239
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:24,500
why is the gym teacher playing the

4240
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:26,500
undertale soundtrack

4241
02:46:28,500 --> 02:46:30,500

4242
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:32,500

and mistery tea

4252
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:54,500
prepare

4253
02:46:54,500 --> 02:46:56,500

of nipo

4257
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:04,500
we plan to battle

4258
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:06,500
proto

4259
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:08,500
write down

4260
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:10,500
on noscroll

4261
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:12,500
then nobeno sento san

4262
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:14,500
steal

4263
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:16,500
battle scroll

4264
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:18,500
fuck you

4265
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:20,500
return the samurai

4266
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:22,500
ninja tea

4267
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,500
battle scroll

4268
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:26,500
okay until next time

4269
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:28,500
sayonara

4270
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:30,500
were they going to battle

4271
02:47:30,500 --> 02:47:32,500
each other

4272
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:34,500
or were they all going

4273
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:36,500
I think they're saying that you stole

4274
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:38,500
mister tea's battle scroll

4275
02:47:38,500 --> 02:47:40,500
they wrote

4276
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:42,500
a battle plan

4277
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:44,500
on a scroll

4278
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:46,500
and

4279
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:48,500
so okay

4280
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:50,500
but I stole the scroll

4281
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:52,500
before they were all in alliance

4282
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:54,500
against me because

4283
02:47:54,500 --> 02:47:56,500
they have allied against me because I stole the scroll

4284
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:58,500
so when they wrote the battle

4285
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,500
plan they were enemies

4286
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:02,500
so they must have been

4287
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:04,500
it must be battle plans for them to battle

4288
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:06,500
each other

4289
02:48:06,500 --> 02:48:08,500
or you like individually

4290
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:10,500
no no because I was in alliance

4291
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:12,500
I was they trusted me back then

4292
02:48:12,500 --> 02:48:14,500
this is only when it was stolen

4293
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:16,500
only once it was stolen that everything changed

4294
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:18,500
they desperately want me to return the scroll

4295
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:20,500
they've allied with each other

4296
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:22,500
so that I'll return the scroll so they can fight each other again

4297
02:48:22,500 --> 02:48:24,500
no I can't

4298
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:26,500
I have to keep it to protect

4299
02:48:26,500 --> 02:48:28,500
I have to protect them from themselves

4300
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:30,500
I'm saving lives here

4301
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:32,500
I see

4302
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:34,500
hmm

4303
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:36,500
the plan has backfired

4304
02:48:36,500 --> 02:48:38,500
I'm more resolute in my scroll hoarding than ever

4305
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:40,500
next voicemail

4306
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:42,500
I think it's the last one

4307
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:44,500
is called slash everybody

4308
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:46,500
slash wants to rule the world

4309
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:48,500
three two one go

4310
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:51,500
on the previous episode of the podcast

4311
02:48:51,500 --> 02:48:53,500
Ben and Gimper arguing on

4312
02:48:53,500 --> 02:48:56,500
DG's self-diagnosed autism

4313
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:58,500
and

4314
02:48:58,500 --> 02:49:00,500
the conclusion they all came to

4315
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:02,500
was essentially that

4316
02:49:02,500 --> 02:49:04,500
if a metal professional did not

4317
02:49:04,500 --> 02:49:06,500
diagnose

4318
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:08,500
then at best it can be called

4319
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:10,500
in the question of what it is

4320
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:12,500
of that diagnosis compromise is the word y'all used

4321
02:49:12,500 --> 02:49:14,500
and I as a transphobic

4322
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:16,500
alt-right fucker

4323
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:18,500
I have to ask

4324
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:20,500
can this not be applied to both

4325
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:22,500
and DG's transness

4326
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:24,500
I can't speak

4327
02:49:24,500 --> 02:49:26,500
for give and take

4328
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:28,500
but I feel as if

4329
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:30,500
because DG had not sought therapy

4330
02:49:30,500 --> 02:49:32,500
or anything involving her issues

4331
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:34,500
I wonder if

4332
02:49:34,500 --> 02:49:36,500
there's another

4333
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:38,500
her gender dysphoria

4334
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:40,500
is not valid because

4335
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:42,500
not a medical professional

4336
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:45,500
the

4337
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:47,500
being trans is not a

4338
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:49,500
being trans is not a diagnosis

4339
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:51,500
it is not a disease

4340
02:49:51,500 --> 02:49:53,500
it is not like a medical

4341
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:55,500
like

4342
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:57,500
issue that is like treatable

4343
02:49:57,500 --> 02:49:59,500
it's like gayness

4344
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:01,500
like you can't

4345
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:03,500
it's not like a disability to be gay

4346
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:05,500
it's just sort of silly

4347
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,500
it's like being gay

4348
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:09,500
yeah no you can't

4349
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:11,500
you can't be diagnosed as trans

4350
02:50:11,500 --> 02:50:13,500
being trans is something you

4351
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:15,500
I guess

4352
02:50:15,500 --> 02:50:17,500
decide that you are

4353
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:19,500
they do annoyingly and a lot of institutions

4354
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:21,500
have like

4355
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:23,500
people to diagnose transness

4356
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:25,500
so that you can get

4357
02:50:25,500 --> 02:50:27,500
like the

4358
02:50:27,500 --> 02:50:29,500
hormones that you would need to transition

4359
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:31,500
because a lot of

4360
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:33,500
medical institutions are a little

4361
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:35,500
I don't know

4362
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:37,500
they're unsure about it and they haven't updated in a long time

4363
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:39,500
even though the medicine

4364
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:41,500
the knowledge is there

4365
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:43,500
but it's just like the bigger

4366
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,500
not all the doctors know

4367
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:47,500
it's just only specialists do

4368
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,500
and you always

4369
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:51,500
haven't caught up yet

4370
02:50:51,500 --> 02:50:53,500
okay

4371
02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:55,500
correct me if I'm wrong

4372
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,500
gender dysphoria

4373
02:50:57,500 --> 02:50:59,500
gender dysphoria is literally

4374
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:01,500
just that you feel bad

4375
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:03,500
about your gender

4376
02:51:03,500 --> 02:51:05,500
basically

4377
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:07,500
I'm not like an expert

4378
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:09,500
okay

4379
02:51:09,500 --> 02:51:11,500
I think

4380
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:13,500
someone can correct me if I'm wrong

4381
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:15,500
it's not like autism

4382
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:17,500
you can diagnose yourself with gender dysphoria

4383
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:19,500
because the only criteria for having it

4384
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:21,500
is do you feel bad

4385
02:51:21,500 --> 02:51:23,500
and if you do then that's gender dysphoria

4386
02:51:23,500 --> 02:51:25,500
right?

4387
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:27,500
I think so

4388
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:29,500
essentially yes

4389
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:33,500
I want

4390
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:35,500
I hope that this question

4391
02:51:35,500 --> 02:51:37,500
is asked in good faith

4392
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:39,500
I mean

4393
02:51:39,500 --> 02:51:41,500
I think the alt-right

4394
02:51:41,500 --> 02:51:43,500
maybe would be exaggerated

4395
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:45,500
a little bit but not too far off the mark

4396
02:51:45,500 --> 02:51:47,500
so I'm a little

4397
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:49,500
little sus about this guy

4398
02:51:49,500 --> 02:51:51,500
I'm open to discussing

4399
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:53,500
this if people are genuinely curious

4400
02:51:53,500 --> 02:51:55,500
because

4401
02:51:55,500 --> 02:51:57,500
there's a lot of stupid

4402
02:51:57,500 --> 02:51:59,500
assumptions made about

4403
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:01,500
being trans

4404
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:03,500
and it's like

4405
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:05,500
it's not a

4406
02:52:05,500 --> 02:52:07,500
it's not untrue

4407
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:09,500
if it's not diagnosed

4408
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:11,500
gender

4409
02:52:11,500 --> 02:52:13,500
is a

4410
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:15,500
you can't diagnose someone's gender

4411
02:52:15,500 --> 02:52:17,500
it just doesn't make sense

4412
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:19,500
gender is a thing that you

4413
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:21,500
choose

4414
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:23,500
or that you choose to be

4415
02:52:23,500 --> 02:52:25,500
or you

4416
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:27,500
yeah right

4417
02:52:27,500 --> 02:52:29,500
gender is a role that you

4418
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:31,500
choose to accept

4419
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:33,500
society

4420
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:35,500
that you live in

4421
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,500
dictates what

4422
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:39,500
men do and women do

4423
02:52:39,500 --> 02:52:41,500
and there's gender signifiers

4424
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:43,500
that you can

4425
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:45,500
ascribe to

4426
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:47,500
and some you might not

4427
02:52:47,500 --> 02:52:49,500
mix and match you can do what you like

4428
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:51,500
and gender

4429
02:52:51,500 --> 02:52:53,500
dysphoria is where

4430
02:52:53,500 --> 02:52:55,500
the gender that you are told to be

4431
02:52:57,500 --> 02:52:59,500
usually just based on your birth sex

4432
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:01,500
is something that you don't

4433
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:03,500
want to do

4434
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:05,500
and you want to do instead do

4435
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:07,500
something else or the exact opposite

4436
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:09,500
you know the other gender

4437
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:11,500
in the society

4438
02:53:11,500 --> 02:53:13,500
in which you live

4439
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:15,500
the gender part of it

4440
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:17,500
is based a lot

4441
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:19,500
needs a lot of context

4442
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:21,500
and because of that it's not like a brain

4443
02:53:21,500 --> 02:53:23,500
thing

4444
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:25,500
I mean it's a problem

4445
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:27,500
that you feel

4446
02:53:27,500 --> 02:53:29,500
that you don't

4447
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:31,500
feel comfortable

4448
02:53:31,500 --> 02:53:33,500
doing specific things

4449
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:35,500
but like the exact science of it

4450
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:37,500
I'm not entirely sure

4451
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,500
but you can tell when you're upset

4452
02:53:41,500 --> 02:53:43,500
you can tell when you're upset

4453
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:45,500
I think it's easier to tell when you're upset

4454
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:47,500
than it is to tell whether or not you're autistic

4455
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:51,500
but you know honestly I'm not even sure

4456
02:53:53,500 --> 02:53:55,500
I don't think

4457
02:53:55,500 --> 02:53:57,500
somebody experimenting with their gender

4458
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:59,500
is like an invalid thing to do

4459
02:53:59,500 --> 02:54:01,500
whether or not like if there's

4460
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:03,500
some medical

4461
02:54:03,500 --> 02:54:05,500
diagnosis that is like

4462
02:54:05,500 --> 02:54:07,500
yes you have gender dysmorphia

4463
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:09,500
or gender dysphoria or whatever

4464
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:11,500
I don't think it's wrong for anyone who doesn't

4465
02:54:11,500 --> 02:54:13,500
have that to try to do any

4466
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:15,500
gender stuff if they feel like it

4467
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:17,500
there's like no reason for it to

4468
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:19,500
be considered wrong

4469
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:21,500
to not be diagnosed

4470
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:23,500
for that

4471
02:54:23,500 --> 02:54:25,500
to do whatever you like regardless of

4472
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:27,500
whatever

4473
02:54:27,500 --> 02:54:29,500
again I'll give this guy the benefit

4474
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:31,500
of the doubt that he asks his question in good faith

4475
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,500
but this is the same kind of

4476
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:35,500
reasoning that you can use

4477
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:37,500
to invalidate trans

4478
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:39,500
people's gender when you say

4479
02:54:39,500 --> 02:54:41,500
oh but you weren't diagnosed

4480
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:43,500
with dysphoria

4481
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:45,500
you need a doctor's diagnosis

4482
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:47,500
to prove

4483
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:49,500
that you have dysphoria

4484
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:51,500
you can't prove that you have dysphoria

4485
02:54:51,500 --> 02:54:53,500
it's like do you feel bad

4486
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:55,500
and like I don't know to be like

4487
02:54:55,500 --> 02:54:57,500
oh no you don't have a real gender dysphoria

4488
02:54:57,500 --> 02:54:59,500
it's like well what are you saying

4489
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:01,500
anybody who goes around saying

4490
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:03,500
I'm saying I feel bad

4491
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:05,500
and you're saying no you don't

4492
02:55:05,500 --> 02:55:07,500
you can't prove it you can't prove that you feel bad

4493
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:09,500
it's like well you're right

4494
02:55:09,500 --> 02:55:11,500
I can't

4495
02:55:11,500 --> 02:55:13,500
anyone going around like deliberately

4496
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:15,500
dead naming someone because they haven't got

4497
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:17,500
a medical note for them from their doctor

4498
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,500
saying I should

4499
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:21,500
treat you the way you want to be treated

4500
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:23,500
I should not upset you

4501
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:25,500
like that's stupid

4502
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:27,500
it's sort of equivalent of saying

4503
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:31,500
please don't annoy me

4504
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:33,500
could you stop being really mean to me

4505
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,500
and somebody saying

4506
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:37,500
well I mean the police haven't told me that I can't

4507
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:39,500
be annoying there's not a law against it

4508
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,500
shut the fuck up

4509
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:43,500
you're a piece of shit

4510
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:45,500
the word for this is trans

4511
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:47,500
medicalism

4512
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:49,500
and it is a kind of stealth

4513
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:51,500
it is a kind of stealth transphobia

4514
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:53,500
that disguises itself

4515
02:55:53,500 --> 02:55:55,500
as an interest

4516
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:57,500
it disguises itself

4517
02:55:57,500 --> 02:55:59,500
as an interest in facts

4518
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:01,500
over feelings

4519
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:03,500
well

4520
02:56:03,500 --> 02:56:05,500
sorry to use a confusing word just

4521
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:07,500
but it misdiagnoses

4522
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:09,500
the issue

4523
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:11,500
by assuming that gender is a

4524
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:13,500
medical condition

4525
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,500
which it is not

4526
02:56:15,500 --> 02:56:17,500
it's far more

4527
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:19,500
it's a social construct

4528
02:56:19,500 --> 02:56:21,500
well it's a social

4529
02:56:21,500 --> 02:56:23,500
it's a social condition

4530
02:56:23,500 --> 02:56:25,500
not a medical one

4531
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:27,500
sure right

4532
02:56:27,500 --> 02:56:29,500
treat me please so that I don't

4533
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:31,500
feel terrible please don't

4534
02:56:31,500 --> 02:56:33,500
bully me

4535
02:56:33,500 --> 02:56:35,500
please treat me

4536
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:37,500
with respect is not like

4537
02:56:37,500 --> 02:56:39,500
something you can say

4538
02:56:39,500 --> 02:56:41,500
do you have a note from your parents

4539
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:43,500
saying I can't bully you

4540
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:45,500
saying I shouldn't

4541
02:56:45,500 --> 02:56:47,500
respect you

4542
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:49,500
it's never an excuse

4543
02:56:49,500 --> 02:56:51,500
for transphobia ever

4544
02:56:51,500 --> 02:56:53,500
okay

4545
02:56:53,500 --> 02:56:55,500
well I feel like we have

4546
02:56:55,500 --> 02:56:57,500
I feel like we have blown the lid off

4547
02:56:57,500 --> 02:56:59,500
of this one we have blown this story

4548
02:56:59,500 --> 02:57:01,500
wide open what a scoop

4549
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:05,500
and that's the last voicemail we did it

02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:09,500

4559
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,500
so that will be dropping soon

4560
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:29,500

4581
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:11,500
too many people have been

02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:13,500
stealing

4583
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:15,500
too many people shoplifted our bonus episodes

4584
02:58:15,500 --> 02:58:17,500

they've been sharing them on file sharing websites

4587
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:23,500

4588

but not too many

4592
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:33,500
because this episode is long

4593
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:35,500
they're also long

4594
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:37,500
do people want them shorter?

4595
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:39,500
no I don't think people want them

4596
02:58:39,500 --> 02:58:41,500
shorter

4597
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:43,500
