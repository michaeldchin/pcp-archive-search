1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I'm gonna bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
That son of a bitch.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Son of a bitch.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Son of a bitch.

6
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Son of a bitch.

7
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,800
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Son of a bitch.

9
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Son of a bitch.

10
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

11
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,080
All right, then, welcome to a canceled episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,320
It is January 9th, 2022.

13
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,000
It's the new second episode of the new year.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,120
Who do we have?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
Cybershell is here.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,080
I'm back for my mandated yearly appearance.

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm only here because I know there's at least one guy in the PCV audience who probably

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,080
like fucking hates me and he's like, oh god, can't believe he's back, he's on another episode

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
to ruin it.

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,640
Yeah, I'm here just to ruin that one guy's day.

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
I want that guy to leave a comment and explain why.

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I want him curious.

23
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,480
Yeah, I want to see the yes-cybershell-no-watch guy.

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,000
Oblivion follows here.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,480
Hi, I've ruined everything.

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Yeah.

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
CeCe is here.

28
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:07,920
The Tails Gets Trolls manager, tape and primer, and me, Ben St, and Gibb and take.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,160
Did you forget Simsie?

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,360
Oh, I did forget Simsie, sorry.

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,840
I'm the background presence.

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm only here because we thought Gibb wasn't going to be here and we needed a British person

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,080
to direct all those two.

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,240
There's two people here that I wasn't expecting to be here, so there's too many, but that's

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
okay.

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,480
We're bringing back the old episodes where people just talk over each other all the time

37
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,640
and yell.

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Everybody likes them.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,120
Everybody liked the one with Tisnaker because it was just a lot of yelling, a lot of talking

40
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,400
over each other, and it was good.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,680
That's what people liked it.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, that's good to know.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,520
So, Gibb, do you want to explain why are you here?

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,320
You weren't supposed to be here.

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,600
I wasn't supposed to be here.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,720
I was supposed to be in the air or at the airport because I was going to fly out to

47
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,640
Boston to see Munchie and Ben and everyone, and it's going to be a fun time, but it was

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,760
going to be a fun time.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,400
But there's a COVID problem, and it came up at the exact last possible moment it could

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,840
have come up this morning, the day I was supposed to be gone by now, but my dad tested positive,

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,920
and because we can't be sure that I don't have it already, because it's likely that

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:43,920
if he was infectious earlier and not symptomatic, then everyone in the house is infected, and

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,360
I wouldn't have time to figure it out.

54
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,880
So I'm probably going to get COVID in a couple of days, and I can't go and see my friends,

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,200
but it sucks.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
That's all.

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
It just really sucks.

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Yeah, I also got COVID from my dad.

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Oh, really?

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Yeah.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:16,240
He probably got it from work, and yeah, everyone's getting it, but I'm better now, mostly.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Who's had COVID?

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,080
Simsie, you have not had COVID.

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
Cybershell, have you had COVID yet?

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,760
I've not had COVID, apart from getting the shot and feeling shitty.

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,360
That sort of counts, but no, I haven't actually got it, because I've just been inside all

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,080
the time, and I refuse to be social with anyone, ever.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,040
I literally never leave the house except for groceries, but I've still managed to get it

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
twice.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Amazing.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,560
I'm still recovering from it.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,040
This is the penalty for having things like friends and family.

73
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
How dare you?

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:57,840
I lived in a tiny university house with fucking four people, and one bathroom, and my friend

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,400
she got it, and somehow none of the rest of us caught it, and in the full two weeks that

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
she was positive.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Impressive.

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
I don't understand how that happened.

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
What was she, pacing in the garden or something?

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't understand.

81
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Women aren't even real, that's why.

82
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
True.

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,560
Women aren't as extremely, not extremely, but higher, like transmission easier.

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Easy transmission.

85
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,920
It's like twice as easy or something.

86
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,960
You just need to breathe near someone, or not even cough.

87
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Less lethal.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,000
That's a good right, question mark.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,160
I don't really know enough about this shit to be like making definitive statements.

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,000
They say that, but then I've seen other experts be like, no, probably not.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,560
It's probably just that people have more immunity now due to vaccinations and antibodies due

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
to previous infections.

93
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,320
That's probably the reason for the reduced hospitalizations and deaths.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Speaking of reduced.

95
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,640
I've seen conflicting opinions.

96
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,960
I wanted to leave a comment on, I can't remember if it was the last episode, and you're like,

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
is Ben okay?

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,640
His brain sounds a little shrunken lately.

99
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,440
I don't know what that's about.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,520
It is, but not necessarily due to COVID, but maybe due to COVID.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,120
That might just be a natural thing happening to everybody.

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, that's a good point because I've been vaccinated twice.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,200
I got the booster and everything too, and I still got it, but the symptoms weren't

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
bad.

105
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I heard it here first, folks.

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Vaccines don't work.

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Don't get them.

108
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
They don't.

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,120
They're an anti-vax podcast now.

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,520
You're better off without them, actually.

111
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Okay.

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,400
YouTube, please don't pretend I didn't say that, YouTube.

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Kill Ben.

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
The algorithm doesn't like it.

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,080
The management at Sims 4 does not support this message.

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,600
If COVID does shrink your brain, if everyone gets COVID, it evens out because then everyone

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
will be stupider.

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,240
No, think about it like this.

119
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
On balance.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Think about it like this.

121
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,640
If it's smaller, the neurons will have less to travel to be fired from the distance would

122
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
be smaller.

123
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,320
You'd actually think even quicker.

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,480
You think your brain is going to be ... It actually just makes it more efficient, makes

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,800
it more aerodynamic, actually.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
The shrinking is superior.

127
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,040
You can have enhanced reflexes like Spiderman.

128
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,960
Maybe it's the racist part of your brain that gets shrunk, and this is a good thing

129
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
for society.

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,720
Well, I mean Daredevil is blind, but because of that, he has super hearing and proprioception.

131
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,280
Because of that, his brain shrunk.

132
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Ben, Daredevil is not real.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
You get COVID, I don't care.

134
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,880
You get COVID, you lose your sense of smell and taste, so probably your other senses get

135
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,320
more powerful to compensate.

136
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
You're going to be COVID Daredevil.

137
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
It's logical.

138
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,560
You're going to be out there fighting crime with your bandana over your nose.

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,840
COVID Daredevil, he lost his sense of smell and taste, but now his sense of ... I don't

140
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,360
know, his sense of balance is really good.

141
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,920
Cum production has increased.

142
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,800
He's also blind, not because of COVID.

143
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,000
He just happened to be blind anyway, so that one didn't get improved.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,280
He's blind because he's a fan of Netflix's Daredevil, so he just wants to go the full

145
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,360
nine yards and cosplay.

146
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,520
That's why he's blind, just because he likes Daredevil.

147
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,640
So anyway, I finally got a test.

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,240
I used my last test on New Year's because I thought I would be negative and I would

149
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,000
be able to party on New Year's, but alas, I was still positive.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
So I was like, fuck.

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,520
So New Year's is ruined.

152
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
But then I could not find any more tests, so even though I'm almost certainly was negative

153
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
shortly after that, I was not able to confirm it.

154
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,360
So it took me like a week until my friend Dwoob brought me over a test, because he found

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,840
one in a pharmacy.

156
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,240
So now I am officially negative, finally.

157
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,880
So that's good news, I guess.

158
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Took a while.

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Yeah.

160
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
What a hassle.

161
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
What a drag.

162
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah, this disease thing ain't so good.

163
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,640
Get rid of it.

164
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,040
In my opinion, the coronavirus is bad.

165
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Excuse me.

166
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,640
I was informed COVID would be over by now.

167
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm done with this COVID shit.

168
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm done pretending that I'm going to care about it.

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm just going to pretend like it doesn't exist and go about my daily life and infect

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
everyone.

171
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,880
At least you're honest.

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,280
I think that's the way to do it.

173
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Also the economy.

174
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
It's going to last for a couple more years.

175
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Is good.

176
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,640
Coronavirus bad.

177
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,520
The economy, good.

178
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,840
No masks, no doctors, baby 2022.

179
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,280
Are you running for president?

180
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah.

181
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, I will be old enough by the next election cycle, so there we go.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,720
Oh, scary Ben, dying of old age.

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
I shouldn't say that.

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,040
I shouldn't say that out loud.

185
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
Ben's going to be 78.

186
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm as old as Jesus was when he was crucified.

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Think about that.

188
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,160
And you've done as much, if not more, with your life.

189
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,960
And I'm going to be crucified.

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Jesus didn't even have a podcast.

191
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:45,760
He had a bunch of followers, sure, but they didn't buy a shirt, so they didn't do anything.

192
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
I mean, Jesus was like the first podcast.

193
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,560
The Sermon on the Mount was a legendary podcast.

194
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,360
I feel like I've made that exact joke before.

195
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
I say it and I'm like, sounds familiar.

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,480
It was a good episode.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,520
It was a good episode, but it goes down with a bit more editing.

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,040
I should have gone living full to soul, that one out.

199
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,720
Oh yeah, I'm the only one who can edit good, clearly.

200
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,920
I know that there's PCP mega fans out there that are going to like, anytime you reuse

201
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
a joke, they're going to have a comment like, didn't you actually use this joke back in

202
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
episode 141?

203
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,880
It's like, okay, thank you so much.

204
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,720
I don't, frankly, frankly, I don't think so.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,640
I don't think PCP viewers are that astute.

206
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't think they have what it takes to call me out on something like that.

207
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,520
I think they're a bunch of dummies.

208
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I think they're a bunch of roots.

209
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,280
Therefore, it's okay to just reuse jokes and content from years past.

210
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,760
Dude, I used so many jokes in Cluster Punk Kitchen and no one noticed.

211
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,280
I had to be self-aware about it and still no one could even remember what the joke

212
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,960
that was reused was.

213
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,880
I mean, you use them a certain amount of times and it becomes, and it's endearing.

214
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,160
There's a sweet spot for reuse.

215
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Like, Cluster Punk Kitchen was you as well.

216
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Yeah, it was all revealed yesterday.

217
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Oh, that's right, Gibby.

218
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
Gibby, you weren't on the last episode.

219
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
We delved into all of the...

220
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,940
I saw the thing and it was like, everything revealed, but I forgot about Cluster Punk

221
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Kitchen.

222
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,140
I remember there was...

223
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,180
Oh, wait, let me ask you.

224
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,860
There was some confusion because there was some guy who would call in to say like, racist

225
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:29,180
shit and he had a deep voice and I occasionally confused him with Cluster Punk Kitchen.

226
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,500
Did you ever get frustrated?

227
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,700
They'd like, no, that's not, that wasn't me.

228
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,180
I actually don't remember.

229
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,660
I've ever called in and said anything racist, I don't think.

230
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,420
There was a guy who I thought was the Cluster Punk Kitchen guy because he just happened to

231
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,700
have a deep voice, but no, it was just a coincidence.

232
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't think that would have been me.

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,500
I don't think I've ever...

234
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,300
No, I know it wasn't you.

235
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,020
I'm saying I thought it was you and I said it...

236
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Yeah, I know, I know.

237
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,340
I'm just like, huh, I don't know.

238
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,980
I don't actually remember.

239
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
There's so many of them.

240
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,740
I remember the guy as well.

241
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,100
We haven't shown a few of his voicemails on the show because they were just like...

242
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,020
After a while, we eventually just started to be like, stop.

243
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,500
Anti-black lives, sort of like, okay, this guy's fucked.

244
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,660
He's like this very racist shit.

245
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
It wasn't even funny.

246
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
It wasn't even funny.

247
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,660
It wasn't funny.

248
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Well, that's the main thing.

249
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,300
I mean, if you're going to be racist, at least be funny about it.

250
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
I mean, kind of.

251
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Yeah.

252
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
It's strange to me.

253
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,540
There's like a deranged, like racist person, but who's also still a PCP fan for some reason.

254
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,580
It's like, I better submit my voicemails just so they know it's up.

255
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,300
Well, haven't heard from him in a while, so he may have finally been weeded out of the

256
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
pack.

257
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Wow.

258
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,420
Turns out, Ben, figure out, you just have to stop playing the bad voicemails if you don't

259
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,020
want to get the bad voicemails.

260
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Yeah.

261
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,140
If I were to say something racist, it'd be like, oh, black people have small toes and

262
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
I don't like it.

263
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,140
It'd be like something stupid like that.

264
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
Oh, clip that.

265
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Clip that one.

266
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
No reason to live.

267
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Canceled.

268
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,780
Yeah, I voicemail anarchy, basically.

269
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,540
There was like very rare, very rare exceptions for like, and it was only people who made

270
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,660
like repeated attempts to make like deliberately shitty voicemails.

271
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Everyone gets one shitty voicemail.

272
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Yeah.

273
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Yeah, kind of.

274
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,140
It was the only time I would be like, Eleazar, just edit this out and pretend we didn't do

275
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,380
it because it's not even funny.

276
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
It's not engaging.

277
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
It sucks.

278
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Yeah.

279
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,420
Like occasionally we do have like somebody who has like a weirdo opinion about something

280
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,220
that we address and then it's not so bad.

281
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,100
There's a discussion there.

282
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Otherwise it could be funny.

283
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:06,220
It's only been like two or three times that someone's just been so like gross, not even

284
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,380
like in a gross like poo poo way because those ones annoyingly get played on the show and

285
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,660
I don't like it when somebody takes a shit and records it.

286
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,660
But like.

287
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Oh yeah.

288
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Oh yeah.

289
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Oh, that stays in.

290
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
That's all content.

291
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,900
But like gross topic wise and opinion wise, it's only happened like three or four times.

292
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
I don't like bad people.

293
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Anyone else with me?

294
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
I don't like bad people.

295
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,020
You guys don't even understand.

296
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,580
Coming out with all the like the best tips right now, Simsie.

297
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
Wow.

298
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,460
No, Simsie, you can't say that.

299
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,740
We have so many bad people in our audience.

300
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
You can't say that.

301
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
You'll offend them.

302
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
Fuck you.

303
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,500
There's so many people that suck that listen to the PCP.

304
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
It's our main demographic.

305
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,740
I hope you guys are ready for next week's voice mails.

306
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Uh oh.

307
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,580
I think every week for now they're going to be like 15 minutes long because you're not

308
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
going to have all the good ones.

309
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,700
It's just going to be the shitty low effort ones.

310
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
No.

311
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
No way.

312
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,100
If you're if you're longer than two minutes, you get auto deleted.

313
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
I don't care.

314
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,660
Actually, I think the time limit is 130.

315
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,420
So I don't think they evenly.

316
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,100
Oh, on the topic of bad people, I guess I can bring up the I guess I can bring up the

317
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,380
weird shit that happened on Furious Cat for me.

318
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,980
I tweeted about it yesterday.

319
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,660
I saw yeah, I saw you getting or tweeted something about it.

320
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Sure.

321
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Yeah.

322
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,340
I've drawn like a few more like dogs.

323
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,380
By the way, everyone follows Simsie.

324
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
Everyone follows Simsie.

325
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380
Is it at Simsie fart?

326
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,380
Yeah.

327
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,540
Simsie fart because art was taken and boy was taken so I thought whatever and Simsie

328
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
was taken.

329
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,140
But I have a Curious Cat page that like Simsie for big, big booby, big booby mommy milkers.

330
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Hell yeah.

331
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Hell yeah.

332
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,500
There's that website Curious Cat, which is just basically a Q&A website where people

333
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,780
can submit questions anonymously.

334
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,620
And somebody noticed that I'd been drawing slightly more dark skinned girls than usual

335
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
recently.

336
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Which is not like intentional or anything.

337
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
How dare I exactly.

338
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Uh oh.

339
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Uh oh.

340
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,620
We got we got a problem here.

341
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Yeah.

342
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,300
And they and they sent me a bunch of fucking questions that weren't even questions.

343
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,580
They were just saying like, damn, that's just horrible racist chair and it's like fuck

344
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,580
off.

345
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Yeah.

346
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
You know what I mean?

347
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,100
I don't understand why some of you so motivated just from seeing a drawing to do that.

348
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
That's mindbrained.

349
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,340
No, I also, I also don't understand.

350
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
People bad.

351
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,020
Uh, uh, if you don't cyber cyber shell, you, you, you must, you understand your, your,

352
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,740
your, your kind of that like that.

353
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
Why don't you explain why people do that?

354
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Uh, what do you mean?

355
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
Why I'm kind of like that.

356
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
I feel bad.

357
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
I was making a joke, but now I feel bad.

358
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,940
I was just going to say, this is, um, first of all, you're right.

359
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,180
There, there, there's a bunch of deranged lunatics out there.

360
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,620
I'm not saying it's your fault, but like, this is why I don't even have a curious cat.

361
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,860
I don't want people to be able to anonymously ask me things.

362
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Fuck you.

363
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,140
If you want to ask me something, show me your identity piece of shit.

364
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Yeah.

365
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Yeah.

366
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
That's true.

367
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
I am.

368
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
I just have a curious cat.

369
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,460
I, I support, I support the alternative service, Brony Curious is much better.

370
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Like the people sent cyber shell weird enough shit on Twitter.

371
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Like there was this guy who kept asking or he kept replying to every post that cyber

372
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,140
shell made asking about like if Sonic is pregnant or something.

373
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,820
That guy, at least, you know, those were annoying, but like that guy thought he was being funny.

374
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,020
At least that guy thought he was being funny.

375
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,260
Like, you know, there's a difference between those guys and people who will just go out

376
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,940
of their way to send like deranged racist shit.

377
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,860
The attempt, the attempt, oh yeah, that's true.

378
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Yeah.

379
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,700
You know, I remember, I think, I remember Formspring, that was kind of like Curious Cat, right?

380
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,420
Just a website where you could ask someone questions.

381
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,420
Yeah.

382
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Right.

383
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,220
It's like an ask FM kind of type deal.

384
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,980
I mean, I understand the appeal of those sites.

385
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,300
I wasn't completely shitting on them.

386
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,260
I just personally am like, fuck you, I'm not, I'm not answering any questions, fuck you.

387
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,380
I remember Andrew Hussie had a lot of really good, a lot of people asked him like Homestuck

388
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:16,020
Lore questions and a lot of info, a lot of great insight was gleaned from his Formspring

389
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,700
answers about stuff back in the day, which was cool.

390
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,380
I like those.

391
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,620
I think Formspring is like dead now, or, wasn't there some shit where Curious Cat was dead

392
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,700
a few like a week ago and everyone's like, oh, yeah, it just came back.

393
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
I don't know.

394
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Yeah, I was going to mention that.

395
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,300
And then there was like a bunch of people saying, oh, don't use it.

396
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,300
It's like compromised.

397
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,900
And there was like a day later, people came on like, it's not really compromised.

398
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,060
I don't know why everyone was saying that, but that's why I checked it is because it

399
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
came out.

400
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,140
I hadn't looked at it for like months and I checked it and it was just all this fucking

401
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,260
horrible shit over months that someone had sent me.

402
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,060
I think it was about like 10 messages and it's like, what the fuck, why?

403
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,620
People are mental, man.

404
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, mental.

405
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,740
Do you do you get a lot of questions on and I would no trust me?

406
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,780
Oh, no, absolutely not.

407
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,660
No, really, like that was like 90 percent of the stuff that had been sent to me over the

408
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,620
last few months because I haven't barely used it.

409
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,620
I just checked it because I heard Curious Cat was back and I was like, OK, wait, it was

410
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,900
gone. What? And then I looked and I was like, oh, well, I'm looking at it right now and

411
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,420
it says it's under maintenance.

412
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
I don't never mind.

413
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,300
I don't know. Speaking of stuff that I've been seeing recently, have you guys been

414
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
playing Wordle?

415
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,580
Have you guys been wordling?

416
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,460
Oh, yeah, I have seen that on my timeline.

417
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,780
I don't even know.

418
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,900
Is that is that a Pokemon?

419
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
It does sound like a Pokemon.

420
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,420
Wordle, Wordle rules.

421
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,620
I've played three now and I'm three for three here.

422
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I'll post the.

423
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,940
Yeah, it's it's the if you've been seeing these little graphics, these little emoji

424
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,020
graphics that people have been it shows it shows like your score.

425
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,980
Let me find one.

426
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,620
I did I did one earlier today.

427
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,580
I'll show my score from Wordle 204.

428
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,060
Where is it?

429
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Here we go.

430
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Oh, yeah.

431
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,820
Copy and paste in that.

432
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
That looks good.

433
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
That looks real good.

434
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
There we go.

435
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Read them and we.

436
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,500
OK, I've seen those.

437
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Yeah.

438
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,620
I have no idea what it is.

439
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
So it's.

440
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,020
How does this work?

441
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm on the page.

442
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,860
It's it.

443
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,580
But yeah, well, you word guessing you make sense.

444
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,420
Yeah, you have to get it sort of like mastermind, but with a word.

445
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,660
You ever play Mastermind?

446
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,780
I know the TV show Mastermind.

447
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,700
It's simple.

448
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,660
It'll just tell you if you get the letter in the right place, it'll be green.

449
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,020
And if you get the letter in the correct letter, but in the wrong place,

450
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,820
it'll be yellow. It's pretty much that simple.

451
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,020
So I got a blank thing and I press A and it's wrong.

452
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
So what do I do?

453
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,220
Matt, Mastermind is a game where like your opponent chooses a sequence

454
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,620
of four colors and you basically have to like make a series of guesses

455
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,220
about of like colors, a series of colors, and he has to tell you like, OK,

456
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,660
you you got one color right, but it was in the wrong place or you got one

457
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,700
color right and it was in the right place and stuff like that.

458
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,780
So word is like that.

459
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
You guess a fight.

460
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,820
You have to guess a five letter word and you have like five or six guesses.

461
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,260
So you have to put it.

462
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,020
You have to type in a five letter word and then it will tell you

463
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,700
which of your letters in your word were correct, but in the wrong place

464
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,220
or correct in the right place.

465
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,980
And because you have a series of guesses,

466
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,260
it gives you this cute little this cute little emoji code.

467
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,180
You know, your your series of guesses forms a little little pattern

468
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,540
that makes for a nice little postable post here.

469
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,740
Because look how great it is.

470
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,420
Because the question is the same for everyone every each day, isn't it?

471
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,220
So like, yes, why they do it as emojis as opposed to people just screenshotting

472
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,580
the results because we just spoil it for everybody.

473
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So.

474
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,380
Yeah, don't no, no, no, no, it's not the same.

475
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,820
Same. Everyone everyone gets one word a day

476
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,060
and it's the same word for everybody.

477
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,420
They do it in different languages, too, which is kind of cool.

478
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,020
If you speak multiple languages, you can play multiple games.

479
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,500
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

480
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,740
What is the strategy?

481
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,940
You just guess a random five letter word and then from there

482
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,020
you have some information with which to make more guesses that are more correct.

483
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,140
Yeah, like, see, my first guess, you know,

484
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,340
it gave me that one yellow square.

485
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,100
So I knew that that letter was in the final word,

486
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,020
but it's not in the right place.

487
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,620
I got two greens on my first try.

488
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,100
So that's pretty lucky.

489
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,180
That's super are all the letters, five words.

490
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,540
Or all what all the five letters.

491
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,740
OK, if you guys enjoy wordal viewers right now,

493
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm not trying to hear it a shit on you or whatever,

494
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,100
but I instantly lost interest in this game once I realized

495
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,620
you can just game the system by if you just search the words O read,

496
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,500
hints, clump and gawky.

497
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,260
That's like 20 letters.

498
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,140
You will guarantee to be able to figure out the word, basically,

499
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,500
from just having inputted all those letters.

500
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,260
You know what I mean?

501
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,060
Like there's systems you can do to basically guarantee

502
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,700
that you're going to be able to figure it out.

503
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,140
Oh, I mean, I mean, necessarily if you're just trying to figure it out,

504
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,380
I guess if you're trying to like get the best score.

505
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,060
This is one of those games you have to use the honor system, right?

506
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,140
Because I mean, obviously, like, yeah, you can just.

507
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,260
Yeah, it's about how you really cared that much, I guess, about score.

508
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,580
It's about how few it's about how few guesses can you get it in.

509
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,060
And then you brag and you post your results

510
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,620
and you make you hope that everyone else looks.

511
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Hey, everyone, I'm really good at this guessing game over here.

512
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
So I just want to brag about that.

513
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,660
I'm really good at tic-tac-toe.

514
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,460
I win it almost every time against.

515
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm really good at hangman.

516
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,380
I'm trying so hard to think of a of a word that ends in this letter,

517
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,380
but I don't.

518
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,540
How do I?

519
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,660
It's impossible.

520
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,900
This one, this one confused me.

521
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,060
This one was a little bit tricky.

522
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,900
This is the third of the last three that I played.

523
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,220
This was the trickiest.

524
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,740
Today was going to be the first one I played,

525
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,660
but I looked at someone's screenshot beforehand and I realized, oh, shit.

526
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,740
That was today's one.

527
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,180
Get fucked, loser.

528
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,380
Can you play a game?

529
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah, true.

530
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,860
Yeah, true.

531
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,380
I have to wait all the way until tomorrow.

532
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,700
Can you do pass?

533
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,980
I guess there would be no reason to do pass ones

534
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,900
if you can just look up the answers.

535
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,180
I tried to look up if you could like choose a different puzzle,

536
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,740
but it looks like it's just the one for the day.

537
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,500
I don't know.

538
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I didn't look at it too long.

539
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,140
It's weird. Why wouldn't they let you do old ones?

540
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,580
Because it's a big community Web 3.0 metaverse thing, Ben.

541
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,980
That doesn't explain anything.

542
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,500
Web 3.0, I'm just going to keep saying that until you accept it and move on.

543
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,460
Well, oh, fuck.

544
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,540
It's like, oh, yeah, this is all like we're all actually secretly

545
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,180
like solving the human genome with all this like computing power

546
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,100
that we're putting in.

547
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,660
If this was like truly Web 3.0, I'd expect it to be like every time

548
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,940
you finish a wordle, it's like you completed a wordle.

549
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,380
Would you like to purchase your wordle as an NFT?

550
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,420
I would.

551
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,700
Dublock chain.

552
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,660
Would you like some of Dublock chain?

553
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,980
What did I want?

554
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,780
Chain, more like.

555
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,700
What blockchain?

556
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,500
What blockchain shit did I see this week that sucked?

557
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,980
Oh, Bitcoin is crashing a bit right now.

558
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,100
It's it's not doing super great.

559
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,500
What's the point of crypto?

560
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,180
Crypto just crashes every time the stock market crashes.

561
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,260
It doesn't it doesn't free you from anything.

562
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,140
It's completely tied to the bullshit via currency that everyone's like,

563
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,940
oh, it's so it frees us from this.

564
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,020
No, it doesn't.

565
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,620
Did the stock market also crash?

566
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,980
I didn't even know about it.

567
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,020
I haven't I don't pay attention to money.

568
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,540
I refuse to learn about any financial knowledge.

569
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,500
I choose to live in ignorance and be stupid about my cyber show.

570
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,380
I love your bank account.

571
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
I love money.

572
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,700
I love money so much.

573
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,700
Yes, you can.

574
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,020
That's how stupid I am about money.

575
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,220
I just give out my bank account details to anyone who will ask publicly

576
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,660
on a password and credit card info and just send me your credit card in the mail.

577
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,580
I'm going to read three credit card number is three.

578
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,100
Oh my god, I just got really overwhelming urge to.

579
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:35,540
I so the card I'm currently churning is my American Express business cash blue.

580
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,780
And I just got the overwhelming urge to read out the funny little numbers on it.

581
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Obviously, I must every time you talk about hard churning,

582
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,740
I imagine you like dressed up like an Amish person churning butter,

583
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,540
but like sitting there over it's your little car.

584
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,900
It's like that.

585
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,340
It's exactly like that.

586
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,780
You know, I think I imagine making butter like one of those those.

587
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,140
Oh, oh, no, I got covid one of those.

588
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Oh, God, it might be.

589
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,060
There's a fucking satisfying to look at like metal crushing machines

590
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,460
with two like cylinders that grab something and crush it.

591
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,140
I guess that's what I imagine when you card churn.

592
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,980
Is that you're throwing cards into metal roller, a flat roller, crushing machine.

593
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,900
It's a crushing machine.

594
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,340
There's like with like interlocking teeth, two cylinders going inwards to it.

595
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,020
And you people just throw a conveyor belt and like a tub is like a funnel.

596
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,060
And then there's things like oh, but the rollers have like ridges on them.

597
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,380
And the ridges like interlock with each other, right?

598
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,260
Grab things and you can throw like animal carcasses into the animals.

599
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,220
You can throw like steel beams.

600
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
You can throw anything.

601
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,820
Well, you can throw the robot dog from Walton Gromit Clochette.

602
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,580
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

603
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,980
That's right.

604
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,380
I had a little toy.

605
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,020
He was scared.

606
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,380
Oh, yeah, pressed in the pressed in the cyberdog.

607
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
What a legend.

608
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,700
I watched all of those with my dad on Christmas.

609
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
That was great.

610
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,220
Last Christmas, I gave my dad watched Flushed.

611
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,020
We watched Flushed Away.

612
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,340
We talked about my dad's a big Aardman fan.

613
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,620
We watched Flushed Away and I loved I loved it.

614
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,140
Flushed Away is cool.

615
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,460
It's pretty weird.

616
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,580
It was really good.

617
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,140
I think I talked about it last year, but I thought was like, wow.

618
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,460
I was like, what a what a what a great little what a great little flick.

619
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,820
What a great little like, you know, clean and satisfying

620
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,460
little three act heroes journey that was.

621
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,060
I was very compelled by it.

622
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,220
It was I loved it.

623
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,940
I've never seen it, but didn't they like

624
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,660
like imitate the stop motion with like animation?

625
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,540
They just did it.

626
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,140
The animation.

627
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,220
It was animated by Dreamworks, but in the style of Aardman,

628
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,900
like in the character design style and like with the limited frame rate stuff

629
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,140
on the faces, I think the bodies were completely smooth.

630
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,540
But yeah, it's cool.

631
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,620
Yes, it was a pretty good.

632
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,700
I think that's interesting.

633
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,940
You got Hugh Grant and as the guy, right, as the main man.

634
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,900
Yeah, that sounds that sounds right.

635
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,260
Yeah, that sounds right.

636
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,340
And you got Ian McKellen as the funny frog.

637
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,460
And he goes, I'm a man of quality.

638
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,740
Right. Good movie.

639
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,660
This is a good movie.

640
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,300
This year, I didn't get to watch anything with my family for Christmas

641
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,020
because I was quarantined with coronavirus.

642
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,340
I still fucking pissed off about it.

643
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,860
I'm fucking mad.

644
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,300
I fucking in terms of festivities for new years.

645
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,980
I went around a friend's house and I got very, very drunk.

646
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,540
I was the only person who drank more than one beer.

647
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,500
That's what I wanted to do, but I was still positive.

648
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,460
My dad drove me home and I was almost sick on the way home.

649
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,860
So I had to step out and I just took a piss behind a bus stop.

650
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,980
And I was like, I'm still doing this.

651
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
I'm twenty two and I'm still doing this.

652
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,460
And then wait till you're thirty three and still doing it.

653
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,020
Yeah, I got home.

654
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,020
I've omitted like six times and put on trailer park boys on my phone.

655
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,460
And then I then then I suddenly was conscious again.

656
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,180
And it had been two hours and I can tell because six episodes had gone by.

657
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,780
And I was like, damn, I have passed out on the toilet for two hours.

658
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,940
Great. Sounds very uncomfortable.

659
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,780
Oh, I was fine.

660
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,060
I'm a grown boy. I can still do it.

661
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,940
We only twenty two, you're just a baby.

662
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,300
I know.

663
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,500
I feel old because my back always hurts from work, which is great

664
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,100
because I have to haul potatoes all night because I have a night job at the supermarket.

665
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,780
Maybe you should put the potatoes down.

666
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,980
No, but you've got to put them on the shelf, give.

667
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
Did you know that?

668
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,700
Did you know that you've got to put potatoes on the shelf in the store?

669
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,780
No, interesting.

670
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,900
Tatoes are interesting shelves.

671
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,020
Interesting grocery store fact.

672
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,260
You know, the shit you're supposed to keep cold

673
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,700
during the night when you're doing delivery.

674
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,300
It just sits in the middle of the aisle for hours, not in the fridge

675
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,900
because it takes so long to like put it on the shelf.

676
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,540
So all that chicken you're eating has just been sat there for at least four

677
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,460
hours every night, not refrigerated, which I mean, delicious.

678
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,820
That's I would do that in my own home.

679
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,340
So what a recommendation is that you need to chuck anything

680
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,060
that's been out for like two hours, though.

681
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,740
Well, what makes you think I would follow a health recommendation?

682
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,460
Well, guess what?

683
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,860
Every single piece of fucking poultry in the shop that I work at

684
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,180
has been left out for at least four hours.

685
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,060
So that's cool.

686
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,660
I hope I don't shop there.

687
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,300
That opens my eyes a little bit.

688
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,340
It's more efficient that way.

689
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,900
I'm not going to say the name.

690
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,740
It's called chicken churning.

691
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,820
Exactly.

692
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,260
Oh, about wordle, when you put a letter and it's gray,

693
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,020
that means it's not anywhere in the world, right?

694
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,700
Correct. That's right.

695
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,380
That's right. Wow.

696
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,980
So it's eliminated.

697
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,380
It snowed here the other day.

698
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,580
It actually just like two days ago, it snowed like a lot.

699
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,460
There's like a foot and a half of snow on the ground

700
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,660
or might be starting to melt finally.

701
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,220
First first serious snow of the winter.

702
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,260
Every time there's snow, I'm just so happy because it looks so pretty.

703
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,060
But then I have to remember, I'm not a kid.

704
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,140
I don't get school like days of school off because of snow.

705
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,180
It just makes my life worse and harder.

706
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,100
Yeah. Fortunately, I'm blessed to be a renter.

707
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,300
You know, I'm blessed not to own property.

708
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,180
So I'm not responsible for shoveling anything.

709
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,820
You know, that's that's that's interesting because when I was a kid,

710
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,500
I was like, oh, I wish I lived somewhere where there was snow

711
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,300
so I could have school off.

712
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,220
But now that I'm old, I'm like, oh, I'm glad I don't fucking have to deal with that shit.

713
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,860
Dude, I did.

714
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,500
Well, if you live in like Virginia or something,

715
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,860
if you even get like a quarter of an inch of snow,

716
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,580
like everything shuts, you don't have to shovel it.

717
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,740
But everything just shuts down instantly

718
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,140
because the infrastructure is simply not prepared.

719
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,500
I got it in four. I got it in four.

720
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
That happens once every like five.

721
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,180
Oh, very good.

722
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,980
Now you're addicted.

723
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,220
Now you know the addicting rush of figuring out a word.

724
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,300
Yeah, you know, wordle seems like a thing.

725
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,940
Seems like a kind of give core.

726
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,860
It definitely did.

727
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,540
Game. I love it.

728
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,820
I like it. I like.

729
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,660
I've played it three days straight now

730
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,380
and we'll see how long I keep my streak up.

731
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,060
I was enticed.

732
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,860
I was enticed by the little emoji cubes.

733
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
I was just like, who made this?

734
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,340
How are they making money off of this?

735
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,340
I need to know.

736
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,380
I'm not comfortable using this until I know how the it's monetized.

737
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,620
It's not about the money.

738
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,700
It's about sending a fun word puzzle to a fun round.

739
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,980
It's about the mitts.

740
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,180
Game, how did you how did you get it like that?

741
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,460
How did you get no yellows?

742
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,020
I thought of, well, I got lucky on the first one

743
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,940
and then I got lucky on the second one.

744
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,140
And then I got lucky on the fourth one.

745
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,700
Well, there was only like, you know what the word is, right?

746
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,940
I'll tell you how she got it, Ben.

747
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,020
She thought, unlike you, your brain is twisted.

748
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,780
I got the second letter on the first try

749
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,820
and then nothing for the entire thing,

750
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,860
except for the last one where he accidentally got the last letter.

751
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,540
So I got fucked.

752
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,580
I realize I got it first try.

753
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,900
You can nobody nobody plays it on hard mode,

754
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,900
but there is a hard mode.

755
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,620
And what hard mode does is it means that you can't.

756
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,900
When once you guess a letter, you can't like change the letter

757
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,460
like that letter is locked in.

758
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,540
And I was like, huh?

759
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,700
And then I realized, oh, well, that's because

760
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,420
if you didn't have them locked in, you could just, you know,

761
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,460
yeah, guess an entire little system.

762
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,660
I had to work on hard mode.

763
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,740
I just found out about that.

764
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,300
Yeah, my full system.

765
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,460
No, I have to actually think about the stupid word.

766
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,500
I tend to basically play as though I'm on hard mode.

767
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,700
Wait, what?

768
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,260
What's the I put the word in right?

769
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,300
And I pressed enter and then the second one I put a word in

770
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,500
and then I like I could go back.

771
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,220
I could delete letters and no, no, no, no, I mean, again, you could.

772
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,340
Well, OK, you entered a word that had the green letters

773
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,340
in the right place. On hard mode, you have to do that.

774
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,340
Like, yellow doesn't count? What do you mean?

775
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Yeah, well, on regular mode, you know, if you don't, you could have put

776
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,340
Once you've correctly guessed the letter, you can't not guess the letter.

777
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,340
You can't, like, guess something else that you know is going to cover a lot of bases, you know what I mean?

778
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Like, you have to, like, make honest attempts is sort of how it works.

779
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Oh, you mean, like, on the second one...

780
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,340
You can't, like, farm. You can't, like, put a bunch of random...

781
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,340
You can't put a bunch of vowels on your second attempt if you go to green one on your first.

782
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Like, like...

783
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Yeah, you have to use that green letter again.

784
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
To, like, see how many yellows you could have.

785
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
And be like, okay, these ones are in, and these ones are...

786
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Right.

787
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,340
We have to type a real word. You can't just type random letters.

788
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:05,340
It should have just been hard mode by default. They should have just done that.

789
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,340
I might start playing on hard mode, actually.

790
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Because, like, I always do it anyway.

791
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
So, like, fuck it.

792
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
I might as well get cred.

793
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
I might as well earn my props.

794
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
There better be a special thing on the tweet that you tweet out that's like,

795
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,340
by the way, this was on hard mode, so it's more important than all you other idiots.

796
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
It should have a little, like, star.

797
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
A little, like, shining star emoji.

798
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Or instead of making it green, they could make it red.

799
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,340
But maybe people would get confused and think it was wrong.

800
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
I'm just going to start posting three, or excuse me,

801
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,340
posting five green boxes in a row and saying I got on the first try.

802
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Like, every single day.

803
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
Make it purple.

804
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every day. Every day.

805
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
Just, like, Wordle 204, one out of six.

806
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
Wordle 204, one out of four.

807
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
But I'm just going to acknowledge that I'm cheating.

808
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
I'm just going to be like, wow, hashtag blessed. I'm so lucky.

809
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Yeah, don't... Everyone's asking, like, how'd you do this

810
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
and just refuse to elaborate.

811
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
It's like, I don't know.

812
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,340
I'm the world champion, bitch. I'm the best at Wordle in the world.

813
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,340
If you were as smart as me, you would also get it in one every time,

814
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,340
but you're not, so fuck off.

815
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,340
This sounds like another video game, like, clout swindle

816
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,340
that will somebody make a YouTube video about.

817
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Yeah, this is the new, like, dream-cheating situation

818
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
that's going to blow up.

819
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,340
There's a guy who's, like, cheating at Wordle.

820
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
It's funny, too, because it's, like, the easiest thing

821
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
you could possibly cheat at. It's, like, you know...

822
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
Just Google the answers.

823
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,340
You just have to not do that if you care.

824
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,340
Is that Planet of the Apes?

825
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
No, it's not.

826
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
It's like humans, man. It's not an ape.

827
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
Oh.

828
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,340
There's, in the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes,

829
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,340
there's, like, a cult of humans underground

830
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
that worship an atom bomb.

831
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,340
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

832
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,340
Yeah, and they stole that for Fallout 3.

833
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
That's the anti-Hideo Kojima.

834
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
Ugh.

835
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Okay, okay. Star Trek, of course. Disgusting.

836
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Sorry, sorry.

837
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
I always like to try to ban.

838
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
I'm not allowed to talk about it on PCP.

839
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
Can we get Ben off of this podcast and get Nate back on

840
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
so we can talk about Star Trek?

841
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
No.

842
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Anything but that.

843
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Finally.

844
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Finally, somebody had to say it.

845
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Oh, why didn't Picard care about the Curlin' Nesco

846
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
when it was destroyed? I don't understand.

847
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,340
What the fuck? The pothole?

848
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,340
I'm not, I'm not a big, I'm not a big Trek guy.

849
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,340
I've seen some Trek. I guess it's alright.

850
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
I'm not a big Trek guy.

851
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
That's my opinion.

852
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,340
But, like, TNG's good. DS9's good.

853
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,340
TNG is the only one I've really watched, like,

854
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
even a significant amount.

855
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
It's the only one that interests me.

856
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I'm a fake fan.

857
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I would occasionally catch a DS9 or Voyager,

858
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,340
like, on TV when I was a kid.

859
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,340
But TNG was the one that I mostly...

860
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,340
I've probably seen, like, a dozen or so.

861
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
TNG's very serialized. You can just catch random ones

862
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
and enjoy it.

863
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,340
Or excuse me, TNG's very much just, like, you know,

864
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
random, you know, they're isolated episodes.

865
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
They stand on their own.

866
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
Whereas DS9 was more, like,

867
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
whoa, it's like a continuing serialized story

868
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
that, like, you know, there's, like, season-long arc.

869
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,340
Believe it or not, there was a time in TV history

870
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,340
when, like, the idea of a season-long arc was, like,

871
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,340
whoa, it was really interesting and exciting.

872
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Like, wow, there's continuity.

873
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,340
Okay, when I was a kid,

874
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,340
and I caught an episode of the fucking X-Men cartoon,

875
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,340
and I realized, like, oh, this is, like, a whole, like, arc.

876
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
This is, like, a season-long arc.

877
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
It's not just, like, an episode.

878
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Like, I have to watch the whole thing to understand what's going on.

879
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
I was, like, blown away.

880
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,340
I was, like, whoa, that's so cool.

881
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,340
And then I saw, like, the first three episodes,

882
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,340
and then I missed the fourth one, and then, like, I never caught up.

883
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,340
That's just how TV used to be.

884
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Yeah, you'd have to catch it every week,

885
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,340
and you miss one, then you're just left out of the conversation.

886
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
Can you imagine that shit?

887
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,340
Yeah, I do.

888
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Imagine, like, Game of Thrones, but in, like, the 90s.

889
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,340
Like, everyone's constantly talking about that stupid fucking show,

890
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,340
but if you missed an episode, you're just fucked.

891
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,340
If, okay, okay, okay, if Game of Thrones had come out, like,

892
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:55,340
like, back then, everybody would have had to watch it.

893
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,340
Like, they would have made so much money on ad revenue,

894
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,340
because everybody would have had to tune in to the network at the time.

895
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Yeah, there is something really weird about that.

896
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Like, TV used to be, like, a real, like, yeah.

897
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
Like, you knew you were watching it at the same time

898
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,340
as, like, all these other people, whereas now it's just, like,

899
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,340
oh, we release on Netflix, everyone go binge it at your own leisure,

900
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,340
which I'm not even, I'm not even saying that's a bad thing.

901
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,340
I'm just saying it's different.

902
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Man, you guys...

903
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,340
I am.

904
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Yeah.

905
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
I don't like that.

906
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Binging is a thing you can do afterwards.

907
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
After...

908
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,340
It's a fun way to watch something.

909
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Honestly, I miss the JoJo Fridays, like, how to say, I miss it.

910
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,340
It kind of allows too much to be missed.

911
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
It was just a whole thing.

912
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Yeah.

913
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,340
If you do it for the first time.

914
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,340
Yeah, I used to do JoJo Fridays.

915
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
I used to do that.

916
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,340
But the, but I mean, you know, streaming exists.

917
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,340
There's no reason Netflix couldn't have released JoJo Part 6, like,

918
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
I don't know, they just don't like doing it weekly.

919
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,340
I guess I'm grateful they're doing batches of episodes rather than

920
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,340
just releasing the entire thing at once, but still kind of weird.

921
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:04,340
I think, I think I have, I have lost a lot of interest

922
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
in, like, media in general.

923
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,340
There's, like, very, very few, like, shows or games or anything that I'm like,

924
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,340
yeah, I really want to check that out.

925
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,340
I think one of the few things that could get me

926
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,340
to want to watch the show would be the feeling of, like,

927
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
everybody else is watching it.

928
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
My friends are watching it.

929
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
I want to be a part of the thing.

930
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
Yeah.

931
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,340
So that, that, like, community, like, like everybody's watching it at the same

932
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
night on the week, right?

933
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
We're all going to talk about it the next day.

934
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,340
That, I think that would be a big pull for me.

935
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,340
I think that would be one of the biggest pulls that they could,

936
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,340
they could use to exert their power over me to get me to watch their

937
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
stupid fucking show.

938
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
And they, and they've given it up.

939
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,340
They've given it up because, like, there's so many shows,

940
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,340
and they're all on streaming, and I could watch them any time I want,

941
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
but, like, ah, fuck it.

942
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Hey, bells.

943
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
You know?

944
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Why?

945
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Yeah.

946
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Well, it wasn't, it wasn't a weird game like that.

947
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,340
Have you heard of a serialized manga called One Piece that you could catch up

948
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,340
with and talk to people about?

949
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,340
I could, I could.

950
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,340
You could even go in the conversation of Talking Pirates on twitch.tv.

951
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
Damn.

952
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Two years ago at Radcon 4, I almost caught up on One Piece.

953
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,340
And you're still writing off the coattails of almost catching up

954
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
one time two years ago.

955
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,340
And that, and that was then, yeah, and that was then,

956
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
and now I'm like, well, shit, I was almost,

957
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
I've been almost caught up for two years.

958
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,340
I guess I'm not anymore.

959
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
My friend is watching it.

960
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
He's not reading it.

961
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,340
He's watching the whole thing, and he's, I'm like,

962
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Well, that's pain.

963
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
You're a psychopath, dude.

964
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Yeah.

965
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,340
That's like, that would take so long to do.

966
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I mean, how did this happen?

967
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I watched the whole thing.

968
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Jeez.

969
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I watched like the first like, the first one.

970
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
Just the One Piece anime have filler in my heart.

971
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,340
I think I remember when it was.

972
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
I can't remember when it was.

973
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,340
It just has bad pacing.

974
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
It was up to like the other chapters.

975
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,340
Okay, okay, it does have, it does,

976
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
it does have some filler,

977
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
but some of the filler is actually really good.

978
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Right.

979
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Like there's that one arc, like when they come down from,

980
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
uh, fuck, what's from Skypea,

981
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,340
they land in that like, in that like prison island

982
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,340
and that's a whole filler arc in the anime.

983
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
Yeah.

984
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
That's really good.

985
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
That's a great.

986
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,340
Yeah.

987
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Mostly the episodes are just really badly paced

988
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,340
and like slow.

989
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
It's because after the time skip,

990
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
they go to one chapter per episode,

991
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
which is terrible.

992
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
They're badly paced.

993
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,340
They should just make the episodes half as long.

994
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
They try.

995
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
15 minute episodes.

996
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,340
They try it.

997
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
They go fucking long.

998
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,340
The intros and outros.

999
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
And the recap.

1000
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,340
It's crazy how long we can get on some shows.

1001
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
It's insane.

1002
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,340
15 minutes of new animation on a show

1003
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
because most of it's recap and intros.

1004
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
Crazy.

1005
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
The intro is like a full three minutes long.

1006
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
Then you have two minutes of fucking recap

1007
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,340
and then like the outro is a full like four minutes

1008
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
or something like that.

1009
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,340
It's crazy.

1010
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,340
They're saving as much time as possible.

1011
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
So one piece is a weekly strip.

1012
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,340
Is it still going weekly?

1013
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,340
Is that just, it's a weekly strip?

1014
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
They have an outro.

1015
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
That's just crazy to me.

1016
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,340
He takes breaks every time.

1017
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
That's so much.

1018
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
Oda is a little less consistent than he used to be,

1019
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
but it's mostly every week.

1020
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,340
He's got some good, what do you call it?

1021
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
Some manga I think is good to read like weekly.

1022
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,340
Some of it like trying to read as it comes out is torturous.

1023
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,340
I really like Kaiji,

1024
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,340
but I just have to like deliberately forget about it for a year

1025
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,340
and then like catch up on it.

1026
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
You know what I mean?

1027
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,340
Hold on.

1028
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,340
You mean ultimate survivor Kaiji?

1029
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Yeah.

1030
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,340
Kaiji is still going.

1031
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Is that still going?

1032
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,340
It's still going.

1033
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Are you joking?

1034
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
No, no, no.

1035
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
He's on this crazy arc right now.

1036
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
It's like you don't even understand.

1037
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,340
How long has it been going for?

1038
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
Since the 90s.

1039
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,340
The thing is, it's not like every week or anything.

1040
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,340
That's why I was like,

1041
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
one piece every week because like that's crazy to me

1042
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,340
that you can be that consistent.

1043
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
Kaiji is not every week.

1044
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
I think it's either monthly now or actually I have no idea

1045
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,340
what the schedule is.

1046
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,340
I'm only catching like the English pages as their chapters

1047
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,340
as they're translated.

1048
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,340
So I don't really know the actual release date,

1049
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
but yeah, it's still going.

1050
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
It's literally still going.

1051
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Kaiji still having his little fun adventures.

1052
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,340
I used to not even read the manga,

1053
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
but just like knowing that.

1054
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Yeah.

1055
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
His fun adventures.

1056
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
The lighthearted, the lighthearted realm.

1057
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Getting his like ear cut on.

1058
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,340
That is a Kaiji ultimate survivor.

1059
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Going in like slave jail underground.

1060
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
See, it's so good though.

1061
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,340
It's so good.

1062
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,340
Do they, do they keep making the anime or do they?

1063
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,340
No, the anime is stuck on,

1064
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
we're never going to get a season three unfortunately.

1065
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,340
I mean, at least that's my guess,

1066
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
which is yeah, it is unfortunate because I really like,

1067
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
but you know, it's one of those things for years,

1068
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,340
I was like, when are we going to get season three?

1069
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,340
When are we going to get season three?

1070
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,340
Oh, I'll just follow the give up.

1071
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,340
And then eventually I'll just read the fucking manga.

1072
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,340
Fuck it, I'll read the manga.

1073
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
Yeah, yeah.

1074
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,340
Feel me.

1075
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,340
It's like the attack on Titan effect.

1076
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,340
It's like, well, it's gotta fucking read the manga, I guess.

1077
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,340
It's extra hard when you know it's just like,

1078
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,340
it's just there, it's waiting for you.

1079
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:06,340
Like spoilers are like,

1080
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,340
you could go spoil the whole show for yourself if you want it.

1081
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,340
I could spoil the show by just, by reading it,

1082
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,340
by going and reading it as intended.

1083
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,340
Yeah.

1084
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,340
And it's original format.

1085
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Exactly.

1086
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,340
The ultimate spoiler.

1087
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,340
I'm so excited for the next season of attack on Titan

1088
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,340
to see all the discourse around that.

1089
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
It's going to be very fun to re-experience it after the manga.

1090
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
I'm going to be honest,

1091
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,340
I watched the first season of attack on Titan

1092
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,340
and I was like, oh, this is pretty interesting.

1093
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,340
Oh, maybe I'll actually watch like the second season too,

1094
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
but whatever.

1095
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
The point is I dropped it and then I was like,

1096
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
I didn't even hate it,

1097
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,340
but I just sort of was like, whatever, I dropped it.

1098
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,340
And now the only thing I hear about people is like bitching

1099
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,340
about how horrible the ending was.

1100
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,340
And now I'm like more curious.

1101
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,340
So I think I might get back into it

1102
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,340
just to hear people bitch about the ending.

1103
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,340
I watched the first season and I liked it.

1104
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,340
I thought it was cool.

1105
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,340
But then, you know, there was a long wait,

1106
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,340
I think for season two.

1107
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,340
Yes, that too.

1108
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,340
And then I was like, okay.

1109
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,340
And people were like, oh, you can just read the manga.

1110
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,340
And then I heard some of the stuff

1111
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,340
that is later in the manga and I was like,

1112
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,340
that sounds dumb.

1113
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,340
I don't know.

1114
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,340
I dropped it.

1115
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,340
So I dropped the show and again, I didn't hate it,

1116
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
but I was like, this kind of feels like The Walking Dead,

1117
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,340
but like for weebs,

1118
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,340
because main characters are constantly introduced

1119
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,340
just to get killed off in a shocking way.

1120
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,340
It's a little cringe.

1121
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,340
So yeah, I sort of fell off.

1122
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,340
But then I heard, it gets incredibly weird

1123
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,340
and political later,

1124
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,340
which is why everyone hates it.

1125
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,340
The problems I had with it are not problems

1126
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,340
that people bring up when they're like,

1127
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,340
this is why it's a bad show.

1128
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,340
You know what I mean?

1129
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,340
So I'm curious as to how it got bad.

1130
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
I read the whole manga.

1131
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,340
Is that what people think the problem is?

1132
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,340
Is that it went smart?

1133
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,340
And it wasn't just people being like smart.

1134
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,340
No, just heard a bunch of weird complaining

1135
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,340
about the political aspects of it

1136
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,340
and something about characters,

1137
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,340
like Aaron's character got assassinated or something.

1138
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,340
The main politics is genocide, bad.

1139
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,340
And if people are complaining about that,

1140
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,340
that's a red flag, in my opinion.

1141
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,340
Yeah.

1142
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,340
I've read the manga.

1143
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,340
I've seen the whole show so far.

1144
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,340
It's one of the few things I have actually caught up on.

1145
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,340
I don't know.

1146
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,340
If you've only seen the first season,

1147
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,340
there's at least two more seasons of good animation,

1148
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,340
but the good animators are no longer working on it

1149
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,340
after they switched studios, which is a shame.

1150
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,340
It's so fucking annoying, dude,

1151
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,340
when it's like you watch a show, like one punch man,

1152
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
you're like, like, shit, this is great animation,

1153
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,340
and then the next to the next season.

1154
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Well, here's the thing, one punch man also had

1155
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
the best scenes in one punch man season one

1156
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,340
were done by the same animator who did all the best scenes

1157
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340
in Attack on Titan.

1158
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,340
His name's Howie Fooly.

1159
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,340
There was great animation, I remember.

1160
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
Action, animation, God, he's a crazy man.

1161
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Attack on Titan's over, right?

1162
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,340
Like the manga ended a while back,

1163
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
but they just haven't been in a show.

1164
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
The show is one more season coming in the manga.

1165
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,340
Technically, it's part two of season four, I think.

1166
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,340
They're cooling it?

1167
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,340
I don't know why they do that.

1168
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,340
You got to break the last season into two parts.

1169
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,340
That's just like a time-owner tradition of milking.

1170
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,340
They did that with season three, too.

1171
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,340
There was season three part one, and then season three part two.

1172
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Oh, yeah.

1173
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,340
That's dumb, just call it next season.

1174
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,340
It should be actually season four,

1175
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,340
and then season four should be called season five,

1176
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,340
and then season four part two should be called season six.

1177
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,340
That would make more sense to me.

1178
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,340
They should go away with calling things season six.

1179
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,340
Part six.

1180
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,340
I don't see it being set in autumn

1181
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,340
or winter or summer.

1182
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,340
It just doesn't make any sense.

1183
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,340
It is weird. Season is a weird term,

1184
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,340
and they don't even use it in England, right?

1185
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,340
Numbers.

1186
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,340
They call it a series.

1187
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,340
We had a series of a show or something.

1188
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,340
Yeah, that's so confusing.

1189
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,340
It's inconsistent. It's weird.

1190
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
It's like shit that's made in England.

1191
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,340
They say series,

1192
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,340
and then everything is important.

1193
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,340
It is inconsistent.

1194
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,340
Well, yeah, most of the time,

1195
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
but then other times it's like

1196
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
they'll adopt the word season

1197
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
for

1198
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,340
a show made in Britain,

1199
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,340
and other times they'll use series for a show

1200
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,340
imported from other countries.

1201
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,340
It just doesn't, it sucks.

1202
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Why does it have to be so confusing?

1203
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Just call it the show.

1204
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
You're absolutely right. The season in Moniker makes

1205
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
even less sense now that everything gets dumped in one day.

1206
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
It's not even like it airs across the season anymore.

1207
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
All the episodes are dumped in one day on Netflix.

1208
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
Oh, that's why they were called season?

1209
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,340
Yeah.

1210
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,340
That's funny.

1211
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,340
Seasonal anime or whatever comes out

1212
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,340
during a season,

1213
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,340
and it's like, oh, it's the winter set of shows.

1214
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,340
It's the this or that.

1215
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,340
I get it, but it really just doesn't

1216
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,340
reflect reality at all

1217
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,340
when you use season for everything,

1218
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
regardless of when it comes out.

1219
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,340
And I don't really have a problem with it.

1220
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
The fact we use season to refer to a series of episodes

1221
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,340
made in a time frame.

1222
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,340
English, come on.

1223
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
They used to have like,

1224
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,340
there was a series

1225
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340
which means like

1226
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,340
one after the other of like episodes

1227
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,340
that could be watched in any order.

1228
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,340
And then there's a serial

1229
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,340
which is used to refer

1230
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,340
to a show that has a narrative

1231
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,340
that goes from one episode to the other.

1232
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,340
You need to watch all of them, I think.

1233
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Either that, it's like one way or the other.

1234
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
Like a series

1235
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
show

1236
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,340
is like, I don't know,

1237
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,340
like a

1238
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,340
Doug, and then a serial would be

1239
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,340
Game of Thrones.

1240
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,340
We call everything season.

1241
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,340
I'm okay with season because it makes discussion easier

1242
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,340
when you're like saying,

1243
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,340
remember in season blood when this happened.

1244
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,340
I'm just so used to it, I'll never not call things season.

1245
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,340
Yeah.

1246
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,340
It's one of those like

1247
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
languages change and season now just means

1248
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,340
that when it refers to a television show

1249
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,340
or whatever.

1250
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,340
But I don't care about Attack on Titan.

1251
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,340
I just wanted to speak about something.

1252
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,340
I just wanted to be pedantic.

1253
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,340
Neva Diwali now though.

1254
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,340
I'm the opposite.

1255
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,340
I care a lot about Attack on Titan, but I didn't talk about it.

1256
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
Hey, what about

1257
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,340
this series?

1258
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,340
Huh?

1259
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,340
What do we think?

1260
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,340
What do we think? It's a math joke.

1261
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,340
That's like, googly eyes.

1262
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,340
With an E and an A and an I

1263
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,340
and a dash and an I and a dash and a one.

1264
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,340
That's exactly it.

1265
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,340
That's exactly what it is. Yes.

1266
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,340
I'm glad you understood.

1267
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,340
What does that mean, Mr. Say?

1268
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,340
That's the summation.

1269
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,340
That's the summation sign.

1270
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,340
It's when you do a series

1271
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,340
that you add up, that means

1272
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,340
A starts with the I

1273
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,340
and then it's the sum and it goes minus one.

1274
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,340
Wow. Everybody laughs at this fucking nerd

1275
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
for trying to tell us about math.

1276
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,340
That's boring.

1277
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,340
That's boring.

1278
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,340
Remember when the female Titan screamed

1279
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,340
and all the Titans ran up and started fighting?

1280
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
That was cool.

1281
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,340
Yeah, I dropped out of school

1282
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,340
so I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1283
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,340
Ben got a degree in physics

1284
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,340
or some worthless nonsense

1285
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
that's not even real.

1286
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,340
No, it wasn't worthless

1287
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,340
because now when I

1288
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,340
have Game Maker open

1289
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,340
I can tell my little guy

1290
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,340
to jump in an arc and I go,

1291
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,340
okay, oh, square

1292
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,340
and I'll make a fade out

1293
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,340
and I make a fade out and I'll use a little

1294
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,340
square root and I'll just say, okay, yeah,

1295
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,340
that's a nice little gentle curve.

1296
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,340
A nice little gentle curve for my little

1297
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,340
video game character, man.

1298
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,340
You should track down and email

1299
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,340
some more professors.

1300
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,340
And be like, this is what I did with my degree.

1301
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,340
Look at the pony game I made.

1302
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,340
No, I don't want to tell James

1303
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340
a joke about that.

1304
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,340
He'd be ashamed.

1305
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,340
But it is a cool skill

1306
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,340
to be math knowledgeable

1307
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,340
that you can put a formula into a thing

1308
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,340
to make a pretty thing happen.

1309
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,340
It actually is.

1310
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,340
I wouldn't know the first thing about

1311
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,340
making a cool arc. I would just need to look up

1312
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,340
what to do.

1313
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,340
The math that I learned was way more advanced.

1314
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,340
The stuff that I use is like fucking

1315
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,340
freshman year bullshit.

1316
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,340
But for what it is,

1317
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,340
it is useful to know about

1318
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,340
the equations

1319
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,340
for a parabolic arc

1320
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,340
or whatever.

1321
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,340
It's good and shit.

1322
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,340
It's helpful.

1323
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,340
If I'm ever in a situation

1324
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,340
where I need to know the radius or the tangent,

1325
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,340
I'd rather die.

1326
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,340
I'd rather just be dead.

1327
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,340
Sign! Cosine! Tangent!

1328
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,340
You ever play

1329
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
The World Ends With You?

1330
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,340
No.

1331
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,340
It's like The World Ends With Cosine.

1332
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,340
It's that one guy that goes

1333
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,340
Sign! Cosine! Tangent!

1334
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,340
I was good at playing the new one.

1335
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,340
He's the best guy.

1336
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,340
Oh right, there's a new one.

1337
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,340
The older one was awesome. The older one ruled.

1338
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,340
I don't know. I haven't seen the new one.

1339
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,340
I heard the switch port of the old one was really bad.

1340
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,340
So I wasn't going to buy that. I was just going to buy the new one.

1341
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,340
Why was it bad?

1342
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,340
It's like a full 3D remake

1343
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,340
and it just ruined the combat.

1344
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,340
The combat doesn't work without the DS system

1345
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
kind of thing.

1346
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
I was skeptical about that.

1347
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,340
I don't know.

1348
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,340
I mean, the original one was made

1349
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,340
the original one

1350
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,340
was very specifically designed

1351
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,340
for the DS.

1352
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
So, you know,

1353
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,340
I can understand how it's just totally fucked

1354
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,340
if you try to play it on anything else.

1355
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,340
It should have done a Wii U port

1356
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,340
when they had the chance.

1357
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,340
Genuine? Yeah.

1358
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,340
Wii U was the perfect fucking console

1359
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,340
for a World of Few sequel.

1360
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,340
OK, the big DS.

1361
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,340
Yeah, it was actually the perfect console

1362
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,340
for like a lot of

1363
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,340
types of games, but like

1364
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
it died so,

1365
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,340
and they didn't really use the touch screen.

1366
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,340
World of Few is actually one of the coolest games

1367
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,340
I've ever played.

1368
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,340
It's actually like, it might be like

1369
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,340
top 10 games that I remember

1370
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,340
like the most fondly.

1371
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,340
I love it.

1372
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,340
That means a lot coming from noted media

1373
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,340
in Saint.

1374
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,340
I used to like things.

1375
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,340
There was a time

1376
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,340
when I liked video games

1377
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,340
and at that time

1378
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,340
World of Few was pretty up there.

1379
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,340
I was like, yeah, pretty cool.

1380
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,340
I've been on my list for a while,

1381
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,340
but I have a friend who's like obsessed with Twi,

1382
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,340
so I'm like, I gotta play it.

1383
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
I'm gonna play it at some point. You know, it's got

1384
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,340
what, the number of character designs?

1385
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,340
How can you resist?

1386
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,340
Yeah.

1387
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340
I thought

1388
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,340
Twi was like an anime movie.

1389
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,340
They made an anime of it recently.

1390
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,340
Oh, is there an anime of it? I wouldn't know.

1391
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Yeah, I was gonna ask about that.

1392
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,340
You might think it's like a visual novel

1393
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,340
if you saw like screen shots of it,

1394
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,340
but no, it has combat.

1395
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,340
It has...

1396
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,340
No, I thought this was like

1397
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,340
a combination of like Jet Set Radio

1398
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,340
and King of Hearts.

1399
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,340
Aesthetically, that's not even, you know, that far off

1400
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,340
of a descriptor, honestly.

1401
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,340
Hearts just do show up in King of Hearts.

1402
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,340
Right.

1403
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,340
It looks weird as like a cartoon.

1404
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,340
Yeah.

1405
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,340
That guy is,

1406
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,340
he's not pulling,

1407
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,340
he's not putting that cup to his lips,

1408
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,340
he's putting it to his nose,

1409
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,340
and he's sniffing it very hard.

1410
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,340
He doesn't have lips.

1411
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,340
Yeah, he'd have to like pull his

1412
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,340
thing down.

1413
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,340
I had no idea that he pours directly into the scarf

1414
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,340
and he's just like slurping it up and he's like dribbling

1415
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,340
Yeah.

1416
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,340
It looks a little stupid

1417
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,340
in motion.

1418
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,340
In the game, in like the limited

1419
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,340
assets of the dialogue

1420
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,340
of the game

1421
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,340
and the characters moving around on the battlefield.

1422
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,340
It looks great. It's beautiful.

1423
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,340
It's a masterpiece.

1424
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,340
Yeah, it seems like a really stylish game.

1425
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,340
I believe you.

1426
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,340
Speaking of stylish masterpieces,

1427
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,340
I would use for it.

1428
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,340
I got into Beth May Cry recently

1429
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,340
who's just fucking awesome.

1430
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,340
Everybody on Earth should play it.

1431
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,340
I put those off for so long,

1432
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,340
but I kept hearing Matthew Matosis

1433
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,340
suck that series' dick and all these other people

1434
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,340
that I respect.

1435
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,340
In my mind, I like character action games.

1436
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,340
That makes sense. That seems like a really cool genre.

1437
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,340
Whenever I play them, I'm like,

1438
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,340
I'm not instantly good at the game.

1439
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,340
I suck and I'm like, this is bullshit.

1440
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,340
But if you really...

1441
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,340
I'm actually not a DMC expert.

1442
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,340
I haven't even played five yet, which is very shameful.

1443
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,340
And then I got through four as well at some point.

1444
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,340
And yeah, they're really good series.

1445
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,340
I mean, apart from two, obviously, but one in three

1446
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,340
are great games and four was also fun.

1447
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
Yeah, much like with Digimon,

1448
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,340
much like with Digimon, I bounced off of

1449
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,340
DMC part two.

1450
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,340
My friend in high school was like the biggest DMC fan

1451
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,340
and I was like, okay, okay, cool.

1452
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,340
And then I decided to get two.

1453
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,340
So unfortunate.

1454
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,340
And I was like, well, this isn't very fun.

1455
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,340
It's legitimately bad during my time with this game.

1456
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,340
It sucks.

1457
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,340
It's horrible.

1458
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,340
There aren't even DMC fans that defend it.

1459
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,340
There's not even a contingent like, oh, it's actually pretty good.

1460
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,340
Everyone just, oh yeah, it sucks.

1461
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,340
We all know it sucks. It's a piece of shit.

1462
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:51,340
How weird that they could just do that?

1463
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
They could just fuck one up real bad.

1464
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,340
And it's just bad.

1465
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,340
The fact that they were able to make another one at three

1466
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,340
and then that one was actually amazing.

1467
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,340
That was a big surprise.

1468
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,340
Three was the best one.

1469
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,340
Making a video game is hard.

1470
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,340
They're like, all right, we've made one.

1471
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,340
Let's make another one.

1472
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,340
But let's do it a little differently.

1473
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,340
It was the Dark Souls 2 thing with it.

1474
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,340
And then they just made all of the wrong choices.

1475
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,340
It was the Dark Souls 2 problem

1476
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,340
of having a different team.

1477
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,340
And then the guy who directed three

1478
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,340
came in at the very end of development and tried to save it.

1479
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,340
Where it's like, oh shit, you guys...

1480
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,340
He came in all last day.

1481
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,340
So how was that game you're doing?

1482
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,340
There was a famous infamous story

1483
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,340
where it was like the only thing they had done

1484
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,340
was the Stinger attack.

1485
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,340
That was the only useful thing they had done

1486
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,340
at that point in development.

1487
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,340
He had to start from scratch when he came in at the project.

1488
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,340
Jesus.

1489
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,340
My God.

1490
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,340
Game development is hard though.

1491
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,340
Why did they make it shitty?

1492
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,340
Why did they choose to make it shitty?

1493
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,340
It's complicated. It's hard.

1494
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,340
Speak for yourself.

1495
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,340
Speak for yourself.

1496
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,340
I have been cranking up.

1497
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,340
This week I have upgraded.

1498
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,340
I have basically finished making Phantom's Revenge

1499
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,340
beta version 3.

1500
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
I have successfully added

1501
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,340
weapon marriage and stock trading

1502
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,340
to the game.

1503
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,340
Better out of fishing game now.

1504
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,340
Better out of fishing game now.

1505
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:17,340
I think it's all this bullshit.

1506
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,340
That's...

1507
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
Seatall last episode asked if you could fish

1508
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,340
and if there was fishing and farming

1509
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,340
and I was like, oh, maybe.

1510
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,340
No, no, I have to stop.

1511
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,340
I have to stop.

1512
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,340
Save that.

1513
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,340
I think stock trading

1514
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,340
is the perfect edition

1515
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,340
and that's where I'm like, okay,

1516
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,340
game's perfect now. Game's perfect.

1517
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,340
Better out of star rank system

1518
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,340
like Devil May Cry.

1519
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,340
You know, I might

1520
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,340
because the game does

1521
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,340
sort of like judge you

1522
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,340
at the end. The game gives you results

1523
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,340
and you can sort of interpret them

1524
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,340
in like a how did you do.

1525
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,340
Have a bit crushed voice go cool,

1526
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
huh?

1527
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
Awesome.

1528
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,340
I mean,

1529
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,340
Phantom at will.

1530
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,340
Not great.

1531
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,340
There are circumstances

1532
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,340
which will make Phantom

1533
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,340
look different at the end.

1534
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,340
You can make him cry. You can make Phantom cry

1535
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,340
at the end if you are a bad person.

1536
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,340
I always wish that if I took like 50 hours

1537
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,340
to beat Metroid, that Samus

1538
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,340
would like cry at the end and be like, how could you?

1539
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,340
I was so bored running

1540
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,340
backwards and forwards

1541
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,340
between two places that I knew what to do

1542
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,340
but someone was controlling me

1543
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,340
making me do stupid shit.

1544
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,340
This was the big

1545
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,340
edition of version two. I'm not going to say

1546
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,340
what it was but I added something

1547
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,340
that would let you beat...

1548
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,340
If you're bad at the game, it would let you beat it anyway

1549
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,340
but if you beat it that way,

1550
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
Phantom cries at the end

1551
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,340
and you feel like a fucking monster

1552
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,340
and you better go back and do it right

1553
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,340
and do it right, you idiot.

1554
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,340
I'm going to speedrun for that ending.

1555
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,340
If it's faster, that's the only route people are going to speedrun, sorry.

1556
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,340
That's true.

1557
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,340
That's true. Kill the animals.

1558
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
Well, you know.

1559
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,340
Alright. It's actually not faster.

1560
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,340
It's actually not faster. It's just easier.

1561
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,340
Okay, that's fair.

1562
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,340
I think it would actually be...

1563
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,340
Interesting point.

1564
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,340
I'm thinking about it. Yeah, I think it would actually be

1565
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,340
faster to play it well

1566
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,340
and not do that.

1567
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,340
Well, you know, I thought of everything.

1568
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Don't worry.

1569
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,340
Game's a masterpiece.

1570
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,340
Yeah.

1571
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,340
And those jump arcs.

1572
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,340
Who, boy?

1573
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,340
Parabolic AF.

1574
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,340
I can't wait to see Jeff Keely on stage

1575
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,340
next year at the Game Awards and he goes,

1576
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,340
the best indie game goes to

1577
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
Phantom's Revenge.

1578
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,340
It is the best indie game.

1579
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,340
Phantom's Revenge.

1580
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,340
He sounds like that.

1581
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,340
He was just like that.

1582
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,340
He's the guy who hosted the Game Awards.

1583
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,340
He was the Dorito Pope.

1584
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,340
Okay, but there's got to be something

1585
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,340
else to him than that, right?

1586
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,340
Yeah, he was a...

1587
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,340
He was a... Fuck, I forgot

1588
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,340
what he did before. He was like a journalist.

1589
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,340
He worked for

1590
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,340
Game Trailer.

1591
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,340
I don't think so.

1592
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,340
He works for something. So one of those

1593
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
Gamescom, Games Far,

1594
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,340
Gamesweep, I don't know.

1595
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,340
Alright, okay.

1596
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,340
He's okay.

1597
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,340
I don't hate him as much as I thought I should hate him.

1598
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,340
He made Angry Joe look

1599
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,340
like an idiot once

1600
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,340
and that was pretty funny. So

1601
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,340
Jeff Keely gets the zero approval.

1602
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,340
That fucking face.

1603
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,340
Oh, I was right.

1604
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,340
There's this infamous interview with Angry Joe.

1605
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,340
He fucking blew Angry Joe the fuck

1606
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,340
out. He fucking...

1607
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,340
Oh, yeah.

1608
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,340
I think, wait.

1609
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,340
Was that entirely

1610
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:49,340
broadcast by Angry Joe to say

1611
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,340
Jeff Keely fucking sucks.

1612
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,340
Yeah, it was.

1613
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,340
And then he just shows them talking

1614
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:57,340
and Angry Joe was just being

1615
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,340
a complete spaz.

1616
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,340
I feel like I know what you're talking about,

1617
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,340
but can you fill me in on

1618
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,340
what that was?

1619
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,340
It was an interview that Angry Joe recorded

1620
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,340
with Jeff Keely at the Game Awards and he was

1621
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,340
complaining about Jeff's

1622
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,340
picks for each category and stuff.

1623
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,340
And he was saying like, oh, you haven't even nominated

1624
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,340
any MMOs for the RPG thing.

1625
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,340
And he was like, Jeff Keely just shuts him down at every

1626
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,340
single point and proves him wrong in every single one.

1627
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,340
And because it's a video made by

1628
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,340
Angry Joe, he like

1629
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,340
pauses the video and then he comes on screen green screen

1630
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,340
and he goes, see, he's fucking with me, even though

1631
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,340
Jeff Keely's just completely proved him wrong.

1632
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,340
It's one of the most hilarious videos.

1633
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,340
Angry Joe's just screaming like

1634
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,340
an idiot and he's completely wrong about

1635
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,340
everything.

1636
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,340
I mean, it sounds like

1637
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,340
Angry Joe owned himself.

1638
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,340
It was a legendary

1639
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,340
cellphone on his part.

1640
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,340
I just realized that

1641
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
cellphone actually sounds exactly the same

1642
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,340
as cellphone when you say it really fast.

1643
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,340
Cellphone. Wow.

1644
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,340
Men posting their L's.

1645
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,340
That's why we just say phone makes you think.

1646
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,340
We had to drop the cell.

1647
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:05,340
It says a lot.

1648
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,340
It says a lot about society. Perfect cellphone.

1649
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,340
You know, I want to go back to

1650
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,340
how

1651
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,340
David Lynch called them

1652
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
telephones, even though they were cellphones.

1653
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
They're still telephones.

1654
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
They are telephones.

1655
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,340
Yeah, we should just go back to calling them that.

1656
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,340
They're cello telephones.

1657
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,340
You know,

1658
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,340
as I was adding stock trading,

1659
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,340
I was a bit sad because

1660
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,340
I was adding stock trading and I was like,

1661
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,340
okay, you're going to do stock trading

1662
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,340
through your cell phone, right? Because that's how you do it

1663
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,340
in Endless War.

1664
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,340
You have a cell phone and you can do,

1665
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,340
you can call it the remote stock exchange.

1666
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,340
You call it your slime broker and you trade

1667
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,340
stocks on the slime stock exchange.

1668
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,340
So I wanted to make

1669
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,340
the like command subcategory

1670
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,340
exclamation point cell phone,

1671
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,340
but it was just a little bit too long

1672
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,340
and it was like, it like

1673
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:59,340
stuck out a little bit further than like the menu

1674
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,340
and I was like, if I change the menu,

1675
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,340
I would have to like change every other

1676
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,340
menu option. I would have to like,

1677
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,340
I would have to move everything,

1678
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,340
every subcategory option individually.

1679
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,340
I have to move them. I was like, no,

1680
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,340
no, it's boring.

1681
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,340
That's dumb. I'm just going to shorten it to phone.

1682
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,340
But I was like, but phone is lame.

1683
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,340
It's not just a phone. It's a gel phone.

1684
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,340
This is a piece of lore.

1685
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,340
I made an artistic compromise

1686
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,340
and I will never forgive myself.

1687
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,340
Can you just do like gel-ph?

1688
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,340
It's a cell phone.

1689
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,340
Or JJ phone.

1690
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,340
No, that's

1691
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,340
those ideas suck.

1692
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,340
This is why you guys are not

1693
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,340
game guys.

1694
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Well, actually, actually you could

1695
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,340
you could have made the font smaller.

1696
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,340
Shut the fuck up.

1697
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,340
You don't understand.

1698
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,340
You don't understand anything.

1699
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,340
Just change the text.

1700
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,340
That would be a nightmare.

1701
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,340
Imagine

1702
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,340
imagine if one text option

1703
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,340
is just a smaller font than all the other ones.

1704
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,340
You would be just close your eyes.

1705
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,340
Then I guarantee

1706
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,340
close your eyes

1707
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,340
does it almost

1708
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,340
feel like nothing

1709
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,340
changed at all.

1710
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,340
You got to change the text.

1711
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,340
Let me just say personally

1712
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,340
I'm looking forward to this game

1713
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,340
and almost as much as looking forward to just playing the game.

1714
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,340
I'm looking forward to watching Ben

1715
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
try to like have to

1716
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,340
explain this game to people who don't know anything about it

1717
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,340
and try to pitch them to play it when they're going to be

1718
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:31,340
beyond confused.

1719
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,340
There's a pony comic you got to read first

1720
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,340
and it's related to Sonichu

1721
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,340
but it's also like this and it's like that.

1722
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,340
My plan

1723
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,340
My plan is to

1724
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,340
make the game funny

1725
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,340
and approachable and cool so that people

1726
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,340
will play it on their own and I won't have to explain it

1727
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,340
and if they want to

1728
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:51,340
they can follow up and be like

1729
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
what's the comic this is linked to? Let me go check that out.

1730
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,340
The whole thing was just a trick

1731
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
to get people to read your old

1732
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,340
pony comic.

1733
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,340
I mean, sure.

1734
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,340
Why not?

1735
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,340
The whole thing was just a

1736
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,340
trick to get more views on T-Bap.

1737
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,340
T-Bap was struggling for years now

1738
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,340
it wasn't getting views so we had to

1739
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,340
put the word out there.

1740
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,340
The thing I'm excited to see is Ben's discord trying to convince him

1741
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:17,340
that the game is done while he's trying to add more shit.

1742
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,340
I can't wait for that.

1743
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,340
You were saying something last week about how

1744
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,340
you've basically done the main game and you're just adding

1745
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:25,340
this type of bullshit on top but I just want to go on

1746
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:27,340
the record and say that's the most important shit is

1747
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,340
the extraneous bullshit because

1748
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,340
that's what really gives the game a soul.

1749
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,340
You know what I mean?

1750
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,340
Genuinely, genuinely, version 1

1751
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,340
beta version 1 sucked

1752
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,340
I realized I thought it was good

1753
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,340
I thought it was great it was done

1754
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,340
but then I was like okay

1755
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,340
version 2 there's something I want to add

1756
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,340
I added it and now I realize version 1

1757
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,340
was garbage. Version 2 was the actual

1758
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,340
complete version of the game. The game was not

1759
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,340
complete.

1760
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,340
Version 3

1761
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,340
it didn't need weapon marriage

1762
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,340
it didn't need stock trading

1763
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,340
but I do think it is better for having them

1764
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,340
and I think version 3 is

1765
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,340
version 2 was essentially done.

1766
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,340
Version 3 is just an improvement but now I'm like

1767
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,340
okay it doesn't

1768
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,340
it would not be that much improved but anymore

1769
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,340
so I think I'm actually calling it

1770
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,340
I'm actually calling it.

1771
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,340
This is no more major addition

1772
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,340
You can only add shit after it comes out

1773
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,340
I really want to

1774
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,340
I have

1775
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,340
maybe you've heard me mention that maybe

1776
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,340
in the future it would be funny to go back

1777
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,340
and add in keg mode

1778
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,340
that would be very silly

1779
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,340
it would be funny

1780
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,340
it would be a lot of work and probably

1781
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,340
not worth it actually

1782
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,340
I said it would be easy but it wouldn't be bad

1783
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,340
you could make a bunch of sprites or shit

1784
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,340
I know you could make it model them

1785
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,340
or modify existing ones

1786
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,340
but it would still be a lot of work

1787
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,340
yeah, yeah

1788
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,340
honestly I was thinking

1789
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,340
I would want it to play differently

1790
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,340
because keg would have to function

1791
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,340
mechanically differently from phantom

1792
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,340
because phantom

1793
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,340
because phantom is a slime pony

1794
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,340
and is immune to the electric attacks

1795
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
of soniches

1796
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:07,340
and it can only be defeated through the use of

1797
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,340
bicarbonate soda water

1798
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,340
keg would be

1799
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,340
he would have no reaction

1800
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,340
he would have no response at all to

1801
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,340
water but he would be

1802
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,340
easily defeated by sonichu

1803
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,340
using some sort of move

1804
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,340
for example thunderbolt or thunder

1805
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,340
or voltackle or etc

1806
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:27,340
etc

1807
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,340
there would have to be something

1808
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,340
and I thought it would be really funny if

1809
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,340
what if keg has a gun

1810
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,340
he's just like hey good thing I found this gun

1811
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,340
outside and it goes in and

1812
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,340
I don't know maybe it's like a speed

1813
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,340
it's like

1814
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,340
here it is, keg mode is this

1815
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,340
instead of a

1816
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,340
turn based rpg

1817
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,340
with phantom

1818
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,340
keg mode is typing of the dead

1819
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,340
where he just gets to a new room

1820
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,340
and he just has to type a word fast enough

1821
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,340
so that he just shoots every sonichu

1822
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,340
before they can shoot him and he's like

1823
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,340
well okay next room

1824
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,340
I love it but I'm biased

1825
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,340
I love typing in the dead so I think that's hilarious

1826
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:07,340
so that would just be

1827
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,340
an entirely new game basically

1828
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,340
just make a new game on top of your old game

1829
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,340
just spend every year making a game

1830
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,340
that's what a sequel is basically

1831
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,340
that's what the virtual dlc is

1832
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,340
and all the dev micro games

1833
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,340
you'd be surprised how much a different playable character

1834
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,340
can have to a game

1835
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,340
I'm trying to think

1836
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,340
I feel like

1837
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,340
oh zero, zero for megaman x

1838
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,340
when you could summon zero

1839
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,340
in like megaman x3

1840
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,340
I think

1841
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,340
and you get a sword

1842
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,340
oh

1843
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,340
zero didn't even have a sword

1844
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,340
in the original megaman x

1845
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,340
like at no point in megaman x

1846
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:51,340
did zero have a sword

1847
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,340
but then like in every other game

1848
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,340
yeah all he does is he

1849
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,340
megafan I like the series but

1850
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,340
I wouldn't have been able to tell you that

1851
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,340
I'm a megafan

1852
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:03,340
I forgot when

1853
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,340
he got the sword was it in 2

1854
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,340
I think it's in

1855
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,340
in number 2

1856
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:11,340
or like

1857
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,340
I don't think you can play as him in 2

1858
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,340
but you can play as him in 3

1859
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,340
and he definitely has the sword in 3

1860
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,340
I don't know if he has the sword in 2

1861
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:21,340
but he definitely does not in 1

1862
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,340
but it's funny because

1863
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,340
him being the sword guy is sort of like

1864
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,340
kind of his whole thing

1865
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,340
that's the one thing people know about him

1866
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,340
that's how I know him

1867
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,340
he's a little cool he's a laser sword

1868
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,340
it's cool

1869
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,340
we'll talk about that later because it was cool

1870
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,340
they were like well there's a cool guy

1871
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,340
so we should give him something cool like a sword

1872
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,340
from what I remember

1873
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,340
the sword wasn't his main weapon until 4

1874
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,340
in 3 he could still use the arm cannon

1875
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,340
from what I remember

1876
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,340
but then in 4 he

1877
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,340
yeah

1878
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,340
yeah you're right

1879
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,340
in 3 he could charge

1880
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:59,340
he still uses the buster

1881
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,340
but like one of his charged moves

1882
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,340
is like a sword slash

1883
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,340
before he just stopped using the buster

1884
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,340
that was after the

1885
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,340
yeah

1886
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,340
after the graphics change

1887
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,340
yeah it went from

1888
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,340
yeah it went from SNES to PS1

1889
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,340
I hate the way that it looks

1890
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,340
I hate the way that

1891
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,340
those games look after the graphical

1892
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,340
change after x3

1893
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,340
I just think it's so much worse

1894
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,340
why?

1895
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,340
it's like 2

1896
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,340
rights are like too

1897
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:35,340
big

1898
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,340
well they're not bigger but like

1899
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,340
they're more detailed and like

1900
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,340
I don't know they're too detailed

1901
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,340
I hate it

1902
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,340
I really really hate

1903
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,340
the way that x4 and on look

1904
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,340
I think that the game looks perfect in the x style

1905
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:51,340
and it

1906
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,340
it was made worse

1907
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,340
by being made better

1908
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:57,340
by the enhanced fidelity

1909
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,340
this is another one of those pokemon moving situations

1910
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:01,340
you don't really articulate what you don't like about it

1911
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,340
kinda

1912
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,340
kinda only mega man was great

1913
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,340
when it made it look 3d

1914
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,340
because everybody likes mega man legends

1915
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,340
like I just said I'm not a huge mega man

1916
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,340
lore expert but I sort of know what you mean

1917
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,340
I actually have not played

1918
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,340
that much legends

1919
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,340
but it looks awesome

1920
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,340
everybody likes how it looks including me

1921
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,340
I love low poly 3d mega man

1922
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,340
yeah those games look dope as fuck

1923
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,340
what about the 3dx games

1924
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,340
it's aced really well

1925
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,340
there's one of the x games

1926
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,340
I think it's like x6 or 7

1927
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,340
you actually have like playable 3d sections

1928
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,340
it's like a hallway

1929
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,340
it's really bad

1930
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,340
I don't know I never played it

1931
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,340
I remember hearing people bitch about like x6

1932
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:45,340
those games apparently get kinda bad

1933
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,340
but again I'm not speaking from first hand experience

1934
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,340
just from watching youtube videos essays about

1935
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,340
this is why mega man games get bad at the end

1936
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,340
I mean in the mega man

1937
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,340
in the mega man zero games

1938
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,340
I guess he's still

1939
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,340
I mean his sword is his most

1940
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,340
iconic weapon but it's not

1941
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,340
he is equally able

1942
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:05,340
I mean he has all kinds of

1943
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,340
he has a whole arsenal he has a gun

1944
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,340
he has a sword he has this boomerang shield

1945
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,340
he's got the like arm jabby things

1946
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,340
he's got the like extendos spear

1947
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,340
I fucking

1948
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,340
zero

1949
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,340
mega man zero

1950
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,340
okay he's got all

1951
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,340
kind of like the whole oh man and then

1952
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,340
I think it's is it in Z4

1953
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,340
is it in 04 that he has the glove

1954
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,340
that he can like rip

1955
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,340
like weapons out of other enemies

1956
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,340
hands and like use them

1957
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,340
we're fucking amazing

1958
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,340
genius the greatest game ever made

1959
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,340
yeah but he doesn't have

1960
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,340
a stock market simulation so I mean

1961
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,340
how good is it really

1962
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,340
no he can't trade stocks on his gel phone

1963
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,340
sure he's got all these weapons

1964
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:49,340
he can't marry a single one of them

1965
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,340
so what's even the point

1966
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,340
I just want to give a shout out to Cruelty Squad

1967
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,340
for being another game with an in-game stock

1968
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,340
market where you can just like buy stocks

1969
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,340
in the middle of a mission

1970
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,340
but you know you really need to add to your game

1971
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,340
to make it stand head and shoulders above

1972
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,340
you need to add like a credit card churning system

1973
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,340
you know

1974
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,340
you already gamified it

1975
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,340
you know how it's fun you know how to do it

1976
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,340
I have not

1977
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,340
I have not gotten around to playing Cruelty Squad

1978
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,340
a lot of people have mentioned like

1979
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,340
Cruelty Squad is very endless war

1980
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:21,340
and it's it is in so many levels because

1981
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,340
like one it's got like it's like slime aesthetic

1982
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,340
and two it's like all about

1983
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,340
like a hyper capitalist like corporate

1984
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,340
nightmare world which is thematically

1985
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,340
like so endless war is also

1986
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,340
it's just like it's a little

1987
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,340
it's a little less in your face about it

1988
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,340
and it's like it really

1989
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,340
it really is I could see people

1990
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,340
I could see someone maybe they find

1991
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,340
they stumble upon Phantom's revenge they play it

1992
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:45,340
they realize like there's stocks in it and like they think like

1993
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,340
is this like

1994
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,340
is this like a Cruelty Squad spinoff

1995
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,340
it's talking about slime and you can trade stocks

1996
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,340
don't worry I could genuinely see someone

1997
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,340
there's no ponies in Cruelty Squad

1998
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,340
people won't get confused

1999
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,340
guess what

2000
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,340
I just found out Attack on Titan season 4

2001
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,340
part 2 is airing today

2002
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,340
the first episode

2003
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,340
timing though

2004
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,340
if only this went up today so the people

2005
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,340
if you're listening to this now you missed it

2006
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,340
if you didn't watch it I mean go watch the first episode

2007
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,340
it's too late

2008
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,340
you can't watch it live you can't watch it the day it came out

2009
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,340
unless you already did

2010
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,340
go watch episode 2 in a few days

2011
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
yeah exactly

2012
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,340
Simsie's lying to me

2013
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,340
set yourself up for disappointment anyway moving on

2014
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,340
it's fine there's

2015
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,340
wait I'm gonna grab a drink

2016
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,340
I'm gonna grab a sparkling water I'll be back in one

2017
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,340
second

2018
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,340
finally now we can talk shit about Ben all we want

2019
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,340
and he will never know

2020
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,340
we can listen to the episode back and be like

2021
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,340
better listen to that part I wasn't there for

2022
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,340
you think he's gonna do that 0% chance

2023
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,340
I mean we can talk shit about Ben to his face

2024
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,340
yeah but

2025
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,340
actually right it is funnier to do it that way

2026
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,340
let's just okay everyone hold your Ben shit on

2027
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,340
until he gets back

2028
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,340
I know it's hard to resist

2029
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,340
he's really smelly he's just generally quite a smelly

2030
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,340
person don't like him

2031
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,340
you never sniffed him

2032
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,340
that's what you think

2033
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,340
you gotta have receipts if you want to destroy Ben's

2034
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,340
I can tell he's smelly because I opened up my package

2035
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,340
of the vapour

2036
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,340
it just reeks

2037
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,340
there's vapour in there

2038
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,340
it's a bunch of vapour I open the box it's like a big cloud

2039
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,340
comes out

2040
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,340
a big vape cloud

2041
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,340
and it says ha ha fuck you

2042
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,340
and it dissipates

2043
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,340
my copy of fucking

2044
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,340
Road to Radcon

2045
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,340
fucking reek I know he pissed on it

2046
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,340
I know he did I know he doesn't like me I know he pissed on

2047
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,340
my copy of Road to Radcon just to piss me off

2048
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,340
he would never piss you off

2049
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,340
let it dry out

2050
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,340
it's all yellow

2051
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,340
oh yeah I was gonna ask him about the

2052
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:47,340
cleave and the weeb stuff

2053
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,340
but I guess I will when he gets back

2054
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:51,340
overall

2055
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,340
I gotta say I'm glad I never bothered

2056
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,340
being like Ben

2057
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,340
you gotta chill out with your like tricksy hate

2058
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,340
because it led us here it led us to this moment

2059
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,340
it all worked out in the end

2060
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:03,340
all the people are like trying to get him to calm down

2061
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,340
calm down

2062
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,340
you were anti-progress

2063
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:09,340
you were gonna stand in the way of this

2064
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,340
it's like an objective fact

2065
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,340
that his hatred of tricksy has caused more

2066
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,340
good in the world than bad

2067
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,340
it is like some weird Dark Souls thing

2068
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,340
where it's like fueling him

2069
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,340
to keep going even though he's definitely

2070
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,340
hollow at this point

2071
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:25,340
I'm gonna buy a cleave and the weeb blu-ray

2072
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,340
and I'm gonna

2073
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,340
pledge an equal amount to Jesse's

2074
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,340
Patreon that month

2075
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,340
but not to tricksy

2076
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,340
tricksy gets nothing

2077
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,340
who's gonna be the first viewer

2078
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,340
to buy the cleave and the weeb and then like

2079
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,340
take it to a live yig show

2080
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,340
and get it signed

2081
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,340
oh god

2082
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,340
he's gonna be the first viewer to

2083
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,340
sign the

2084
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,340
back of the box

2085
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:53,340
it's a fat shit on tricksy

2086
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,340
on the back of the box

2087
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,340
there are live yig shows

2088
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,340
I don't even think that's a thing anymore

2089
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:01,340
it wasn't like it was a thing

2090
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,340
there were

2091
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,340
there was a techie

2092
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,340
there was like one or two

2093
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,340
one that was run by Wiley

2094
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,340
one that they just like came into

2095
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,340
at the end and then like another one

2096
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,340
that's exactly what I was thinking

2097
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,340
Riley Coyote

2098
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,340
I can just imagine those

2099
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,340
going like a

2100
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,340
low taxes party

2101
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,340
at his office

2102
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,340
where only one person showed up and he was on the couch

2103
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,340
passed out

2104
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,340
oh yeah I should probably

2105
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,340
I was gonna at some point take a moment to shill

2106
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:35,340
my new video that I did

2107
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,340
with my pal Bedhead Bernie

2108
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:39,340
yeah I wanted to talk about that too

2109
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,340
that was my favorite part

2110
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,340
it's a funny moment

2111
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,340
I knew a lot about

2112
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,340
the history of SA

2113
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,340
but that was one thing I didn't know about

2114
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,340
it's real

2115
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,340
internet boomer hours over here

2116
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,340
trying to educate people about internet history

2117
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,340
which is one of those things where it's like intellectually

2118
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,340
like is internet history like important

2119
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,340
no not really

2120
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,340
but like at the same time

2121
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,340
like I kind of think it is I don't really know how to explain it

2122
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,340
and like it's

2123
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,340
and it's

2124
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,340
it's um

2125
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,340
it's nice

2126
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,340
I wouldn't say it's important but like so much of what we enjoy

2127
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,340
it's easy for that stuff to get lost at time

2128
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,340
you know like a lot of contemporary

2129
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,340
like tweets just tweets just like things

2130
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,340
like news articles with sight from around

2131
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,340
you know

2132
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,340
low taxes death and stuff like

2133
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,340
those tweets are just deleted and like those news articles have like broken links

2134
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:31,340
like internet history is just very

2135
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,340
easy people just assume someone else

2136
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,340
to like document it and archive it but

2137
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,340
you know it doesn't really happen

2138
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,340
are we talking about um

2139
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,340
the Bernie vids low tax

2140
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:43,340
I mentioned I was shilling my

2141
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,340
low tax video that I had

2142
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,340
worked on with my pal Bernie

2143
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,340
yeah I saw that

2144
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,340
I started I saw Bernie

2145
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,340
tweet it and I started it and then I was like

2146
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,340
oh hey it's cyber shell is in this

2147
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,340
neat indeed indeed

2148
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,340
um yeah we wrote it and researched

2149
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,340
it together but uh he did

2150
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,340
oh did you yeah yeah we basically made it

2151
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,340
together but he edited and

2152
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,340
voiced it because he just better edit

2153
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,340
anything and I also didn't want to do it

2154
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,340
it's amazing but uh yeah we basically

2155
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,340
made it together there is a lot of people like

2156
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,340
if you let's you watch to the end and also don't

2157
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,340
or read the description then you probably

2158
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:19,340
like a lot of people like oh I'm glad he got cyber shell for

2159
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,340
a voice cameo and I'm like I do I did a lot

2160
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:23,340
more than a voice cameo it's okay

2161
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,340
that's what I thought yeah I thought you were just

2162
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,340
a voice cameo no there's a lot of there are a lot of just

2163
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,340
voice cameos so it's a little like I get why

2164
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,340
people are like that like I really don't care

2165
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,340
it's just one of those situations where I just wanted to make a good video

2166
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,340
I didn't like I didn't care so much about

2167
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,340
I hope it gets x amount of like views like I

2168
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:39,340
want people to see it but like it's just like

2169
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,340
I'm just happy that it's done

2170
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,340
the video for us do people

2171
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,340
even read the video descriptions anymore

2172
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,340
because it didn't say that like you wrote it

2173
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,340
nobody nobody read the video description

2174
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,340
no answer no nobody

2175
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,340
read the video of course not damn

2176
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,340
I guess I'm the only one you're right

2177
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,340
you're the last remaining video description

2178
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,340
reader out there

2179
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,340
yeah you're right

2180
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,340
I'm the last person who exists to read some

2181
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:05,340
about like internet

2182
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,340
archiving where you were

2183
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,340
saying somebody

2184
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,340
asked in a voicemail like I think

2185
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,340
a week or two ago

2186
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:15,340
about

2187
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,340
the digi clips

2188
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,340
the digi clip stuff it was

2189
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,340
the archives are just gone

2190
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,340
like those forums have been deleted

2191
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,340
and like all the fallout

2192
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,340
of the whole something awful raid

2193
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,340
on the real digimon believers forums

2194
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,340
a lot of it just doesn't exist anymore

2195
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,340
and it's sad because

2196
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,340
a lot of funny a lot of funny shit went down there

2197
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:39,340
and yeah a lot of

2198
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,340
it is just gone

2199
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,340
there's a lot of funny shit from like 2015

2200
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,340
that's like gone forever let alone

2201
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:47,340
trying to do research on like websites

2202
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,340
from like 2003 thank god

2203
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,340
for like archive.org and the way back machine

2204
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,340
you can't even imagine how barren

2205
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,340
and empty the internet would seem if just like it was

2206
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,340
constantly like all these major sites

2207
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,340
just gone forever you know what I mean

2208
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,340
I mean I like lost media as much as the next guy

2209
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,340
because I just like think it's interesting

2210
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,340
like a million people could have seen this

2211
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,340
but like zero remaining copies exist

2212
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:09,340
you know what I mean it's just something weird about that

2213
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,340
right but if it's truly

2214
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,340
lost like gone forever then there's

2215
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,340
nothing interesting about that because

2216
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,340
like well what do we there's nothing

2217
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,340
even frustrating

2218
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,340
yeah I was

2219
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,340
going to say if I could go back in time

2220
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,340
I would have invested like millions of more

2221
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,340
dollars in the internet archive because

2222
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:29,340
like they were really ahead of their time that

2223
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,340
shit started like in the late 90s like

2224
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,340
he like knew how

2225
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,340
important the internet was going to be become

2226
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,340
the guy who started it

2227
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,340
just like Hideo Kojima

2228
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,340
that's what Metal Gear Solid 2 is

2229
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,340
I love the part of Metal Gear Solid 2

2230
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,340
where Raiden turns the camera and he goes

2231
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,340
please just archive the things on the internet

2232
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,340
and don't believe everything you read

2233
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,340
I need my reuploads

2234
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,340
of Digi Bros videos

2235
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,340
don't delete your save files

2236
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,340
I like the part where Raiden is like

2237
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,340
chief

2238
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,340
I need

2239
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,340
I need a download and chief

2240
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,340
is like no you can't have it

2241
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,340
because I've put it on the blockchain

2242
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,340
and it's the web 3.0

2243
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,340
is the future

2244
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,340
this internet shit these memes of today

2245
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:15,340
are stupid

2246
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,340
bitcoin

2247
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,340
Raiden you didn't invest in bitcoin

2248
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:21,340
I can't verify your hash I'm going to have to sell

2249
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:23,340
your NFT

2250
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,340
your NFTs end here Colonel

2251
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,340
what's really interesting is that Metal Gear

2252
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,340
was like one of the first places to use

2253
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,340
the actual definition of the word meme

2254
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,340
I am aware

2255
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,340
before memes actually became

2256
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,340
it is funny that meme

2257
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,340
is just like a Richard

2258
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,340
first of all it's weird that Richard Dawkins

2259
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,340
of all people is the guy that

2260
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,340
I think he coined it and it's just a gene

2261
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,340
but with information

2262
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,340
it's just a medic transfer of information

2263
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,340
that's all it means

2264
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,340
he invented the word

2265
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,340
just like Shakespeare he just made up a word

2266
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,340
and everyone was like okay

2267
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,340
it's like I don't know

2268
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:03,340
I understand English is an evolving language

2269
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,340
and people make up words all the time

2270
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,340
but in more of a slang way

2271
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,340
and that sort of just becomes normalized

2272
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,340
where it feels weird to be like this is going to be a real word I'm making right now

2273
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:13,340
and it's going to go in dictionaries and stuff

2274
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,340
I don't think he realized people were going to use it

2275
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:17,340
I just quiz it

2276
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:19,340
that way

2277
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,340
yeah he probably didn't

2278
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,340
he probably didn't expect it

2279
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,340
to enter the lexicon

2280
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:27,340
right

2281
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,340
how could he have

2282
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:31,340
he was describing what I'm sure he considered

2283
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,340
a very hyper

2284
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,340
a very specific type of information transfer

2285
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:37,340
whereas the average person you say meme

2286
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,340
and they're like oh you mean an image macro

2287
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,340
it's like yeah that's what I meant

2288
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:43,340
do you mean a trick tool

2289
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:45,340
come to mean something else

2290
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,340
you know I don't know

2291
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,340
if any of you other guys were on my team

2292
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,340
but they used to call them fads on there

2293
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,340
yes I remember before a meme was widespread

2294
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,340
people calling internet memes fads

2295
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,340
that's a factoid

2296
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,340
I don't even remember that

2297
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,340
I remember that from Game Facts

2298
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,340
more than YTMND

2299
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,340
yeah

2300
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:07,340
hmm

2301
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,340
I knew what the word fad meant

2302
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,340
but I never heard anyone use it

2303
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,340
about like a specific image

2304
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,340
or a phrase or anything

2305
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,340
hmm maybe

2306
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,340
I mean

2307
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,340
I wasn't on YTMND

2308
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,340
and I wasn't even really on Game Facts that much

2309
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:25,340
I was on 4chan

2310
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,340
I wasn't really on 4chan

2311
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,340
really on 4chan until college

2312
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,340
I was on Game Facts but I got

2313
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:35,340
banned based

2314
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,340
did I tell it

2315
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,340
have I mentioned that a lot of my old roommates

2316
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,340
that I was living with until recently

2317
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,340
were people from a

2318
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:45,340
forum called

2319
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,340
oh fuck it was called

2320
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,340
the TLDR

2321
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,340
the forum was called the TLDR and it was where

2322
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,340
people that were banned from the world of warcraft

2323
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,340
the forum

2324
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,340
would congregate

2325
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,340
and they had lore

2326
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:03,340
they had lore like Gabe Newell

2327
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:05,340
posted one time on their forum

2328
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,340
one time and that was like a big

2329
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,340
and then one of the mods banned him

2330
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,340
was Gabe Newell banned from World of Warcraft

2331
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,340
no

2332
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,340
I don't think so

2333
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:17,340
but he was banned from the TLDR

2334
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,340
which was

2335
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,340
that was like a cataclysmic event

2336
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,340
I think in their history

2337
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,340
does it still exist

2338
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:27,340
is what you mean like they're still

2339
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:29,340
actively posting on there

2340
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:31,340
I believe the forum does

2341
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:33,340
still exist but I think it has mostly

2342
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,340
become like a discord

2343
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,340
I was gonna say almost every fucking forum

2344
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,340
has just gotten evaporated

2345
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:41,340
into discords and stuff

2346
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:43,340
and social media in general

2347
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,340
when I went back to look at

2348
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:47,340
when I went back to look at

2349
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:49,340
the Gaming Steve forums

2350
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,340
I think I mentioned this a few months ago

2351
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,340
I just went back to look at Gaming Steve

2352
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,340
because I used to go there

2353
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,340
when I was waiting for Will Wright's spore to come out

2354
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,340
I would go there to check up on the latest

2355
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,340
spore, yeah, to check up on the latest spore news

2356
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,340
I remember the spore hype

2357
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,340
dudes

2358
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,340
that was like your first

2359
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:09,340
your first youtube videos that are still up

2360
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:11,340
yeah I have some spore creature creator videos

2361
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,340
I remember the creature creator came out

2362
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,340
and everyone was like oh this is so pog

2363
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:17,340
the game's gonna be even better

2364
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,340
I talked about that shit for years

2365
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:21,340
I annoyed my girlfriend

2366
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,340
in college by talking too much

2367
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,340
about it

2368
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:27,340
and then it came out

2369
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,340
and uh

2370
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,340
oops

2371
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,340
but um

2372
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,340
I went back to check those forums

2373
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,340
and there was like one guy

2374
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,340
there was like one guy

2375
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,340
still posting threads

2376
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,340
like fairly often

2377
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,340
just being like hey guys I played this new game

2378
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:47,340
I thought it was pretty good

2379
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,340
this part annoyed me

2380
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,340
which is can't let it go

2381
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,340
he can't move on to the afterlife

2382
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,340
yeah and he

2383
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:57,340
he would just make some threads

2384
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:59,340
every now and then and then like

2385
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,340
I was just looking at all these threads he was making

2386
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:03,340
and one guy was like hey man

2387
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,340
we're all on discord now

2388
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,340
you should join the discord and he's like

2389
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,340
no fucking discord

2390
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,340
discord's for groomers

2391
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,340
fuck that shit

2392
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,340
based one forum poster guy

2393
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,340
he's literally like the guys in World War 2

2394
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,340
who didn't realize the war was over and kept fighting

2395
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,340
for like years after

2396
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,340
the guy's trying to populate forums

2397
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,340
still after the war has been lost

2398
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,340
to discord

2399
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,340
what video did I see about that one

2400
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,340
about that one guy

2401
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,340
that one like Vietnam

2402
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,340
they think Japanese guy was like living on like

2403
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,340
a jungle or something and

2404
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,340
that's such a weird story but like yeah it's crazy

2405
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,340
weren't there like multiple guys

2406
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,340
surprised that there were at least a couple

2407
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,340
I saw a video about one specific guy

2408
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,340
it might have been an atrocity guy

2409
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,340
video or uh

2410
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,340
I don't remember what channel it was on

2411
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,340
I don't know but yeah there's at least one

2412
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,340
sounds like the kind of thing they'd cover on that channel

2413
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:59,340
yeah

2414
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:03,340
it sucks you should be able to have a question

2415
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:05,340
and you could google it

2416
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,340
but now it's like oh you want to know the answer to the

2417
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,340
subscure game thing you have to join our discord

2418
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:11,340
yeah exactly

2419
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,340
oh

2420
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,340
it's you got to join our discord

2421
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,340
it's just it's just the

2422
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,340
the

2423
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,340
large discords feel like

2424
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,340
you're walking around in a city

2425
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,340
and everybody's walking past you

2426
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,340
and it's like impossible to start a conversation

2427
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,340
and it just doesn't

2428
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:31,340
yeah it's too

2429
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,340
it's also like really

2430
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,340
it's really inconvenient to find information

2431
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,340
how I feel about like a twitch chat once it gets too big

2432
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:39,340
it's just it's it's unusable

2433
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,340
I

2434
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,340
like

2435
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:45,340
like the the thread thing

2436
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:47,340
is like a conversation about a specific

2437
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,340
theory

2438
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,340
you click on the topic you click on the thread and you read about

2439
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,340
but like in a discord

2440
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:55,340
chat

2441
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,340
nobody is like

2442
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:59,340
there's there's a lot less

2443
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,340
um I guess strict

2444
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,340
rules implored

2445
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,340
in in in discords to keep things

2446
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,340
on topic

2447
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,340
but it just

2448
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,340
I don't know it's just a completely

2449
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:13,340
different feeling and it's sort of

2450
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:15,340
to if it gets

2451
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,340
to a certain size that discord is completely

2452
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,340
unusable for me I have to just

2453
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,340
mute it completely

2454
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,340
I like lots of individual threads lots of

2455
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,340
smaller conversations you can just go pick

2456
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:27,340
and choose and participate in versus one like

2457
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:29,340
giant uninterrupted

2458
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,340
stream like I don't know it's it's you

2459
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:33,340
got to find a discord like that's the right size

2460
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,340
but then it's like yeah it's like some goldilocks

2461
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,340
share it's either way too big way too fast

2462
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,340
or you join discord and it's like

2463
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:41,340
three messages a day type situation

2464
01:32:43,340 --> 01:32:45,340
I like I like discord

2465
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:47,340
but yeah I do I do think it is a bit

2466
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,340
sad that yeah it has

2467
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,340
largely displaced forums

2468
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:53,340
I did used to like

2469
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,340
forums sometimes

2470
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:57,340
and my experience

2471
01:32:57,340 --> 01:32:59,340
most of the forums I was on were kind of like

2472
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,340
dead for like a couple years

2473
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:03,340
and then discord sort of revived the community

2474
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,340
that was more the experience I had

2475
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:07,340
I don't want to be fully anti discord

2476
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:09,340
I'm sure it has plenty of good things like just

2477
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,340
intellectually like they do have a chat program

2478
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,340
like there's nothing wrong with that you know

2479
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:15,340
but I don't know

2480
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:17,340
the pivot animation community was pretty

2481
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,340
dead before discord revived it

2482
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:21,340
it's it's just it's just

2483
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,340
on on many that's actually

2484
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,340
a good point there's probably a lot of communities that

2485
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,340
can't maybe we're blaming

2486
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,340
the wrong maybe we're blaming the wrong thing

2487
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,340
maybe it's not yeah this discord

2488
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,340
the move to discord might be like a symptom

2489
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,340
more than like a you know

2490
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,340
a root cause it is um

2491
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,340
it is

2492
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:41,340
it's not that I care about

2493
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,340
forums more it's just that discord

2494
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:45,340
sucks and I don't like it

2495
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,340
it doesn't it doesn't like

2496
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,340
it's just unwieldy I can't

2497
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:51,340
get into anything

2498
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,340
I can't make new friends on discord so it just

2499
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,340
doesn't feel like I can't make new friends period but uh

2500
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:57,340
that's

2501
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,340
that's um another another topic

2502
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,340
uh

2503
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,340
I didn't care that much about forums either but the

2504
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:05,340
the

2505
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:07,340
problem is that everything online is like owned by

2506
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:09,340
the same three corporations

2507
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:11,340
yeah that's kind of what I was about

2508
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,340
to say it sort of feels like another

2509
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,340
step god

2510
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,340
I mean I I guess we're I guess we're going

2511
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,340
to the web 3.0 now which is even worse

2512
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,340
somehow it works the web 2.0

2513
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:23,340
well yeah it feels like another step

2514
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,340
in the web 2.0

2515
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,340
of like no no one

2516
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,340
no like individual websites like

2517
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,340
every what everything is on like a few big

2518
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,340
platforms everything is on youtube or on

2519
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:35,340
facebook or on discord or

2520
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:37,340
yeah everything is agglomerated right

2521
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:39,340
one yeah that's exactly

2522
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,340
it's not that I specifically miss forums

2523
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:43,340
and like if we all just went back to forums

2524
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:45,340
the internet would be fixed it's just like

2525
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,340
forums are emblematic of the old internet

2526
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:49,340
which I miss as a whole

2527
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:51,340
a lot more than I miss specifically for forums

2528
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,340
in general we're just a den of like

2529
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,340
the leadest pricks and you know a bunch of assholes

2530
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:57,340
circle jerking over power

2531
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:59,340
I mean I guess there's plenty of that on discord too

2532
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,340
but it's not the forums for this

2533
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,340
holy magical place trust me

2534
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,340
yeah yeah

2535
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,340
a lot of discords

2536
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,340
I feel

2537
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,340
totally invisible and a

2538
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,340
giant discord but on a forum

2539
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,340
I feel like you can start something

2540
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,340
and then somebody can call you an idiot

2541
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,340
a lot of discords are dominated by regulars

2542
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,340
trying to break into a new group of people

2543
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:23,340
like as a new member is very

2544
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,340
hard because it's just the two

2545
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:27,340
same group of people talking to each other

2546
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:29,340
and just ignoring all the new people that join

2547
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,340
which is a big issue I think

2548
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,340
that's just a trend that I've noticed that is strange

2549
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:35,340
yeah

2550
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:37,340
I mean forums are like that too though

2551
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:39,340
you would have your big posters

2552
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:41,340
there were some

2553
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,340
yeah for sure that could have been hard to like

2554
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,340
you know

2555
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:47,340
dude post count clout was like a big thing

2556
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,340
I think

2557
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,340
that was just as much of a problem

2558
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:53,340
on forums

2559
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:55,340
if you're a newbie

2560
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:57,340
nobody wants to talk to you

2561
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,340
and the threads are

2562
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,340
dominated by the

2563
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,340
people with lots of posts

2564
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,340
on something awful in particular

2565
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,340
there was a very big emphasis on forum etiquette

2566
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,340
and lurking before posting

2567
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:11,340
if you pay $10 for an account

2568
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,340
and you make some posts

2569
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:15,340
it's a lower case and you use

2570
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,340
you instead of typing out the full word you

2571
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,340
instantly you band off the forum

2572
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,340
jeez

2573
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:23,340
see I'm genuinely too young

2574
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,340
and too normy to have ever used forums

2575
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,340
in like any extent the only times I've looked

2576
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,340
at forums is just like looking up

2577
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,340
how to fix my computer and stuff and seeing posts from like

2578
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,340
2002

2579
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:35,340
well before discord existed

2580
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,340
that's where everyone was hanging out

2581
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,340
I was on the dark team

2582
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,340
in forums for a pivot animation

2583
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,340
like all the fucking time

2584
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,340
in like 2009 to 2011

2585
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,340
that community was pretty great

2586
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,340
it was all for animators

2587
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:51,340
and if you were a good animator

2588
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:53,340
like you would get noticed like instantly

2589
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,340
and you'd get your

2590
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:57,340
animations posted into like the high quality

2591
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:59,340
sections of the website

2592
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,340
which was pretty cool

2593
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:03,340
they had a ranking system

2594
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:05,340
there's beginners, intermediates, veterans

2595
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,340
and elites and I moved all the way up

2596
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:09,340
to like the 10 people

2597
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:11,340
who are in the elite zone

2598
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,340
doing that shit

2599
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,340
the ranking system

2600
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:17,340
was very

2601
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,340
controversial later on

2602
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:21,340
because how dare you

2603
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,340
rank people's artistic ability

2604
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,340
or something

2605
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,340
I hope you put that on your resume

2606
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,340
I was elite on this forum

2607
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:31,340
on the dark demon forum

2608
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,340
on the fucking dark demon

2609
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:35,340
there was one guy

2610
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:37,340
who had like 30,000 posts

2611
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,340
his name was Skype and I don't know how the fuck

2612
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:41,340
he managed that

2613
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,340
that was a post count of everyone else

2614
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,340
some people were just forums

2615
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:47,340
they just spend all their time on forums

2616
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:49,340
and I feel like those people in particular

2617
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,340
had a hard transition to discourse

2618
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:53,340
well I mean

2619
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,340
how many fucking tweets have I made

2620
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,340
since starting my account

2621
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,340
too many

2622
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,340
is there a counter?

2623
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:03,340
there used to be

2624
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,340
I don't think it's public anymore

2625
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:07,340
but there's probably still a way to check

2626
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,340
it might be

2627
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,340
you've made 17.3k tweets

2628
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,340
Ben

2629
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,340
I have?

2630
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:17,340
wow, every single one a gem

2631
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,340
worth the

2632
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,340
17k

2633
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:23,340
wow

2634
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:25,340
I mean my account is pretty old

2635
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,340
my account is like 7 or 8 or 9 years old

2636
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,340
oh yeah

2637
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:33,340
I'm liking that pinned tweet

2638
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:35,340
while you were in the bathroom we had a brief discussion

2639
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:37,340
about the plebe and the weeb

2640
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:39,340
I'm sad I missed the announcement

2641
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,340
it was very funny

2642
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,340
all the people

2643
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,340
trying to talk you down

2644
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:47,340
you got to stop being so deranged

2645
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:49,340
with your Trixie hate

2646
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,340
it all led to this, it was all worth it

2647
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,340
yeah

2648
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,340
I kind of thought

2649
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,340
this is building

2650
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,340
it's going to be hard to top this

2651
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,340
just going back to shitting on Trixie

2652
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:03,340
in a few snipes tweets

2653
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:05,340
I'm not saying you're not allowed to do it

2654
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,340
it's going to be hard to top this

2655
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,340
I've been

2656
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:11,340
I've been gloating a little bit

2657
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,340
I've been trying to gloat a little bit on Twitter

2658
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,340
and they just are

2659
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:17,340
the cowards are simply pretending

2660
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,340
they don't notice

2661
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:21,340
they pretend they do not see

2662
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:23,340
I know that they know

2663
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,340
I know they're seeing the ads

2664
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,340
you made a tweet to this effect

2665
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:29,340
you got Trixie in a bind

2666
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,340
she just can't acknowledge it

2667
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,340
there's no win scenario for her

2668
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,340
she looks so bad

2669
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,340
she looks so stupid

2670
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:39,340
there's nothing she can say

2671
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,340
to be like

2672
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,340
Ben's bullying me about this

2673
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,340
there's no angle

2674
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:47,340
that she can take

2675
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,340
I'm sure she's told Riley

2676
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:51,340
Riley don't answer

2677
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:53,340
just ignore it

2678
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,340
don't acknowledge it

2679
01:39:55,340 --> 01:39:57,340
they at least want the complimentary free one

2680
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,340
they want

2681
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,340
I'm trying to extend the olive branch

2682
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,340
I'll give Riley one too

2683
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:05,340
he can have one

2684
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:07,340
I'll give one for Bird

2685
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:09,340
not only is the Radcon

2686
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:11,340
for Kickstarter finally almost

2687
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,340
having all his shit fulfilled

2688
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,340
but even Kickstarter you weren't personally a part of

2689
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:17,340
you're fulfilling now

2690
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,340
Radcon

2691
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,340
it's actually

2692
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:23,340
I didn't really mention it

2693
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,340
but Radcon 2

2694
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:27,340
the documentary is in there

2695
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:29,340
it's one of the bonus features

2696
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:31,340
people might actually

2697
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:33,340
the watch alongs

2698
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,340
are not quality content

2699
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:37,340
they're long

2700
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,340
some of them might be funny

2701
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:41,340
but they're pretty low quality

2702
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:43,340
it's content that exists

2703
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,340
they might as well go on there

2704
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:47,340
yeah

2705
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:49,340
it was bonus content for backers

2706
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:51,340
so I put it on the disc

2707
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:53,340
but the Radcon 2

2708
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,340
that was never uploaded anywhere

2709
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,340
and it's edited

2710
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,340
it's got interviews

2711
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,340
in it and stuff

2712
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:03,340
Victor filmed a bunch of us behind the scenes

2713
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,340
at Radcon 2

2714
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,340
that's a good little piece

2715
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:09,340
I think it's like 40 minutes

2716
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,340
it's an actual little documentary

2717
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,340
of what we were all doing behind the scenes at Radcon 2

2718
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:15,340
and I think it's the only place you can see it

2719
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:17,340
that's a quality little bit

2720
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:19,340
of exclusive content

2721
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,340
that I think is pretty neat

2722
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,340
a tectonic improv provided me

2723
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,340
with the links to that

2724
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:27,340
wait

2725
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,340
what's up

2726
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,340
wait how did tectonic improv

2727
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,340
because he was a backer

2728
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:35,340
yeah it was like

2729
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,340
backers got a link to like a

2730
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,340
what do you call it

2731
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,340
a

2732
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,340
google drive

2733
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,340
that had bonus content in it

2734
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,340
including all the watch alongs and stuff

2735
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,340
and then of course there's the exclusive

2736
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:51,340
message from Ben Sain

2737
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:53,340
as the first bonus feature

2738
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,340
in which I give my thoughts on the situation

2739
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:57,340
it's got to see the message from Ben Sain

2740
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:59,340
that's like

2741
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:01,340
if you haven't heard the message

2742
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,340
from Ben Sain

2743
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,340
what are you even doing

2744
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:07,340
you're not a real plebe in the weeb head

2745
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:09,340
that's the final piece of plebe in the weeb related content

2746
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,340
that will ever be produced

2747
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,340
I think so

2748
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,340
I think you should be called

2749
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:17,340
dweebs

2750
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,340
I think the generic term should be dweebs

2751
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,340
I was thinking

2752
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:23,340
I'm gonna make an NFT series

2753
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:25,340
based on like those character designs

2754
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:27,340
they should be called

2755
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:29,340
dweebs

2756
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:31,340
just take that design and run it to like a million

2757
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:33,340
different variations

2758
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,340
I can see that

2759
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:37,340
yes just iterate it

2760
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:39,340
do like a stone toss style thing of like

2761
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,340
okay I just have a bunch of different eyes

2762
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,340
a bunch of different mouths, a bunch of different whatever

2763
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:45,340
and randomize

2764
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,340
here they are

2765
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,340
dweebs is the name

2766
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,340
yeah let's see

2767
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,340
do I have anything else to say about that

2768
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,340
Trixie is

2769
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,340
too cowardly

2770
01:42:57,340 --> 01:42:59,340
to acknowledge it

2771
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,340
it's probably

2772
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,340
this is probably my last hurrah

2773
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,340
like yeah I can't

2774
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,340
it would be hard to top

2775
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:09,340
what else is there to do

2776
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,340
you have to really start from square one

2777
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:13,340
what else is there to say

2778
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:15,340
just solid own

2779
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:17,340
full album

2780
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,340
I hope you will buy them

2781
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,340
I think I have sold exactly

2782
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,340
50 of them

2783
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:25,340
that's pretty good honestly dude

2784
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:27,340
a few

2785
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:29,340
I don't know

2786
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,340
I guess I'm not that surprised that there's like a market for it

2787
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,340
but like it's just

2788
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,340
I wouldn't have also been that surprised if a lot of people are just like

2789
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:37,340
I don't want to buy a blu-ray for this shit

2790
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,340
I can just go watch it on YouTube if I care

2791
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:41,340
they don't get the exclusive content though

2792
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,340
okay

2793
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:45,340
I'll break it down

2794
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:47,340
buying are like actually people who

2795
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:49,340
you know pledge to the kickstarter

2796
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:51,340
and actually want their thing versus how many people are just like

2797
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,340
oh that looks funny I'll pay for it

2798
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,340
very few only

2799
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,340
that's what I was curious about

2800
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,340
interesting

2801
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:01,340
okay

2802
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:03,340
only nine people are like yeah I pledge to the

2803
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,340
kickstarter

2804
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,340
thanks for making it

2805
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,340
can I have my copy

2806
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:11,340
the majority are just like

2807
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:13,340
yeah I want one I guess

2808
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:15,340
I

2809
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,340
I spent about

2810
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:19,340
okay

2811
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:21,340
I'll break it down a little bit

2812
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:23,340
I paid slow but on like

2813
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,340
$150 to make the files

2814
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,340
the

2815
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:29,340
50 DVDs

2816
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,340
cost me like $100

2817
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,340
or blu-rays cost me blank ones cost me

2818
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,340
$100

2819
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,340
the cases cost me like 20 for

2820
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,340
50 and then printing the labels cost

2821
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,340
me like $40

2822
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:43,340
and then

2823
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:45,340
so Ctole got me a blu-ray

2824
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:47,340
burner

2825
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,340
but the one he got me broke

2826
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,340
so I had to get another one

2827
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,340
and I also needed a printer

2828
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,340
to print on the

2829
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,340
disc which is a little bit

2830
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:59,340
hard to find like I tried to get a printing

2831
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,340
company to do it and no one would do it

2832
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,340
so I had to

2833
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,340
get a printer capable of doing it

2834
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,340
fortunately it wasn't that expensive that printer

2835
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,340
ended up costing $200

2836
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,340
and the blu-ray burner cost

2837
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:13,340
a little less than $100 or about

2838
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,340
$100 so all in all

2839
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,340
I probably spent maybe like

2840
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:19,340
I don't know

2841
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:21,340
it was maybe like $300

2842
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,340
on materials and then

2843
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,340
the burner and the

2844
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,340
printer were another $300 but like

2845
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:29,340
I keep those so

2846
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:31,340
I don't know if that really counts as an expense

2847
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:33,340
because like now I have a new printer and that's pretty cool

2848
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,340
so selling the 50

2849
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,340
copies has made it has paid for

2850
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,340
all the materials it has paid

2851
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:41,340
the cost of the printer

2852
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,340
and the burner and I have made

2853
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,340
like a few hundred dollars in addition to that

2854
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:47,340
on top of that. Damn I can't wait to get Phantoms Revenge

2855
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,340
on printed onto a blu-ray

2856
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:51,340
Yeah you gotta make a PS4 version

2857
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:53,340
so that you can put it on a blu-ray and send it

2858
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:57,340
I bought another batch

2859
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,340
of 50 DVDs

2860
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,340
and cases and labels I'm hoping

2861
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:03,340
to sell most of them. I'm definitely gonna buy one

2862
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,340
If I don't sell

2863
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:07,340
Thank you. I hope everybody will buy one.

2864
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:09,340
I honestly

2865
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:11,340
I think you mentioned this Samoy. I am impressed

2866
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,340
that you went to the effort of making it

2867
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,340
like a real DVD instead of just

2868
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:17,340
throwing the files on a thing and like the

2869
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,340
autoplay when you throw them on a DVD player

2870
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,340
like it has a freaking menu guys.

2871
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,340
That's what Trixie was gonna do.

2872
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:25,340
At that point it's like

2873
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:27,340
why even bother having it on a blu-ray because

2874
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,340
if you're just gonna have the files basically

2875
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:31,340
just go watch it. You know what I mean?

2876
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:33,340
Yeah.

2877
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:35,340
I was like no. I'm gonna make it like

2878
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,340
I'm gonna make this like a nice little

2879
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:39,340
collectible item. A nice little thing to put

2880
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,340
on your shelf.

2881
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,340
This is gonna be on someone's shelf out there

2882
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:45,340
and someone will be like what the fuck is this

2883
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,340
and someone will be like oh boy okay how do I even explain this

2884
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:49,340
okay so there was a Kickstarter and there's this guy

2885
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:51,340
Ben St. and he was really mad about

2886
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,340
a lot of things

2887
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,340
That's the

2888
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,340
I made the back of the label

2889
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:59,340
you know I wrote the whole like

2890
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:01,340
the back of the label is not about what plebe

2891
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,340
and the weeb is. The back of the label is about

2892
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,340
Ben St. and why Ben hates Trixie.

2893
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,340
I saw some people upset about that

2894
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:09,340
in Jesse's server

2895
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:11,340
they just wanted the label to just be about

2896
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,340
Wait what? Say what?

2897
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:15,340
I saw some people were upset about that being

2898
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,340
the back of the case. They just wanted it to

2899
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,340
just be about plebe and the weeb

2900
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,340
which I completely wouldn't exist

2901
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:23,340
without Ben St's

2902
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,340
furious anger so like you know

2903
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:27,340
like you know I think he earned the right

2904
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,340
to put it on the back. Like it's not like he

2905
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,340
went into every episode and like

2906
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,340
digitally inserted himself going

2907
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:35,340
by the way this is why these guys are dumb

2908
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,340
you know what I mean?

2909
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:39,340
Was a relevant blurb

2910
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:41,340
part of the stretch goals?

2911
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:43,340
Ben St. appears on screen, green screen

2912
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:45,340
points that these guys are fucking with me

2913
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,340
A relevant blurb wasn't

2914
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,340
part of the stretch goals so

2915
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:51,340
the blue rays exist as promised

2916
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,340
so that's all that matters

2917
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,340
Neither was the coveted

2918
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,340
exclusive message from Ben St

2919
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,340
Wait how much

2920
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,340
How much of the kickstart

2921
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,340
of money did Jesse receive?

2922
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:05,340
Do you think?

2923
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,340
That I don't know

2924
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,340
I heard people saying that Trixie received like 7k

2925
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:11,340
but I don't know if that's accurate

2926
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:13,340
The whole

2927
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,340
the whole campaign raised

2928
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:17,340
7k

2929
01:48:17,340 --> 01:48:19,340
750

2930
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:21,340
Is that true?

2931
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:23,340
I said it's not like all of that one

2932
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:25,340
Oh yeah

2933
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:27,340
She said she paid Jesse

2934
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:29,340
something and I don't know

2935
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:31,340
how much it was so I really don't know how it breaks down

2936
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,340
Some money

2937
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,340
Some money

2938
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:37,340
because Jesse had the whole like his

2939
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:39,340
house flooded or whatever

2940
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:41,340
I vaguely recall

2941
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:43,340
like

2942
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:45,340
the money was for editing all of the

2943
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:47,340
episodes

2944
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,340
and being in them I guess

2945
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:51,340
but I don't know what the number was

2946
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:53,340
This one

2947
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:55,340
Yeah I shouldn't give a

2948
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:57,340
But the kickstarter for Radcon 2

2949
01:48:57,340 --> 01:48:59,340
or the kickstarter for plebe and the weave

2950
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:01,340
included like getting flights

2951
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,340
for people for Radcon 2 as well

2952
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,340
The stretch goals were

2953
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:07,340
basically plane tickets to fly us out there

2954
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:09,340
to be on plebe and the weave episodes

2955
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,340
and I think one of the stretch goals was

2956
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,340
like when we get everyone

2957
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:15,340
out there we'll have Radcon 2

2958
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:17,340
I think

2959
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:19,340
it was mentioned somewhere

2960
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,340
Right

2961
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:23,340
Let's see

2962
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:25,340
I feel like there was

2963
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:27,340
maybe one other thing I wanted to mention

2964
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:29,340
about it

2965
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,340
I don't know

2966
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:33,340
It's just

2967
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:35,340
Money

2968
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,340
Give me money please

2969
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:39,340
Give me money

2970
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:41,340
If I have some

2971
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:43,340
I'll probably have a few left over

2972
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,340
But that's okay whatever

2973
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:47,340
Maybe like I'll just have

2974
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:49,340
20 or 30 copies left over

2975
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,340
It's fine whatever

2976
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:53,340
It turned a profit it's okay

2977
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,340
Give away to your patrons

2978
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:57,340
with the left over ones

2979
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:59,340
I've always been interested

2980
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:01,340
in like home media releases

2981
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:03,340
for like internet shows

2982
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:05,340
I have like the first quote unquote season of angry video game nerd

2983
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,340
on dvd and I have much other stupid shit

2984
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:09,340
like red vs blue

2985
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:11,340
and mega 64 dvds

2986
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:13,340
I've always been fascinated

2987
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,340
by this

2988
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:17,340
I've been fascinated by that kind of stuff

2989
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:19,340
and this is

2990
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:21,340
not only is this that

2991
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:23,340
this is like a physical release of internet thing

2992
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,340
but like it's way weirder than that

2993
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:27,340
because of all the shit that's gone down since then

2994
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:29,340
I

2995
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,340
I love thinking about someone

2996
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:33,340
it was the same with road to radcon

2997
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:35,340
like on the back of road to radcon

2998
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:37,340
I had the little blurb explaining what it was

2999
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,340
I can't imagine reading that

3000
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,340
with no knowledge of the PCP

3001
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,340
That would be so confusing

3002
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:45,340
It's like someone finding it

3003
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:47,340
and being like what is this book

3004
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,340
and then the back of display it's like

3005
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,340
okay so there was a thing called radcon

3006
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:53,340
from like a podcast called the procrastinators

3007
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,340
and they wrote a book

3008
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:57,340
but then like one of them quit

3009
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,340
and then the other one like printed it

3010
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:01,340
and like okay I guess

3011
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:03,340
it's great

3012
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:05,340
it's great

3013
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:07,340
comedy gold

3014
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:09,340
mate I'm hoping

3015
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:11,340
it's like

3016
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,340
what's the word for like

3017
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,340
environmental storytelling

3018
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,340
but in real life

3019
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:19,340
it's just sort of it's like a weird artifact

3020
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,340
that would puzzle someone

3021
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,340
it's not just like oh it's a figure from

3022
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:25,340
an anime it's a book

3023
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:27,340
about

3024
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:29,340
some people on a podcast

3025
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:31,340
it's so exciting right I love that

3026
01:51:31,340 --> 01:51:33,340
who are these it's a lesser known

3027
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:35,340
podcast as well it's not like a big thing

3028
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,340
no no this isn't like

3029
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:39,340
this isn't like you didn't find

3030
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:41,340
you know the fucking

3031
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:43,340
like D&D

3032
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:45,340
comics from the

3033
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,340
my brother my brother and me

3034
01:51:47,340 --> 01:51:49,340
thing

3035
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:51,340
that's dumb everybody knows that

3036
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:53,340
you should have like some weird shit

3037
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:55,340
that's some weirdos printed out a few extra

3038
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:57,340
road to radcon and just like leave them like

3039
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,340
good wills and just like random places

3040
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:01,340
like so someone at some point will find it and just be like

3041
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,340
what the fuck is this

3042
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:05,340
I have like

3043
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:07,340
45 copies just sitting in a box

3044
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,340
and I could spare a few

3045
01:52:09,340 --> 01:52:11,340
why not

3046
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,340
I just imagine someone in 100 years being like

3047
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:15,340
what the fuck was going on in the past

3048
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,340
in the past

3049
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:21,340
imagine you're like

3050
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:23,340
you're like

3051
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:25,340
you're like man I'm curious

3052
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:27,340
like what were things like in the

3053
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,340
past and then you're like hmm and you're like

3054
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,340
just going through random and you pick up

3055
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,340
road to radcon you read the back of

3056
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,340
like radcon

3057
01:52:35,340 --> 01:52:37,340
like did you bro like what the fuck

3058
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:39,340
man the past was fucking

3059
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:41,340
just imagine someone picturing radcon

3060
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:43,340
like 100 people like they just

3061
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,340
think it's like a convention you know like they don't understand

3062
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:49,340
in 50

3063
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,340
years from now someone will find it and be like

3064
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,340
huh what the fuck was going on in the past

3065
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,340
like this would have been an NFT today

3066
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:57,340
this would be on the blockchain like

3067
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,340
I haven't seen a physical book in years

3068
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,340
they find a book like what is this some kind of

3069
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:03,340
physical pdf

3070
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,340
NFT I don't understand

3071
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,340
wait it's

3072
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:09,340
they pick it up and they're like

3073
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:11,340
wait I can't

3074
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:13,340
funge it it's not fungible but it's not

3075
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:15,340
on the blockchain it's in

3076
01:53:15,340 --> 01:53:17,340
physical space it's in my hands

3077
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:19,340
how am I supposed to read this

3078
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:21,340
book if it hasn't been verified on the blockchain

3079
01:53:21,340 --> 01:53:23,340
by that point we'll be

3080
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,340
at web 4.0 and I can't even imagine

3081
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:27,340
how horrible that'll be

3082
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,340
I wish web 4.0

3083
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,340
I wish they would just stop counting

3084
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:35,340
I wish they would just stop

3085
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,340
incrementing the number so

3086
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,340
and then it would all be okay

3087
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:41,340
once we get to web 8.0

3088
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,340
then the spiders will take over the earth

3089
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:45,340
and

3090
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,340
they'll have a real world wide web

3091
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:49,340
which is all in it

3092
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:53,340
cute

3093
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,340
it's finking too far ahead

3094
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,340
that was pretty good

3095
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:59,340
I want

3096
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:01,340
everyone to buy

3097
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:03,340
if we ever get that damn

3098
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,340
dojin, if we ever get that damn

3099
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:07,340
radcon dojin done

3100
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:09,340
so much merch so much

3101
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,340
so much weird radcon

3102
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:13,340
PC shit to purchase

3103
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:15,340
you'll get road to radcon

3104
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:17,340
in your own home for your shelf

3105
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:19,340
you've got the road to radcon

3106
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:21,340
you've got the plebe in the weave

3107
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:23,340
and you've also got phantom's revenge

3108
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,340
you're working on which again as I already explained

3109
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,340
in the nicest possible way

3110
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:29,340
it's the weirdest, most hard to understand

3111
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,340
do you ever plan on making something

3112
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:33,340
that normal human beings can comprehend

3113
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:35,340
and understand without a million years

3114
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,340
of internet lore behind them

3115
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:39,340
that's something good about the paper

3116
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:41,340
which is you can just pick it up

3117
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,340
and read it

3118
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:45,340
what's the point

3119
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:47,340
if there's not

3120
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:49,340
if you just understand it

3121
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,340
I'm with you man, I like the weird internet shit

3122
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:53,340
so don't take it as like

3123
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,340
I don't know

3124
01:54:57,340 --> 01:54:59,340
yeah, I'll make normal shit at some point

3125
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,340
you know, I ain't gonna finish

3126
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,340
my fucking Winnie the Pooh

3127
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:05,340
my Winnie the Pooh retrospective

3128
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:07,340
dude, Winnie the Pooh just became public domain

3129
01:55:07,340 --> 01:55:09,340
yeah, it's perfect time for that, you gotta do it

3130
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:11,340
but only the shirtless con

3131
01:55:11,340 --> 01:55:13,340
if he's wearing a red shirt

3132
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:15,340
you will get sued

3133
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:17,340
have you seen the Ned Flanders meme

3134
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:19,340
if he's

3135
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,340
if he's red and yellow

3136
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:23,340
that's Mickey's fellow

3137
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,340
if he's shirtless and brown, you're in fair use town

3138
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:27,340
I love it, it's a good bit

3139
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:29,340
yeah, it is

3140
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:33,340
excited though, excited

3141
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:35,340
man, imagine what the

3142
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,340
with the twitter artist community

3143
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:39,340
can do now that

3144
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,340
Winnie the Pooh is fair use

3145
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:43,340
the possibilities are endless

3146
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:47,340
so if you gave him like

3147
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,340
a blue shirt

3148
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:51,340
I guess

3149
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:53,340
there's like little things

3150
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:55,340
like I think Tigger is a Disney character

3151
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:57,340
like you can't just use everything

3152
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:59,340
but I think the rest of the cast should be okay

3153
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,340
just don't use

3154
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:03,340
wait, are they guess the original stories might be

3155
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:05,340
fair use now huh

3156
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:07,340
orange

3157
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:09,340
they must be

3158
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:13,340
anything that's Disney original

3159
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,340
and also like the specific

3160
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:17,340
like Disney character designs

3161
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,340
are not fair use

3162
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,340
but

3163
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:23,340
I don't know

3164
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:25,340
so just draw badly and give him a blue shirt

3165
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,340
and you can just do the entire film

3166
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:29,340
so like gopher

3167
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:31,340
right, gopher is a Disney original

3168
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:33,340
he was not in the original books I don't think

3169
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:35,340
so tragically

3170
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:37,340
artists, I'm sorry

3171
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:39,340
you can't use gopher, I know you were all like

3172
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:41,340
clamoring for

3173
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:43,340
the gopher fandom is like

3174
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:45,340
heartbroken

3175
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:47,340
the gopher verse

3176
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,340
it kind of

3177
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,340
it kind of reminds me of how

3178
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,340
the wizard of Oz is public domain

3179
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,340
but not the red slippers because I was

3180
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:57,340
invented for the movie

3181
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,340
wait

3182
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,340
you mean

3183
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:03,340
what are you talking about

3184
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:05,340
the wizard of Oz is public domain

3185
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,340
but not the red slippers because I was

3186
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:09,340
invented for the movie

3187
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:11,340
oh

3188
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,340
right, they were like silver shoes

3189
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:15,340
yeah, they were the 7 dragons balls

3190
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:17,340
there's

3191
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,340
a million fucking Oz books

3192
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,340
there's a lot of weird shit in that whole

3193
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,340
I guess I didn't realize it was public domain

3194
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,340
right

3195
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:27,340
there's the wizard of Oz, the warlock of Oz

3196
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:29,340
the mage of Oz

3197
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,340
the fighter of Oz, the thief of Oz

3198
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:33,340
the paladin of Oz

3199
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,340
the cleric of Oz

3200
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,340
the goblin of Oz

3201
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,340
a whole RPG

3202
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:41,340
party's worth

3203
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:43,340
of Oz books, I guess

3204
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:45,340
yeah, I've heard

3205
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:47,340
about those, I've never

3206
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:49,340
I mean, I've never read

3207
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:51,340
any of you have read the Oz books

3208
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,340
I haven't, I haven't read it

3209
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:55,340
they actually did make a JRPG about the wizard of Oz

3210
01:57:55,340 --> 01:57:57,340
for the DS

3211
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:59,340
yeah

3212
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:01,340
yeah, I believe that

3213
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,340
I believe that completely

3214
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:05,340
that seems like the kind of thing that would be

3215
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,340
right for like a Tim

3216
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:09,340
that would be right for like

3217
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,340
a Tim Burton

3218
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,340
like Grimdark reimagining

3219
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:15,340
I thought you were going to say

3220
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:17,340
they must have done those

3221
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,340
I thought you were going to say a Tim Rogers video essay

3222
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,340
about the

3223
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:23,340
wizard of Oz

3224
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:25,340
JRPG

3225
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,340
yeah

3226
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:29,340
um

3227
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:31,340
fucking

3228
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,340
I don't know, no, did they make

3229
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:35,340
Oz video games? Yeah, they probably did

3230
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,340
yeah, it seems like

3231
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:39,340
someone would make um

3232
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:41,340
RPG maker like survival

3233
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,340
yeah

3234
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:45,340
indie RPG maker top down

3235
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,340
yeah, ones like that

3236
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:49,340
I could see it in my mind

3237
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:51,340
you make the scarecrow scary

3238
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:53,340
yeah

3239
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:57,340
duh

3240
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,340
stupid

3241
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,340
what are you fucking stupid bro

3242
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:03,340
wait a minute

3243
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:05,340
wait a minute, we can't have dark

3244
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,340
themes

3245
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:09,340
in children's media

3246
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,340
what was I making fun of

3247
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:13,340
there was some like

3248
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:15,340
some post was going around that was like

3249
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,340
oh it was Animorphs

3250
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:19,340
oh

3251
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:21,340
I saw someone posting like

3252
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,340
bro, like I just read this Animorphs

3253
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:25,340
book and it's about like child soldiers

3254
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:27,340
and like there's war

3255
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,340
it's about how war is bad and like people die

3256
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:31,340
and they get killed and I was like oh my god

3257
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:33,340
this is so

3258
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:35,340
fucked up

3259
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:37,340
they get that one past the censors

3260
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:39,340
I can't believe they made kids

3261
01:59:39,340 --> 01:59:41,340
read these in school

3262
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:43,340
they forced them to do it

3263
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:45,340
anything that's like

3264
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,340
darker than Barney the dinosaur is

3265
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:49,340
really amazing that kids could actually

3266
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,340
watch that

3267
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:53,340
like I know, in the

3268
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:55,340
Animorphs lecture we did

3269
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,340
we were a bit guilty of it as well

3270
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:59,340
we also like clapped and cheered and were like

3271
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,340
whoa and it was like

3272
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:03,340
all child soldiers genocide

3273
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:05,340
war crimes

3274
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,340
there was some war crimes

3275
02:00:07,340 --> 02:00:09,340
particularly weird shit in Animorphs

3276
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:11,340
beyond just like you know

3277
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,340
child soldiers

3278
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:15,340
body horror stuff that one in particular

3279
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,340
I'll say is a little weird but other than that

3280
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:19,340
I don't have anything against dark themes

3281
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:23,340
yeah

3282
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:25,340
body horror

3283
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:27,340
you know what else that annoyed me on twitter

3284
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,340
you know what else annoyed me on twitter

3285
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:31,340
this week

3286
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:33,340
a lot of things annoyed me on twitter

3287
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:35,340
I'm gonna throw one of our

3288
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:37,340
former guests under the bus

3289
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:39,340
and say it was very irritated by

3290
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:41,340
Mallory Eudicious's

3291
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:43,340
posts recently

3292
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:45,340
you know her, she's the

3293
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:47,340
the new guy

3294
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:49,340
girl

3295
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:51,340
they've been

3296
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,340
they've been posting on their main account about

3297
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:55,340
like I've decided twitter is bad

3298
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,340
and I'm quitting

3299
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:59,340
I just kept posting about like

3300
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:01,340
I'm quitting twitter now

3301
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:03,340
oh I can't believe more people are following

3302
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:05,340
oh people are patroning me

3303
02:01:05,340 --> 02:01:07,340
quitting twitter is based but like

3304
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:09,340
actually doing it is based

3305
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,340
not making a big deal of it

3306
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:13,340
she may

3307
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,340
actually do it at some point

3308
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,340
but it's annoying to be like

3309
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,340
I'm totally leaving twitter guys

3310
02:01:19,340 --> 02:01:21,340
I'm really doing it

3311
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,340
you saw Lindsay Ellis

3312
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:25,340
she's like done with being a public internet person

3313
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:27,340
and then like as soon as she announced

3314
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:29,340
she's like this patreon

3315
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,340
will no longer be putting out things

3316
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:33,340
and it got like 3000 new members

3317
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:35,340
yes

3318
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:37,340
it did

3319
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:39,340
it went from like 8000 to like 12000

3320
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:41,340
that must have been intentional

3321
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:43,340
because she put her goodbye message behind a paywall

3322
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,340
okay people got mad at me

3323
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:49,340
because I said she paywalled the message

3324
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:51,340
and people were like no she didn't

3325
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,340
but like she definitely did

3326
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,340
she definitely did

3327
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:57,340
like the first few hours ago

3328
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:59,340
it wasn't paywalled and then she made it paywalled

3329
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:01,340
oh it's interesting because I was going to say

3330
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:03,340
I think I remember seeing it and it wasn't paywalled

3331
02:02:03,340 --> 02:02:05,340
and then that's weird that she would do it in that order

3332
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,340
because like you know once it's been out there

3333
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:09,340
it's been you need to text you

3334
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,340
just copy paste it it's not even like hard to

3335
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,340
replicate

3336
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:15,340
so yeah I did not actually

3337
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:17,340
read the post

3338
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:19,340
so I can't comment on what she

3339
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,340
actually said in it

3340
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:23,340
so is that I heard

3341
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:25,340
is that I heard she's quitting

3342
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:27,340
being a youtuber or an internet person

3343
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:29,340
and

3344
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:31,340
it was an interesting

3345
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,340
I'm not here to shit on her or anything

3346
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:35,340
I don't want to start drama not that I mean

3347
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,340
not that we're even on the same level but like

3348
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:39,340
it was a very melodramatic post and it was a little cringe

3349
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:41,340
and it was she's mad

3350
02:02:41,340 --> 02:02:43,340
she still buttered that she got cancelled over like some

3351
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:45,340
dumb twitter take about

3352
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,340
freaking like avatar the last airbender

3353
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:49,340
like nobody fucking cares

3354
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:51,340
yeah that whole thing

3355
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,340
it was people getting mad at her

3356
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:55,340
for like not like the take itself

3357
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:57,340
like people calling her racist

3358
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:59,340
and stuff like I'm sure when you're a creator

3359
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:01,340
of that size you just have to deal with a lot of

3360
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:03,340
bullshit so like I get it it's not like

3361
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:05,340
how dare she be fed up with twitter

3362
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:07,340
of course she of course she have haters

3363
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:09,340
I didn't think her post was too melodramatic

3364
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:11,340
no she can totally leave if she wants

3365
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:13,340
what is very reasonable is just like

3366
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:15,340
being an internet creator has like

3367
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:17,340
a lot of stresses that I'm just not prepared

3368
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,340
for and it's not for me

3369
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:21,340
which I think is fair

3370
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:23,340
that's okay

3371
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,340
that's okay you don't

3372
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:27,340
tell me you aren't cut out for being an internet person

3373
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:29,340
you can leave if you want

3374
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:31,340
you don't have to make youtube videos

3375
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,340
if you don't want to make them

3376
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,340
it's okay

3377
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,340
oh yeah that was basically it

3378
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,340
well she's like she's like writes books

3379
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:41,340
and stuff too and she's like I don't even know if I want

3380
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,340
to write books with my name because my name

3381
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:45,340
is like you know tainted or whatever

3382
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:47,340
it's been tarnished by people

3383
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:49,340
by viewers calling me racist online

a criminal yeah that whole controversy

3400
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:23,340
was incredibly stupid

3401
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:25,340
okay that

3402
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:27,340
it still happens

3403
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:29,340
there's people still make threads

3404
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,340
about like Mallory is bad because

3405
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:33,340
shoplifting and like I can't believe

3406
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:35,340
she would support like every time

3407
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:37,340
I lose my fucking

3408
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:39,340
mind every time like there's literally nothing

3409
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:41,340
in the world that makes me matter then people making a

3410
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,340
thread about how like Mallory is bad

3411
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:45,340
because she made a comic where someone shop

3412
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:47,340
insanely done and that's like terrible at this point

3413
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:49,340
like for God's sake it's insane

3414
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:51,340
I saw a thread about that

3415
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:53,340
like last week and someone and someone was like

3416
02:04:53,340 --> 02:04:55,340
the thread was like guys

3417
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:57,340
what's worst the worst thing about

3418
02:04:57,340 --> 02:04:59,340
this the worst thing about this comic

3419
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:01,340
about shoplifting is that she shop lifted

3420
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:03,340
from BIC

3421
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:05,340
or from Blick which is family owned

3422
02:05:05,340 --> 02:05:07,340
it's a family

3423
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,340
owned company that she was stealing from

3424
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:11,340
and someone responded

3425
02:05:11,340 --> 02:05:13,340
in all seriousness

3426
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:15,340
like I can't like that's disgusting

3427
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:17,340
like I can't believe

3428
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:19,340
from a family owned company

3429
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:21,340
and I'm like

3430
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,340
she had some article right

3431
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,340
she put an article out about like this whole

3432
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:27,340
her dealing with the online harassment and she was like

3433
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:29,340
she was like she was like I wasn't making

3434
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,340
this comic to be like it was a bio

3435
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:33,340
I was just like

3436
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:35,340
I wasn't making the comic to be like this is you should

3437
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:37,340
steal stealing is based even though it is a little base she wasn't

3438
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:39,340
she was really just like I wanted just to like make

3439
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:41,340
a comic about a character who like

3440
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:43,340
has like you know just like

3441
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:45,340
yeah like people people thought

3442
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:47,340
yeah people people thought it was

3443
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:49,340
a self insert right yes

3444
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:51,340
it was not meant to be that's what she said when she was on

3445
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:53,340
we had her as a

3446
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,340
we had her as a guest and that's what she said she's like

3447
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:57,340
it's literally just a

3448
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:59,340
you know it's it's a fiction it's a comic

3449
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:01,340
about a care I mean she did say in a tweet

3450
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:03,340
that like yeah she used to shop lift

3451
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,340
art supplies when she was like a teenager

3452
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:07,340
you know the fucking

3453
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:09,340
uh the woe woe

3454
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:11,340
betide should to get mad about on twitter

3455
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:13,340
okay people getting mad about that it's just like

3456
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:15,340
I can't even write my head around it like what the

3457
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:17,340
fuck is it it makes me so mad

3458
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:19,340
what's what's what's even stupid

3459
02:06:19,340 --> 02:06:21,340
oh sorry

3460
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:23,340
well but that okay that's not the

3461
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:25,340
point the point is right yes

3462
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:27,340
obviously that all makes me mad

3463
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:29,340
like never nevertheless

3464
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:31,340
nevertheless like I

3465
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:33,340
definitely don't feel bad for

3466
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:35,340
her because like ultimately

3467
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,340
the controversy has gotten her a lot of exposure

3468
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,340
and made her a lot more successful I know

3469
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:41,340
that that is the case

3470
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:43,340
and I feel the exact same way about

3471
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:45,340
and I feel the same way

3472
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,340
and I feel the same way about Lindsay like

3473
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:49,340
like I'm sorry like I'm sorry

3474
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:51,340
you're upset that like

3475
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:53,340
many people on the internet

3476
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,340
don't like you they make

3477
02:06:55,340 --> 02:06:57,340
they make they maybe they harass you

3478
02:06:57,340 --> 02:06:59,340
in various ways on like social media

3479
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:01,340
or whatever uh they

3480
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:03,340
mean things about you and you get hate

3481
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:05,340
on the internet like I'm very sorry about

3482
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:07,340
that but like fuck's sake

3483
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:09,340
I will I could never I could never

3484
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,340
in a million years feel bad for

3485
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,340
Lindsay Ellis it's uh yeah

3486
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:15,340
so fucking successful it is a little like

3487
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,340
she's got like like sure like

3488
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:19,340
these bad things might happen to you but like

3489
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,340
you've obviously gotten so much

3490
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:23,340
out of your internet celebrity

3491
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:25,340
and your position like it's obviously

3492
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:27,340
been a massive net good for you like

3493
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:29,340
I can't possibly be expected

3494
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:31,340
to feel sorry I'm empathetic in the

3495
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,340
sense that it must suck having a million

3496
02:07:33,340 --> 02:07:35,340
people post dumb shit at you

3497
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:37,340
and say you're racist on Twitter when you're not

3498
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:39,340
like that really probably does suck a lot

3499
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:41,340
and like might take shit out of your mental health

3500
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:43,340
absolutely and you don't have to be on Twitter

3501
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:45,340
if you don't want to or anything like that

3502
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:47,340
but yeah I absolutely agree which is like

3503
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,340
I think here's I'm not like one of these like

3504
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:51,340
guys who gives a fucking like

3505
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:53,340
cancel culture but I think

3506
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:55,340
the like sort of accepted theory

3507
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:57,340
on why she's so buttered about it is like

3508
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:59,340
she was very instrumental

3509
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:01,340
and like this whole like

3510
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,340
Twitter you know going after

3511
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:05,340
someone when they have like the wrong take

3512
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:07,340
and like really going hard at them and

3513
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:09,340
she just wasn't like mentally prepared for that

3514
02:08:09,340 --> 02:08:11,340
to happen to her you know what I mean

3515
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:13,340
wait wait wait

3516
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:15,340
you cut out you cut out she was

3517
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:17,340
she was involved in what now

3518
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:19,340
people in general like

3519
02:08:19,340 --> 02:08:21,340
are saying that she was involved with like

3520
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:23,340
going around like you know cancelling people for having

3521
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:25,340
being racist on Twitter like that's the kind

3522
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:27,340
of things that she would do is like start

3523
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,340
like these mobs like everyone we need to dog-pile

3524
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:31,340
this person for having a bad take so she just

3525
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:33,340
couldn't believe that it

3526
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:35,340
happened to her like I like like I thought

3527
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:37,340
everyone knew I was on the right side of history

3528
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:39,340
and like I would never be racist so like all the people

3529
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:41,340
like all the people jump down my throat all the people

3530
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:43,340
betray me like you know it must suck

3531
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:45,340
to have your friends like not stand up for you when you

3532
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:47,340
make a take that's not even racist at all and people

3533
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:49,340
like all it's racist and you know people just want to distance

3534
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:51,340
myself from that and not get involved you know what I mean

3535
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:53,340
so I do have empathy

3536
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:55,340
what I'm just saying like the only thing I

3537
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,340
want to say is that like I mean yeah if

3538
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:59,340
I were in her position I feel like I'd

3539
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,340
handle it better and I'd be able to like

3540
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:03,340
be like well the success is worth it but

3541
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:05,340
everyone's brains work differently and

3542
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,340
some people just can't handle that and

3543
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:09,340
there's nothing to be held against from

3544
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:11,340
for it so I

3545
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:13,340
I don't hold I don't hold it again

3546
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:15,340
I don't hold it against okay fair

3547
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:17,340
but I also

3548
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:19,340
don't feel any pity

3549
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:21,340
for her and I never would

3550
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,340
I think it's a pretty fair take

3551
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:25,340
like you know when you're making six figures

3552
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:27,340
a year making like media analysis

3553
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:29,340
and then you know

3554
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:31,340
the worst thing that happens to you is people are mean to you online

3555
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:33,340
and it's and it's and it's just

3556
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:35,340
and it's just a little annoying and it's not

3557
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,340
even I can't even hold this against her right it's

3558
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:39,340
not that I'm like she did something

3559
02:09:39,340 --> 02:09:41,340
bad like with her announcement

3560
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,340
and then she got a bunch of support and

3561
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:45,340
and it's just annoying to see her be

3562
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:47,340
like I quit and the response and to have

3563
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:49,340
like an overwhelming like

3564
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:51,340
let's give her some more money

3565
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:53,340
like it's like why

3566
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:55,340
it's like there were just really weird things

3567
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:57,340
in her post like like oh I employ a bunch

3568
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:59,340
of people and like you know like I'm responsible

3569
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:01,340
for paying their salary and I haven't even told them that I'm

3570
02:10:01,340 --> 02:10:03,340
quitting making content they're gonna find out when they read

3571
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,340
this post I was just like what the fuck is this

3572
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:07,340
shit

3573
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:09,340
yeah that is yeah that is also a point

3574
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:11,340
to it's a bit on having

3575
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:13,340
as much money as you might assume because she

3576
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,340
is paying so many people

3577
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,340
that's true she has employees

3578
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,340
um

3579
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:21,340
I don't know it

3580
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:23,340
it feels a bit like a sort of like

3581
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:25,340
this is

3582
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:27,340
an unfair comparison but you know

3583
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:29,340
that that one

3584
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,340
Dar man video god

3585
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:33,340
he's like

3586
02:10:33,340 --> 02:10:35,340
where that one Dar man video where it's about

3587
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:37,340
it's about like

3588
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:39,340
it's about

3589
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:41,340
the kid who works as a Dar man

3590
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:43,340
actor getting bullied by people

3591
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:45,340
who say he's in cringy videos

3592
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,340
and the basically the plot of the video is like

3593
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,340
you know you

3594
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:51,340
you can hate me you can hate me

3595
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:53,340
I Dar man can take it but when you

3596
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:55,340
say mean things about my videos

3597
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,340
you're actually hurting

3598
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:59,340
this adorable child star actor

3599
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:01,340
this this young boy who's just trying to get

3600
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:03,340
his career off the ground like this guy

3601
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:05,340
this kid who works for me like I can take it but this kid

3602
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,340
you're really hurting this kid

3603
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:09,340
I don't know this seems a little

3604
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:11,340
bit like you know like I like

3605
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:13,340
I Lindsay

3606
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:15,340
well I like I'm responsible for paying

3607
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,340
a bunch of people's salaries so

3608
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:19,340
you know I got I got to keep the patreon going

3609
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,340
because otherwise how would I continue

3610
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:23,340
to pay all these other people

3611
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,340
that I got to pay their

3612
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,340
salaries for and like

3613
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:29,340
kind of I mean it's

3614
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:31,340
true well sure

3615
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:33,340
but is that a reason to

3616
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:35,340
but is that a reason

3617
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,340
for people to just like pour money

3618
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:39,340
into a you can't

3619
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:41,340
that is now

3620
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:43,340
that is that is now funding

3621
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:45,340
nothing you can't get mad

3622
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,340
about people wasting their money and shit

3623
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:49,340
people have bleeding hearts

3624
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:51,340
yeah people I guess

3625
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:53,340
people fucking spend money

3626
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:55,340
stupidly all the time

3627
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,340
I mean debatably

3628
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,340
stupidly if they enjoy the feeling

3629
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:01,340
of supporting someone then whatever

3630
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:03,340
it's not really

3631
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:05,340
of my business where people do their money

3632
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,340
I can understand

3633
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:09,340
that like Lindsay Ellis

3634
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:11,340
leaves

3635
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,340
and then people show a lot

3636
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,340
of support and it irks

3637
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:17,340
you because where's my

3638
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:19,340
support god damn it I'm still here

3639
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:21,340
okay well there's a little

3640
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:23,340
little more nuance than that

3641
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:25,340
well there's dirt there's a lot

3642
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,340
sure sure I just I just feel like

3643
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:29,340
that the whole thing with with Lindsay is

3644
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,340
and and Mallory and stuff

3645
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:33,340
like this is that people

3646
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:35,340
either are

3647
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:37,340
super supportive

3648
02:12:37,340 --> 02:12:39,340
with their money or they're like

3649
02:12:39,340 --> 02:12:41,340
saying things like oh no all

3650
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:43,340
and then there's the

3651
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:45,340
the counteraction to the

3652
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:47,340
like the the reaction

3653
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:49,340
to that is to like say

3654
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:51,340
no don't be nice to them don't be

3655
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:53,340
why are you being so supportive

3656
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:55,340
um fuck

3657
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:57,340
them they're rich and they have

3658
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:59,340
they're rich and they're quitting

3659
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,340
they're rich and they're quitting and everyone's like

3660
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,340
oh I love it I love it though

3661
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,340
well if I was rich

3662
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:07,340
I wouldn't work either

3663
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,340
and there's those two sides

3664
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:11,340
of those two takes and I just

3665
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,340
feel so exhausted

3666
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:15,340
hearing about either one of them

3667
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:17,340
it's just you know

3668
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,340
it doesn't matter other people

3669
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:21,340
it doesn't matter that you're annoyed by people

3670
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,340
other people are supporting someone

3671
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:25,340
well you know nothing matters in the end

3672
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,340
we're all gonna die I guess

3673
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:29,340
I guess it's just I guess I'm

3674
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:31,340
annoyed by the discourse about it

3675
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:33,340
it really shouldn't

3676
02:13:33,340 --> 02:13:35,340
other people quit posting

3677
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,340
on the internet all the time

3678
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:39,340
and uh what happens

3679
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:41,340
with them nothing nobody knows

3680
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:43,340
they just leave

3681
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:45,340
they just they just leave and they get

3682
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:47,340
a regular job

3683
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:49,340
I'm not even saying this against Lindsay Ellis

3684
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:51,340
I just mean in general I always sort of have an issue

3685
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:53,340
when people like if you just want to leave the internet whatever

3686
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:55,340
that's fine or I saw this more on forums

3687
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:57,340
two people like I'm they would make a big deal

3688
02:13:57,340 --> 02:13:59,340
like I'm leaving the forums they make a big thread

3689
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:01,340
like I'm leaving the forums and this is why

3690
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,340
and then like a week later they're still fucking there

3691
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:05,340
you know what I mean like it's a classic

3692
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,340
classic that like uh on

3693
02:14:07,340 --> 02:14:09,340
on forums that me and my friends owned

3694
02:14:09,340 --> 02:14:11,340
we made a rule that if you make a big post saying

3695
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,340
you're leaving you get banned that's fair

3696
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:15,340
because people would

3697
02:14:15,340 --> 02:14:17,340
people would make those posts and then come back

3698
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:19,340
like a week later you would literally mean

3699
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,340
when I was a teenager

3700
02:14:23,340 --> 02:14:25,340
you just want people to take you seriously

3701
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:27,340
I understand that stuff is annoying

3702
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:29,340
I just feel like it's

3703
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:31,340
like is there

3704
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:33,340
nothing interesting to talk about these days

3705
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:35,340
that this is such a big thing

3706
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:37,340
I don't you fucking cares

3707
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:39,340
people have been wasting money

3708
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:41,340
on stupid things

3709
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,340
you can't be getting mad at other people's patreons

3710
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:45,340
you just don't just don't think about it

3711
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:47,340
you can't be you just can't be

3712
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:49,340
get upset when bad people make money

3713
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:51,340
you want to know how much money Stone Toss made

3714
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:53,340
on his fucking schmorky parody NFTs

3715
02:14:53,340 --> 02:14:55,340
oh my god

3716
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:57,340
uh

3717
02:14:57,340 --> 02:14:59,340
yeah I saw someone

3718
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:01,340
posting I saw someone

3719
02:15:01,340 --> 02:15:03,340
someone

3720
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:05,340
posted about like

3721
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:07,340
oh Stone Toss made NFTs

3722
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:09,340
and like the point was to be like

3723
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:11,340
cringe right yeah but all you're doing is

3724
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,340
amplifying him and like spreading that to more people

3725
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:15,340
and like

3726
02:15:15,340 --> 02:15:17,340
okay I just

3727
02:15:17,340 --> 02:15:19,340
want to say really quick Stone Toss's detractors are like

3728
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:21,340
like

3729
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:23,340
90% of the reason why he's famous

3730
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,340
people like oh we're gonna own him

3731
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:27,340
by spreading the amugus meme and all that did

3732
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:29,340
was increase his notoriety and reach

3733
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:31,340
and probably gave him much of children aren't it

3734
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,340
like fans

3735
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:35,340
people do the amugus meme for that reason

3736
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:37,340
yeah he just leaned into it

3737
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:39,340
but it's I don't know someone was like

3738
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:41,340
and I responded to that

3739
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:43,340
being like like what's the point

3740
02:15:43,340 --> 02:15:45,340
and someone said like it's cringe it's cringe that he makes

3741
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:47,340
NFTs and I was like well

3742
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:49,340
sure I think so

3743
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:51,340
but I know that he made a ton of money off of it

3744
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:53,340
so like he got exactly what he wanted

3745
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:55,340
and someone tried to

3746
02:15:55,340 --> 02:15:57,340
tell me like no he's probably just lying

3747
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:59,340
he's probably lying about how much money he made

3748
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,340
the one thing about NFTs

3749
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:03,340
and my 3.0 bullshit is like okay first off

3750
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:05,340
you can fake sales I'll give you that like it's not like

3751
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:07,340
without their own possibility but for the most part

3752
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:09,340
this shit is out in the open like we know how much money he's making

3753
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:11,340
yeah it's

3754
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,340
quite a lot

3755
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:15,340
that's what

3756
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:17,340
that's what NFTs are for

3757
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:19,340
they're for bilking money out of suckers and like

3758
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:21,340
I'm sure that that's exactly what they did

3759
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:23,340
like there's no reason to think

3760
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:25,340
that this is like a fraud like no

3761
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:27,340
yeah I'm officially at the point

3762
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:29,340
it's so hard to resist making fun of NFTs

3763
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,340
we just we just have to live with it

3764
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:33,340
but they get more powerful every time

3765
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:35,340
you pay attention to them like the monsters

3766
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:37,340
and that one episode of The Simpsons

3767
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:39,340
you know the thing that's really annoying

3768
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,340
is like people making like intentionally

3769
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:43,340
like oh god

3770
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,340
thinking NFTs on purpose to piss people off

3771
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:47,340
and people just take the bait

3772
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:49,340
I was like how could you get mad at this

3773
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:51,340
that one I could tell

3774
02:16:51,340 --> 02:16:53,340
that one was so transparently

3775
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:55,340
they couldn't even get mad because it was so

3776
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:57,340
pathetically like scummy

3777
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:59,340
it was like they want me to get mad at this

3778
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:01,340
like that would be winning for them

3779
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:03,340
yeah but people keep

3780
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:05,340
posting about it anyway like they don't

3781
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:07,340
it's the same thing with the George Floyd one too

3782
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,340
right right

3783
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:11,340
at least all the video game ones are failing

3784
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:13,340
like the Ubisoft

3785
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:15,340
all these big companies just try to jump in

3786
02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:17,340
they're so stupid

3787
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:19,340
but like they don't know how to do it

3788
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:21,340
they're stupid

3789
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,340
you mean like

3790
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,340
like in-game NFT transactions

3791
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:27,340
Ubisoft did something with Rainbow Six

3792
02:17:27,340 --> 02:17:29,340
where they put NFTs in it and they sold like

3793
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:31,340
absolutely terribly and like

3794
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:33,340
people worked out and the minting cost was like

3795
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:35,340
800 times what they made

3796
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:37,340
they just don't

3797
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,340
they just don't add anything

3798
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:41,340
and there's the game

3799
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:43,340
stalker and they were going to use NFTs

3800
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:45,340
to help fund the rest of the development

3801
02:17:45,340 --> 02:17:47,340
they had to walk that back

3802
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:49,340
yeah everyone screamed at them and they

3803
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:51,340
walked it back and it was like yeah good

3804
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:53,340
it turned out screaming at corporations works

3805
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:57,340
the guy who played Al

3806
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,340
Borland in Home Improvement

3807
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:01,340
he was going to do like audio

3808
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:03,340
NFTs

3809
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,340
and then everyone screamed at him and he was like

3810
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:07,340
hey sorry

3811
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:09,340
I guess I won't I didn't mean anything

3812
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:11,340
by it and it was great

3813
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:13,340
I do feel a little bad for some of these boomers

3814
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:15,340
and people who just don't they just don't understand

3815
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:17,340
the internet let alone NFTs

3816
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:19,340
and someone's just like hey we can make a lot of money with this thing

3817
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:21,340
you know

3818
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,340
he obviously didn't know

3819
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,340
like what people were mad at him for

3820
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:27,340
right

3821
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:29,340
someone just came to him

3822
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:31,340
and said like hey what if you

3823
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:33,340
did some voice recordings and we'll

3824
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:35,340
do it on this thing called the blockchain and you'll

3825
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:37,340
get paid and he was like

3826
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:39,340
sure

3827
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:41,340
some people like meet Canyon

3828
02:18:41,340 --> 02:18:43,340
did NFTs and sold them and made money

3829
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:45,340
but like when they were like brand new

3830
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:47,340
like that was like a meat like as soon as I learned about NFTs

3831
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,340
I saw those and like now they're on record being like

3832
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:51,340
uh yeah we kind of we're not going to do that again

3833
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:53,340
and stuff

3834
02:18:53,340 --> 02:18:55,340
yeah psychic pebbles did that

3835
02:18:55,340 --> 02:18:57,340
and the other guy that's working on a tv show

3836
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:59,340
right oh god smiling friends that's like

3837
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,340
today too isn't it

3838
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:03,340
is that today I think so I think it's today

3839
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:05,340
if it's not today it's like this week

3840
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,340
this regard attack on Titan smiling friends

3841
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:09,340
exactly

3842
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:11,340
is that like is that like airing like

3843
02:19:11,340 --> 02:19:13,340
for the first time like today yeah

3844
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:15,340
the first like actual episode not pilot

3845
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:17,340
oh right yeah I was gonna say I don't know

3846
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:19,340
oh

3847
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:21,340
yeah I've seen um I've seen

3848
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:23,340
it like gifts of it around

3849
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:25,340
I like the pilot I thought it was pretty good

3850
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,340
and I was like I already I had already coped with

3851
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,340
the fact that we wasn't gonna get picked up because it was like a year after

3852
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:31,340
the pilot before they announced it was picked up

3853
02:19:31,340 --> 02:19:33,340
I had a feeling it was gonna get picked up the whole time

3854
02:19:33,340 --> 02:19:35,340
it should

3855
02:19:35,340 --> 02:19:37,340
like it didn't make sense for them not to because it was so popular online

3856
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,340
and it was really good but you know you never

3857
02:19:39,340 --> 02:19:41,340
know what these fucking companies will do

3858
02:19:43,340 --> 02:19:45,340
I don't really know what I think about psychic pebbles

3859
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:47,340
I think I've seen like hellbenders

3860
02:19:47,340 --> 02:19:49,340
and that was like

3861
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,340
alright I'm gonna be honest

3862
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:53,340
did he do with the hellbenders

3863
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:55,340
I didn't think anything he ever made was fun

3864
02:19:55,340 --> 02:19:57,340
I never I don't know anything about the leech pilot

3865
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:59,340
only plays or psychic pebbles I've never seen

3866
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:01,340
any of that shit smiling pet smiling friends was my first

3867
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:03,340
like introduction I was like hey it's pretty good

3868
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:05,340
yeah

3869
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:07,340
that was the only thing they

3870
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:09,340
that was the only thing they made

3871
02:20:09,340 --> 02:20:11,340
that I enjoyed

3872
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:13,340
he's a

3873
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:15,340
newgrounds animator boy

3874
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:17,340
and he's got a very distinctive voice

3875
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:19,340
and he's very funny

3876
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:21,340
I like his Trump impression

3877
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:23,340
I recommend one of

3878
02:20:23,340 --> 02:20:25,340
one of these guys I forgot where

3879
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:27,340
I recommend like only plays compilations of just psychic

3880
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:29,340
pebbles saying funny shit

3881
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:31,340
because it is very funny

3882
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:33,340
I don't even know about these guys at all

3883
02:20:33,340 --> 02:20:35,340
because I don't like watch any only play stuff

3884
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:37,340
but I always like like you know only plays

3885
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,340
animated like you know I love to see little animated

3886
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:41,340
clips of things so I've seen like exposure from that

3887
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:43,340
and you know

3888
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:45,340
I don't even know why or how

3889
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:47,340
let's place are still a thing but I guess

3890
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:49,340
there's a few people carrying on the torch

3891
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:51,340
because I mean Game Grumps is technically still going

3892
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:53,340
but I don't know how many people are watching that

3893
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:55,340
Game Grumps is ten years old

3894
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:57,340
did you know that Jesus Christ

3895
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:59,340
it's so funny to me how like John was on

3896
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:01,340
one year but like

3897
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:03,340
that cast such a big shadow over the rest of the show

3898
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:05,340
like you know it's been like

3899
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:07,340
Aaron and Danny for nine years now

3900
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:09,340
but people are still like oh I remember

3901
02:21:09,340 --> 02:21:11,340
fucking the original series of the original

3902
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:13,340
episodes of Game Grumps

3903
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:15,340
yeah that's the only time I ever

3904
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:17,340
watched it so obviously that sticks

3905
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,340
out the most

3906
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:21,340
yeah I mean I didn't obviously I didn't

3907
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:23,340
stick with watching it but like when I did watch

3908
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:25,340
it it was like you know

3909
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:27,340
yeah it was about like one year and one year

3910
02:21:27,340 --> 02:21:29,340
so it feels in my

3911
02:21:29,340 --> 02:21:31,340
memory like it was like half John

3912
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:33,340
and half Danny

3913
02:21:33,340 --> 02:21:35,340
not even close

3914
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:37,340
anymore

3915
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:39,340
now there are people who are born

3916
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:41,340
who can vote feel old yet

3917
02:21:41,340 --> 02:21:43,340
I thought you were like saying that like you know people say that as like a joke

3918
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,340
but like that could literally be true which is

3919
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:47,340
fucked up

3920
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:49,340
probably not that many

3921
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,340
in your old post John

3922
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:53,340
but there's probably at least some

3923
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:55,340
you'd be surprised

3924
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:57,340
at least a few

3925
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:59,340
I think we mentioned this before

3926
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:01,340
or something but

3927
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:03,340
peep kids these days say oh I want to be a YouTuber when I grow up

3928
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:05,340
that's so fucked up

3929
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:07,340
now kids are going to be saying I want to be an NFT

3930
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:09,340
when I grow up

3931
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:11,340
they have higher aspirations

3932
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:13,340
I want to sell my NFTs on tiktok when I grow up

3933
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:15,340
what the fuck is a YouTube

3934
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:17,340
go outside play with sticks and stones

3935
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:19,340
go outside play with sticks and stones

3936
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:21,340
and break your bones

3937
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:23,340
please

3938
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:25,340
no choice but to be on the web

3939
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:27,340
3.0

3940
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:29,340
we got to upload our consciousness to the

3941
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:31,340
blockchain

3942
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:33,340
what would it have been like if

3943
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:35,340
COVID happened when we were kids

3944
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:37,340
that's weird to think about

3945
02:22:39,340 --> 02:22:41,340
I don't want to talk to you

3946
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:43,340
I don't want to have done so much reading

3947
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:49,340
they're so literate right now

3948
02:22:49,340 --> 02:22:51,340
I don't even want to think

3949
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:53,340
about it

3950
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:55,340
probably nothing would have

3951
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,340
changed for me

3952
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:59,340
except I would have gotten COVID

3953
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,340
several times and my brain would have been shrunken

3954
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:03,340
I am very excited for being

3955
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:05,340
an old man and saying I lived through the pandemic

3956
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:09,340
no that's depressing

3957
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:11,340
I hate that

3958
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:13,340
I don't want fucking

3959
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:15,340
what?

3960
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:17,340
explain what life was like

3961
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:19,340
to my grandchildren

3962
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:21,340
we didn't go outside

3963
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:23,340
and then they'll be like

3964
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:25,340
we know

3965
02:23:25,340 --> 02:23:27,340
the pandemic is still happening

3966
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:29,340
I don't want

3967
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:31,340
to think about it

3968
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:33,340
I died during the pandemic

3969
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:35,340
this is what it looks like when you're dead

3970
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:37,340
in the future

3971
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,340
when I'm old

3972
02:23:39,340 --> 02:23:41,340
and kids ask me

3973
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:43,340
what was it like

3974
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:45,340
in 2015

3975
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:47,340
I'll be like

3976
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:49,340
whatever it sucked

3977
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:51,340
who cares

3978
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:53,340
let's just

3979
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:55,340
put on our VR headsets

3980
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:57,340
and play some NFT games

3981
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:59,340
whatever we're doing

3982
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:01,340
who cares about the past

3983
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:03,340
what's going to happen

3984
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:05,340
as soon as it's already happened

3985
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:07,340
2078

3986
02:24:07,340 --> 02:24:09,340
daddy

3987
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:11,340
grandpa

3988
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:13,340
what's this book

3989
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:15,340
your face goes red

3990
02:24:15,340 --> 02:24:17,340
bitch Trixie

3991
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:19,340
I'm gonna fucking tell you about this

3992
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:21,340
a single tear

3993
02:24:21,340 --> 02:24:23,340
of rage

3994
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:27,340
fist clenched

3995
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:29,340
my robot fist clenched

3996
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,340
because I got

3997
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:33,340
you do the dangles when you clench your fist so hard

3998
02:24:33,340 --> 02:24:35,340
that your hand starts bleeding

3999
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,340
and you're so fucking angry

4000
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:39,340
that'll be

4001
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:41,340
that'll be like two years from now

4002
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:43,340
I'll be like

4003
02:24:43,340 --> 02:24:45,340
I'll snap my walking stick

4004
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:47,340
I'll throw my crutches

4005
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:49,340
out the window

4006
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:51,340
my walker

4007
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:53,340
the fucking image of clenching your fist so hard

4008
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:55,340
that they both completely explode

4009
02:24:57,340 --> 02:24:59,340
that's a great visual gag

4010
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,340
that's what Trunks does

4011
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:03,340
fingers go through your palms

4012
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:05,340
and out the back

4013
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:07,340
blood everywhere

4014
02:25:09,340 --> 02:25:11,340
delightful

4015
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:15,340
I guess

4016
02:25:15,340 --> 02:25:17,340
did we talk about

4017
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,340
the new episode of the

4018
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:21,340
Tails gets trolled audio

4019
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:23,340
yeah I was gonna say

4020
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:25,340
after I mentioned my low tax video

4021
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:27,340
I was like shilling successfully

4022
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:29,340
completed but I was like

4023
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:31,340
we should also talk about Tails gets trolled briefly

4024
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:33,340
cuz yeah we were both in that

4025
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:35,340
weren't we Ben

4026
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:37,340
yeah I did not know you were in that

4027
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:39,340
why do you think I put

4028
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:41,340
the voice of Tom from Tom and Jerry

4029
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:43,340
in my Twitter profile

4030
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:45,340
wait is it?

4031
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:47,340
he was in the last episode too

4032
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:49,340
which came out last year

4033
02:25:49,340 --> 02:25:51,340
they make one episode a year

4034
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:53,340
yeah it's a little slow

4035
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:55,340
but uh

4036
02:25:55,340 --> 02:25:57,340
puke does a great job

4037
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:59,340
or um

4038
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:01,340
whatever

4039
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:03,340
I guess I could call him puke when I'm relating

4040
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:05,340
to the TGT stuff because he still credits himself

4041
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,340
is that in the credits

4042
02:26:07,340 --> 02:26:09,340
it was well edited and it had some nice little

4043
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:11,340
nice little voice like effects

4044
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:13,340
on there like my voice had

4045
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:15,340
a cool like reverb on it

4046
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:17,340
it was like that sounds great

4047
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:19,340
when he told me you were gonna be

4048
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:21,340
a voice in it I thought you were just gonna use

4049
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:23,340
your normal voice

4050
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:25,340
no well I mean

4051
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:27,340
you'd say hello my children

4052
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:29,340
I am Ben St

4053
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:31,340
and I will give you satanic powers

4054
02:26:31,340 --> 02:26:33,340
well he um

4055
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:35,340
yeah it's really funny

4056
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:37,340
I mean Cybershell

4057
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:39,340
you just talked normal

4058
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:41,340
but like your voice

4059
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:43,340
but like you're voicing Tom so like

4060
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:45,340
why wouldn't you just talk like a normal guy

4061
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:47,340
like Tom

4062
02:26:47,340 --> 02:26:49,340
well sort of the joke is that Tom doesn't like

4063
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:51,340
he doesn't have a voice unless you count that

4064
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:53,340
you know the god awful movie or whatever

4065
02:26:53,340 --> 02:26:55,340
but does anyone really want me to like do an impression of Tom from the movie

4066
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:57,340
well actually

4067
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:59,340
actually puke uh showed me

4068
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:01,340
the normal voice actor tried voicing

4069
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:03,340
Tom at first and it actually sounded like Cybershell's voice

4070
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:05,340
that's just

4071
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:07,340
I'm sorry I mean I know there's actually some people

4072
02:27:07,340 --> 02:27:09,340
in the comments are like

4073
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:11,340
it took me out of it just hearing Cybershell

4074
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:13,340
because it's just like his voice

4075
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:15,340
you know what I mean and it's sort of a

4076
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:17,340
easy to recognize voice but I'm like

4077
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:19,340
I'm sorry that's just what Tom sounds like

4078
02:27:19,340 --> 02:27:21,340
that's just what he canonically sounds like

4079
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:23,340
in every canon

4080
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,340
yeah I mean that's what the voice actor

4081
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:27,340
made him sound like so

4082
02:27:27,340 --> 02:27:29,340
I was thinking you should take it up with him

4083
02:27:29,340 --> 02:27:31,340
I was thinking like um

4084
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:33,340
I was thinking like Darn

4085
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:35,340
I wish I had more lines

4086
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:37,340
and then I saw

4087
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:39,340
right because I was the voice of Satan

4088
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:41,340
who only appears

4089
02:27:41,340 --> 02:27:43,340
basically in that one scene

4090
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:45,340
when they drink the blood

4091
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:47,340
in the ritual in the church

4092
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:49,340
wow

4093
02:27:49,340 --> 02:27:51,340
but then

4094
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:53,340
I saw the new page

4095
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:55,340
and the new page features

4096
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:57,340
Satan's back

4097
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:59,340
Satan comes back for a big fucking

4098
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:01,340
awesome

4099
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:03,340
scene which rules

4100
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:05,340
yeah I feel bad I forgot

4101
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:07,340
the artist name but that latest page is

4102
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:09,340
fucking awesome

4103
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:11,340
the artist is Rokinot

4104
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,340
that one's so good

4105
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:15,340
so I can't wait to like 10 years

4106
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:17,340
from now voice that

4107
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:19,340
dialogue that would be very

4108
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:21,340
I was looking at some

4109
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:23,340
Tom lines from like chapter like

4110
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:25,340
14 or 16 I can't remember

4111
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:27,340
and being like damn someday

4112
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:29,340
I'll get to voice these I can't wait

4113
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:31,340
yeah that would be good shit

4114
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:33,340
oh the porn the porn argue

4115
02:28:33,340 --> 02:28:35,340
yeah there's some funny lines

4116
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:37,340
like Tom only is relevant for the next

4117
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:39,340
like 3 or 4 chapters

4118
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:41,340
and then I don't know if he says

4119
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:43,340
anything after that

4120
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:45,340
I'm not since I'm the tgt

4121
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:47,340
expert I'll tell you he appears

4122
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,340
until chapter 16

4123
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:51,340
and then stops appearing until

4124
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:53,340
like chapter 23

4125
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:55,340
I just don't even know if he said anything

4126
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,340
since Sylvester has died spoiler alert

4127
02:28:57,340 --> 02:28:59,340
you know should read tales gets trolled

4128
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:01,340
yeah

4129
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:03,340
we're doing we're doing really well with releasing

4130
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:05,340
the new page yeah you're actually on like a

4131
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:07,340
pretty consistent schedule which is just like

4132
02:29:07,340 --> 02:29:09,340
crazy for tales gets trolled you know what I mean

4133
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:11,340
hmm yeah

4134
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:13,340
aside from

4135
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:15,340
the one year when laser bot was

4136
02:29:15,340 --> 02:29:17,340
making a new page every day

4137
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:19,340
I asked him I asked the guy

4138
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:21,340
if he would have if he like

4139
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:23,340
had any more

4140
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:25,340
like voices he needed I told I would totally voice

4141
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:27,340
another one it would be funny if he

4142
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:29,340
just gave me like a more like normal character

4143
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:31,340
that I could just talk in my normal

4144
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:33,340
voice

4145
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:35,340
I'm sure I mean I'm sure there's got to be

4146
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:37,340
I'm sure more characters pop up later

4147
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:39,340
I don't know there's plenty if you just

4148
02:29:39,340 --> 02:29:41,340
want a small character they could just give you like a troll

4149
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:43,340
just some random troll who shows up

4150
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:45,340
but I'm sure there's also that would be funny

4151
02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:47,340
yeah I think I think the next

4152
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:49,340
chapter is when knuckles

4153
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:51,340
goes to the troll camp and smokes weed

4154
02:29:51,340 --> 02:29:53,340
with the random trolls

4155
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:55,340
there might be some good

4156
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:57,340
good voices in there

4157
02:29:57,340 --> 02:29:59,340
very funny

4158
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:01,340
it's great

4159
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:03,340
yeah

4160
02:30:03,340 --> 02:30:05,340
my plan was to get high and I did

4161
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:09,340
and I voiced

4162
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:11,340
yeah I was Satan but I was also one of the cultists

4163
02:30:11,340 --> 02:30:13,340
who has like two lines

4164
02:30:13,340 --> 02:30:15,340
and I just did like a stupid

4165
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:17,340
that scene is so funny to me the way like

4166
02:30:17,340 --> 02:30:19,340
laser bot like he names every character

4167
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:21,340
but then they all just immediately

4168
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:23,340
there was no point in giving them names

4169
02:30:23,340 --> 02:30:25,340
I think the one I did

4170
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:27,340
was Bob

4171
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:29,340
he's just

4172
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:31,340
there to deliver like

4173
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:33,340
one line about the church

4174
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:35,340
oh wait no that's Kevin

4175
02:30:35,340 --> 02:30:37,340
there's one of them who says what the gently caresses

4176
02:30:37,340 --> 02:30:39,340
with that

4177
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:41,340
because that's something awful

4178
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:43,340
but he doesn't say

4179
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:45,340
I don't know if laser bot was making

4180
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:47,340
a something awful reference

4181
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:49,340
like he thought this will be cute because

4182
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:51,340
that's where they found the comic or he

4183
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:53,340
he might have actually just thought

4184
02:30:53,340 --> 02:30:55,340
that's something people say

4185
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:57,340
that was a word filter

4186
02:30:57,340 --> 02:30:59,340
if you don't have a something awful account

4187
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:01,340
and you see someone say fuck in a post

4188
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:03,340
it auto word filters to gently caress

4189
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:05,340
for non account holders

4190
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:07,340
he might have just thought people talked like that

4191
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:09,340
he might have

4192
02:31:09,340 --> 02:31:11,340
but he didn't say gently caress

4193
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:13,340
he said gently cares right

4194
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:15,340
he said gently cares

4195
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:17,340
I don't think he knows what caress meant

4196
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:19,340
I love all the little typos

4197
02:31:19,340 --> 02:31:21,340
and little things like that

4198
02:31:21,340 --> 02:31:23,340
it adds so much flavor and texture to the comic

4199
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:25,340
yeah it bothers me

4200
02:31:25,340 --> 02:31:27,340
because the song

4201
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,340
which is probably my favorite song

4202
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:31,340
the one that J Flay made

4203
02:31:31,340 --> 02:31:33,340
for that chapter

4204
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:35,340
he pronounces it as gently caress

4205
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:37,340
when it's gently cares

4206
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:39,340
he didn't know the correct word

4207
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:41,340
I was disappointed to see that he

4208
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:43,340
correctly pronounced the word

4209
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:45,340
that was spelled differently

4210
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:47,340
I was

4211
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:49,340
what's the line

4212
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:51,340
he usually does pronounce them

4213
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:53,340
incorrectly

4214
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:55,340
as they're written

4215
02:31:55,340 --> 02:31:57,340
sometimes I feel like you have to find a balance

4216
02:31:57,340 --> 02:31:59,340
and sometimes you do have to read out the funny

4217
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:01,340
typo

4218
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:03,340
sometimes I will like

4219
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:05,340
if it's like confusing or something

4220
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:07,340
I'll try and just make it understandable at least

4221
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:09,340
well laser bot himself

4222
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:11,340
pronounced because

4223
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:13,340
when they read his comic

4224
02:32:13,340 --> 02:32:15,340
and put it in apostrophe and isle

4225
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:17,340
they pronounce it as ill

4226
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:19,340
but laser bot voiced his own comic

4227
02:32:19,340 --> 02:32:21,340
one of the comics

4228
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:23,340
or one of the pages was like an animation

4229
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:25,340
that he did

4230
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:27,340
and he pronounced like everything correctly

4231
02:32:27,340 --> 02:32:29,340
so

4232
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:31,340
yeah it's an artistic debate to be had for sure

4233
02:32:33,340 --> 02:32:35,340
the last line

4234
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:37,340
Satan says is

4235
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:39,340
I will give you one day

4236
02:32:39,340 --> 02:32:41,340
to require these requirements

4237
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:43,340
that's so fucking funny

4238
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:49,340
oh god

4239
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:51,340
that was also like the first instance

4240
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:53,340
of laser bot ever using capital letters

4241
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:55,340
in the comic

4242
02:32:55,340 --> 02:32:57,340
that's funny

4243
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:59,340
yeah well historic

4244
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:01,340
I don't know why they just use that

4245
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:03,340
for that one line

4246
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:05,340
Satan's the only one

4247
02:33:07,340 --> 02:33:09,340
so that was

4248
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:11,340
the entire chapter 16

4249
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:13,340
it was a highlight of my week

4250
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:19,340
what's everyone been up to

4251
02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:23,340
I've been drunk this whole time

4252
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,340
I've been rewatching game of thrones

4253
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:27,340
oh wow

4254
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:29,340
game of thrones

4255
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:31,340
how far are you into game of thrones

4256
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:33,340
I've watched it all before

4257
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:35,340
but I'm rewatching the first

4258
02:33:35,340 --> 02:33:37,340
I just finished the third season

4259
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:39,340
and

4260
02:33:39,340 --> 02:33:41,340
those first four seasons are great

4261
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:43,340
they really are great tv

4262
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:45,340
because they still have the books to work off

4263
02:33:45,340 --> 02:33:47,340
oh there's so many good little things in there

4264
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:49,340
real shame but it ended

4265
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:51,340
there's so much good stuff in those first four seasons

4266
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:53,340
I never saw the end

4267
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:55,340
I fell off watching it at like

4268
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:57,340
you got lucky

4269
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,340
game of thrones is just

4270
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:01,340
like an anime because they had to make up

4271
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:03,340
retarded filler

4272
02:34:03,340 --> 02:34:05,340
straight up a full metal alchemist scenario

4273
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:07,340
where they just had to come up with their own shit

4274
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:09,340
except unlike that

4275
02:34:09,340 --> 02:34:11,340
George R. R. Martin will never finish the books

4276
02:34:11,340 --> 02:34:13,340
yeah

4277
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:15,340
unlike that the filler they came up with

4278
02:34:15,340 --> 02:34:17,340
for full metal alchemist is just better

4279
02:34:17,340 --> 02:34:19,340
than the actual source material

4280
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:21,340
sorry not sorry

4281
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:27,340
some people do think that

4282
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:29,340
my partner probably agrees with you

4283
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:31,340
that actually happens

4284
02:34:31,340 --> 02:34:33,340
because I was looking at

4285
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:35,340
I was looking at a few clips on youtube

4286
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:37,340
before I decided to start rewatching the show

4287
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:39,340
and there was that one

4288
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:41,340
where Charles dance

4289
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:43,340
Tywin Lannister

4290
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:45,340
is gutting the

4291
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:47,340
the stag on the table and he's telling

4292
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:49,340
Jamie you're a fucking idiot for killing Ned Stark

4293
02:34:49,340 --> 02:34:51,340
isn't that his first scene

4294
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:53,340
that's the first scene with Tywin Lannister

4295
02:34:55,340 --> 02:34:57,340
he was such a good character dude

4296
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:59,340
Tywin

4297
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:01,340
apparently that scene

4298
02:35:01,340 --> 02:35:03,340
was written by

4299
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:05,340
D&D

4300
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:07,340
for the show it wasn't in the books

4301
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:09,340
there is actually

4302
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:11,340
some good filler in the first four seasons

4303
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:13,340
that they made up

4304
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:15,340
and it makes the

4305
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:17,340
the ending of the show

4306
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:19,340
a little more strange

4307
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:21,340
I'm kind of curious to see how

4308
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:23,340
cause like

4309
02:35:23,340 --> 02:35:25,340
so early on in like

4310
02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:27,340
the march south to King's Landing

4311
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:29,340
who if you know

4312
02:35:29,340 --> 02:35:31,340
Bruce Bolton

4313
02:35:31,340 --> 02:35:33,340
like what happens

4314
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:35,340
with him and his busted son

4315
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:37,340
it's like

4316
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:39,340
I know he's a villain

4317
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:41,340
but he seems like just a regular

4318
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:43,340
who cares kind of guy in the background

4319
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:45,340
and so rewatching it is like

4320
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:47,340
oh they're actually

4321
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:49,340
doing things they're actually like making little hints

4322
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:51,340
here and there

4323
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:53,340
it's great there's so much packed into

4324
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:55,340
even just the first episode

4325
02:35:55,340 --> 02:35:57,340
it's great for

4326
02:35:57,340 --> 02:35:59,340
for world building it's great for character development

4327
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:01,340
I think there's like a line in the first episode

4328
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:03,340
where it's like they throw

4329
02:36:03,340 --> 02:36:05,340
he's just like oh yeah you

4330
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:07,340
what's your name barriced on Darien you go do this

4331
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:09,340
and he's like okay and then like yeah that like

4332
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,340
comes up like two three seasons later you actually

4333
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:13,340
meet that guy and he's like a kind of important character

4334
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:15,340
and it's just like there's a lot of little things that

4335
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:17,340
yeah the first time watching it

4336
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:19,340
not only did I watch Game of Thrones you know like

4337
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:21,340
you know not binge watch it I watch it

4338
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:23,340
like basically as it came out year by year

4339
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:25,340
so that's like a different way to experience a show

4340
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:27,340
versus like actually just going through it again

4341
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:29,340
because you can really notice all like the plot

4342
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:31,340
threads that they like lay down

4343
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:33,340
and you can like notice the ones that like

4344
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:35,340
that doesn't go anywhere they never brought that back up again

4345
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:37,340
you know what I mean

4346
02:36:37,340 --> 02:36:39,340
man uh

4347
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:41,340
Cracking Tilly Game of Thrones

4348
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:43,340
the show there's just not enough

4349
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:45,340
heraldry there's not enough like

4350
02:36:47,340 --> 02:36:49,340
the books like laying on really thick

4351
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:51,340
like all of these like different houses

4352
02:36:51,340 --> 02:36:53,340
and stuff have like these very

4353
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:55,340
specific like color schemes

4354
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:57,340
and like animal motifs

4355
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:59,340
and all of the characters are described in ways

4356
02:36:59,340 --> 02:37:01,340
that like evoke the animals

4357
02:37:01,340 --> 02:37:03,340
that like their houses are based on

4358
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:05,340
and in the show it just

4359
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:07,340
that just can't you just can't do a thing

4360
02:37:07,340 --> 02:37:09,340
like that in the show

4361
02:37:09,340 --> 02:37:11,340
so they just kind of don't

4362
02:37:11,340 --> 02:37:13,340
I feel like it does

4363
02:37:13,340 --> 02:37:15,340
like the toys have like the

4364
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:17,340
the armor that looks like fish scales

4365
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:20,340
yeah a little bit

4366
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:22,340
and the Lannisters have their lion

4367
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:24,340
like stuff and

4368
02:37:24,340 --> 02:37:26,340
Ben would you prefer if there was always

4369
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:28,340
would you prefer if there was always a guy

4370
02:37:28,340 --> 02:37:30,340
stood in the background holding their flag

4371
02:37:30,340 --> 02:37:32,340
like whenever a family was holding another family

4372
02:37:32,340 --> 02:37:33,340
that would be awesome

4373
02:37:33,340 --> 02:37:35,340
up 100% of course

4374
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:37,340
why would you even ask me that

4375
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:39,340
Ben's saying himself

4376
02:37:39,340 --> 02:37:41,340
okay they have flags though

4377
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:43,340
it's just the fucking okay some of the shit

4378
02:37:43,340 --> 02:37:45,340
that like some of the shit the heraldry

4379
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:47,340
and the armor that they wear in the books

4380
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:49,340
sounds like like fucking Mecca

4381
02:37:49,340 --> 02:37:51,340
like they I think

4382
02:37:51,340 --> 02:37:53,340
Tywin Lannister has like one where he's like

4383
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:55,340
has like a full suit of armor where like he just has

4384
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:57,340
like his head is just

4385
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:59,340
it's just like an entire like lion

4386
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:01,340
he's like he's like a fully

4387
02:38:01,340 --> 02:38:03,340
like suited like golden man with like a full

4388
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:05,340
like lion head and stuff

4389
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:07,340
Ben is correct there is some cooler

4390
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,340
shit that they just had to scale down for the show

4391
02:38:09,340 --> 02:38:11,340
like even the iron throne is supposed to be like this

4392
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:13,340
massive giant thing

4393
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:15,340
it's just like a prequel show

4394
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:17,340
it's just a fucking chair

4395
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:19,340
they're making like a prequel show

4396
02:38:19,340 --> 02:38:21,340
where they're gonna do the throne justice

4397
02:38:21,340 --> 02:38:23,340
it looks like but I don't know if it's gonna be good

4398
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:25,340
I don't know who's gonna like

4399
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:27,340
watch the prequel shows

4400
02:38:27,340 --> 02:38:29,340
I feel like every all the normies I know

4401
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:31,340
like have completely like

4402
02:38:31,340 --> 02:38:33,340
I haven't heard anyone mention Game of Thrones

4403
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:35,340
in the fucking dog's age

4404
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:37,340
seems like people who read the books would mostly be interested

4405
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:39,340
but it depends on if they got

4406
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:41,340
like actually good people to direct it

4407
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:43,340
if it's a good show then you're right it'll be fine

4408
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:45,340
we'll see

4409
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:47,340
I guess I shouldn't prejudge it

4410
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:49,340
they should do like a

4411
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:51,340
they should do like a young Sheldon and make like one about

4412
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:53,340
like Ned's start growing up

4413
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:55,340
with like old Nan

4414
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:57,340
no no it's like hundreds of years in the past

4415
02:38:57,340 --> 02:38:59,340
like

4416
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:01,340
oh then it's not even cool

4417
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:03,340
it's not even cool

4418
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:05,340
is it gonna be like pre Targaryen

4419
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:07,340
rule of Westeros

4420
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:09,340
I think it's dealing with the Targaryen stuff

4421
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:11,340
with all the dragons and shit

4422
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:13,340
seems like it could be cool

4423
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:15,340
see it's funny like

4424
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:17,340
in the show I haven't read the books

4425
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:19,340
but like the Targaryens is really

4426
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:21,340
just Daenerys

4427
02:39:21,340 --> 02:39:23,340
and her story is interesting in its

4428
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:25,340
way but I really really

4429
02:39:25,340 --> 02:39:27,340
liked all of like

4430
02:39:27,340 --> 02:39:29,340
the stupid

4431
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:31,340
house bullshit and bickering

4432
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:33,340
in King's Landing

4433
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:35,340
and the North and all of the houses

4434
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:37,340
and like marrying people off to certain

4435
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:39,340
people to get like land and stuff

4436
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:41,340
that's the interesting stuff

4437
02:39:41,340 --> 02:39:43,340
a slice of life anime for Game of Thrones

4438
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:45,340
there's

4439
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:47,340
so much more

4440
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:49,340
I still watch that YouTube channel

4441
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:51,340
that Preston Jacobs guy

4442
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:53,340
I haven't even read like half the books

4443
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:55,340
I've only read like three of them

4444
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:57,340
but I still watch that guy's channel and all

4445
02:39:57,340 --> 02:39:59,340
he's like he does

4446
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:01,340
he sort of branched out into other stuff that I'm not as interested in

4447
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:03,340
but his like

4448
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:05,340
I mean you can't blame him for branching out

4449
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:07,340
but I agree with you though

4450
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:09,340
I like the book analysis stuff even as a non-book reader

4451
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:11,340
there's some really interesting stuff

4452
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:13,340
there's so much like shit

4453
02:40:13,340 --> 02:40:15,340
there's so much shit

4454
02:40:15,340 --> 02:40:17,340
in the books that are like

4455
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:19,340
all these like minor characters

4456
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:21,340
have such like specific like heraldry

4457
02:40:21,340 --> 02:40:23,340
associated with them and Preston can take that

4458
02:40:23,340 --> 02:40:25,340
and be like oh okay

4459
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:27,340
so we can actually like this guy if you think about it

4460
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:29,340
you can actually be like oh

4461
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:31,340
we can like kind of figure out this guy's entire

4462
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:33,340
like parentage and like the whole

4463
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:35,340
like bloodline that he's from

4464
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:37,340
and like therefore like how does he

4465
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:39,340
how does he probably feel

4466
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:41,340
about like

4467
02:40:41,340 --> 02:40:43,340
maesters and dragons and

4468
02:40:43,340 --> 02:40:45,340
you know like which side would he

4469
02:40:45,340 --> 02:40:47,340
probably prefer in this

4470
02:40:47,340 --> 02:40:49,340
you know is he a religious

4471
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:51,340
is he from a religious family

4472
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:53,340
does he support like the iron

4473
02:40:53,340 --> 02:40:55,340
woods or the other guys

4474
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:57,340
from Dorn

4475
02:40:57,340 --> 02:40:59,340
you know like they've all got

4476
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:01,340
all these associations with them

4477
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:03,340
and it's there's just a lot

4478
02:41:03,340 --> 02:41:05,340
there's a lot of that stuff

4479
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:07,340
and I feel stupid even

4480
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:09,340
saying it like and it doesn't they had

4481
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:11,340
cut it all from the show like like of course it doesn't

4482
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:13,340
all make it into the show because the books are

4483
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:15,340
like seven of them and they're each like

4484
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:17,340
thousands of pages long

4485
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:19,340
so like yeah the books are so dense

4486
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:21,340
there's so much going on every page

4487
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:23,340
genuinely so many words

4488
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:25,340
there's so many wordles

4489
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:27,340
it's like a fucking that that reminds

4490
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:29,340
me they're making a fucking wheel of

4491
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:31,340
time show

4492
02:41:31,340 --> 02:41:33,340
of those books

4493
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:35,340
wheel of time

4494
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:37,340
I remember that

4495
02:41:37,340 --> 02:41:39,340
I used to read those books when I was in

4496
02:41:39,340 --> 02:41:41,340
like sixth grade

4497
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:43,340
I was I love that shit

4498
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:45,340
I read a couple of them

4499
02:41:45,340 --> 02:41:47,340
and I just got too dense

4500
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:49,340
the show looks kind of goofy

4501
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:51,340
it looks kind of goofy kind of

4502
02:41:51,340 --> 02:41:53,340
a lot of CGI magic

4503
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:55,340
sparkly stuff and I'm like

4504
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:57,340
huh there's not the vibe I remember from the books

4505
02:41:57,340 --> 02:41:59,340
the books

4506
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:01,340
I'm a little curious

4507
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:05,340
wheel of time show

4508
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:07,340
let me just find some screenshots here to

4509
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:15,340
people in the woods

4510
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:17,340
looks medieval

4511
02:42:17,340 --> 02:42:19,340
guys in white robes

4512
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:23,340
I'm getting like nothing

4513
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:25,340
I'm getting like no impression

4514
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:27,340
of anything in these pictures

4515
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:29,340
I feel nothing

4516
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:31,340
okay never mind I've lost interest

4517
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:33,340
exactly

4518
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:35,340
the only adaptation of wheel of time

4519
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:37,340
that is worth anything is the song

4520
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:39,340
by blind guardian that song slaps

4521
02:42:39,340 --> 02:42:41,340
is it about

4522
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:43,340
the books

4523
02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:45,340
yeah it's a song

4524
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:47,340
blind guardian are like this like

4525
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:49,340
symphonic like metal

4526
02:42:49,340 --> 02:42:51,340
I've heard blind guardian before

4527
02:42:51,340 --> 02:42:53,340
they made a song about wheel of time

4528
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:55,340
and it's probably their best song

4529
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:57,340
and one of the best

4530
02:42:57,340 --> 02:42:59,340
metal songs I've heard ever

4531
02:42:59,340 --> 02:43:01,340
it's really good

4532
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:03,340
really good shit

4533
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:05,340
I used to get so excited about

4534
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:07,340
TV adaptations of like

4535
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:09,340
things I had read and like oh dude

4536
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:11,340
I can't wait there's gonna be the TV show

4537
02:43:11,340 --> 02:43:13,340
it's gonna be so epic now I'm like

4538
02:43:13,340 --> 02:43:15,340
I don't care or I actively dislike it

4539
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:17,340
like recently why the last man is a comic

4540
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:19,340
series I haven't read in a long time

4541
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:21,340
I remember really enjoying it back in the day

4542
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:23,340
oh for years I remember

4543
02:43:23,340 --> 02:43:25,340
oh I wish they'd make a show on this

4544
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:27,340
oh I'd be so cool oh I wish they'd make a show on this

4545
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:29,340
and like last year they made a show and I was like

4546
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:31,340
whatever I didn't even watch it

4547
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:33,340
they got cancelled after one season

4548
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:35,340
I was hype as a child

4549
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:37,340
when I heard they were making

4550
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:39,340
an Animorphs TV series

4551
02:43:39,340 --> 02:43:41,340
and I don't know if you've ever seen the Animorphs TV series

4552
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:43,340
it's like

4553
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:45,340
legendarily shit

4554
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:47,340
I can only imagine

4555
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:49,340
it would be so hard to make a good animated

4556
02:43:49,340 --> 02:43:51,340
it would be so hard to make a good Animorphs show

4557
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:53,340
I feel like

4558
02:43:53,340 --> 02:43:55,340
it didn't even look good as a kid

4559
02:43:55,340 --> 02:43:57,340
I can't I don't even want to see it as

4560
02:43:57,340 --> 02:43:59,340
an adult I'm like afraid of what it would

4561
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:01,340
look like to my adult eyes

4562
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:03,340
because I was in like third grade

4563
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:05,340
for that shit

4564
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:07,340
when was the first time you realized

4565
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:09,340
as a kid that movies can be bad

4566
02:44:11,340 --> 02:44:13,340
I remember probably when I was like

4567
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:15,340
three years old

4568
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:17,340
it was the first time I watched the nostalgia cringe

4569
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:19,340
yeah I liked everything I ever saw

4570
02:44:19,340 --> 02:44:21,340
until I had him explain to me

4571
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:23,340
why it was bad

4572
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:25,340
my bad credit card

4573
02:44:25,340 --> 02:44:27,340
oh god

4574
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:29,340
I saw like Harry Potter

4575
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:31,340
and Disney films and I was about it

4576
02:44:31,340 --> 02:44:33,340
I wouldn't really listen to movies

4577
02:44:33,340 --> 02:44:35,340
so I hadn't even been explaining

4578
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:37,340
how terrible

4579
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:39,340
have you guys seen kick assia

4580
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:41,340
that's a great movie

4581
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:43,340
that's legitimately

4582
02:44:43,340 --> 02:44:45,340
one of the worst movies I've ever seen

4583
02:44:45,340 --> 02:44:47,340
how many movies have you made

4584
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:49,340
that's what I thought

4585
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:51,340
the other ones are worse

4586
02:44:51,340 --> 02:44:53,340
kick assia is the best one he made

4587
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:55,340
it's the first one right

4588
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:57,340
because they get progressive

4589
02:44:57,340 --> 02:44:59,340
the second one was

4590
02:44:59,340 --> 02:45:01,340
suburban knights

4591
02:45:01,340 --> 02:45:03,340
that's one of the bullshot

4592
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:05,340
that's one we can see is big fat bulls

4593
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:07,340
oh kick assia I was thinking of kick ass

4594
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:09,340
like the

4595
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:11,340
luchin door superhero kid

4596
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:13,340
oh yeah the real life superhero

4597
02:45:13,340 --> 02:45:15,340
this is the real shit

4598
02:45:15,340 --> 02:45:17,340
way better than that

4599
02:45:17,340 --> 02:45:19,340
the thing that sucks

4600
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:21,340
about it is not even bad

4601
02:45:21,340 --> 02:45:23,340
in a funny way it's just bad

4602
02:45:23,340 --> 02:45:25,340
no it's legitimately good

4603
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:27,340
I watch it every day

4604
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:29,340
it's great insight

4605
02:45:29,340 --> 02:45:31,340
watch it like a documentary

4606
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:33,340
you're actually seeing all these internet creators

4607
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:35,340
they actually were like

4608
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:37,340
they did this they were forced to do this

4609
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:39,340
by Doug

4610
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:41,340
they were forced to do this

4611
02:45:41,340 --> 02:45:43,340
a compelling cultural

4612
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:45,340
artifact

4613
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:47,340
a sort of proto

4614
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:49,340
road to rad con

4615
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:51,340
a sort of proto plebe in the wee blu-ray

4616
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:53,340
is a movie like kick ass

4617
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:55,340
now there's a pretty meme exquisite

4618
02:45:55,340 --> 02:45:57,340
hell yeah

4619
02:45:57,340 --> 02:45:59,340
something you look at and you're like

4620
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:01,340
why

4621
02:46:01,340 --> 02:46:03,340
did anyone make this

4622
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:05,340
what's the story and you look at it and you're like

4623
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:07,340
I don't know just thinking about

4624
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:09,340
you watch something like kick assia

4625
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:11,340
which I haven't seen of course

4626
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:13,340
but I can imagine

4627
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:15,340
and you're not thinking about the story of the movie

4628
02:46:15,340 --> 02:46:17,340
you're thinking about like

4629
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:19,340
oh there's that guy I know

4630
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:21,340
him from the youtube

4631
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:23,340
what is he feeling as he's being directed

4632
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:25,340
by Doug Walker to do this fucking stupid shit

4633
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:27,340
right now

4634
02:46:27,340 --> 02:46:29,340
that's what you're supposed to think

4635
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:31,340
you can't get immersed in the world of the movie

4636
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:33,340
it's impossible

4637
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:35,340
it doesn't make any sense

4638
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:37,340
and even a hack like Doug

4639
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:39,340
probably didn't think anyone was gonna be

4640
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:41,340
immersed in the story

4641
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:43,340
he must have known

4642
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:45,340
this is a stupid... I don't know about that one

4643
02:46:45,340 --> 02:46:47,340
I think he might have really thought he was making

4644
02:46:47,340 --> 02:46:49,340
a great movie

4645
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:51,340
I feel like he knew

4646
02:46:51,340 --> 02:46:53,340
he was making a funny comedy

4647
02:46:53,340 --> 02:46:55,340
a funny comedy that's

4648
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:57,340
somewhat

4649
02:46:57,340 --> 02:46:59,340
somewhat self aware about

4650
02:46:59,340 --> 02:47:01,340
its status as a sort of

4651
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:03,340
weird artifact that exists to

4652
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:05,340
bring all these internet content creators

4653
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:07,340
together into a single

4654
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:09,340
film

4655
02:47:09,340 --> 02:47:11,340
it's a hype moment

4656
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:13,340
a legitimate hype moment for everyone who's fans of

4657
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:15,340
all these people to see a crossover

4658
02:47:15,340 --> 02:47:17,340
it's a comedy movie and it's not taking itself too seriously

4659
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:19,340
that's the first one

4660
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:21,340
to boldly flee the last one

4661
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:23,340
is way

4662
02:47:23,340 --> 02:47:25,340
more like sincere

4663
02:47:25,340 --> 02:47:27,340
it's a lore movie and Doug really thinks

4664
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:29,340
this will be a great

4665
02:47:29,340 --> 02:47:31,340
magnuopus for his

4666
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,340
nostalgia critic character and it's so

4667
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:35,340
painful

4668
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:37,340
that is absolutely right there's way more of

4669
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:39,340
understanding that

4670
02:47:39,340 --> 02:47:41,340
kickass is a silly low budget

4671
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:43,340
it's just like we're all on screen at the same time

4672
02:47:43,340 --> 02:47:45,340
isn't that funny

4673
02:47:45,340 --> 02:47:47,340
but by the third time they were doing it he was like

4674
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:49,340
this is epic

4675
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:51,340
you know what? fuck you

4676
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:53,340
that's what phantom's revenge is

4677
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:55,340
it's the ultimate send off

4678
02:47:55,340 --> 02:47:57,340
to a classic character

4679
02:47:57,340 --> 02:47:59,340
and fuck you if you don't think that's cool

4680
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:01,340
is the game gonna suck?

4681
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:03,340
there's no more voicemails

4682
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:05,340
or else Lin's nostalgia critic

4683
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:07,340
would have had to bring even more voicemail characters together

4684
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:09,340
and take it too seriously

4685
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:11,340
Ben saying that phantom home is the

4686
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:13,340
to boldly flee no phantom home's revenge

4687
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:15,340
is the to boldly flee of the slimy

4688
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:17,340
punishment universe is not a good thing

4689
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:19,340
it's a bold statement

4690
02:48:19,340 --> 02:48:21,340
I would absolutely describe it

4691
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:23,340
as the to boldly flee

4692
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:25,340
I hope the

4693
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:27,340
final boss is the plot

4694
02:48:27,340 --> 02:48:29,340
you know what I mean

4695
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:31,340
uh

4696
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:33,340
the fucking first

4697
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:35,340
movie I ever saw that I was like

4698
02:48:35,340 --> 02:48:37,340
oh what the fuck

4699
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:39,340
bad movies exist

4700
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:41,340
I don't actually remember how old I was

4701
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:43,340
when it came out it was spy kids freedy

4702
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:47,340
I saw it in theaters

4703
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:49,340
and I'm like this is a movie made for me

4704
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:51,340
how can you not like spy kids freedy? it has the guy in it

4705
02:48:51,340 --> 02:48:53,340
the guy

4706
02:48:53,340 --> 02:48:55,340
I didn't know who Frodo was

4707
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:57,340
at the time

4708
02:48:57,340 --> 02:48:59,340
fair enough

4709
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:01,340
I mean even aside from that

4710
02:49:01,340 --> 02:49:03,340
it was a funny scene

4711
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:05,340
I just remember

4712
02:49:05,340 --> 02:49:07,340
here's my memory

4713
02:49:07,340 --> 02:49:09,340
I walk into the movie theater

4714
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:11,340
I sit down

4715
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:13,340
the fat kid breaks his piggy bank

4716
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:15,340
on the floor

4717
02:49:15,340 --> 02:49:17,340
and then there's flashing lights and there's like a boxing glove that flies

4718
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,340
out of the screen into my face

4719
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:21,340
and then I walk out of the movie and I'm just completely

4720
02:49:21,340 --> 02:49:23,340
underwhelmed like

4721
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:25,340
I didn't have fun

4722
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:27,340
I feel like I had no fun at all

4723
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:29,340
I think that happened

4724
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:31,340
I feel like I was supposed to enjoy that

4725
02:49:31,340 --> 02:49:33,340
I think that happened with me with the second

4726
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:35,340
Narnia movie I think it was

4727
02:49:35,340 --> 02:49:37,340
we went to cinema and saw that and I was like

4728
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:39,340
oh this is uh

4729
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:41,340
wait things can be bad

4730
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:43,340
the first Narnia movie sucked

4731
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:45,340
how old were you when Narnia?

4732
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:47,340
I don't think I had even seen the first one

4733
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:49,340
I had like yeah those fucking

4734
02:49:49,340 --> 02:49:51,340
old Narnia movies exist I remember

4735
02:49:51,340 --> 02:49:53,340
seeing one of my friends

4736
02:49:53,340 --> 02:49:55,340
the TV special

4737
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:57,340
it was a TV special

4738
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:59,340
the one from the 80s

4739
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:01,340
I'm talking about the 2008 one

4740
02:50:01,340 --> 02:50:03,340
I know that's what you're talking about

4741
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:05,340
that's why I said that one sucks

4742
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:07,340
because the other one is

4743
02:50:07,340 --> 02:50:09,340
it has more hard but it's like the special effects

4744
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:11,340
are awful and terrible

4745
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:13,340
you've awakened the fucking memory in me

4746
02:50:13,340 --> 02:50:15,340
do you remember the beaver that looks

4747
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:17,340
like a cylindrical

4748
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:19,340
turd

4749
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:21,340
I only saw one of them

4750
02:50:21,340 --> 02:50:23,340
it was I think it was based on the 7th book

4751
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:25,340
or the one where if I go underground

4752
02:50:25,340 --> 02:50:27,340
or something there's like a character who like turns into a giant snake

4753
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:29,340
and like it just fades

4754
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:31,340
and there's like this fucking weird like

4755
02:50:31,340 --> 02:50:33,340
styrofoam like rubber cylinder

4756
02:50:33,340 --> 02:50:35,340
that's like supposed to be like

4757
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:37,340
some monster and it just like flops on the floor

4758
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:39,340
and I just remember laughing

4759
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:41,340
so hard I was at a friend's house

4760
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:43,340
I need to look up that clip holy fuck

4761
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:45,340
I completely forgot about it

4762
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:47,340
they never even made voyage of the Don

4763
02:50:47,340 --> 02:50:49,340
Treader the fucking cowards

4764
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:51,340
they did

4765
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:53,340
remember this one

4766
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,340
that's the one I remember

4767
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:57,340
they didn't make a movie out of it and I didn't watch it

4768
02:50:57,340 --> 02:50:59,340
well they didn't do it

4769
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:01,340
with the old

4770
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:03,340
with the old TV specials and that's how I wanted to see it

4771
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:05,340
old TV specials

4772
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:07,340
no look at her

4773
02:51:07,340 --> 02:51:09,340
they did it with a crappy nooster

4774
02:51:09,340 --> 02:51:11,340
I swear to god my parents

4775
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:13,340
read me the Narnia books

4776
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:15,340
when I was like a wee lad

4777
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:17,340
I retained almost

4778
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:19,340
zero knowledge of them

4779
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:21,340
let me tell you the one

4780
02:51:21,340 --> 02:51:23,340
literally the one plot detail I remember

4781
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:25,340
from all those books is there's a part

4782
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:27,340
where like this little rat guy

4783
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:29,340
gets on a boat

4784
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:31,340
and then he like sails off to the edge of the world

4785
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:33,340
and that's all I remember

4786
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:35,340
voyage of the Don Treader

4787
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:37,340
that's the only thing I remember from the entire series

4788
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:39,340
no was he like a dwarf

4789
02:51:39,340 --> 02:51:41,340
wasn't there a

4790
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:43,340
no there was a dwarf

4791
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:45,340
yeah

4792
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:47,340
he gets in a little

4793
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:49,340
bucket or something

4794
02:51:49,340 --> 02:51:51,340
the ship can't go any further because

4795
02:51:51,340 --> 02:51:53,340
either going to the edge of the world

4796
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:55,340
the sea becomes too shallow

4797
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:57,340
and they're like we can't go any further

4798
02:51:57,340 --> 02:51:59,340
and the mouse is like I don't care

4799
02:51:59,340 --> 02:52:01,340
I'm gonna see the edge of the world or I'm gonna die trying

4800
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:03,340
I'm gonna get in my little bucket and I'm just gonna keep going

4801
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:05,340
see ya

4802
02:52:05,340 --> 02:52:07,340
I vaguely remember that

4803
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:09,340
getting that part and I'm just like what the fuck

4804
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:11,340
this is crazy

4805
02:52:11,340 --> 02:52:13,340
voyage of the Don Treader

4806
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:15,340
fucking rules

4807
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:17,340
my mom read me

4808
02:52:17,340 --> 02:52:19,340
specifically

4809
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:21,340
the one about the line that was in the wardrobe

4810
02:52:21,340 --> 02:52:23,340
that was the only one we have

4811
02:52:23,340 --> 02:52:25,340
I do vaguely remember some from that one

4812
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:27,340
that one's an iconic classic book

4813
02:52:27,340 --> 02:52:29,340
and then I got to school

4814
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:31,340
and then we had a school library and I was like

4815
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:33,340
wait there's more Narnia books

4816
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:35,340
and I read them all

4817
02:52:35,340 --> 02:52:37,340
and they were great

4818
02:52:37,340 --> 02:52:39,340
some of them were better than others

4819
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:41,340
voyage of the Don Treader is the best one

4820
02:52:41,340 --> 02:52:43,340
and yeah

4821
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:45,340
Christian

4822
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:47,340
that's why they call me Ben Saint

4823
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:49,340
now it fucked me up forever

4824
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:51,340
voyage of the Don Treader

4825
02:52:51,340 --> 02:52:53,340
I really really loved

4826
02:52:53,340 --> 02:52:55,340
I've read it like probably seven times

4827
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:57,340
I've read all the books like at least five times

4828
02:52:57,340 --> 02:52:59,340
magicians nephew

4829
02:52:59,340 --> 02:53:01,340
I really like magicians nephew fucks

4830
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:03,340
I love the fucking dying world with like the old

4831
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:05,340
red giant son and shit

4832
02:53:05,340 --> 02:53:07,340
I like don't remember that one very well

4833
02:53:07,340 --> 02:53:09,340
I remember that one as being kind of the

4834
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:11,340
boringest one

4835
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,340
it was because I was too intellectual

4836
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:15,340
for your young brain

4837
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:17,340
I mean it probably was

4838
02:53:17,340 --> 02:53:19,340
I was probably like nine

4839
02:53:19,340 --> 02:53:21,340
so sure

4840
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:23,340
why not

4841
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:25,340
I just remember them going to this world that's like completely fucked up

4842
02:53:25,340 --> 02:53:27,340
and everything's dead and like the sun is about to explode

4843
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:29,340
and there's just this fucking

4844
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:31,340
there's this fucking bitch there who's just evil

4845
02:53:31,340 --> 02:53:33,340
and like trying to fuck everyone up

4846
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:35,340
and it's great

4847
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:37,340
there's a green ring

4848
02:53:37,340 --> 02:53:39,340
and a yellow ring

4849
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:41,340
and they can go to a magical forest

4850
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:43,340
with puddles in it

4851
02:53:43,340 --> 02:53:45,340
and that's one ring to rule the world

4852
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:47,340
nooo

4853
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:49,340
no no no

4854
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:51,340
puddles

4855
02:53:51,340 --> 02:53:53,340
forest with puddles it's like a dimension

4856
02:53:53,340 --> 02:53:55,340
of portals

4857
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:57,340
or something it's like

4858
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:59,340
the puddle dimension that sounds like something from

4859
02:53:59,340 --> 02:54:01,340
fucking unicorn jelly

4860
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:03,340
yeah it's like

4861
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:05,340
the subtle knife

4862
02:54:05,340 --> 02:54:07,340
it's like the amber spyglass when they cut holes

4863
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:09,340
in the dimension

4864
02:54:09,340 --> 02:54:11,340
oh yeah I remember those books

4865
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:13,340
those were cool books

4866
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:15,340
those were cool books

4867
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:17,340
it kind of went off the rails as it went on

4868
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:19,340
I like the second book the most

4869
02:54:19,340 --> 02:54:21,340
and then it just kind of got weird

4870
02:54:21,340 --> 02:54:23,340
the first one is all about

4871
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:25,340
this one

4872
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:27,340
this

4873
02:54:27,340 --> 02:54:29,340
the first one is like it like ends

4874
02:54:29,340 --> 02:54:31,340
with the revelation that like oh

4875
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:33,340
actually like

4876
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,340
this actually takes place in like a whole fucking

4877
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:37,340
multiverse and like everything you have

4878
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:39,340
sort of experience up until now

4879
02:54:39,340 --> 02:54:41,340
is kind of just like some bullshit that doesn't matter

4880
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:43,340
and like

4881
02:54:43,340 --> 02:54:45,340
it's just one world among many and like fuck it

4882
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:47,340
the real adventure starts now

4883
02:54:47,340 --> 02:54:49,340
and then the second book a bunch of crazy shit

4884
02:54:49,340 --> 02:54:51,340
happens and then the third one

4885
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:53,340
is like we must kill

4886
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:55,340
god and

4887
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:57,340
you know

4888
02:54:57,340 --> 02:54:59,340
yeah it's just kind of strange from there

4889
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:01,340
the weird the weird church shit

4890
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:03,340
in the third book is like

4891
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:05,340
stupid

4892
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:07,340
it's like dumb I don't know

4893
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:09,340
and then they have to

4894
02:55:09,340 --> 02:55:11,340
they kill god

4895
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:13,340
they kill god and they destroy hell

4896
02:55:13,340 --> 02:55:15,340
and they kill the big angel

4897
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:17,340
guy who's really bad

4898
02:55:17,340 --> 02:55:19,340
no they don't kill god

4899
02:55:19,340 --> 02:55:21,340
god's already dead

4900
02:55:21,340 --> 02:55:23,340
and he's worthless

4901
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:25,340
and there's a but the angel

4902
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:27,340
who is

4903
02:55:27,340 --> 02:55:29,340
basically god we kill him though

4904
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:31,340
because he sucks

4905
02:55:31,340 --> 02:55:33,340
and the church is bad and we kill them too

4906
02:55:33,340 --> 02:55:35,340
and everyone dies

4907
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:37,340
and they send him to hell but then we're like

4908
02:55:37,340 --> 02:55:39,340
fuck hell and then we kill the hell

4909
02:55:39,340 --> 02:55:41,340
wasn't he like a Christian though

4910
02:55:41,340 --> 02:55:43,340
so why would he say

4911
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:45,340
no this isn't C.S. Lewis these books were written

4912
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:47,340
by someone who's like I'm gonna be the

4913
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:49,340
anti C.S. Lewis

4914
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:51,340
I'm gonna like

4915
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:53,340
do Narnia but I'm gonna make sin

4916
02:55:53,340 --> 02:55:55,340
is good and fuck god

4917
02:55:55,340 --> 02:55:57,340
can I actually do that because it sounds like

4918
02:55:57,340 --> 02:55:59,340
he might specifically have set out to do

4919
02:55:59,340 --> 02:56:01,340
exactly that

4920
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:03,340
that book was called Shin Megami Tensei

4921
02:56:03,340 --> 02:56:05,340
my parents bought the books for me

4922
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:07,340
my parents are Christians and

4923
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:09,340
they knew that this was what the books were about

4924
02:56:09,340 --> 02:56:11,340
but they still bought them for me and said hey

4925
02:56:11,340 --> 02:56:13,340
just be aware this is what the offer is like

4926
02:56:13,340 --> 02:56:15,340
but apparently the books are good anyways so read them and I did

4927
02:56:15,340 --> 02:56:17,340
that's pretty damn nice

4928
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:19,340
pretty chill parenting

4929
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:21,340
considering most people in America are like

4930
02:56:21,340 --> 02:56:23,340
Harry Potter is the devil it'll make you Satan

4931
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:25,340
my parents were like fat like when I was really

4932
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:27,340
little and then they got over it

4933
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:29,340
cause they went to university and like studied

4934
02:56:29,340 --> 02:56:31,340
religion and were like oh yeah never mind

4935
02:56:31,340 --> 02:56:33,340
there's literally no reason to be against

4936
02:56:33,340 --> 02:56:35,340
that shit

4937
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:37,340
genuinely the

4938
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:39,340
his dark materials is just like a very

4939
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:41,340
his dark materials

4940
02:56:41,340 --> 02:56:43,340
is that what I said?

4941
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:45,340
yeah yes that's correct you just I'm just like saying it

4942
02:56:45,340 --> 02:56:47,340
cause you awakened memory

4943
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:49,340
yeah I was trying to remember it's like wait

4944
02:56:49,340 --> 02:56:51,340
Amber spyglass, subtle knife

4945
02:56:51,340 --> 02:56:53,340
uh

4946
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:55,340
no first one is golden compass

4947
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:57,340
golden compass, subtle knife, amber spyglass

4948
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:59,340
and the whole set is called his dark materials

4949
02:56:59,340 --> 02:57:01,340
the el-theometer

4950
02:57:01,340 --> 02:57:03,340
yes yes the el-ethiometer

4951
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:05,340
they dumbed it down on the title

4952
02:57:05,340 --> 02:57:07,340
I think the first book in English

4953
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:09,340
is just called the northern lights

4954
02:57:09,340 --> 02:57:11,340
yeah it is it is called the northern lights

4955
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:13,340
well that sucked I remember reading

4956
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:15,340
yeah that sucked

4957
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:17,340
that sucked shit

4958
02:57:17,340 --> 02:57:19,340
that fucking sucked ass and was terrible

4959
02:57:19,340 --> 02:57:21,340
okay well in America

4960
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:23,340
in America they called the book

4961
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:25,340
in America they called the book the golden compass

4962
02:57:25,340 --> 02:57:27,340
uh

4963
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:29,340
America always gets the dumb titles

4964
02:57:29,340 --> 02:57:31,340
no northern lights fucking sucks

4965
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:33,340
the sorcerers don't

4966
02:57:33,340 --> 02:57:35,340
children can't know what a

4967
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:37,340
philosopher is

4968
02:57:37,340 --> 02:57:39,340
okay yeah

4969
02:57:39,340 --> 02:57:41,340
that sucks obviously sorcerers

4970
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:43,340
don't sucks

4971
02:57:43,340 --> 02:57:45,340
but uh the

4972
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:47,340
northern lights doesn't even sound

4973
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:49,340
like it's about like a journey to the fucking arctic circle

4974
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:51,340
it does not sound like

4975
02:57:51,340 --> 02:57:53,340
it's about

4976
02:57:53,340 --> 02:57:55,340
yeah voraborealis

4977
02:57:55,340 --> 02:57:57,340
or in this kind of book

4978
02:57:57,340 --> 02:57:59,340
she she walked into the northern lights

4979
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:01,340
and was transported to another dimension

4980
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:03,340
delightfully devilish

4981
02:58:03,340 --> 02:58:05,340
delightfully devilish

4982
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:07,340
delightfully devilish

4983
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:09,340
the author of the author was like

4984
02:58:09,340 --> 02:58:11,340
he sat down and he's like

4985
02:58:11,340 --> 02:58:13,340
fuck C.S. Lewis I'm gonna get a little

4986
02:58:13,340 --> 02:58:15,340
delightfully devilish with my

4987
02:58:15,340 --> 02:58:17,340
with my work of secular humanism

4988
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:19,340
but what if

4989
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:21,340
I were to take Narnia and reverse the thematic

4990
02:58:21,340 --> 02:58:23,340
that would be

4991
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:25,340
you remind me of a funny

4992
02:58:25,340 --> 02:58:27,340
story from my childhood now regarding

4993
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:29,340
steamed hams and literature

4994
02:58:29,340 --> 02:58:31,340
those two things overlapped in my childhood

4995
02:58:31,340 --> 02:58:33,340
what if I made God an old bitch

4996
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:35,340
and disguised it as a work of

4997
02:58:35,340 --> 02:58:37,340
something else

4998
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:41,340
delightfully devilish

4999
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:43,340
I have to tell this story it's funny

5000
02:58:43,340 --> 02:58:45,340
when I was um

5001
02:58:45,340 --> 02:58:47,340
I was probably like 10 I was probably 10 or 11

5002
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:49,340
I saw that episode of the Simpsons and I love steamed hams

5003
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:51,340
me and my sister were like quoting at each other

5004
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:53,340
all the time we thought it was so fucking funny

5005
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:55,340
we thought it was the funniest fucking thing

5006
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:57,340
we even taped the episode on VHS

5007
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:59,340
with a blank videotape and rewatched it a bunch of times

5008
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:01,340
and then

5009
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:03,340
and then I had a creative writing assignment at school

5010
02:59:03,340 --> 02:59:05,340
I was at a tiny school there were literally

5011
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:07,340
four students after me and my sister

5012
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:09,340
joined and then later there were like seven students

5013
02:59:09,340 --> 02:59:11,340
it was the tiniest fucking school you've ever seen

5014
02:59:11,340 --> 02:59:13,340
and for my creative writing assignment

5015
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:15,340
I just transcribed steamed hams

5016
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:17,340
from memory and I failed

5017
02:59:19,340 --> 02:59:21,340
you should have

5018
02:59:21,340 --> 02:59:23,340
for plagiarism

5019
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:25,340
did your teacher know what it was

5020
02:59:25,340 --> 02:59:27,340
I don't even know if I did

5021
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:29,340
I don't think they did

5022
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:31,340
her name was Mrs. King

5023
02:59:31,340 --> 02:59:33,340
she was like the oldest

5024
02:59:33,340 --> 02:59:35,340
fuddy deadiest woman you could ever imagine

5025
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:37,340
she fought everything

5026
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:39,340
was a swear word

5027
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:41,340
like ass

5028
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:43,340
some people like you don't like the word ass

5029
02:59:43,340 --> 02:59:45,340
well she didn't like the word butt

5030
02:59:45,340 --> 02:59:47,340
and she didn't even like the word bum

5031
02:59:47,340 --> 02:59:49,340
that was considered a swear word

5032
02:59:49,340 --> 02:59:51,340
I know what you mean there's these old people who can't handle

5033
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:53,340
they can't even handle the soft swear words

5034
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:55,340
they can't even handle the soft swear word bum

5035
02:59:55,340 --> 02:59:57,340
you have to say bottom

5036
02:59:57,340 --> 02:59:59,340
and that's the only acceptable word as one example

5037
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:01,340
what exactly

5038
03:00:01,340 --> 03:00:03,340
was the assignment that you were like I know

5039
03:00:03,340 --> 03:00:05,340
I'll just transcribe steamed hams

5040
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:07,340
from memory and that will be

5041
03:00:07,340 --> 03:00:09,340
that will satisfy my instructor

5042
03:00:09,340 --> 03:00:11,340
it was just like write a short story

5043
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:13,340
that was all it was

5044
03:00:13,340 --> 03:00:15,340
alright Mrs. King I have my

5045
03:00:15,340 --> 03:00:17,340
short story here it's called

5046
03:00:17,340 --> 03:00:19,340
who's on first

5047
03:00:19,340 --> 03:00:21,340
I'm trying to imagine

5048
03:00:21,340 --> 03:00:23,340
yeah exactly I'm trying to imagine

5049
03:00:23,340 --> 03:00:25,340
if I was like a first grade teacher

5050
03:00:25,340 --> 03:00:27,340
or whatever and like

5051
03:00:27,340 --> 03:00:29,340
I assigned my kids that

5052
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:31,340
and one of them hands it back and they've just

5053
03:00:31,340 --> 03:00:33,340
they've written steamed hams

5054
03:00:33,340 --> 03:00:35,340
I knew you transcribed it

5055
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:37,340
it was like principal Seymour

5056
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:39,340
Skinner who says this like

5057
03:00:39,340 --> 03:00:41,340
character names and everything

5058
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:43,340
I basically just like

5059
03:00:43,340 --> 03:00:45,340
when me and my sister would just quote it at each other

5060
03:00:45,340 --> 03:00:47,340
it was just that

5061
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:49,340
so it was like nonsensical it wasn't like written

5062
03:00:49,340 --> 03:00:51,340
so it wasn't like

5063
03:00:51,340 --> 03:00:53,340
it was just like the sentences they say to each other

5064
03:00:53,340 --> 03:00:55,340
written in a sequence

5065
03:00:55,340 --> 03:00:57,340
and like maybe a description here of air

5066
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:59,340
but mostly just for sentences yeah

5067
03:00:59,340 --> 03:01:01,340
just the dialogue

5068
03:01:01,340 --> 03:01:03,340
I'm trying to decide

5069
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:05,340
that like she must she just genuinely thought it was bad

5070
03:01:05,340 --> 03:01:07,340
or did you just

5071
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:09,340
like do a bad job transcribing

5072
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:11,340
I definitely did a fucking bad job

5073
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:13,340
I did not know how to spell a roar

5074
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:15,340
so it's not that like

5075
03:01:15,340 --> 03:01:17,340
so it's not that she was like

5076
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:19,340
so it can't be that she was like a first

5077
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:21,340
grader didn't write this this is a work of comedic genius

5078
03:01:21,340 --> 03:01:23,340
this is like that this is

5079
03:01:23,340 --> 03:01:25,340
this is this is this is national

5080
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:27,340
yeah it's like

5081
03:01:27,340 --> 03:01:29,340
it mentioned your to your child's

5082
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:31,340
hands in like a professional like

5083
03:01:31,340 --> 03:01:33,340
mean writer level comedy scene

5084
03:01:33,340 --> 03:01:35,340
yeah it's just

5085
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:37,340
it's just a steam of

5086
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:39,340
consciousness if you will

5087
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:41,340
nonsense you know I just

5088
03:01:41,340 --> 03:01:43,340
want to go on record the people sometimes will groan

5089
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:45,340
when you make an aurora borealis reference now because

5090
03:01:45,340 --> 03:01:47,340
that scene was memed like to high heaven

5091
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:49,340
and back but just for the record

5092
03:01:49,340 --> 03:01:51,340
that scene is still incredibly funny

5093
03:01:51,340 --> 03:01:53,340
I was so glad when it became a meme

5094
03:01:53,340 --> 03:01:55,340
it was already in my life

5095
03:01:55,340 --> 03:01:57,340
it was not one of the simpson scenes

5096
03:01:57,340 --> 03:01:59,340
that I like quoted all the time

5097
03:01:59,340 --> 03:02:01,340
as a kid I mean it was it was

5098
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:03,340
a funny scene that I was great

5099
03:02:03,340 --> 03:02:05,340
but it wasn't it wasn't like that whole episode

5100
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:07,340
the whole like all the short stories and stuff like

5101
03:02:07,340 --> 03:02:09,340
28 short films about springfield yeah

5102
03:02:09,340 --> 03:02:11,340
yeah it's a classic

5103
03:02:11,340 --> 03:02:13,340
I only saw that one like

5104
03:02:13,340 --> 03:02:15,340
once as a kid I didn't

5105
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:17,340
it wasn't one that I like remembered that

5106
03:02:17,340 --> 03:02:19,340
well I thought I remember

5107
03:02:19,340 --> 03:02:21,340
thinking that it was weird oh you know

5108
03:02:21,340 --> 03:02:23,340
I mean I hadn't seen

5109
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:25,340
what do you call it pulp fiction and like

5110
03:02:25,340 --> 03:02:27,340
half of that episode is like a pulp fiction reference

5111
03:02:27,340 --> 03:02:29,340
and I didn't get it because there's some very

5112
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:31,340
explicit references to pulp fiction

5113
03:02:31,340 --> 03:02:33,340
I heard of pulp fiction because

5114
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:35,340
my dad said it was a bad movie

5115
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:37,340
and the director was just

5116
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:39,340
trying to be too cool by doing things out of order

5117
03:02:39,340 --> 03:02:41,340
stop trying to be cool you're not cool

5118
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:43,340
that's why

5119
03:02:43,340 --> 03:02:45,340
I love that reaction some people go like

5120
03:02:45,340 --> 03:02:47,340
they get offended when you try and like do things

5121
03:02:47,340 --> 03:02:49,340
in like you know non chronological order

5122
03:02:49,340 --> 03:02:51,340
they're like just fucking put it in chronological order

5123
03:02:51,340 --> 03:02:53,340
stop trying to be fucking smart

5124
03:02:53,340 --> 03:02:55,340
my dad's favorite movie is braveheart

5125
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:57,340
and character has like a moral

5126
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:59,340
like takes a moral stand

5127
03:02:59,340 --> 03:03:01,340
or something or makes a sacrifice or whatever the fuck

5128
03:03:01,340 --> 03:03:03,340
I mean alright

5129
03:03:03,340 --> 03:03:05,340
sure I don't know

5130
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:07,340
he's just a guy that likes a good default movie

5131
03:03:07,340 --> 03:03:09,340
I can't blame him my dad's favorite movie

5132
03:03:09,340 --> 03:03:11,340
is planes trains and all the wheels because he likes funny things

5133
03:03:11,340 --> 03:03:13,340
I have never seen

5134
03:03:13,340 --> 03:03:15,340
I have never seen that it's a good movie

5135
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:17,340
my name's fun mum has

5136
03:03:17,340 --> 03:03:19,340
I think I've seen that never watched a movie more

5137
03:03:19,340 --> 03:03:21,340
than once except for the matrix

5138
03:03:21,340 --> 03:03:23,340
she's like never watched a movie

5139
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:25,340
it's like me

5140
03:03:25,340 --> 03:03:27,340
it's probably not that uncommon

5141
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:29,340
but it feels weird to me

5142
03:03:29,340 --> 03:03:31,340
I like never rewatch movies like I never re-read books

5143
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:33,340
I just didn't do it

5144
03:03:33,340 --> 03:03:35,340
I'm a re-watcher I'll re-watch things

5145
03:03:35,340 --> 03:03:37,340
I've seen office space literally like

5146
03:03:37,340 --> 03:03:39,340
a hundred times

5147
03:03:39,340 --> 03:03:41,340
I think the thing that I have probably re-watched the most

5148
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:43,340
times in my life is Fooley Cooley

5149
03:03:43,340 --> 03:03:45,340
and I've probably seen it maybe like six times

5150
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:47,340
only six times

5151
03:03:47,340 --> 03:03:49,340
that's good that one's nice and short too

5152
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:51,340
Fooley Cooley is basically a movie

5153
03:03:51,340 --> 03:03:53,340
not even as a kid when you only had like

5154
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:55,340
ten movies on VHS

5155
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:57,340
and that's all you had and you just watched them all the time

5156
03:03:57,340 --> 03:03:59,340
okay

5157
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:01,340
I re-watched stuff a lot less

5158
03:04:01,340 --> 03:04:03,340
than I used to

5159
03:04:03,340 --> 03:04:05,340
when I was younger

5160
03:04:05,340 --> 03:04:07,340
I mean I'm trying to think

5161
03:04:07,340 --> 03:04:09,340
if there was stuff that I watched

5162
03:04:09,340 --> 03:04:11,340
or replayed games or whatever

5163
03:04:11,340 --> 03:04:13,340
I didn't really have anything that I would

5164
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:15,340
re-watch all the time

5165
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:17,340
as a kid

5166
03:04:17,340 --> 03:04:19,340
how much treasure planet films suddenly as a kid

5167
03:04:19,340 --> 03:04:21,340
and that is a cool movie

5168
03:04:21,340 --> 03:04:23,340
I just kind of watched every movie that we had

5169
03:04:23,340 --> 03:04:25,340
re-watch a bunch because we didn't have a lot

5170
03:04:25,340 --> 03:04:27,340
and we didn't have good television

5171
03:04:27,340 --> 03:04:29,340
it's just weird that like kids today

5172
03:04:29,340 --> 03:04:31,340
never have to re-watch anything if they don't want to

5173
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:33,340
they'll just go on their little phone or tablet

5174
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:35,340
and you know you can see an infinite supply of

5175
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:37,340
new content but easily

5176
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:39,340
I re-watch YouTube videos at the time too though

5177
03:04:39,340 --> 03:04:41,340
yeah me too there's plenty of YouTube videos I go back to

5178
03:04:41,340 --> 03:04:43,340
I could not tell you how many times

5179
03:04:43,340 --> 03:04:45,340
I've seen

5180
03:04:45,340 --> 03:04:47,340
Rolling Rocks with A-Press

5181
03:04:47,340 --> 03:04:49,340
you know what I mean?

5182
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:51,340
I've seen that like three times

5183
03:04:51,340 --> 03:04:53,340
you know what actually yeah

5184
03:04:53,340 --> 03:04:55,340
you didn't know about Darth Vader's suit

5185
03:04:55,340 --> 03:04:57,340
oh my god dude Simzi Simzi that video is

5186
03:04:57,340 --> 03:04:59,340
fucking amazing

5187
03:04:59,340 --> 03:05:01,340
there are a bunch of

5188
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:03,340
there are a bunch of

5189
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:05,340
I've listened to like

5190
03:05:05,340 --> 03:05:07,340
I've listened to all of Jenny Nicholson's

5191
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:09,340
videos multiple times

5192
03:05:09,340 --> 03:05:11,340
just for instance

5193
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:13,340
she has some really good ones

5194
03:05:13,340 --> 03:05:15,340
she has really good ones

5195
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:17,340
when I was editing the PCP

5196
03:05:17,340 --> 03:05:19,340
last week I was grabbing clips from

5197
03:05:19,340 --> 03:05:21,340
Journey of the Spark right for that segment

5198
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:23,340
where I talked about it

5199
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:25,340
in the

5200
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:27,340
one of the credit sequences Jenny Nicholson was voicing

5201
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:29,340
Rainbow Dash

5202
03:05:29,340 --> 03:05:31,340
in Journey of the Spark I forgot about that

5203
03:05:31,340 --> 03:05:33,340
really? yeah it's funny that she was

5204
03:05:33,340 --> 03:05:35,340
so in the Brony like her Brony

5205
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:37,340
community like dissection video

5206
03:05:37,340 --> 03:05:39,340
was really interesting

5207
03:05:39,340 --> 03:05:41,340
I worked with Jenny Nicholson on a few projects

5208
03:05:41,340 --> 03:05:43,340
I worked on Friendship as Witchcraft

5209
03:05:43,340 --> 03:05:45,340
that was one of the few videos from her I watched

5210
03:05:45,340 --> 03:05:47,340
she was

5211
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:49,340
she was the voice

5212
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:51,340
of Kagan Phantom's mom

5213
03:05:51,340 --> 03:05:53,340
in Phantom Reviews

5214
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:55,340
Hearth's Warming Eve

5215
03:05:55,340 --> 03:05:57,340
she did a voice

5216
03:05:57,340 --> 03:05:59,340
she has one line

5217
03:05:59,340 --> 03:06:01,340
at the very beginning of that video

5218
03:06:01,340 --> 03:06:03,340
LeMau

5219
03:06:03,340 --> 03:06:05,340
oh and then she did

5220
03:06:05,340 --> 03:06:07,340
because we put Kimmy Sparkle

5221
03:06:07,340 --> 03:06:09,340
in one of the

5222
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:11,340
the

5223
03:06:11,340 --> 03:06:13,340
music the song video

5224
03:06:13,340 --> 03:06:15,340
the cutie mark for Fuffle videos

5225
03:06:15,340 --> 03:06:17,340
and she voiced

5226
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:19,340
two lines from Kimmy Sparkle

5227
03:06:19,340 --> 03:06:21,340
I did an animation of Kimmy Sparkle

5228
03:06:21,340 --> 03:06:23,340
like bursting into flames

5229
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:25,340
and dying horrifically

5230
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:27,340
it was going to be in that

5231
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:29,340
I live Compossible a lot animation about John Delancey

5232
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:31,340
because I was on that project as well

5233
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:33,340
why wasn't it?

5234
03:06:33,340 --> 03:06:35,340
they cut it out

5235
03:06:35,340 --> 03:06:37,340
why?

5236
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:39,340
fuck off

5237
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:41,340
we sent it to Jenny

5238
03:06:41,340 --> 03:06:43,340
and she loved it

5239
03:06:43,340 --> 03:06:45,340
and when I met her at Fiesta Choir 2014

5240
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:47,340
she was like oh my god you animated that thing

5241
03:06:47,340 --> 03:06:49,340
and was like super

5242
03:06:49,340 --> 03:06:51,340
like happy about it

5243
03:06:51,340 --> 03:06:53,340
which was cool

5244
03:06:53,340 --> 03:06:55,340
when I met Jenny

5245
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:57,340
at the last Bronycon

5246
03:06:57,340 --> 03:06:59,340
we were walking

5247
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:01,340
because there were like two buildings

5248
03:07:01,340 --> 03:07:03,340
and we were going to a room in the secondary

5249
03:07:03,340 --> 03:07:05,340
building

5250
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:07,340
so we had to pass through a sky bridge

5251
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:09,340
and I was walking towards the sky bridge

5252
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:11,340
and I was just unsure where to go

5253
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:13,340
and I had just made up my mind

5254
03:07:13,340 --> 03:07:15,340
I'm going to ask the next person I see

5255
03:07:15,340 --> 03:07:17,340
like is this the way to the building

5256
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:19,340
and it just so happened that the person that walked out

5257
03:07:19,340 --> 03:07:21,340
of the sky bridge was Jenny Nicholson

5258
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:23,340
with like two other people

5259
03:07:23,340 --> 03:07:25,340
and I was like oh okay

5260
03:07:25,340 --> 03:07:27,340
so I asked her like hey

5261
03:07:27,340 --> 03:07:29,340
is this the way to the building

5262
03:07:29,340 --> 03:07:31,340
and she was like yep it's right through there

5263
03:07:31,340 --> 03:07:33,340
and I was like okay cool

5264
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:35,340
and then I kept walking

5265
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:37,340
and then Nicholson's met Ben St

5266
03:07:37,340 --> 03:07:39,340
yeah right

5267
03:07:39,340 --> 03:07:41,340
you jealous of her

5268
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:43,340
yeah

5269
03:07:43,340 --> 03:07:45,340
you should hear her tell that story

5270
03:07:45,340 --> 03:07:47,340
when she's like can you believe the time Ben St walked up to me

5271
03:07:47,340 --> 03:07:49,340
and asked me where the sky bridge was

5272
03:07:49,340 --> 03:07:51,340
I was like holy shit

5273
03:07:51,340 --> 03:07:53,340
so I was just going to keep going

5274
03:07:53,340 --> 03:07:55,340
but then like the part

5275
03:07:55,340 --> 03:07:57,340
because I was like at the front of the pack

5276
03:07:57,340 --> 03:07:59,340
like other people were behind me

5277
03:07:59,340 --> 03:08:01,340
Nate was back there and Michelle

5278
03:08:01,340 --> 03:08:03,340

5279
03:08:03,340 --> 03:08:05,340

I didn't hear what he said because I was a bit too far away

5285
03:08:15,340 --> 03:08:17,340
but I turned around and I was kind of like

5286
03:08:17,340 --> 03:08:19,340

in BronyCon LeMau

5301
03:08:47,340 --> 03:08:49,340

I think I was next to Nate

5303
03:08:51,340 --> 03:08:53,340
I barely have seen her videos

5304
03:08:53,340 --> 03:08:55,340

5305
03:08:55,340 --> 03:08:57,340

5306
03:08:57,340 --> 03:08:59,340

I mean I know that it's a song where she's

5319
03:09:25,340 --> 03:09:27,340
like a gypsy making a potion

5320
03:09:27,340 --> 03:09:29,340
Pinky's Brew and what's the other one

5321
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:31,340

in her video that like

5335
03:09:57,340 --> 03:09:59,340

03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:37,340
want if I feel like it if they have a really

5385
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:39,340
easy design I'll just be like sure

5386
03:11:39,340 --> 03:11:41,340
and then I get like a hundred bucks and then I knock it out

5387
03:11:41,340 --> 03:11:43,340
in a few hours

5388
03:11:43,340 --> 03:11:45,340
there's still demand for pony vectors huh

5389
03:11:45,340 --> 03:11:47,340
yeah there are

5390
03:11:47,340 --> 03:11:49,340
I get people I thought all

5391
03:11:49,340 --> 03:11:51,340
any and all pony fandom would

5392
03:11:51,340 --> 03:11:53,340
be stomped out forcefully

5393
03:11:53,340 --> 03:11:55,340
to make way for the new brony fandom

5394
03:11:55,340 --> 03:11:57,340
for the new generation of the show

5395
03:11:57,340 --> 03:11:59,340
no they'll never die

5396
03:11:59,340 --> 03:12:01,340
does anyone even care about the new generation

5397
03:12:01,340 --> 03:12:03,340
did it start I can't remember

5398
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:05,340
yeah the new the new generation

5399
03:12:05,340 --> 03:12:07,340
okay but the new generation like

5400
03:12:07,340 --> 03:12:09,340
kind of acknowledges the old generation

5401
03:12:09,340 --> 03:12:11,340
and it like doesn't really invalidate it

5402
03:12:11,340 --> 03:12:13,340
so like you can bronies the next

5403
03:12:13,340 --> 03:12:15,340
generation there's there's no conflict

5404
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:17,340
in being like a g a g

5405
03:12:17,340 --> 03:12:19,340
a g4 brony

5406
03:12:19,340 --> 03:12:21,340
and like being into

5407
03:12:21,340 --> 03:12:23,340
the new the new

5408
03:12:23,340 --> 03:12:25,340
one like you can a smooth

5409
03:12:25,340 --> 03:12:27,340
smooth transition of power

5410
03:12:27,340 --> 03:12:29,340
there's no problem with being a g4

5411
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:31,340
brony but if you're one of those fucking g1

5412
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:33,340
grandmas we're gonna fucking kill you

5413
03:12:33,340 --> 03:12:35,340
wow

5414
03:12:35,340 --> 03:12:37,340
yeah that's my sister dude my

5415
03:12:37,340 --> 03:12:39,340
grandma literally

5416
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:41,340
she's dead now but I growing up

5417
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:43,340
I knew her as one of the biggest

5418
03:12:43,340 --> 03:12:45,340
my little pony collectors in the united states

5419
03:12:45,340 --> 03:12:47,340
like I would go in her basement there was

5420
03:12:47,340 --> 03:12:49,340
like a wall of these fucking ponies

5421
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:51,340
so I was always just

5422
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:53,340
so to you my little pony with grandma

5423
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:55,340
the ponies were fine

5424
03:12:55,340 --> 03:12:57,340
I'm a little curious did she have anything

5425
03:12:57,340 --> 03:12:59,340
to say about the brony phenomenon

5426
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:01,340
I'm a little brony curious

5427
03:13:01,340 --> 03:13:03,340
I asked her about the

5428
03:13:03,340 --> 03:13:05,340
brony thing she died in like 2015

5429
03:13:05,340 --> 03:13:07,340
or something so she wasn't like she

5430
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:09,340
didn't fully she didn't get to fully experience it which is

5431
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:11,340
can you think of a greater casual life and being a

5432
03:13:11,340 --> 03:13:13,340
little pony fan and not getting to experience

5433
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:15,340
friendship is magic

5434
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:17,340
wait friendship is magic came out

5435
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:19,340
in like 2010 though that

5436
03:13:19,340 --> 03:13:21,340
surely was a lot of time

5437
03:13:21,340 --> 03:13:23,340
yeah sorry I

5438
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:25,340
she was contemporaneously surviving with it

5439
03:13:25,340 --> 03:13:27,340
I just never asked her about it I don't think she was ever

5440
03:13:27,340 --> 03:13:29,340
like she never talked about the new show or anything

5441
03:13:29,340 --> 03:13:31,340
she was a big fan but she was a big closeted

5442
03:13:31,340 --> 03:13:33,340
brony like she didn't tell you about it

5443
03:13:33,340 --> 03:13:35,340
she never

5444
03:13:35,340 --> 03:13:37,340
she never lived to see twilight

5445
03:13:37,340 --> 03:13:39,340
grow into a long legged giant

5446
03:13:39,340 --> 03:13:41,340
horse freak princess creature

5447
03:13:41,340 --> 03:13:43,340
she didn't get to finish it is what I was saying

5448
03:13:43,340 --> 03:13:45,340
she lived just long enough to see horseshoe finale

5449
03:13:45,340 --> 03:13:47,340
on her death

5450
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:49,340
that's what she could check out

5451
03:13:49,340 --> 03:13:51,340
I don't know anything about what you're talking about

5452
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:53,340
does she grow into a long

5453
03:13:53,340 --> 03:13:55,340
freaky monster

5454
03:13:55,340 --> 03:13:57,340
do you know princess celestia

5455
03:13:57,340 --> 03:13:59,340
no

5456
03:13:59,340 --> 03:14:01,340
okay well she's got a long neck

5457
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:03,340
the princess

5458
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:05,340
princess celestia is the ruler

5459
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:07,340
of the horses but she's like a big

5460
03:14:07,340 --> 03:14:09,340
horse like she's just bigger and longer

5461
03:14:09,340 --> 03:14:11,340
than all the other horses and at the end

5462
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:13,340
of the series twilight sparkle

5463
03:14:13,340 --> 03:14:15,340
fucking pokemon evolves

5464
03:14:15,340 --> 03:14:17,340
and grows up into a long

5465
03:14:17,340 --> 03:14:19,340
freak like celestia

5466
03:14:19,340 --> 03:14:21,340
only big boys

5467
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:23,340
can be in charge of society

5468
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:25,340
that's the message it's literally it's the

5469
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:27,340
it's the almighty tallest from invader

5470
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:29,340
zim that's the rule

5471
03:14:29,340 --> 03:14:31,340
it literally is

5472
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:33,340
that's funny is it like in dark souls

5473
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:35,340
how the more powerful you are the bigger you are

5474
03:14:35,340 --> 03:14:37,340
yes yes

5475
03:14:37,340 --> 03:14:39,340
yes it is

5476
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:41,340
precisely like that

5477
03:14:41,340 --> 03:14:43,340
almost all of my

5478
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:45,340
pony knowledge besides from like

5479
03:14:45,340 --> 03:14:47,340
watching a jenny tekelson video on that brony

5480
03:14:47,340 --> 03:14:49,340
thing comes from just like memes

5481
03:14:49,340 --> 03:14:51,340
and animation memes I've seen from like two

5482
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:53,340
snacks you know the cool animation guy

5483
03:14:53,340 --> 03:14:55,340
there's some pretty

5484
03:14:55,340 --> 03:14:57,340
high quality animation

5485
03:14:57,340 --> 03:14:59,340
stuff out there for brony's

5486
03:14:59,340 --> 03:15:01,340
okay two snacks is probably most known

5487
03:15:01,340 --> 03:15:03,340
for his vtuber stuff now like the eco vocal

5488
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:05,340
thing it's that guy

5489
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,340
animations that were popular

5490
03:15:07,340 --> 03:15:09,340
in the early brony fandom

5491
03:15:09,340 --> 03:15:11,340
my brony knowledge comes from

5492
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:13,340
asking ben and gibb things when I talk to them

5493
03:15:13,340 --> 03:15:15,340
oh god

5494
03:15:15,340 --> 03:15:17,340
as soon as he said the eco vocal thing I knew

5495
03:15:17,340 --> 03:15:19,340
that's not actually from the show but it's

5496
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:21,340
approximately what she looks like

5497
03:15:21,340 --> 03:15:23,340
that's freaky

5498
03:15:23,340 --> 03:15:25,340
yeah she went through the fucking

5499
03:15:25,340 --> 03:15:27,340
junji ito cave hole

5500
03:15:27,340 --> 03:15:29,340
I want to see her kill someone with that horn

5501
03:15:29,340 --> 03:15:31,340
I think I've seen taller ponies

5502
03:15:31,340 --> 03:15:33,340
before but I just assumed that they were

5503
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:35,340
adults and everyone else was kids

5504
03:15:35,340 --> 03:15:37,340
no the god queen

5505
03:15:37,340 --> 03:15:39,340
of ponies is long and everyone

5506
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:41,340
else is a little

5507
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:43,340
is a little marshmallow

5508
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:45,340
and squeaky and small

5509
03:15:45,340 --> 03:15:47,340
and a twilight sparkle grows up to become

5510
03:15:47,340 --> 03:15:49,340
queen of the ponies and the

5511
03:15:49,340 --> 03:15:51,340
old queen I guess dies

5512
03:15:51,340 --> 03:15:53,340
or like retires to some

5513
03:15:53,340 --> 03:15:55,340
she retires to a beach

5514
03:15:55,340 --> 03:15:57,340
do they not show her getting small

5515
03:15:57,340 --> 03:15:59,340
does she get small once she leaves the power

5516
03:15:59,340 --> 03:16:01,340
no I don't think we ever see

5517
03:16:01,340 --> 03:16:03,340
what becomes of princess celestia

5518
03:16:03,340 --> 03:16:05,340
she presumably just goes away from her

5519
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:07,340
you think small luna

5520
03:16:07,340 --> 03:16:09,340
could they coronate every

5521
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:13,340
could they coronate every member of the

5522
03:16:13,340 --> 03:16:15,340
community and make them all tall and then

5523
03:16:15,340 --> 03:16:17,340
everybody gets to be tall probably not

5524
03:16:17,340 --> 03:16:19,340
because twilight was able to become

5525
03:16:19,340 --> 03:16:21,340
this creature through a

5526
03:16:21,340 --> 03:16:23,340
fucking like

5527
03:16:23,340 --> 03:16:25,340
magical confluence

5528
03:16:25,340 --> 03:16:27,340
of like mystical

5529
03:16:27,340 --> 03:16:29,340
knowledge and it's probably

5530
03:16:29,340 --> 03:16:31,340
like a once in a lifetime miraculous

5531
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:33,340
event that will never be

5532
03:16:33,340 --> 03:16:35,340
sorry main character is only

5533
03:16:35,340 --> 03:16:37,340
so she's the chosen one

5534
03:16:39,340 --> 03:16:41,340
a little bit

5535
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:43,340
is she the reincarnation of

5536
03:16:43,340 --> 03:16:45,340
the son of the sage of

5537
03:16:45,340 --> 03:16:47,340
six paths

5538
03:16:47,340 --> 03:16:49,340
that's a narrator

5539
03:16:49,340 --> 03:16:51,340
that's right

5540
03:16:51,340 --> 03:16:53,340
applejack gif

5541
03:16:53,340 --> 03:16:55,340
his awakening memory is holy fuck I remember

5542
03:16:55,340 --> 03:16:57,340
it

5543
03:16:57,340 --> 03:16:59,340
remember when Naruto made a big frog

5544
03:16:59,340 --> 03:17:01,340
appear okay okay

5545
03:17:01,340 --> 03:17:03,340
that was great

5546
03:17:03,340 --> 03:17:05,340
that was great that was a

5547
03:17:05,340 --> 03:17:07,340
pretty cool

5548
03:17:07,340 --> 03:17:09,340
cyber shell did you ever see one called

5549
03:17:09,340 --> 03:17:11,340
um oh god what was

5550
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:13,340
was it um

5551
03:17:13,340 --> 03:17:15,340
the one the one where celestia

5552
03:17:15,340 --> 03:17:17,340
is like you're a bitch who likes bananas

5553
03:17:17,340 --> 03:17:19,340
you know that one

5554
03:17:19,340 --> 03:17:21,340
oh my god

5555
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:23,340
triggering some neurons in my brain

5556
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:25,340
I don't remember what it was called

5557
03:17:25,340 --> 03:17:27,340
you're a bitch who likes

5558
03:17:27,340 --> 03:17:29,340
bananas you're a bitch who likes

5559
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:31,340
bananas

5560
03:17:31,340 --> 03:17:33,340
I got a fucking

5561
03:17:33,340 --> 03:17:35,340
t-shirt from my sister that

5562
03:17:35,340 --> 03:17:37,340
had a meme referencing that on it

5563
03:17:37,340 --> 03:17:39,340
that specific video

5564
03:17:39,340 --> 03:17:41,340
that was the shit now that

5565
03:17:41,340 --> 03:17:43,340
was the shit back in the day

5566
03:17:43,340 --> 03:17:45,340
whoa that frog is so huge

5567
03:17:45,340 --> 03:17:47,340
what the fuck it's a really big frog

5568
03:17:47,340 --> 03:17:49,340
I saw a thread

5569
03:17:49,340 --> 03:17:51,340
I saw a thread on twitter

5570
03:17:51,340 --> 03:17:53,340
I found the video

5571
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:55,340
oh yeah friendship is magic bitch there it is

5572
03:17:55,340 --> 03:17:57,340
there it is I mean it's a great video

5573
03:17:57,340 --> 03:17:59,340
it's really funny

5574
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:01,340
I saw a thread

5575
03:18:01,340 --> 03:18:03,340
it is

5576
03:18:03,340 --> 03:18:05,340
I saw a thread on twitter about a guy

5577
03:18:05,340 --> 03:18:07,340
who found a green

5578
03:18:07,340 --> 03:18:09,340
tree frog in his romaine

5579
03:18:09,340 --> 03:18:11,340
lettuce from whole foods

5580
03:18:11,340 --> 03:18:13,340
and it just lived

5581
03:18:13,340 --> 03:18:15,340
like he just

5582
03:18:15,340 --> 03:18:17,340
he bought romaine lettuce from whole foods

5583
03:18:17,340 --> 03:18:19,340
and he

5584
03:18:19,340 --> 03:18:21,340
just it was in his fridge for like days

5585
03:18:21,340 --> 03:18:23,340
and he pulled it out

5586
03:18:23,340 --> 03:18:25,340
and he pulled out some romaine lettuce

5587
03:18:25,340 --> 03:18:27,340
and there was just a green tree frog

5588
03:18:27,340 --> 03:18:29,340
living in his refrigerator

5589
03:18:29,340 --> 03:18:31,340
the whole time

5590
03:18:31,340 --> 03:18:33,340
and he's just one of those fridge

5591
03:18:33,340 --> 03:18:35,340
frogs you know

5592
03:18:35,340 --> 03:18:37,340
he made it his pet

5593
03:18:37,340 --> 03:18:39,340
it briefly escaped but he found it

5594
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:41,340
he found it crawling around his door frame

5595
03:18:41,340 --> 03:18:43,340
so you know

5596
03:18:43,340 --> 03:18:45,340
he got it an actual like terrarium

5597
03:18:45,340 --> 03:18:47,340
and he named it toby

5598
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:49,340
and uh

5599
03:18:49,340 --> 03:18:51,340
that's the story now he's his pet frog

5600
03:18:51,340 --> 03:18:53,340
that's a good

5601
03:18:53,340 --> 03:18:55,340
free frog

5602
03:18:55,340 --> 03:18:57,340
did he say to the frog you seem chill

5603
03:18:59,340 --> 03:19:01,340
you seem chill you could stay bro

5604
03:19:01,340 --> 03:19:03,340
I get it

5605
03:19:03,340 --> 03:19:05,340
I get it

5606
03:19:05,340 --> 03:19:07,340
I don't

5607
03:19:07,340 --> 03:19:09,340
I guess because he was in the fridge

5608
03:19:09,340 --> 03:19:11,340
wouldn't he die in the fridge

5609
03:19:11,340 --> 03:19:13,340
because he's cold-blooded

5610
03:19:13,340 --> 03:19:15,340
like don't frogs don't cold-blooded creatures

5611
03:19:15,340 --> 03:19:17,340
need to not be in the cold

5612
03:19:17,340 --> 03:19:19,340
or they die?

5613
03:19:19,340 --> 03:19:21,340
I thought it would just slow down his metabolism

5614
03:19:21,340 --> 03:19:23,340
and like help him survive honestly

5615
03:19:23,340 --> 03:19:25,340
but maybe

5616
03:19:25,340 --> 03:19:27,340
he wraps up in a little lettuce blanket

5617
03:19:27,340 --> 03:19:29,340
I mean being cold-blooded means they can be cold-blooded

5618
03:19:29,340 --> 03:19:31,340
it means they want their blood to be warmed

5619
03:19:31,340 --> 03:19:33,340
by like the sun and stuff but like

5620
03:19:33,340 --> 03:19:35,340
it would be worse if he was warm-blooded

5621
03:19:35,340 --> 03:19:37,340
and then he locked him in the fridge because then he would definitely die

5622
03:19:37,340 --> 03:19:39,340
I thought when you're cold-blooded

5623
03:19:39,340 --> 03:19:41,340
you need heat

5624
03:19:41,340 --> 03:19:43,340
or you die whereas like if you're warm-blooded

5625
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:45,340
you can generate your own heat

5626
03:19:45,340 --> 03:19:47,340
I thought it was like that

5627
03:19:47,340 --> 03:19:49,340
am I crazy?

5628
03:19:49,340 --> 03:19:51,340
I don't think reptiles are real

5629
03:19:51,340 --> 03:19:53,340
I think it was just a conspiracy

5630
03:19:53,340 --> 03:19:55,340
I mean yeah the reptiles are the government

5631
03:19:55,340 --> 03:19:57,340
really

5632
03:19:57,340 --> 03:19:59,340
those are the real reptiles

5633
03:19:59,340 --> 03:20:01,340
what Simsie what is this?

5634
03:20:01,340 --> 03:20:03,340
you seem chill

5635
03:20:03,340 --> 03:20:05,340
it's just an image I really like

5636
03:20:05,340 --> 03:20:07,340
I love the

5637
03:20:07,340 --> 03:20:09,340
yeah the HD trailer and just the horrible

5638
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:11,340
JPEG artifacts

5639
03:20:11,340 --> 03:20:13,340
they're so funny but they are sometimes

5640
03:20:13,340 --> 03:20:15,340
dude I'm manually painting JPEG artifacts

5641
03:20:15,340 --> 03:20:17,340
cause it looks like you got it from your grandma's facebook

5642
03:20:17,340 --> 03:20:19,340
yeah

5643
03:20:19,340 --> 03:20:21,340
do you actually have live info?

5644
03:20:21,340 --> 03:20:23,340
I did

5645
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:25,340
I did a fake

5646
03:20:25,340 --> 03:20:27,340
a fake picture

5647
03:20:27,340 --> 03:20:29,340
of me like

5648
03:20:29,340 --> 03:20:31,340
what do you call that pose

5649
03:20:31,340 --> 03:20:33,340
like that meditation pose where your legs are crossed

5650
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:35,340
and you're like

5651
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:37,340
doing a thing

5652
03:20:37,340 --> 03:20:39,340
I don't know

5653
03:20:39,340 --> 03:20:41,340
my legs crossed and I was like floating off the floor

5654
03:20:41,340 --> 03:20:43,340
and I was supporting myself

5655
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:45,340
with just my two pointer fingers

5656
03:20:45,340 --> 03:20:47,340
and the image was fake I was actually sitting

5657
03:20:47,340 --> 03:20:49,340
on a

5658
03:20:49,340 --> 03:20:51,340
like a box like a fire proof box

5659
03:20:51,340 --> 03:20:53,340
or something

5660
03:20:53,340 --> 03:20:55,340
and I photoshopped it out by

5661
03:20:55,340 --> 03:20:57,340
instead of taking a picture I actually ran a video

5662
03:20:57,340 --> 03:20:59,340
where I sat in that position

5663
03:20:59,340 --> 03:21:01,340
on the box with my fingers on the floor

5664
03:21:01,340 --> 03:21:03,340
and then I stood up and walked away

5665
03:21:03,340 --> 03:21:05,340
and removed the box so that there's like

5666
03:21:05,340 --> 03:21:07,340
an empty background

5667
03:21:07,340 --> 03:21:09,340
different frames of the video

5668
03:21:09,340 --> 03:21:11,340
I gotcha

5669
03:21:11,340 --> 03:21:13,340
it helps to do that on the video

5670
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:15,340
I was doing a whole Captain Disillusion thing

5671
03:21:15,340 --> 03:21:17,340
I was just gonna say

5672
03:21:17,340 --> 03:21:19,340
I looked too clean

5673
03:21:19,340 --> 03:21:21,340
so I got a green and blue brush

5674
03:21:21,340 --> 03:21:23,340
and just painted in little like squary little things

5675
03:21:23,340 --> 03:21:25,340
around it to make it look more JPEG-y

5676
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:27,340
and that made it more convincing

5677
03:21:27,340 --> 03:21:29,340
yes absolutely crushing your

5678
03:21:29,340 --> 03:21:31,340
like removing quality somehow

5679
03:21:31,340 --> 03:21:33,340
like makes things more believable sometimes

5680
03:21:33,340 --> 03:21:35,340
which is weird to think about but yeah

5681
03:21:35,340 --> 03:21:37,340
I was just watching some Captain D

5682
03:21:37,340 --> 03:21:39,340
the other day I watched

5683
03:21:39,340 --> 03:21:41,340
the one about playing in traffic

5684
03:21:41,340 --> 03:21:43,340
he's a great

5685
03:21:43,340 --> 03:21:45,340
Tuber for sure and he's one of those guys

5686
03:21:45,340 --> 03:21:47,340
that's been doing it for like 10 years

5687
03:21:47,340 --> 03:21:49,340
and like go back and watch his early videos

5688
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:51,340
or yeah this is one longer than 10

5689
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:53,340
it's been longer than 10

5690
03:21:53,340 --> 03:21:55,340
2007

5691
03:21:55,340 --> 03:21:57,340
it hurts my brain to think that there are

5692
03:21:57,340 --> 03:21:59,340
YouTube videos that have been up for like 15 years

5693
03:21:59,340 --> 03:22:01,340
but you're absolutely right the point I was just trying to say is that

5694
03:22:01,340 --> 03:22:03,340
go back and watch his earliest stuff and it's not like

5695
03:22:03,340 --> 03:22:05,340
shitty it's still good stuff it's still good

5696
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:07,340
it's like exactly the same

5697
03:22:07,340 --> 03:22:09,340
the highest quality that YouTube could support

5698
03:22:09,340 --> 03:22:11,340
at the time which is like 240p

5699
03:22:11,340 --> 03:22:13,340
well the interesting thing about those old videos

5700
03:22:13,340 --> 03:22:15,340
is that if you watch from now they're actually

5701
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:17,340
16x9

5702
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:19,340
which is interesting

5703
03:22:19,340 --> 03:22:21,340
because most videos from back then people would add

5704
03:22:21,340 --> 03:22:23,340
the black bars at the bottom and then

5705
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:25,340
when we got widescreen there'd be extra

5706
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:27,340
black bars so there's just black bars

5707
03:22:27,340 --> 03:22:29,340
on all sides he avoided that

5708
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:31,340
he did like some weird

5709
03:22:31,340 --> 03:22:33,340
like codec

5710
03:22:33,340 --> 03:22:35,340
he injected some code into the upload

5711
03:22:35,340 --> 03:22:37,340
that made it so that it was

5712
03:22:37,340 --> 03:22:39,340
properly 16x9 and when YouTube

5713
03:22:39,340 --> 03:22:41,340
upgraded the video got formatted correctly

5714
03:22:41,340 --> 03:22:43,340
and he's the only fucking person

5715
03:22:43,340 --> 03:22:45,340
who did that that I'm aware of

5716
03:22:45,340 --> 03:22:47,340
that's insane

5717
03:22:47,340 --> 03:22:49,340
that is pretty cool

5718
03:22:49,340 --> 03:22:51,340
I don't even know how he fucking did that but he had the foresight to do that somehow

5719
03:22:51,340 --> 03:22:53,340
what the fuck

5720
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:55,340
I know YouTube allows different video resolutions

5721
03:22:55,340 --> 03:22:57,340
I know I've seen some shitposts that are just

5722
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:59,340
very very very wide

5723
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:01,340
but doing that shit back in the day was very impressive

5724
03:23:01,340 --> 03:23:03,340
yeah back then no you had to

5725
03:23:03,340 --> 03:23:05,340
it was just like fucking

5726
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:09,340
quote unquote standard resolution right

5727
03:23:13,340 --> 03:23:15,340
god damn that's

5728
03:23:15,340 --> 03:23:17,340
I sometimes wonder if he ever regrets doing the

5729
03:23:17,340 --> 03:23:19,340
face paint thing because it's very cool

5730
03:23:19,340 --> 03:23:21,340
branding and it's recognizable and

5731
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:23,340
it's probably just a huge pain in the ass

5732
03:23:23,340 --> 03:23:25,340
cause he can't stop doing it now

5733
03:23:25,340 --> 03:23:27,340
I'm sure he's had moments like that

5734
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:29,340
but his face though

5735
03:23:29,340 --> 03:23:31,340
it's so distinct like you gotta have a visual

5736
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:33,340
brand like nah

5737
03:23:33,340 --> 03:23:35,340
no I like it I'm not at all

5738
03:23:35,340 --> 03:23:37,340
I'm sure he like

5739
03:23:37,340 --> 03:23:39,340
you know it's like this is a pretty good

5740
03:23:39,340 --> 03:23:41,340
you know it's a brand

5741
03:23:41,340 --> 03:23:43,340
it's iconic I can't like stop it

5742
03:23:43,340 --> 03:23:45,340
but like

5743
03:23:45,340 --> 03:23:47,340
I feel like he has mentioned that it's like

5744
03:23:47,340 --> 03:23:49,340
it's very tedious and it doesn't help

5745
03:23:49,340 --> 03:23:51,340
when he's trying to like be punctual

5746
03:23:51,340 --> 03:23:53,340
with like a fad

5747
03:23:53,340 --> 03:23:55,340
and try to make a video about it

5748
03:23:55,340 --> 03:23:57,340
when he's gonna do all of this work and editing

5749
03:23:57,340 --> 03:23:59,340
and like 3D work on it

5750
03:23:59,340 --> 03:24:01,340
that too god yeah

5751
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:03,340
you can't just do a retake because you'd have to like

5752
03:24:03,340 --> 03:24:05,340
you can't do a retake but like you know he has to do the

5753
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:07,340
make up every time he wants to do it

5754
03:24:07,340 --> 03:24:09,340
how long do you think it would take him to get his make up done

5755
03:24:09,340 --> 03:24:11,340
like he can't be that bad

5756
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:13,340
he's probably pretty good at it now

5757
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:15,340
he's gonna go down to like 40 minutes or something

5758
03:24:15,340 --> 03:24:17,340
that's still a long fucking time at least for me

5759
03:24:17,340 --> 03:24:19,340
40 minutes

5760
03:24:19,340 --> 03:24:21,340
that's just me going off memory

5761
03:24:21,340 --> 03:24:23,340
you can't just slap that shit on your face

5762
03:24:23,340 --> 03:24:25,340
especially like the black part like you know

5763
03:24:25,340 --> 03:24:27,340
he does a good job

5764
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:29,340
apparently like he's gone faster at it

5765
03:24:29,340 --> 03:24:31,340
I mean 40 minutes ish is what I remember

5766
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:33,340
hearing but I could be wrong

5767
03:24:33,340 --> 03:24:35,340
I mean looking at that even if he was twice as fast

5768
03:24:35,340 --> 03:24:37,340
even if he only took him 20 minutes that's still 20 minutes

5769
03:24:37,340 --> 03:24:39,340
that'd be such a pain in the ass dude

5770
03:24:39,340 --> 03:24:41,340
I'm just lazy as fuck because I thought of doing that

5771
03:24:41,340 --> 03:24:43,340
is so like horrifying to me

5772
03:24:43,340 --> 03:24:45,340
I had seen I had seen

5773
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:47,340
Captain D's face

5774
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:49,340
like I've been seeing his face for a long time

5775
03:24:49,340 --> 03:24:51,340
and only like this year did I like

5776
03:24:51,340 --> 03:24:53,340
find out like what he does

5777
03:24:53,340 --> 03:24:55,340
and like what his videos are about

5778
03:24:55,340 --> 03:24:57,340
yeah I only got into him

5779
03:24:57,340 --> 03:24:59,340
it was a couple years ago for me

5780
03:24:59,340 --> 03:25:01,340
but like yeah I somehow managed to like

5781
03:25:01,340 --> 03:25:03,340
you know there's a million people on YouTube

5782
03:25:03,340 --> 03:25:05,340
he can't really be in touch with every popular creator on YouTube

5783
03:25:05,340 --> 03:25:07,340
but like he's really he's very popular

5784
03:25:07,340 --> 03:25:09,340
and like he makes good videos

5785
03:25:09,340 --> 03:25:11,340
I would recommend him to like pretty much anyone

5786
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:13,340
so like I'm just surprised I agree like how did I not find him earlier

5787
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:15,340
and I still found out about him a couple years ago

5788
03:25:15,340 --> 03:25:17,340
so I was just like damn I felt the same way

5789
03:25:17,340 --> 03:25:19,340
I watched the one about laminar flow

5790
03:25:19,340 --> 03:25:21,340
and I was like damn why didn't anybody tell me to watch this before

5791
03:25:21,340 --> 03:25:23,340
this is great

5792
03:25:23,340 --> 03:25:25,340
yeah like I've never even heard of him

5793
03:25:25,340 --> 03:25:27,340
until just now so

5794
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:29,340
check out his channel there's some good stuff on there

5795
03:25:29,340 --> 03:25:31,340
yeah I'm looking at it it didn't start getting well known

5796
03:25:31,340 --> 03:25:33,340
until like 2015

5797
03:25:33,340 --> 03:25:35,340
the first one I saw was the portal

5798
03:25:35,340 --> 03:25:37,340
to like Sedona or whatever that weird thing was

5799
03:25:37,340 --> 03:25:39,340
which is like you know I've always sort of like

5800
03:25:39,340 --> 03:25:41,340
enjoyed a good debunk video but like

5801
03:25:41,340 --> 03:25:43,340
his like special effects videos are the real

5802
03:25:43,340 --> 03:25:45,340
ream of the crop that's the stuff I really like

5803
03:25:45,340 --> 03:25:47,340
yeah yeah for sure

5804
03:25:47,340 --> 03:25:49,340
I always tell everyone to watch for one about the tape measure

5805
03:25:49,340 --> 03:25:51,340
because he just edits himself

5806
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:53,340
oh that was so good

5807
03:25:53,340 --> 03:25:55,340
he removes the special effects

5808
03:25:55,340 --> 03:25:57,340
and he edits himself into the shot

5809
03:25:57,340 --> 03:25:59,340
setting up the special effects and like the wire rigs

5810
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:01,340
and stuff and I'm like how the fuck dude

5811
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:03,340
the other day

5812
03:26:03,340 --> 03:26:05,340
that one rules the other day I watched

5813
03:26:05,340 --> 03:26:07,340
the one about

5814
03:26:07,340 --> 03:26:09,340
it was a short one about

5815
03:26:09,340 --> 03:26:11,340
the trophy in the Great British Bake Off

5816
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:13,340
you see that one and how they

5817
03:26:13,340 --> 03:26:15,340
oh yeah that's a good new one

5818
03:26:15,340 --> 03:26:17,340
I like that

5819
03:26:17,340 --> 03:26:19,340
I watched that I was like I can't fucking

5820
03:26:19,340 --> 03:26:21,340
believe he could just do that

5821
03:26:21,340 --> 03:26:23,340
I can't fucking believe this is real

5822
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:25,340
that's another example of Americans

5823
03:26:25,340 --> 03:26:27,340
that was like a legal thing or something but like

5824
03:26:27,340 --> 03:26:29,340
American titles being stupid

5825
03:26:29,340 --> 03:26:31,340
very stupid very fucking stupid

5826
03:26:31,340 --> 03:26:33,340
we can't call it a bake off we have to call it like the cooking

5827
03:26:33,340 --> 03:26:35,340
the baking show or something like that

5828
03:26:35,340 --> 03:26:37,340
because Nestle owns the phrase Bake Off

5829
03:26:37,340 --> 03:26:39,340
I'm so stupid

5830
03:26:39,340 --> 03:26:41,340
fucking Nestle

5831
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:43,340
is it Nestle it might not be Nestle

5832
03:26:43,340 --> 03:26:45,340
it was some I think it was

5833
03:26:45,340 --> 03:26:47,340
it was some company

5834
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:49,340
someone owns the phrase

5835
03:26:49,340 --> 03:26:51,340
to bake off which is stupid in and of itself

5836
03:26:51,340 --> 03:26:53,340
terrible

5837
03:26:53,340 --> 03:26:55,340
nightmare

5838
03:26:55,340 --> 03:26:57,340
yeah

5839
03:26:57,340 --> 03:26:59,340
I think maybe I just checked and I just watched

5840
03:26:59,340 --> 03:27:01,340
the newest ones that had gone up since the last time

5841
03:27:01,340 --> 03:27:03,340
I had

5842
03:27:03,340 --> 03:27:05,340
scoped it out

5843
03:27:05,340 --> 03:27:07,340
you should watch every single one

5844
03:27:07,340 --> 03:27:09,340
I might have watched

5845
03:27:09,340 --> 03:27:11,340
all of you know what

5846
03:27:11,340 --> 03:27:13,340
I started to watch the one where he had

5847
03:27:13,340 --> 03:27:15,340
including his like talks his talks he does

5848
03:27:15,340 --> 03:27:17,340
are also like impressively good

5849
03:27:17,340 --> 03:27:19,340
I started watching the one about

5850
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:21,340
his live shows like require so much coordination

5851
03:27:21,340 --> 03:27:23,340
and like setting things up

5852
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:25,340
I started watching the video about

5853
03:27:25,340 --> 03:27:27,340
about the last Starfighter

5854
03:27:27,340 --> 03:27:29,340
I got bored

5855
03:27:29,340 --> 03:27:31,340
I like that one I thought that was interesting

5856
03:27:31,340 --> 03:27:33,340
I wasn't that interested in it

5857
03:27:33,340 --> 03:27:35,340
I like hearing minutia about

5858
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:37,340
special effects so like I said that one

5859
03:27:37,340 --> 03:27:39,340
it did it for me

5860
03:27:39,340 --> 03:27:41,340
when people talk about things

5861
03:27:41,340 --> 03:27:43,340
they're really interested in

5862
03:27:43,340 --> 03:27:45,340
maybe I should give that one another try

5863
03:27:45,340 --> 03:27:47,340
I tried to watch the one

5864
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:49,340
okay where he had

5865
03:27:49,340 --> 03:27:51,340
Beekman on it because like I remember

5866
03:27:51,340 --> 03:27:53,340
Beekman I saw Beekman's world on TV

5867
03:27:53,340 --> 03:27:55,340
as a kid and I was like oh my god it's

5868
03:27:55,340 --> 03:27:57,340
fucking Beekman but there was

5869
03:27:57,340 --> 03:27:59,340
okay I feel bad I feel bad to say

5870
03:27:59,340 --> 03:28:01,340
it about someone

5871
03:28:01,340 --> 03:28:03,340
esteemed as captain

5872
03:28:03,340 --> 03:28:05,340
D but I

5873
03:28:05,340 --> 03:28:07,340
when he was introducing Beekman

5874
03:28:07,340 --> 03:28:09,340
and they're getting really excited about

5875
03:28:09,340 --> 03:28:11,340
we should collab with each other

5876
03:28:11,340 --> 03:28:13,340
I was like it's too corny

5877
03:28:13,340 --> 03:28:15,340
it's too corny I'm cringing

5878
03:28:15,340 --> 03:28:17,340
I can't do it I had to

5879
03:28:17,340 --> 03:28:19,340
class that one

5880
03:28:19,340 --> 03:28:21,340
so I was

5881
03:28:21,340 --> 03:28:23,340
bored that one was a little like

5882
03:28:23,340 --> 03:28:25,340
I liked that he clearly had a good time

5883
03:28:25,340 --> 03:28:27,340
making it but I was like

5884
03:28:27,340 --> 03:28:29,340
he was like I can't believe

5885
03:28:29,340 --> 03:28:31,340
I've got Beekman on my show

5886
03:28:31,340 --> 03:28:33,340
and I'm like good for you

5887
03:28:33,340 --> 03:28:35,340
good for him you know I'm happy for him

5888
03:28:35,340 --> 03:28:37,340
now I fell so I was like you know

5889
03:28:37,340 --> 03:28:39,340
he clearly liked this one so

5890
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:41,340
I used to watch Beekman

5891
03:28:41,340 --> 03:28:43,340
and it's so fucking

5892
03:28:43,340 --> 03:28:45,340
it's so weird to see Beekman but he's like 30 years

5893
03:28:45,340 --> 03:28:47,340
older now it's like oh my god

5894
03:28:47,340 --> 03:28:49,340
what the hell

5895
03:28:49,340 --> 03:28:51,340
what's happening

5896
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:55,340
very very just

5897
03:28:55,340 --> 03:28:57,340
but that really

5898
03:28:57,340 --> 03:28:59,340
jogged a memory like oh yeah

5899
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:01,340
Beekman's world

5900
03:29:01,340 --> 03:29:03,340
it was like Bill Nye but like Goofyere

5901
03:29:03,340 --> 03:29:05,340
yeah

5902
03:29:05,340 --> 03:29:07,340
cool cool shit

5903
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:11,340
do people know about Beekman

5904
03:29:11,340 --> 03:29:13,340
surely some people just heard about

5905
03:29:13,340 --> 03:29:15,340
I'll be honest I'd never heard of him

5906
03:29:15,340 --> 03:29:17,340
outside of the Captain D

5907
03:29:17,340 --> 03:29:19,340
I wasn't aware to be honest

5908
03:29:19,340 --> 03:29:21,340
well okay

5909
03:29:21,340 --> 03:29:23,340
oh well

5910
03:29:23,340 --> 03:29:25,340
I remember when I was a little kid I thought he was like

5911
03:29:25,340 --> 03:29:27,340
Bill Nye but better

5912
03:29:27,340 --> 03:29:29,340
clearly people remember Captain D

5913
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:31,340
he's gonna make sure all the new kids remember who he is

5914
03:29:31,340 --> 03:29:33,340
I thought he was funnier than Bill Nye

5915
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:37,340
yes

5916
03:29:37,340 --> 03:29:39,340
I'm trying to think of like British equivalents

5917
03:29:39,340 --> 03:29:41,340
of like ooh science is cool

5918
03:29:41,340 --> 03:29:43,340
kids but I don't think we had

5919
03:29:43,340 --> 03:29:45,340
brainiac science abuse hosted by Richard Hammond

5920
03:29:47,340 --> 03:29:49,340
oh fuck that no

5921
03:29:49,340 --> 03:29:51,340
ham that's food

5922
03:29:51,340 --> 03:29:53,340
I remember that

5923
03:29:53,340 --> 03:29:55,340
I think we had like horrible science or horrible histories

5924
03:29:55,340 --> 03:29:57,340
but I don't think they were shows back then

5925
03:29:57,340 --> 03:29:59,340
we were just

5926
03:29:59,340 --> 03:30:01,340
Harry Potter

5927
03:30:01,340 --> 03:30:03,340
Harry Potter wasn't a scientist

5928
03:30:03,340 --> 03:30:05,340
he was the exact opposite

5929
03:30:05,340 --> 03:30:07,340
he was a sorcerer

5930
03:30:07,340 --> 03:30:09,340
from hell

5931
03:30:09,340 --> 03:30:11,340
he wasn't a sorcerer he was a philosopher

5932
03:30:11,340 --> 03:30:13,340
oh fuck

5933
03:30:13,340 --> 03:30:15,340
in America he was a sorcerer

5934
03:30:15,340 --> 03:30:17,340
and it made us really mad

5935
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:21,340
do you know that the Harry Potter books in the UK

5936
03:30:21,340 --> 03:30:23,340
are entirely about philosophy

5937
03:30:23,340 --> 03:30:25,340
they're not anything to do with them

5938
03:30:25,340 --> 03:30:27,340
they cut out all mentions of magic

5939
03:30:27,340 --> 03:30:29,340
it's completely different like

5940
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:31,340
setting

5941
03:30:31,340 --> 03:30:33,340
Harry Potter goes to Harvard and he thinks about things

5942
03:30:33,340 --> 03:30:35,340
I can't believe they localized

5943
03:30:35,340 --> 03:30:37,340
America they decided to turn it into magic

5944
03:30:37,340 --> 03:30:39,340
because they don't know what thinking is

5945
03:30:39,340 --> 03:30:41,340
nobody in England likes the movies because of that

5946
03:30:41,340 --> 03:30:43,340
because the English people are all wizards

5947
03:30:43,340 --> 03:30:45,340
the Nietzsche election

5948
03:30:45,340 --> 03:30:47,340
book one Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

5949
03:30:47,340 --> 03:30:49,340
book two Harry Potter debates

5950
03:30:49,340 --> 03:30:51,340
Noam Chomsky

5951
03:30:51,340 --> 03:30:53,340
and so on

5952
03:30:53,340 --> 03:30:55,340
the Chamber of Nietzsche

5953
03:30:55,340 --> 03:30:57,340
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Philosophy

5954
03:30:57,340 --> 03:30:59,340
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Philosophy

5955
03:30:59,340 --> 03:31:01,340
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Philosophy

5956
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:03,340
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Philosophy

5957
03:31:03,340 --> 03:31:05,340
the Philosopher's Gewand

5958
03:31:05,340 --> 03:31:07,340
I want to hear what

5959
03:31:07,340 --> 03:31:09,340
Slaver shall we commission a dub of

5960
03:31:09,340 --> 03:31:11,340
oh I was going to say commission a dub of

5961
03:31:11,340 --> 03:31:13,340
Full Metal Alchemist but

5962
03:31:13,340 --> 03:31:15,340
every time they say Philosopher's Stone

5963
03:31:15,340 --> 03:31:17,340
get them to say Sorcerer's Stone instead

5964
03:31:17,340 --> 03:31:19,340
or like do a video review or it's like

5965
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:21,340
I just don't understand what's going on in this show

5966
03:31:21,340 --> 03:31:23,340
what is a philosopher I don't get it

5967
03:31:23,340 --> 03:31:25,340
they localize it better

5968
03:31:25,340 --> 03:31:27,340
remember when Adult Swim

5969
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:29,340
just aired Full Metal Alchemist

5970
03:31:29,340 --> 03:31:31,340
but they just dubbed a bunch of fart sounds

5971
03:31:31,340 --> 03:31:33,340
into it

5972
03:31:33,340 --> 03:31:35,340
I have always appreciated the really

5973
03:31:35,340 --> 03:31:37,340
stupid and like even unfunny

5974
03:31:37,340 --> 03:31:39,340
pranks that Adult Swim

5975
03:31:39,340 --> 03:31:41,340
has pulled just because I think it was a

5976
03:31:41,340 --> 03:31:43,340
you're never going to see another channel do anything

5977
03:31:43,340 --> 03:31:45,340
interesting I couldn't fucking believe it

5978
03:31:45,340 --> 03:31:47,340
I think it was an April Fool's joke and on April Fool's

5979
03:31:47,340 --> 03:31:49,340
they just aired the first episode

5980
03:31:49,340 --> 03:31:51,340
of Full Metal Alchemist but they just put

5981
03:31:51,340 --> 03:31:53,340
fart sounds into it

5982
03:31:53,340 --> 03:31:55,340
at like you know funny times

5983
03:31:55,340 --> 03:31:57,340
when like it was like ha ha ha

5984
03:31:57,340 --> 03:31:59,340
like during an awkward pause

5985
03:31:59,340 --> 03:32:01,340
like she farts like LeMalle

5986
03:32:01,340 --> 03:32:03,340
that was someone's job

5987
03:32:03,340 --> 03:32:05,340
at Turner Network

5988
03:32:05,340 --> 03:32:07,340
and it was great

5989
03:32:07,340 --> 03:32:09,340
I love it

5990
03:32:09,340 --> 03:32:11,340
I hope

5991
03:32:11,340 --> 03:32:13,340
I hope people

5992
03:32:13,340 --> 03:32:15,340
I hope networks do more things like that

5993
03:32:15,340 --> 03:32:17,340
what a

5994
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:19,340
man that's like a

5995
03:32:19,340 --> 03:32:21,340
even exists anymore outside of Adult Swim

5996
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:23,340
like a fucking network with like

5997
03:32:23,340 --> 03:32:25,340
editorial control

5998
03:32:25,340 --> 03:32:27,340
like that they can just like do stupid shit

5999
03:32:27,340 --> 03:32:29,340
and it's funny

6000
03:32:29,340 --> 03:32:31,340
that's what the internet's for now

6001
03:32:31,340 --> 03:32:33,340
that seems like such an outdated

6002
03:32:33,340 --> 03:32:35,340
thing that seems like so old school

6003
03:32:35,340 --> 03:32:37,340
like some dudes

6004
03:32:37,340 --> 03:32:39,340
running a magazine just like making a magazine

6005
03:32:39,340 --> 03:32:41,340
out of their garage or whatever

6006
03:32:41,340 --> 03:32:43,340
yeah TV doesn't exist anymore

6007
03:32:43,340 --> 03:32:45,340
I don't understand

6008
03:32:45,340 --> 03:32:47,340
do kids today watch TV

6009
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:49,340
they watch TV in the sense they'll watch shows

6010
03:32:49,340 --> 03:32:51,340
on like a streaming service I guess

6011
03:32:51,340 --> 03:32:53,340
but I don't understand how network television

6012
03:32:53,340 --> 03:32:55,340
is still afloat

6013
03:32:55,340 --> 03:32:57,340
boomers

6014
03:32:57,340 --> 03:32:59,340
I guess all boomers are still watching TV

6015
03:32:59,340 --> 03:33:01,340
there's more boomers than there are kids

6016
03:33:01,340 --> 03:33:03,340
because as soon as you're like 19

6017
03:33:03,340 --> 03:33:05,340
you're a boomer now

6018
03:33:05,340 --> 03:33:07,340
they lowered the age of boomer first they lowered down to 30 year old boomer

6019
03:33:07,340 --> 03:33:09,340
now it's like anyone who isn't

6020
03:33:09,340 --> 03:33:11,340
you know people

6021
03:33:11,340 --> 03:33:13,340
people still listen to the radio

6022
03:33:13,340 --> 03:33:15,340
like the radio is not

6023
03:33:15,340 --> 03:33:17,340
like going away

6024
03:33:17,340 --> 03:33:19,340
radio has like a long easy reach

6025
03:33:19,340 --> 03:33:21,340
like it's really easy to broadcast

6026
03:33:21,340 --> 03:33:23,340
well it's not like super easy to broadcast things yourself

6027
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:25,340
I mean actually it is pretty easy like I don't know if you know

6028
03:33:25,340 --> 03:33:27,340
like review bra like report of the week guy

6029
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:29,340
he is like obsessed with like radio

6030
03:33:29,340 --> 03:33:31,340
he has like a radio show that he hosts and stuff

6031
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:33,340
wait really no I

6032
03:33:33,340 --> 03:33:35,340
I did not know about that

6033
03:33:35,340 --> 03:33:37,340
that's very funny

6034
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:39,340
he's an old fashioned kind of guy

6035
03:33:39,340 --> 03:33:41,340
he gave me a shout out on one of his shows once

6036
03:33:41,340 --> 03:33:43,340
really that's awesome

6037
03:33:43,340 --> 03:33:45,340
I knew I knew about his radio show but I didn't listen to it

6038
03:33:45,340 --> 03:33:47,340
yeah I only listen to it a couple times

6039
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:49,340
but like it's just like interesting

6040
03:33:49,340 --> 03:33:51,340
like it's also weird that like a normal person

6041
03:33:51,340 --> 03:33:53,340
can have a radio show where you like play like copyrighted music

6042
03:33:53,340 --> 03:33:55,340
and stuff like I don't understand how the rules

6043
03:33:55,340 --> 03:33:57,340
about music on the radio work but there's like

6044
03:33:57,340 --> 03:33:59,340
some weird interesting shit going on over there

6045
03:33:59,340 --> 03:34:01,340
well you pay commission

6046
03:34:01,340 --> 03:34:03,340
like a little bit of money for each song you play

6047
03:34:03,340 --> 03:34:05,340
doesn't that sound like that

6048
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:07,340
you can get like a license or something I really don't know the details

6049
03:34:07,340 --> 03:34:09,340
I don't want to speak and like say a bunch of bullshit

6050
03:34:09,340 --> 03:34:11,340
that's not true

6051
03:34:11,340 --> 03:34:13,340
like in the day they'd get like a check in the mail

6052
03:34:13,340 --> 03:34:15,340
of like here's how many times your song

6053
03:34:15,340 --> 03:34:17,340
was played on the radio in the entire world

6054
03:34:17,340 --> 03:34:19,340
this week and it's like well

6055
03:34:19,340 --> 03:34:21,340
billions and billions of dollars

6056
03:34:21,340 --> 03:34:23,340
now it's like your song was played

6057
03:34:23,340 --> 03:34:25,340
like 14 million times on Spotify

6058
03:34:25,340 --> 03:34:27,340
this week here's $20

6059
03:34:27,340 --> 03:34:29,340
yeah it's like nothing you get

6060
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:31,340
streaming rights are like it's a whole fucked up situation

6061
03:34:31,340 --> 03:34:33,340
I'm not a musical artist so I don't even know

6062
03:34:33,340 --> 03:34:35,340
what is the pay

6063
03:34:35,340 --> 03:34:37,340
is actually pretty good

6064
03:34:37,340 --> 03:34:39,340
I think it's been getting better

6065
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:41,340
someone posted how much money they make for each streaming service

6066
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:43,340
and Napster was the most

6067
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:45,340
what? how?

6068
03:34:47,340 --> 03:34:49,340
uh cause it's a paid service now

6069
03:34:49,340 --> 03:34:51,340
and some music artists

6070
03:34:51,340 --> 03:34:53,340
gets the most money from Napster than

6071
03:34:53,340 --> 03:34:55,340
any other streaming service

6072
03:34:55,340 --> 03:34:57,340
I can't remember who it was I did see that

6073
03:34:57,340 --> 03:34:59,340
yeah me neither

6074
03:34:59,340 --> 03:35:01,340
who the fuck like how is Napster still a thing

6075
03:35:01,340 --> 03:35:03,340
it was like a mainstream artist wasn't it

6076
03:35:03,340 --> 03:35:05,340
yeah

6077
03:35:05,340 --> 03:35:07,340
it wasn't like Drake or something was it

6078
03:35:07,340 --> 03:35:09,340
I guess it still exists but I can't go like

6079
03:35:09,340 --> 03:35:11,340
find a paid version of Kazaa and Limewire

6080
03:35:11,340 --> 03:35:13,340
uh

6081
03:35:13,340 --> 03:35:15,340
uh

6082
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:17,340
they couldn't cope with the changes

6083
03:35:19,340 --> 03:35:21,340
yeah what were you gonna say about review?

6084
03:35:21,340 --> 03:35:23,340
oh I was just gonna ask like what does

6085
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:25,340
his radio show about

6086
03:35:25,340 --> 03:35:27,340
oh he just like talks about his life

6087
03:35:27,340 --> 03:35:29,340
and stuff it's not like

6088
03:35:29,340 --> 03:35:31,340
he's not like talking about like food on it

6089
03:35:31,340 --> 03:35:33,340
or anything like he's apart from like

6090
03:35:33,340 --> 03:35:35,340
I guess that is his job

6091
03:35:35,340 --> 03:35:37,340
my question

6092
03:35:37,340 --> 03:35:39,340
is like why

6093
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:41,340
why do it on the radio?

6094
03:35:41,340 --> 03:35:43,340
why not stream it on like

6095
03:35:43,340 --> 03:35:45,340
why not do it a podcast where it would get way more views

6096
03:35:45,340 --> 03:35:47,340
that's just cause that's just how he likes

6097
03:35:47,340 --> 03:35:49,340
he just likes the radio like the technology

6098
03:35:49,340 --> 03:35:51,340
there's like it beams all across the

6099
03:35:51,340 --> 03:35:53,340
planets like people across in other countries

6100
03:35:53,340 --> 03:35:55,340
can hear it and he's like send they send back

6101
03:35:55,340 --> 03:35:57,340
people in other countries can see it on the internet

6102
03:35:57,340 --> 03:35:59,340
I don't

6103
03:35:59,340 --> 03:36:01,340
well a lot of he's talking about like

6104
03:36:01,340 --> 03:36:03,340
countries that don't have easy access to internet stuff

6105
03:36:03,340 --> 03:36:05,340
but yeah like I do know what you mean

6106
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:07,340
I agree with you like it's very old fashioned

6107
03:36:07,340 --> 03:36:09,340
okay I mean

6108
03:36:09,340 --> 03:36:11,340
I'm genuinely curious like

6109
03:36:11,340 --> 03:36:13,340
does broadcasting via radio

6110
03:36:13,340 --> 03:36:15,340
give you like access to some

6111
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:17,340
audience that like you could not reach

6112
03:36:17,340 --> 03:36:19,340
via the internet

6113
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:21,340
yeah it does

6114
03:36:21,340 --> 03:36:23,340
I thought it was the opposite

6115
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:25,340
unless it's like a global like network

6116
03:36:25,340 --> 03:36:27,340
or whatever like series or something

6117
03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:29,340
yeah I would think that if you were doing it radio

6118
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:31,340
you would be like you would specifically

6119
03:36:31,340 --> 03:36:33,340
reaching like a local audience like

6120
03:36:33,340 --> 03:36:35,340
they would have to be like somewhat geographically

6121
03:36:35,340 --> 03:36:37,340
near he like buys

6122
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:39,340
time slots with some fucking

6123
03:36:39,340 --> 03:36:41,340
company or something that broadcasted around

6124
03:36:41,340 --> 03:36:43,340
the world I really don't know the details so I don't

6125
03:36:43,340 --> 03:36:45,340
want to look into it yourself

6126
03:36:45,340 --> 03:36:47,340
not just you Ben and people I'm talking to but the

6127
03:36:47,340 --> 03:36:49,340
viewer or the listener listening to this right now

6128
03:36:49,340 --> 03:36:51,340
if you don't believe me look up I'm sure

6129
03:36:51,340 --> 03:36:53,340
you could find him talking about it on the

6130
03:36:53,340 --> 03:36:55,340
radio show because he's you know that's one of the things he's

6131
03:36:55,340 --> 03:36:57,340
interested in it's just an

6132
03:36:57,340 --> 03:36:59,340
interesting thing it's just an interesting that like

6133
03:36:59,340 --> 03:37:01,340
radio still exists

6134
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:03,340
imagine being okay it's just such a

6135
03:37:03,340 --> 03:37:05,340
weird thing because like

6136
03:37:05,340 --> 03:37:07,340
if you're

6137
03:37:07,340 --> 03:37:09,340
review brah like the one thing you

6138
03:37:09,340 --> 03:37:11,340
don't have to worry about

6139
03:37:11,340 --> 03:37:13,340
is like how am I going to reach

6140
03:37:13,340 --> 03:37:15,340
my audience right

6141
03:37:15,340 --> 03:37:17,340
exactly like that's the one thing you'd be like

6142
03:37:17,340 --> 03:37:19,340
like that's settled like like your

6143
03:37:19,340 --> 03:37:21,340
method of like

6144
03:37:21,340 --> 03:37:23,340
reaching an audience is you got it

6145
03:37:23,340 --> 03:37:25,340
that's crazy that's crazy

6146
03:37:25,340 --> 03:37:27,340
I don't know

6147
03:37:27,340 --> 03:37:29,340
who's is to broadcast a radio show to I don't know

6148
03:37:29,340 --> 03:37:31,340
some like a few thousands

6149
03:37:31,340 --> 03:37:33,340
of people like people listen to the radio you know it's not

6150
03:37:33,340 --> 03:37:35,340
like some nobody listens to it but like yes

6151
03:37:35,340 --> 03:37:37,340
he literally has like millions of subs you could easily

6152
03:37:37,340 --> 03:37:39,340
have more people and get eyeballs on it

6153
03:37:39,340 --> 03:37:41,340
if you wanted I don't know some people just like

6154
03:37:41,340 --> 03:37:43,340
certain things I don't know

6155
03:37:43,340 --> 03:37:45,340
I sort of get I like some old technology I like

6156
03:37:45,340 --> 03:37:47,340
my old CRT TV

6157
03:37:47,340 --> 03:37:49,340
I'd be curious is it just

6158
03:37:49,340 --> 03:37:51,340
about like is it just

6159
03:37:51,340 --> 03:37:53,340
about like loving the technology

6160
03:37:53,340 --> 03:37:55,340
or is it about like

6161
03:37:55,340 --> 03:37:57,340
reaching like a different community like is like

6162
03:37:57,340 --> 03:37:59,340
the community of like the radio

6163
03:37:59,340 --> 03:38:01,340
listener like

6164
03:38:01,340 --> 03:38:03,340
his parents

6165
03:38:03,340 --> 03:38:05,340
I would have seen he simply does not care

6166
03:38:05,340 --> 03:38:07,340
who's listening

6167
03:38:07,340 --> 03:38:09,340
I think it's a combination of both those things like

6168
03:38:09,340 --> 03:38:11,340
he's happy to get the people who would you know

6169
03:38:11,340 --> 03:38:13,340
only listen to radio but he just he's doing it because

6170
03:38:13,340 --> 03:38:15,340
he likes radio like I really do think that is the main thing

6171
03:38:15,340 --> 03:38:17,340
like he just wants to do it that's his hobby

6172
03:38:17,340 --> 03:38:19,340
he just enjoys it

6173
03:38:19,340 --> 03:38:21,340
he like listens to other radio shows too

6174
03:38:21,340 --> 03:38:23,340
you know what I mean and like he's like

6175
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:25,340
I mean most

6176
03:38:25,340 --> 03:38:27,340
most boomer for people just

6177
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:29,340
you know if you're like a right-wing pundit

6178
03:38:29,340 --> 03:38:31,340
for instance you just do a podcast

6179
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:33,340
but you just like pretend it's a radio

6180
03:38:33,340 --> 03:38:35,340
show like you just you have

6181
03:38:35,340 --> 03:38:37,340
you have the microphone and you set it up

6182
03:38:37,340 --> 03:38:39,340
the studio so it looks like

6183
03:38:39,340 --> 03:38:41,340
a Howard Stern like like like

6184
03:38:41,340 --> 03:38:43,340
broadcasting station or whatever you just you just

6185
03:38:43,340 --> 03:38:45,340
pretend you're on the radio and other what otherwise

6186
03:38:45,340 --> 03:38:47,340
do nothing differently

6187
03:38:47,340 --> 03:38:49,340
that's the easiest way to post your microphone

6188
03:38:49,340 --> 03:38:51,340
yeah that's the easiest way to do it

6189
03:38:51,340 --> 03:38:53,340
but I guess I think some

6190
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:55,340
boomers authentic thing

6191
03:38:55,340 --> 03:38:57,340
that sort of ties in like boomers are

6192
03:38:57,340 --> 03:38:59,340
comforted by the fact that radio has like

6193
03:38:59,340 --> 03:39:01,340
barely changed like I remember listening to the annoying

6194
03:39:01,340 --> 03:39:03,340
shitty radio DJ

6195
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:05,340
morning hosts when I was a kid and you can turn on the radio today

6196
03:39:05,340 --> 03:39:07,340
and it's the same exact annoying shitty banter

6197
03:39:07,340 --> 03:39:09,340
you know it's like exactly the same medium as it was

6198
03:39:09,340 --> 03:39:11,340
30 years ago and like longer back

6199
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:13,340
than that I can have I guess

6200
03:39:13,340 --> 03:39:15,340
I can appreciate

6201
03:39:15,340 --> 03:39:17,340
I guess I can appreciate that

6202
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:19,340
I wonder if I wonder if I'll be

6203
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:21,340
the same with like

6204
03:39:21,340 --> 03:39:23,340
God I don't know

6205
03:39:23,340 --> 03:39:25,340
I was already having my insane boomer

6206
03:39:25,340 --> 03:39:27,340
moment about forums you know what I mean earlier

6207
03:39:27,340 --> 03:39:29,340
this podcast or someone listening

6208
03:39:29,340 --> 03:39:31,340
would be like what the fuck is these guys talking about

6209
03:39:31,340 --> 03:39:33,340
with forums these fucking crazy old boomers

6210
03:39:33,340 --> 03:39:35,340
what am I gonna what am I gonna have

6211
03:39:35,340 --> 03:39:37,340
my boomer moment about is it gonna be like

6212
03:39:37,340 --> 03:39:39,340
video game analysis

6213
03:39:39,340 --> 03:39:41,340
YouTube videos is that what I'm gonna be like

6214
03:39:41,340 --> 03:39:43,340
like oh they don't make up like they used to

6215
03:39:43,340 --> 03:39:45,340
come over here to me

6216
03:39:45,340 --> 03:39:47,340
come watch toki meki memorial

6217
03:39:47,340 --> 03:39:49,340
we've grown analysts we're just not gonna do it right

6218
03:39:51,340 --> 03:39:53,340
they don't put the cartoon avatar

6219
03:39:53,340 --> 03:39:55,340
in the bottom right corner anymore

6220
03:39:55,340 --> 03:39:57,340
how my arms aren't even crossed how do you know he's mad

6221
03:39:57,340 --> 03:39:59,340
how am I

6222
03:39:59,340 --> 03:40:01,340
they do they do they do do that actually

6223
03:40:01,340 --> 03:40:03,340
it's vtubers

6224
03:40:03,340 --> 03:40:05,340
the media hasn't been the same since rich got hairplugs

6225
03:40:05,340 --> 03:40:07,340
really rude on the show

6226
03:40:07,340 --> 03:40:09,340
I was um

6227
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:11,340
I was thinking about vtubers

6228
03:40:11,340 --> 03:40:13,340
yeah vtubers is basically like

6229
03:40:13,340 --> 03:40:15,340
yeah it's it's kind of

6230
03:40:15,340 --> 03:40:17,340
the next step it is it is the next

6231
03:40:17,340 --> 03:40:19,340
logical evolution of like the little

6232
03:40:19,340 --> 03:40:21,340
the cartoon avatar in the corner

6233
03:40:21,340 --> 03:40:23,340
um I okay

6234
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:25,340
I hate vtubers I hate them

6235
03:40:25,340 --> 03:40:27,340
um and the reason why I hate them

6236
03:40:27,340 --> 03:40:29,340
is because all right on the endless

6237
03:40:29,340 --> 03:40:31,340
war twitter account I

6238
03:40:31,340 --> 03:40:33,340
subscribe to like two vtubers because

6239
03:40:33,340 --> 03:40:35,340
they were slime themed vtubers

6240
03:40:35,340 --> 03:40:37,340
one of them was like a marshmallow

6241
03:40:37,340 --> 03:40:39,340
slime girl and the other was like a little slime

6242
03:40:39,340 --> 03:40:41,340
ball and I was like that's funny it

6243
03:40:41,340 --> 03:40:43,340
would be funny if I followed these slime vtubers

6244
03:40:43,340 --> 03:40:45,340
on the endless war account

6245
03:40:45,340 --> 03:40:47,340
so I did and now my feed

6246
03:40:47,340 --> 03:40:49,340
is nothing but vtubers they're all getting

6247
03:40:49,340 --> 03:40:51,340
recommended to me and I

6248
03:40:51,340 --> 03:40:53,340
I hate them I hate them so much

6249
03:40:53,340 --> 03:40:55,340
they are so cloying

6250
03:40:55,340 --> 03:40:57,340
and desperate and annoying they're all

6251
03:40:57,340 --> 03:40:59,340
just like oh other vtubers

03:40:59,340 --> 03:41:01,340

let me just reiterate for listeners

6261
03:41:17,340 --> 03:41:19,340
Ben St hates vtubers because he

6262
03:41:19,340 --> 03:41:21,340
chose of his own free will to

6263
03:41:21,340 --> 03:41:23,340
follow vtubers that he didn't even watch

6264
03:41:23,340 --> 03:41:25,340
on his twitter account and now they're putting him on

6265
03:41:25,340 --> 03:41:27,340

03:41:37,340 --> 03:41:39,340

03:42:15,340 --> 03:42:17,340
Ben you could just block them

6291
03:42:17,340 --> 03:42:19,340
no

6292
03:42:19,340 --> 03:42:21,340
that's I know he can't do that then he wouldn't

6293
03:42:21,340 --> 03:42:23,340
be able to complain about it you them you turn off

6294
03:42:23,340 --> 03:42:25,340
retweets you guys are being uncharitable

6295
03:42:25,340 --> 03:42:27,340
to me I did not follow these people

6296
03:42:27,340 --> 03:42:29,340
these people because I followed these other

6297
03:42:29,340 --> 03:42:31,340
two these just all

6298
03:42:31,340 --> 03:42:33,340
just tons of others just just keep

6299
03:42:33,340 --> 03:42:35,340
appearing I think it's maybe

6300
03:42:35,340 --> 03:42:37,340
it's because those two like follow a bunch

6301
03:42:37,340 --> 03:42:39,340
of other ones and so I get like shown

6302
03:42:39,340 --> 03:42:41,340
them because I follow

6303
03:42:41,340 --> 03:42:43,340
your tweet wait do you not set your twitter to

6304
03:42:43,340 --> 03:42:45,340
only show like recent tweets

6305
03:42:45,340 --> 03:42:47,340
you're getting random recommendations I don't get that on twitter

6306
03:42:47,340 --> 03:42:49,340
I don't know

6307
03:42:49,340 --> 03:42:51,340
I didn't really fuck with the settings

6308
03:42:51,340 --> 03:42:53,340
I don't know

6309
03:42:53,340 --> 03:42:55,340
I do everything I can to avoid getting

6310
03:42:55,340 --> 03:42:57,340
like random recommendations by the algorithm

6311
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:59,340
I only want to see

6312
03:42:59,340 --> 03:43:01,340
tweets in chronological order yeah people I follow

6313
03:43:01,340 --> 03:43:03,340
and that's why I'm getting I'm getting recommend

6314
03:43:03,340 --> 03:43:05,340
it and it's all just like

6315
03:43:05,340 --> 03:43:07,340
and it's they all just

6316
03:43:07,340 --> 03:43:09,340
they all just want to they all just want to like

6317
03:43:09,340 --> 03:43:11,340
collab and like share one another's

6318
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:13,340
audience there's and like play games with

6319
03:43:13,340 --> 03:43:15,340
each other and like build their they're all

6320
03:43:15,340 --> 03:43:17,340
like like a regular you super make

6321
03:43:17,340 --> 03:43:19,340
connection I know

6322
03:43:19,340 --> 03:43:21,340
they're just playing the cloud game they're playing

6323
03:43:21,340 --> 03:43:23,340
the cloud game like anyone else it's fine

6324
03:43:23,340 --> 03:43:25,340
I can't hold it against them just like

6325
03:43:25,340 --> 03:43:27,340
Lindsay Ellis I can't hold it against them

6326
03:43:27,340 --> 03:43:29,340
it's just annoying when I see it

6327
03:43:29,340 --> 03:43:31,340
Hey

6328
03:43:31,340 --> 03:43:33,340
do you ever think about how much money you could

6329
03:43:33,340 --> 03:43:35,340
make if you made like a failure vtuber and got

6330
03:43:35,340 --> 03:43:37,340
like a lady player I have

6331
03:43:37,340 --> 03:43:39,340
thought about it I don't know who I would get

6332
03:43:39,340 --> 03:43:41,340
to do it though I think I think about that

6333
03:43:41,340 --> 03:43:43,340
a lot with my characters and like fuck

6334
03:43:43,340 --> 03:43:45,340
I wish I had a girl voice

6335
03:43:45,340 --> 03:43:47,340
I do sort of just I was

6336
03:43:47,340 --> 03:43:49,340
for the record I was being uncharitable

6337
03:43:49,340 --> 03:43:51,340
on purpose to Ben and I want to say

6338
03:43:51,340 --> 03:43:53,340
I know some fair points

6339
03:43:53,340 --> 03:43:55,340
like there is some there is something very

6340
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:57,340
like I there's already

6341
03:43:57,340 --> 03:43:59,340
a weird parasocial aspect to being a youtuber

6342
03:43:59,340 --> 03:44:01,340
okay but it feels like vtubers are like

6343
03:44:01,340 --> 03:44:03,340
aware of that and they're like leaning into it

6344
03:44:03,340 --> 03:44:05,340
on purpose yeah they feed off it

6345
03:44:05,340 --> 03:44:07,340
I don't I

6346
03:44:07,340 --> 03:44:09,340
I'm being I mean I'm being a little

6347
03:44:09,340 --> 03:44:11,340
you know like obviously I don't

6348
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:13,340
have to read these posts but I don't know

6349
03:44:13,340 --> 03:44:15,340
so something about something about the

6350
03:44:15,340 --> 03:44:17,340
content creation plus

6351
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:19,340
like an extra little visual thing

6352
03:44:19,340 --> 03:44:21,340
it not there are good ones

6353
03:44:21,340 --> 03:44:23,340
I've seen good ones I'm sure

6354
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:25,340
the problem is that most of them are streamers

6355
03:44:25,340 --> 03:44:27,340
and that's just not content I'm interested in

6356
03:44:27,340 --> 03:44:29,340
yeah yeah yeah it's mostly streamers

6357
03:44:29,340 --> 03:44:31,340
and it's all

6358
03:44:31,340 --> 03:44:33,340
like it's all

6359
03:44:33,340 --> 03:44:35,340
it's all like the same like it's all the same product

6360
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:37,340
but it's all

6361
03:44:37,340 --> 03:44:39,340
it's okay okay easier for me to

6362
03:44:39,340 --> 03:44:41,340
like see the appeal when it's like I'm only seeing

6363
03:44:41,340 --> 03:44:43,340
the highest quality vtuber moment and I'm only

6364
03:44:43,340 --> 03:44:45,340
seeing them animated by beautiful professional

6365
03:44:45,340 --> 03:44:47,340
like animation level you know what I mean like

6366
03:44:47,340 --> 03:44:49,340
like that's my only exposure to it because I'm not going out

6367
03:44:49,340 --> 03:44:51,340
there searching for

6368
03:44:51,340 --> 03:44:53,340
but I totally get we're coming there's just there's

6369
03:44:53,340 --> 03:44:55,340
just something a little a little weird to me about

6370
03:44:55,340 --> 03:44:57,340
like okay anyone who

6371
03:44:57,340 --> 03:44:59,340
can like you know it's like the barrier

6372
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:01,340
to entry to be a vtuber is not that high

6373
03:45:01,340 --> 03:45:03,340
you can you don't

6374
03:45:03,340 --> 03:45:05,340
need like a hugely expensive

6375
03:45:05,340 --> 03:45:07,340
rig to have

6376
03:45:07,340 --> 03:45:09,340
what it takes to call yourself a vtuber and so it's just

6377
03:45:09,340 --> 03:45:11,340
it's just a little weird to see like so

6378
03:45:11,340 --> 03:45:13,340
many of them

6379
03:45:13,340 --> 03:45:15,340
all just kind of trying to do

6380
03:45:15,340 --> 03:45:17,340
I mean you know

6381
03:45:17,340 --> 03:45:19,340
there's there's there's there's not that much

6382
03:45:19,340 --> 03:45:21,340
it's weirdly corporate there's not that much

6383
03:45:21,340 --> 03:45:23,340
there's this weird thing about it it's not about being corporate

6384
03:45:23,340 --> 03:45:25,340
it's about the fact that like how like how different

6385
03:45:25,340 --> 03:45:27,340
can these be from

6386
03:45:27,340 --> 03:45:29,340
each other and yet they're all there's so many

6387
03:45:29,340 --> 03:45:31,340
of them right yeah everyone

6388
03:45:31,340 --> 03:45:33,340
just wants to be like it's not necessarily about

6389
03:45:33,340 --> 03:45:35,340
being corporate but everyone just wants to follow that model

6390
03:45:35,340 --> 03:45:37,340
and no one wants to like do really creative interesting

6391
03:45:37,340 --> 03:45:39,340
things like I mean you know I guess I can't blame

6392
03:45:39,340 --> 03:45:41,340
people for wanting to be a cute anime girl instead of like a

6393
03:45:41,340 --> 03:45:43,340
weird fucked up monster but I want to see more

6394
03:45:43,340 --> 03:45:45,340
weird vtuber there's just too many of them

6395
03:45:45,340 --> 03:45:47,340
to for me to be like okay

6396
03:45:47,340 --> 03:45:49,340
like like how many of them do they really

6397
03:45:49,340 --> 03:45:51,340
need to be how how many of them

6398
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:53,340
do we really need you know it's I

6399
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:55,340
yeah dude I

6400
03:45:55,340 --> 03:45:57,340
when member kizuna I she was like the only

6401
03:45:57,340 --> 03:45:59,340
one and everyone's like oh look at this new thing

6402
03:45:59,340 --> 03:46:01,340
and then you know there was like a new then there were a few

6403
03:46:01,340 --> 03:46:03,340
of them she was like the first one to mine

6404
03:46:03,340 --> 03:46:05,340
all I mean she wouldn't probably not the first ever

6405
03:46:05,340 --> 03:46:07,340
really blow up and then she just sort of fell off

6406
03:46:07,340 --> 03:46:09,340
because of some reasons I don't give a fuck

6407
03:46:09,340 --> 03:46:11,340
and then there was coronae coronae was coronae

6408
03:46:11,340 --> 03:46:13,340
the dog one and then there's like a couple others

6409
03:46:13,340 --> 03:46:15,340
that got really popular and now you're right now

6410
03:46:15,340 --> 03:46:17,340
there's a million of these fucking people and

6411
03:46:17,340 --> 03:46:19,340
like it's like impossible and like they're all there's

6412
03:46:19,340 --> 03:46:21,340
so many of them that have like a over a million subs and stuff

6413
03:46:21,340 --> 03:46:23,340
I have to say I am disappointed

6414
03:46:23,340 --> 03:46:25,340
in the NSFW like vtuber

6415
03:46:25,340 --> 03:46:27,340
scene because project melody

6416
03:46:27,340 --> 03:46:29,340
was also on there pretty early and got super

6417
03:46:29,340 --> 03:46:31,340
popular and she's got like this freedy model

6418
03:46:31,340 --> 03:46:33,340
and stuff and she does like porn streams

6419
03:46:33,340 --> 03:46:35,340
and I'm sitting here like

6420
03:46:35,340 --> 03:46:37,340
why are you not like

6421
03:46:37,340 --> 03:46:39,340
there are so many like

6422
03:46:39,340 --> 03:46:41,340
like fetish content

6423
03:46:41,340 --> 03:46:43,340
that you could be doing that because

6424
03:46:43,340 --> 03:46:45,340
you're like a cartoon character you could actually

6425
03:46:45,340 --> 03:46:47,340
do it like breast expansion

6426
03:46:47,340 --> 03:46:49,340
or whatever the fuck

6427
03:46:49,340 --> 03:46:51,340
and just no one fucking does it

6428
03:46:51,340 --> 03:46:53,340
it's like you're wasting

6429
03:46:53,340 --> 03:46:55,340
so much potential

6430
03:46:55,340 --> 03:46:57,340
like literally why bother

6431
03:46:57,340 --> 03:46:59,340
it's about the teas

6432
03:46:59,340 --> 03:47:01,340
she's got like the full

6433
03:47:01,340 --> 03:47:03,340
you have to deliver at some point

6434
03:47:03,340 --> 03:47:05,340
you have to deliver on the teas eventually

6435
03:47:07,340 --> 03:47:09,340
she's got like a full

6436
03:47:09,340 --> 03:47:11,340
body rig

6437
03:47:11,340 --> 03:47:13,340
like her rig is obviously

6438
03:47:13,340 --> 03:47:15,340
you know like not something

6439
03:47:15,340 --> 03:47:17,340
that your average schmuck

6440
03:47:17,340 --> 03:47:19,340
could afford to be doing

6441
03:47:19,340 --> 03:47:21,340
yeah it is a little

6442
03:47:21,340 --> 03:47:23,340
weird that like I don't know

6443
03:47:23,340 --> 03:47:25,340
I don't know there's something a little strange about

6444
03:47:25,340 --> 03:47:27,340
people trying to you know

6445
03:47:27,340 --> 03:47:29,340
foster this whole parasocial thing where you're like

6446
03:47:29,340 --> 03:47:31,340
but it's funny because it's like oh it's like nobody

6447
03:47:31,340 --> 03:47:33,340
thinks that they're really talking to a cute

6448
03:47:33,340 --> 03:47:35,340
anime girl like everyone's aware like everyone's

6449
03:47:35,340 --> 03:47:37,340
aware that like it's a shared

6450
03:47:37,340 --> 03:47:39,340
delusion right like

6451
03:47:39,340 --> 03:47:41,340
you know that there's a real human behind that screen

6452
03:47:41,340 --> 03:47:43,340
like that's the implicit understanding

6453
03:47:43,340 --> 03:47:45,340
because some people sort of lose track of that but like

6454
03:47:45,340 --> 03:47:47,340
that's my understanding right

6455
03:47:47,340 --> 03:47:49,340
it's like you can't like get mad at a guy

6456
03:47:49,340 --> 03:47:51,340
for simping over some vtuber

6457
03:47:51,340 --> 03:47:53,340
it's like his choice I guess I don't know

6458
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:55,340
when you have

6459
03:47:55,340 --> 03:47:57,340
you know when the barrier to entry

6460
03:47:57,340 --> 03:47:59,340
is low to do a thing that

6461
03:47:59,340 --> 03:48:01,340
lots of people to do

6462
03:48:01,340 --> 03:48:03,340
this parasocial thing

6463
03:48:03,340 --> 03:48:05,340
and lots of people try to get in

6464
03:48:05,340 --> 03:48:07,340
on that action it's

6465
03:48:07,340 --> 03:48:09,340
it creates a

6466
03:48:09,340 --> 03:48:11,340
I don't know it just creates a vibe

6467
03:48:11,340 --> 03:48:13,340
of like

6468
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:15,340
they're all just like

6469
03:48:15,340 --> 03:48:17,340
to the untrained eye

6470
03:48:17,340 --> 03:48:19,340
to a kind of checked out sort of

6471
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:21,340
step back like looking at it from a distance

6472
03:48:21,340 --> 03:48:23,340
viewpoint it just looks like

6473
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:25,340
the sea of like

6474
03:48:25,340 --> 03:48:27,340
identical creatures all just like

6475
03:48:27,340 --> 03:48:29,340
kind of like just yammering

6476
03:48:29,340 --> 03:48:31,340
yammering in the same

6477
03:48:31,340 --> 03:48:33,340
it's almost like they're inspired

6478
03:48:33,340 --> 03:48:35,340
by the anime industry

6479
03:48:35,340 --> 03:48:37,340
yeah

6480
03:48:37,340 --> 03:48:39,340
you looked at those seasonal charts

6481
03:48:39,340 --> 03:48:41,340
in the last few years

6482
03:48:41,340 --> 03:48:43,340
holy fuck

6483
03:48:43,340 --> 03:48:45,340
like when it was okay

6484
03:48:45,340 --> 03:48:47,340
on the one hand like I guess it's good

6485
03:48:47,340 --> 03:48:49,340
for things to be accessible

6486
03:48:49,340 --> 03:48:51,340
it's good for I like that the barrier

6487
03:48:51,340 --> 03:48:53,340
to entry to things is low

6488
03:48:53,340 --> 03:48:55,340
so I like that things don't have to be

6489
03:48:55,340 --> 03:48:57,340
corporate right because those ones that got popular

6490
03:48:57,340 --> 03:48:59,340
early on they were all owned by like

6491
03:48:59,340 --> 03:49:01,340
that one same corporation

6492
03:49:01,340 --> 03:49:03,340
I forget what it's called but like

6493
03:49:03,340 --> 03:49:05,340
you know hololive

6494
03:49:05,340 --> 03:49:07,340
like a bunch of those people are like

6495
03:49:07,340 --> 03:49:09,340
names and you know

6496
03:49:09,340 --> 03:49:11,340
maybe if the technology

6497
03:49:11,340 --> 03:49:13,340
is more accessible that's good

6498
03:49:13,340 --> 03:49:15,340
but I guess on the other hand

6499
03:49:15,340 --> 03:49:17,340
then it leads to this

6500
03:49:17,340 --> 03:49:19,340
this chatter this community chatter that is

6501
03:49:19,340 --> 03:49:21,340
so like so much

6502
03:49:21,340 --> 03:49:23,340
it's so much maybe we need

6503
03:49:23,340 --> 03:49:25,340
we need to keep more is what I'm saying

6504
03:49:25,340 --> 03:49:27,340
there's an underlying

6505
03:49:27,340 --> 03:49:29,340
air of like loneliness and desperation

6506
03:49:29,340 --> 03:49:31,340
of the entire vtuber fend

6507
03:49:31,340 --> 03:49:33,340
yes it's so bad

6508
03:49:33,340 --> 03:49:35,340
that's that might be what I'm picking up

6509
03:49:35,340 --> 03:49:37,340
on yeah

6510
03:49:37,340 --> 03:49:39,340
and I sort of get

6511
03:49:39,340 --> 03:49:41,340
what you're saying out with like the collaboration thing

6512
03:49:41,340 --> 03:49:43,340
like is like all these early generation

6513
03:49:43,340 --> 03:49:45,340
like corporate vtubers are popular

6514
03:49:45,340 --> 03:49:47,340
and they're all collabing with each other so it's just like

6515
03:49:47,340 --> 03:49:49,340
you know making even harder for newer people to get

6516
03:49:49,340 --> 03:49:51,340
a foothold you know they all have lore

6517
03:49:51,340 --> 03:49:53,340
and they all like exist in like a shared universe

6518
03:49:53,340 --> 03:49:55,340
and I mean yeah they have the same parent

6519
03:49:55,340 --> 03:49:57,340
company so they're all

6520
03:49:57,340 --> 03:49:59,340
you know they have these like

6521
03:49:59,340 --> 03:50:01,340
they're hooked up they're keyed in

6522
03:50:01,340 --> 03:50:03,340
it's funny they were

6523
03:50:03,340 --> 03:50:05,340
like so ready for this because it's just a new

6524
03:50:05,340 --> 03:50:07,340
version of idols you know what I mean I even have like

6525
03:50:07,340 --> 03:50:09,340
graduation ceremonies where they retire and shit

6526
03:50:09,340 --> 03:50:11,340
like it's literally just virtual idols at this point

6527
03:50:11,340 --> 03:50:13,340
like that's why they were so easily able to get

6528
03:50:13,340 --> 03:50:15,340
ready and capitalize on it Mary whether

6529
03:50:15,340 --> 03:50:17,340
he tweeted the other day that

6530
03:50:17,340 --> 03:50:19,340
like he never wants to graduate

6531
03:50:19,340 --> 03:50:21,340
and I didn't know what it meant

6532
03:50:21,340 --> 03:50:23,340
but then like in a tweet he clarified

6533
03:50:23,340 --> 03:50:25,340
it like in a reply he

6534
03:50:25,340 --> 03:50:27,340
clarified that it means

6535
03:50:27,340 --> 03:50:29,340
stop vtubing

6536
03:50:29,340 --> 03:50:31,340
and I was like oh

6537
03:50:31,340 --> 03:50:33,340
oh right right is that

6538
03:50:33,340 --> 03:50:35,340
from like an idol culture thing like when an idol

6539
03:50:35,340 --> 03:50:37,340
gets old enough they graduate because like it's

6540
03:50:37,340 --> 03:50:39,340
like you're too old now

6541
03:50:39,340 --> 03:50:41,340
it's literally just idol culture

6542
03:50:41,340 --> 03:50:43,340
I see I see you're too old now you're 20

6543
03:50:43,340 --> 03:50:45,340
you're 25 no one could ever

6544
03:50:45,340 --> 03:50:47,340
do they god 22

6545
03:50:47,340 --> 03:50:49,340
do they even make it 20%

6546
03:50:49,340 --> 03:50:51,340
because you can be an older

6547
03:50:51,340 --> 03:50:53,340
woman and be a vtuber and that's I think

6548
03:50:53,340 --> 03:50:55,340
it's a little slightly controversial for some

6549
03:50:55,340 --> 03:50:57,340
people because you know they get like docs and stuff of course

6550
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:59,340
yeah cuz in Japan they don't want to fuck kids

6551
03:50:59,340 --> 03:51:01,340
apparently

6552
03:51:01,340 --> 03:51:03,340
I heard Corona was

6553
03:51:03,340 --> 03:51:05,340
actually like 35 or something

6554
03:51:05,340 --> 03:51:07,340
Corona based

6555
03:51:07,340 --> 03:51:09,340
yeah good for her

6556
03:51:09,340 --> 03:51:11,340
I legitimately think that's a good thing like the older

6557
03:51:11,340 --> 03:51:13,340
people can you know it's not just like

6558
03:51:13,340 --> 03:51:15,340
you know people don't graduate

6559
03:51:15,340 --> 03:51:17,340
because they're getting aged out necessarily

6560
03:51:17,340 --> 03:51:19,340
it's more just like you know you have to

6561
03:51:19,340 --> 03:51:21,340
keep your rare

6562
03:51:21,340 --> 03:51:23,340
they all just want

6563
03:51:23,340 --> 03:51:25,340
forever it would kill hype and they wouldn't

6564
03:51:25,340 --> 03:51:27,340
be able to pump the new ones as much I don't know

6565
03:51:27,340 --> 03:51:29,340
I'm not like a vtuber expert I'm really not

6566
03:51:29,340 --> 03:51:31,340
so I don't want to speak with authority like I really

6567
03:51:31,340 --> 03:51:33,340
know what's going on behind the scenes

6568
03:51:33,340 --> 03:51:35,340
that being the case I don't really understand

6569
03:51:35,340 --> 03:51:37,340
why they do graduate

6570
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:39,340
because like what

6571
03:51:39,340 --> 03:51:41,340
if you're a popular vtuber

6572
03:51:41,340 --> 03:51:43,340
if you're a popular vtuber

6573
03:51:43,340 --> 03:51:45,340
why would you stop doing it because

6574
03:51:45,340 --> 03:51:47,340
like why what

6575
03:51:47,340 --> 03:51:49,340
the only one I heard about

6576
03:51:49,340 --> 03:51:51,340
who got fired

6577
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:53,340
or whatever is because they said something

6578
03:51:53,340 --> 03:51:55,340
like Taiwan is real or something

6579
03:51:55,340 --> 03:51:57,340
yeah uh someone

6580
03:51:57,340 --> 03:51:59,340
some big one retired

6581
03:51:59,340 --> 03:52:01,340
recently and it was like they're not

6582
03:52:01,340 --> 03:52:03,340
they're never gonna fire you they're gonna like

6583
03:52:03,340 --> 03:52:05,340
make you go through the whole song and dance of

6584
03:52:05,340 --> 03:52:07,340
graduating you know what I mean because

6585
03:52:07,340 --> 03:52:09,340
and you have to pretend that nothing bad is happening

6586
03:52:09,340 --> 03:52:11,340
they're totally not sending

6587
03:52:11,340 --> 03:52:13,340
you to the glue factory

6588
03:52:13,340 --> 03:52:15,340
it's so yeah it's such an ominous

6589
03:52:15,340 --> 03:52:17,340
thing or it's like it feels like a euphemism

6590
03:52:17,340 --> 03:52:19,340
like we're graduating it feels like they're getting

6591
03:52:19,340 --> 03:52:21,340
taken behind the shed and kills

6592
03:52:21,340 --> 03:52:23,340
the giver like

6593
03:52:23,340 --> 03:52:25,340
like oh yeah we're graduating them

6594
03:52:25,340 --> 03:52:27,340
like yeah we're putting them out

6595
03:52:27,340 --> 03:52:29,340
into the real world

6596
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:31,340
are we yeah

6597
03:52:31,340 --> 03:52:33,340
we're sending them to a magical place

6598
03:52:33,340 --> 03:52:35,340
uh

6599
03:52:35,340 --> 03:52:37,340
creepy

6600
03:52:37,340 --> 03:52:39,340
creepy

6601
03:52:39,340 --> 03:52:41,340
um

6602
03:52:41,340 --> 03:52:43,340
I don't

6603
03:52:43,340 --> 03:52:45,340
I don't know how we got

6604
03:52:45,340 --> 03:52:47,340
how did I get here oh no

6605
03:52:47,340 --> 03:52:49,340

conversations went

it was because

6609
03:52:55,340 --> 03:52:57,340

03:52:57,340 --> 03:52:59,340
the cartoon avatars

6611
03:52:59,340 --> 03:53:01,340

6640
03:53:57,340 --> 03:53:59,340
for sure she's definitely up there

6641
03:53:59,340 --> 03:54:01,340
she's one of the most

6642
03:54:01,340 --> 03:54:03,340
English ones right

6643
03:54:03,340 --> 03:54:05,340
I think she is

6644
03:54:05,340 --> 03:54:07,340
I checked the subscriber counts of a few at the time

6645
03:54:07,340 --> 03:54:09,340
like a year ago and she was like shooting up

6646
03:54:09,340 --> 03:54:11,340
like past two million subscribers really fast

6647
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:13,340
I recognize her so she's clearly

6648
03:54:13,340 --> 03:54:15,340
has some degree of

6649
03:54:15,340 --> 03:54:17,340
she's genuinely like

6650
03:54:17,340 --> 03:54:19,340
I think she genuinely has an extremely pleasant voice

6651
03:54:19,340 --> 03:54:21,340
to listen to it's very soothing

6652
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:23,340
and I think she definitely has voice training

6653
03:54:23,340 --> 03:54:25,340
because she has very fine control over

6654
03:54:25,340 --> 03:54:27,340
her voice when she does little

6655
03:54:27,340 --> 03:54:29,340
funny sounds that go up and down in pitch

6656
03:54:29,340 --> 03:54:31,340
it's like very well controlled

6657
03:54:31,340 --> 03:54:33,340
her and Korone and maybe

6658
03:54:33,340 --> 03:54:35,340
Amelia Watson are like the three

6659
03:54:35,340 --> 03:54:37,340
that I probably have seen the most

6660
03:54:37,340 --> 03:54:39,340
Amelia Watson is like a distant third

6661
03:54:39,340 --> 03:54:41,340
um I watched

6662
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:43,340
I watched some Amelia stuff too

6663
03:54:43,340 --> 03:54:45,340
I know the shark and I know

6664
03:54:45,340 --> 03:54:47,340
Pikami I know those two

6665
03:54:47,340 --> 03:54:49,340
Gargura is the shark

6666
03:54:49,340 --> 03:54:51,340
I don't know

6667
03:54:51,340 --> 03:54:53,340
I know Pikami because she has the funny face

6668
03:54:53,340 --> 03:54:55,340
I refuse to learn their names I only refer to the

6669
03:54:55,340 --> 03:54:57,340
the shark and the dog

6670
03:54:57,340 --> 03:54:59,340
I know one of them is a phoenix

6671
03:54:59,340 --> 03:55:01,340
that

6672
03:55:01,340 --> 03:55:03,340
I like this one's face

6673
03:55:03,340 --> 03:55:05,340
yes I know that one because she's like the tea kettle one

6674
03:55:05,340 --> 03:55:07,340
what

6675
03:55:07,340 --> 03:55:09,340
she makes tea kettle sounds

6676
03:55:09,340 --> 03:55:11,340
oh

6677
03:55:11,340 --> 03:55:13,340
her

6678
03:55:13,340 --> 03:55:15,340
she must not be a hololive

6679
03:55:15,340 --> 03:55:17,340
because she looks completely different

6680
03:55:17,340 --> 03:55:19,340
than all those people

6681
03:55:19,340 --> 03:55:21,340
yeah there are like independent ones

6682
03:55:21,340 --> 03:55:23,340
and I think there's like some people are talking about

6683
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:25,340
forming their own little conglomerate

6684
03:55:25,340 --> 03:55:27,340
separate from hololive and stuff

6685
03:55:27,340 --> 03:55:29,340
and then hiring management to sort it out

6686
03:55:29,340 --> 03:55:31,340
for them oh no this one's really

6687
03:55:31,340 --> 03:55:33,340
cute look at that

6688
03:55:33,340 --> 03:55:35,340
look at that that's

6689
03:55:35,340 --> 03:55:37,340
precious

6690
03:55:37,340 --> 03:55:39,340
that's Pikami

6691
03:55:39,340 --> 03:55:41,340
okay well now

6692
03:55:41,340 --> 03:55:43,340
with the words

6693
03:55:43,340 --> 03:55:45,340
with the words leading VTuber podcast now

6694
03:55:45,340 --> 03:55:47,340
amazing

6695
03:55:47,340 --> 03:55:49,340
this whole segment was like

6696
03:55:49,340 --> 03:55:51,340
fucking hate VTubers

6697
03:55:51,340 --> 03:55:53,340
I fucking hate them now

6698
03:55:53,340 --> 03:55:55,340
oh this one's alright this one's not so bad

6699
03:55:55,340 --> 03:55:57,340
oh but she's so cute though

6700
03:55:57,340 --> 03:55:59,340
you know what it's because

6701
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:01,340
I mean when you're a successful VTuber

6702
03:56:01,340 --> 03:56:03,340
you don't have to project that

6703
03:56:03,340 --> 03:56:05,340
like kind of desperate

6704
03:56:05,340 --> 03:56:07,340
air you have a desperate cloying

6705
03:56:07,340 --> 03:56:09,340
I feel bad because

6706
03:56:09,340 --> 03:56:11,340
I know it comes from a place of like

6707
03:56:11,340 --> 03:56:13,340
if you're trying to make it as a VTuber

6708
03:56:13,340 --> 03:56:15,340
you're in a really

6709
03:56:15,340 --> 03:56:17,340
tough spot and it must be really hard

6710
03:56:17,340 --> 03:56:19,340
and probably

6711
03:56:19,340 --> 03:56:21,340
basically statistically impossible

6712
03:56:21,340 --> 03:56:23,340
for you to ever claw your way up

6713
03:56:23,340 --> 03:56:25,340
to being popular from being

6714
03:56:25,340 --> 03:56:27,340
a nobody VTuber

6715
03:56:27,340 --> 03:56:29,340
so like I get it

6716
03:56:29,340 --> 03:56:31,340
but

6717
03:56:31,340 --> 03:56:33,340
I don't like but that doesn't mean I like it

6718
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:35,340
yeah

6719
03:56:35,340 --> 03:56:37,340
well look at her go

6720
03:56:37,340 --> 03:56:39,340
why don't they all put cat ears on

6721
03:56:39,340 --> 03:56:41,340
and ruin their aesthetic

6722
03:56:41,340 --> 03:56:43,340
all the time this one doesn't

6723
03:56:43,340 --> 03:56:45,340
some of them do

6724
03:56:45,340 --> 03:56:47,340
okay well no wait no I just found a gift

6725
03:56:47,340 --> 03:56:49,340
of her doing it with cat ears on

6726
03:56:49,340 --> 03:56:51,340
people like cat ears of course there's everyone

6727
03:56:51,340 --> 03:56:53,340
to put on the cat ears at some point

6728
03:56:53,340 --> 03:56:55,340
it really paced me off when I saw the shark one with cat ears

6729
03:56:55,340 --> 03:56:57,340
it's like she's already a shark don't make her two things

6730
03:56:57,340 --> 03:56:59,340
here's a hot take

6731
03:56:59,340 --> 03:57:01,340
there's no such thing

6732
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:03,340
as a anime girl with cat ears

6733
03:57:03,340 --> 03:57:05,340
that is good

6734
03:57:05,340 --> 03:57:07,340
the cat ears have never done anything

6735
03:57:07,340 --> 03:57:09,340
they're not good

6736
03:57:09,340 --> 03:57:11,340
they're not a good addition to a character design

6737
03:57:11,340 --> 03:57:13,340
ever never

6738
03:57:13,340 --> 03:57:15,340
that one in um

6739
03:57:15,340 --> 03:57:17,340
I don't like uh

6740
03:57:17,340 --> 03:57:19,340
what's that one anime

6741
03:57:19,340 --> 03:57:21,340
about the kid who fucks this

6742
03:57:21,340 --> 03:57:23,340
Aurora Borealis

6743
03:57:23,340 --> 03:57:25,340
oh Aurora

6744
03:57:25,340 --> 03:57:27,340
yeah it's like a

6745
03:57:27,340 --> 03:57:29,340
yeah ororaimu I don't like ororaimu

6746
03:57:29,340 --> 03:57:31,340
but that one cat

6747
03:57:31,340 --> 03:57:33,340
that girl with the cat ears is pretty good

6748
03:57:33,340 --> 03:57:35,340
isn't her name just

6749
03:57:35,340 --> 03:57:37,340
the thing about cat ears is like

6750
03:57:37,340 --> 03:57:39,340
do they have the regular human ears

6751
03:57:39,340 --> 03:57:41,340
below that do they have like four ears

6752
03:57:41,340 --> 03:57:43,340
it's just sort of like the

6753
03:57:43,340 --> 03:57:45,340
isn't it so cute to put cat ears

6754
03:57:45,340 --> 03:57:47,340
oh no it's not it does nothing

6755
03:57:47,340 --> 03:57:49,340
it does exactly nothing

6756
03:57:49,340 --> 03:57:51,340
it's completely neutral it just feels like

6757
03:57:51,340 --> 03:57:53,340
you're a fucking furry

6758
03:57:53,340 --> 03:57:55,340
I don't know

6759
03:57:55,340 --> 03:57:57,340
why there's such an infatuation with putting

6760
03:57:57,340 --> 03:57:59,340
cat ears on a person

6761
03:57:59,340 --> 03:58:01,340
I don't get it a real cat is cute

6762
03:58:01,340 --> 03:58:03,340
I think at a certain point they were supposed

6763
03:58:03,340 --> 03:58:05,340
at a certain point they were supposed to act

6764
03:58:05,340 --> 03:58:07,340
like a cat and like nuzzle up to you

6765
03:58:07,340 --> 03:58:09,340
and purr and ask for sex

6766
03:58:09,340 --> 03:58:11,340
real cats don't do that

6767
03:58:11,340 --> 03:58:13,340
that's why real cats are better

6768
03:58:13,340 --> 03:58:15,340
I guess I don't really

6769
03:58:15,340 --> 03:58:17,340
get why it's like the thing

6770
03:58:19,340 --> 03:58:21,340
I never like thought about it it's just like so

6771
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:23,340
ingrained

6772
03:58:23,340 --> 03:58:25,340
cat boy is a cuter

6773
03:58:25,340 --> 03:58:27,340
you should like do it for more

6774
03:58:27,340 --> 03:58:29,340
the animals than just cats

6775
03:58:29,340 --> 03:58:31,340
and sometimes dogs you just have like turtle people

6776
03:58:31,340 --> 03:58:33,340
you have a turtle a shell

6777
03:58:33,340 --> 03:58:35,340
I'm a turtle girl

6778
03:58:35,340 --> 03:58:37,340
like it's a new idea

6779
03:58:37,340 --> 03:58:39,340
our entire like anime is based around

6780
03:58:39,340 --> 03:58:41,340
girls being different sorts of animals

6781
03:58:41,340 --> 03:58:43,340
I guess Japan loves

6782
03:58:43,340 --> 03:58:45,340
horse girl shows that have been a thing recently

6783
03:58:45,340 --> 03:58:47,340
where they have like horse ears

6784
03:58:47,340 --> 03:58:49,340
and all the animals are having big

6785
03:58:49,340 --> 03:58:51,340
horse dicks and I'm like yes this is good

6786
03:58:51,340 --> 03:58:53,340
more of that please

6787
03:58:53,340 --> 03:58:55,340
in America we have bunny girls

6788
03:58:55,340 --> 03:58:57,340
like the playboy mansion

6789
03:58:57,340 --> 03:58:59,340
yeah we invented

6790
03:58:59,340 --> 03:59:01,340
we invented that

6791
03:59:01,340 --> 03:59:03,340
as always we did it just like Disney

6792
03:59:03,340 --> 03:59:05,340
and Tezuka as always America did it

6793
03:59:05,340 --> 03:59:07,340
first and better

6794
03:59:07,340 --> 03:59:09,340
we invented furries

6795
03:59:09,340 --> 03:59:11,340
it's just something about like the

6796
03:59:11,340 --> 03:59:13,340
ubiquity of the cat ears as a

6797
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:15,340
cute icon that I've just never agreed with

6798
03:59:15,340 --> 03:59:17,340
yeah I never I don't understand

6799
03:59:17,340 --> 03:59:19,340
like where did like they had to like come from

6800
03:59:19,340 --> 03:59:21,340
somewhere like the cat ears and just

6801
03:59:21,340 --> 03:59:23,340
spontaneously like they added

6802
03:59:23,340 --> 03:59:25,340
they added an armor attachment in Halo Infinite

6803
03:59:25,340 --> 03:59:27,340
which is the cat ears that you can put on any helmet

6804
03:59:27,340 --> 03:59:29,340
and it cost like

6805
03:59:29,340 --> 03:59:31,340
$15 to get them

6806
03:59:31,340 --> 03:59:33,340
it's insane and you better believe

6807
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:35,340
tons of people are paying for that oh no yeah

6808
03:59:35,340 --> 03:59:37,340
I play the game and I see fucking like

6809
03:59:37,340 --> 03:59:39,340
20 people out of like 30

6810
03:59:39,340 --> 03:59:41,340
that I play matches with what the fucking stupid

6811
03:59:41,340 --> 03:59:43,340
cat ears thing and it's like you morons

6812
03:59:43,340 --> 03:59:45,340
you stumbags

6813
03:59:45,340 --> 03:59:47,340
genius move on their part making it 15 bucks

6814
03:59:47,340 --> 03:59:49,340
because they knew they could just milk that one

6815
03:59:49,340 --> 03:59:51,340
it's just triangle

6816
03:59:53,340 --> 03:59:55,340
it's true

6817
03:59:55,340 --> 03:59:57,340
it literally is just triangles

6818
03:59:57,340 --> 03:59:59,340
people be really loving basic shapes

6819
03:59:59,340 --> 04:00:01,340
get some squares in there

6820
04:00:01,340 --> 04:00:03,340
they love the kiki on top of the boba

6821
04:00:03,340 --> 04:00:05,340
oh I know that

6822
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:07,340
I know that one

6823
04:00:07,340 --> 04:00:09,340
that reference

6824
04:00:09,340 --> 04:00:11,340
I suppose that's true

6825
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:13,340
I'm stating only the truest facts

6826
04:00:15,340 --> 04:00:17,340
I'm getting hungry

6827
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:19,340
it's muted

6828
04:00:19,340 --> 04:00:21,340
oh that's perfect I'm gonna make you hungry

6829
04:00:21,340 --> 04:00:23,340
I suggest you some food because my final topic

6830
04:00:23,340 --> 04:00:25,340
well actually it's the only topic

6831
04:00:25,340 --> 04:00:27,340
actually meant to bring on this episode

6832
04:00:27,340 --> 04:00:29,340
is I wanted to talk about some of the recipes

6833
04:00:29,340 --> 04:00:31,340
from cluster punk kitchens

6834
04:00:31,340 --> 04:00:33,340
especially the first one because it's actually

6835
04:00:33,340 --> 04:00:35,340
fucking delicious and one of the best things ever

6836
04:00:35,340 --> 04:00:37,340
I don't think anyone actually tried it

6837
04:00:37,340 --> 04:00:39,340
after I suggested it on the PCP

6838
04:00:39,340 --> 04:00:41,340
I can't remember it so yeah

6839
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:43,340
please

6840
04:00:43,340 --> 04:00:45,340
it will rehash it for us

6841
04:00:45,340 --> 04:00:47,340
the recipe

6842
04:00:47,340 --> 04:00:49,340
it's two ingredients

6843
04:00:49,340 --> 04:00:51,340
and

6844
04:00:51,340 --> 04:00:53,340
Doritos

6845
04:00:53,340 --> 04:00:55,340
oh

6846
04:00:55,340 --> 04:00:57,340
and what you do is you put the English muffin

6847
04:00:57,340 --> 04:00:59,340
in the toaster you butter it up

6848
04:00:59,340 --> 04:01:01,340
and then you put like five or six Doritos in there

6849
04:01:01,340 --> 04:01:03,340
and you crunch it down and you eat it

6850
04:01:03,340 --> 04:01:05,340
and it's fucking delicious

6851
04:01:05,340 --> 04:01:07,340
and everyone's like oh it seems sort of okay

6852
04:01:07,340 --> 04:01:09,340
but I have made this for like seven different friends of mine

6853
04:01:09,340 --> 04:01:11,340
and every single time I hand it to them

6854
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:13,340
they're a little skeptical if I take a bite

6855
04:01:13,340 --> 04:01:15,340
and then their eyes just light up

6856
04:01:15,340 --> 04:01:17,340
their life is changed take a bite change your life

6857
04:01:17,340 --> 04:01:19,340
and that's where it comes from is people

6858
04:01:19,340 --> 04:01:21,340
I made this

6859
04:01:21,340 --> 04:01:23,340
I invented this in like 2011

6860
04:01:23,340 --> 04:01:25,340
because I'm such a genius of just putting random shit together

6861
04:01:25,340 --> 04:01:27,340
and it is fucking tasty

6862
04:01:27,340 --> 04:01:29,340
it looks like a

6863
04:01:29,340 --> 04:01:31,340
McDuritos

6864
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:33,340
fucking breakfast sandwich

6865
04:01:33,340 --> 04:01:35,340
and you know what it sounds like a meme item

6866
04:01:35,340 --> 04:01:37,340
if I just heard that in voicemail

6867
04:01:37,340 --> 04:01:39,340
because Doritos and Mountain Dew they're such like meme foods

6868
04:01:39,340 --> 04:01:41,340
but hey if you say it's good

6869
04:01:41,340 --> 04:01:43,340
I'll consider trying it out

6870
04:01:43,340 --> 04:01:45,340
if I ever see English muffins

6871
04:01:45,340 --> 04:01:47,340
I'll consider it

6872
04:01:47,340 --> 04:01:49,340
I'll post your pictures

6873
04:01:49,340 --> 04:01:51,340
but you're English

6874
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:53,340
it's an American invention

6875
04:01:55,340 --> 04:01:57,340
they don't hold English muffins

6876
04:01:57,340 --> 04:01:59,340
we do have them

6877
04:01:59,340 --> 04:02:01,340
we have them in New Zealand too though

6878
04:02:01,340 --> 04:02:03,340
basically anyway you get crumpets

6879
04:02:03,340 --> 04:02:05,340
they'd be next to crumpets

6880
04:02:05,340 --> 04:02:07,340
they're always like sold next to the crumpets

6881
04:02:07,340 --> 04:02:09,340
like the worst crumpets that don't have the holes in them

6882
04:02:11,340 --> 04:02:13,340
they're basically like

6883
04:02:13,340 --> 04:02:15,340
the muffins at McDonald's

6884
04:02:15,340 --> 04:02:17,340
that's what they are

6885
04:02:17,340 --> 04:02:19,340
they're like really doughy bread

6886
04:02:19,340 --> 04:02:21,340
like all bread is doughy bread

6887
04:02:21,340 --> 04:02:23,340
but it's like

6888
04:02:23,340 --> 04:02:25,340
it's like doughier

6889
04:02:25,340 --> 04:02:27,340
not as fluffy it's more like

6890
04:02:27,340 --> 04:02:29,340
stodgy

6891
04:02:29,340 --> 04:02:31,340
more like stodgy bread

6892
04:02:31,340 --> 04:02:33,340
English muffins are fucking delicious

6893
04:02:33,340 --> 04:02:35,340
are they sweet or savory

6894
04:02:35,340 --> 04:02:37,340
the only time I eat them is when I have McDonald's breakfast

6895
04:02:37,340 --> 04:02:39,340
they're savory

6896
04:02:39,340 --> 04:02:41,340
I finish work at 6am

6897
04:02:41,340 --> 04:02:43,340
they're really good with butter

6898
04:02:43,340 --> 04:02:45,340
and Doritos

6899
04:02:45,340 --> 04:02:47,340
and you put them together and take a bite

6900
04:02:47,340 --> 04:02:49,340
change your life it's good

6901
04:02:49,340 --> 04:02:51,340
it's fucking delicious

6902
04:02:51,340 --> 04:02:53,340
everyone watching this try it at least once

6903
04:02:53,340 --> 04:02:55,340
you won't regret it

6904
04:02:55,340 --> 04:02:57,340
I promise

6905
04:02:57,340 --> 04:02:59,340
you're not allowed to hate it until you've tried it

6906
04:02:59,340 --> 04:03:01,340
I disagree I will hate it immediately

6907
04:03:01,340 --> 04:03:03,340
and forever

6908
04:03:03,340 --> 04:03:05,340
no

6909
04:03:05,340 --> 04:03:07,340
you gotta change my life

6910
04:03:07,340 --> 04:03:09,340
I've just been eating mozzarella cheese toasties recently

6911
04:03:09,340 --> 04:03:11,340
pancakes and I'm shit at that

6912
04:03:11,340 --> 04:03:13,340
that's another thing I failed at in my life

6913
04:03:13,340 --> 04:03:15,340
I don't

6914
04:03:15,340 --> 04:03:17,340
I can't cook

6915
04:03:17,340 --> 04:03:19,340
I can't do it

6916
04:03:19,340 --> 04:03:21,340
I get a canny soup

6917
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:23,340
the thing about clusterpot kitchen recipes

6918
04:03:23,340 --> 04:03:25,340
takes zero skill

6919
04:03:25,340 --> 04:03:27,340
zero skill whatsoever

6920
04:03:27,340 --> 04:03:29,340
I think everyone was

6921
04:03:29,340 --> 04:03:31,340
macaroni and cheese with

6922
04:03:31,340 --> 04:03:33,340
honey barbecue fritos which I don't know if you can get them outside of America

6923
04:03:33,340 --> 04:03:35,340
but I just mixed the chips

6924
04:03:35,340 --> 04:03:37,340
into the mac and cheese and it was

6925
04:03:37,340 --> 04:03:39,340
pretty good it's not when you're as good as the Doritos

6926
04:03:39,340 --> 04:03:41,340
there are any recipes that aren't just like

6927
04:03:41,340 --> 04:03:43,340
make something and then put chips in it

6928
04:03:43,340 --> 04:03:45,340
um

6929
04:03:45,340 --> 04:03:47,340
I guess it depends on whether you like the chips

6930
04:03:47,340 --> 04:03:49,340
the third recipe was make spaghetti sauce

6931
04:03:51,340 --> 04:03:53,340
the third recipe was make spaghetti sauce

6932
04:03:53,340 --> 04:03:55,340
you know with like ground beef and stuff

6933
04:03:55,340 --> 04:03:57,340
but put saltine crackers in it

6934
04:03:57,340 --> 04:03:59,340
and use the sauce as a dip

6935
04:03:59,340 --> 04:04:01,340
so no every recipe is

6936
04:04:01,340 --> 04:04:03,340
just put chips in a thing

6937
04:04:03,340 --> 04:04:05,340
which is also pretty good

6938
04:04:05,340 --> 04:04:07,340
but the first Doritos was on the top of like

6939
04:04:07,340 --> 04:04:09,340
a chili con carne

6940
04:04:09,340 --> 04:04:11,340
which is good

6941
04:04:11,340 --> 04:04:13,340
what are we looking at here

6942
04:04:13,340 --> 04:04:15,340
we're talking about clusterpot kitchen

6943
04:04:15,340 --> 04:04:17,340
Ben

6944
04:04:17,340 --> 04:04:19,340
I said I was hungry and now Oblivion Fool

6945
04:04:19,340 --> 04:04:21,340
was torturing me

6946
04:04:21,340 --> 04:04:23,340
Ben you have to put Doritos in an English muffin

6947
04:04:23,340 --> 04:04:25,340
with butter it's so fucking good you have no idea

6948
04:04:25,340 --> 04:04:27,340
like

6949
04:04:27,340 --> 04:04:29,340
crumbled up or just

6950
04:04:29,340 --> 04:04:31,340
no just like 5 or

6951
04:04:31,340 --> 04:04:33,340
just like between 4 or 5

6952
04:04:33,340 --> 04:04:35,340
Doritos put them like in an English muffin

6953
04:04:35,340 --> 04:04:37,340
you can like crunch it down

6954
04:04:37,340 --> 04:04:39,340
I don't see why is that better

6955
04:04:39,340 --> 04:04:41,340
why is that better than just eating Doritos

6956
04:04:43,340 --> 04:04:45,340
it's a meal

6957
04:04:45,340 --> 04:04:47,340
it just tastes really fucking good

6958
04:04:47,340 --> 04:04:49,340
it's a feast

6959
04:04:49,340 --> 04:04:51,340
it's a meal

6960
04:04:51,340 --> 04:04:53,340
everyone I save is to Ben doesn't believe me

6961
04:04:53,340 --> 04:04:55,340
and then I make it for them I give it to him

6962
04:04:55,340 --> 04:04:57,340
they take a bite, their eyes light up, their life is changed

6963
04:04:57,340 --> 04:04:59,340
take a bite, change your life, it's real

6964
04:04:59,340 --> 04:05:01,340
so you butter the English muffin

6965
04:05:01,340 --> 04:05:03,340
what flavor Dorino

6966
04:05:03,340 --> 04:05:05,340
can you do any flavor

6967
04:05:05,340 --> 04:05:07,340
the nacho cheese works best

6968
04:05:07,340 --> 04:05:09,340
I've tried a few different flavors but the nacho cheese works best

6969
04:05:09,340 --> 04:05:11,340
or cheese supreme

6970
04:05:11,340 --> 04:05:13,340
I know what all those ingredients taste like

6971
04:05:13,340 --> 04:05:15,340
I'm imagining them together

6972
04:05:15,340 --> 04:05:17,340
and I don't know if they

6973
04:05:17,340 --> 04:05:19,340
do they really enhance each other that much

6974
04:05:19,340 --> 04:05:21,340
I don't know

6975
04:05:21,340 --> 04:05:23,340
they really do

6976
04:05:23,340 --> 04:05:25,340
I mean maybe you'll hate it

6977
04:05:25,340 --> 04:05:27,340
but I've given it to like 7 people

6978
04:05:27,340 --> 04:05:29,340
I'm sure I wouldn't hate it

6979
04:05:29,340 --> 04:05:31,340
okay I mean if you say so

6980
04:05:31,340 --> 04:05:33,340
hmm

6981
04:05:33,340 --> 04:05:35,340
well now I'm worried I'm hyping it up

6982
04:05:35,340 --> 04:05:37,340
I just really like it

6983
04:05:37,340 --> 04:05:39,340
it's like the best thing to have

6984
04:05:39,340 --> 04:05:41,340
it's the best way to eat both of those things

6985
04:05:41,340 --> 04:05:43,340
if I had all

6986
04:05:43,340 --> 04:05:45,340
if I had any, well I have butter

6987
04:05:45,340 --> 04:05:47,340
but if I had those three things

6988
04:05:47,340 --> 04:05:49,340
I would try it

6989
04:05:49,340 --> 04:05:51,340
but I don't

6990
04:05:51,340 --> 04:05:53,340
have you ever been at a low enough point in your life

6991
04:05:53,340 --> 04:05:55,340
that you've had paster and beans

6992
04:05:55,340 --> 04:05:57,340
that sounds like an English thing

6993
04:05:57,340 --> 04:05:59,340
paster and beans

6994
04:05:59,340 --> 04:06:01,340
paster and baked beans

6995
04:06:01,340 --> 04:06:03,340
all you got left

6996
04:06:03,340 --> 04:06:05,340
that's what you got to eat

6997
04:06:05,340 --> 04:06:07,340
I mean sometimes I just have

6998
04:06:07,340 --> 04:06:09,340
rice and beans

6999
04:06:09,340 --> 04:06:11,340
rice and beans is

7000
04:06:11,340 --> 04:06:13,340
filling and it's very easy

7001
04:06:13,340 --> 04:06:15,340
and I don't think that's too bad

7002
04:06:15,340 --> 04:06:17,340
rice doesn't fill me up

7003
04:06:17,340 --> 04:06:19,340
whenever I have rice I get hungry again

7004
04:06:19,340 --> 04:06:21,340
oh you're eating shit rice

7005
04:06:21,340 --> 04:06:23,340
you need to get that good rice

7006
04:06:23,340 --> 04:06:25,340
I don't know what it is

7007
04:06:25,340 --> 04:06:27,340
well rice

7008
04:06:27,340 --> 04:06:29,340
rice has the problem that most

7009
04:06:29,340 --> 04:06:31,340
carbohydrates have for me

7010
04:06:31,340 --> 04:06:33,340
which is that I can feel like I can just

7011
04:06:33,340 --> 04:06:35,340
eat an infinite amount of it and never

7012
04:06:35,340 --> 04:06:37,340
stop being hungry

7013
04:06:37,340 --> 04:06:39,340
so yeah I'm with you on that

7014
04:06:39,340 --> 04:06:41,340
um

7015
04:06:41,340 --> 04:06:43,340
paster and beans

7016
04:06:43,340 --> 04:06:45,340
like what kind of beans

7017
04:06:45,340 --> 04:06:47,340
baked beans like in tomato sauce

7018
04:06:47,340 --> 04:06:49,340
oh right

7019
04:06:49,340 --> 04:06:51,340
the English

7020
04:06:51,340 --> 04:06:53,340
tomatoes

7021
04:06:53,340 --> 04:06:55,340
because okay

7022
04:06:55,340 --> 04:06:57,340
if the beans are in tomato sauce

7023
04:06:57,340 --> 04:06:59,340
that sort of makes a little more sense

7024
04:06:59,340 --> 04:07:01,340
then like it's not like beans and molasses

7025
04:07:01,340 --> 04:07:03,340
like we would have here

7026
04:07:03,340 --> 04:07:05,340
that would be disgusting

7027
04:07:05,340 --> 04:07:07,340
yeah

7028
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:09,340
more like that sounds gross

7029
04:07:09,340 --> 04:07:11,340
I don't think I've ever eaten molasses I don't even know what it is really

7030
04:07:11,340 --> 04:07:13,340
it's sugary stuff

7031
04:07:13,340 --> 04:07:15,340
I know it goes slow sometimes or something

7032
04:07:15,340 --> 04:07:17,340
isn't it sugary syrupy like super sticky

7033
04:07:17,340 --> 04:07:19,340
something or other

7034
04:07:19,340 --> 04:07:21,340
yeah the beans baked beans

7035
04:07:21,340 --> 04:07:23,340
but here they'd be in a can that have

7036
04:07:23,340 --> 04:07:25,340
it's sort of like a molassesy

7037
04:07:25,340 --> 04:07:27,340
sort of maybe caramel

7038
04:07:27,340 --> 04:07:29,340
not really caramel I don't know

7039
04:07:29,340 --> 04:07:31,340
it's like brown sugar it's like a thick

7040
04:07:31,340 --> 04:07:33,340
sort of brown sugary kind of

7041
04:07:33,340 --> 04:07:35,340
syrup

7042
04:07:35,340 --> 04:07:37,340
doesn't it go slow on a sundae or something

7043
04:07:37,340 --> 04:07:39,340
yeah it's very I mean pure molasses

7044
04:07:39,340 --> 04:07:41,340
is very thick

7045
04:07:41,340 --> 04:07:43,340
like it's like

7046
04:07:43,340 --> 04:07:45,340
it's thicker than

7047
04:07:45,340 --> 04:07:47,340
it's thicker than like peanut butter

7048
04:07:47,340 --> 04:07:49,340
basically it's like you can't even pour it

7049
04:07:49,340 --> 04:07:51,340
it's actually

7050
04:07:51,340 --> 04:07:53,340
I've tried I think

7051
04:07:53,340 --> 04:07:55,340
I tried like pure molasses

7052
04:07:55,340 --> 04:07:57,340
actually like gross

7053
04:07:57,340 --> 04:07:59,340
there's um

7054
04:07:59,340 --> 04:08:01,340
there's a scene in over the garden

7055
04:08:01,340 --> 04:08:03,340
is it over the garden wall

7056
04:08:03,340 --> 04:08:05,340
where they put molasses

7057
04:08:05,340 --> 04:08:07,340
they put molasses in their potatoes

7058
04:08:07,340 --> 04:08:09,340
and

7059
04:08:09,340 --> 04:08:11,340
and I'm convinced that that would be like vile

7060
04:08:13,340 --> 04:08:15,340
because like pure molasses is

7061
04:08:15,340 --> 04:08:17,340
like it is sweet but it's like

7062
04:08:17,340 --> 04:08:19,340
sickening like

7063
04:08:19,340 --> 04:08:21,340
sort of like powerful flavor

7064
04:08:21,340 --> 04:08:23,340
like you

7065
04:08:23,340 --> 04:08:25,340
you mix that shit

7066
04:08:25,340 --> 04:08:27,340
you don't just put a big dollop of it

7067
04:08:27,340 --> 04:08:29,340
on whatever you're eating

7068
04:08:29,340 --> 04:08:31,340
okay

7069
04:08:31,340 --> 04:08:33,340
yeah that's my molasses

7070
04:08:33,340 --> 04:08:35,340
rant

7071
04:08:35,340 --> 04:08:37,340
thanks for coming to

7072
04:08:37,340 --> 04:08:39,340
what's that about molasses

7073
04:08:39,340 --> 04:08:41,340
you would use it as like a baking ingredient

7074
04:08:41,340 --> 04:08:43,340
you could like bake it into like a bread

7075
04:08:43,340 --> 04:08:45,340
it's just sort of like a brown sugary

7076
04:08:45,340 --> 04:08:47,340
like dark

7077
04:08:47,340 --> 04:08:49,340
sweeteners

7078
04:08:49,340 --> 04:08:51,340
effects

7079
04:08:51,340 --> 04:08:53,340
anyway

7080
04:08:53,340 --> 04:08:55,340
the point is it would be terrible on pasta

7081
04:08:55,340 --> 04:08:57,340
just disgusting

7082
04:08:59,340 --> 04:09:01,340
okay I won't do that in the future

7083
04:09:01,340 --> 04:09:03,340
if I ever get a hold of it

7084
04:09:03,340 --> 04:09:05,340
instead of take a bite change your life

7085
04:09:05,340 --> 04:09:07,340
it should be

7086
04:09:07,340 --> 04:09:09,340
take a life

7087
04:09:09,340 --> 04:09:11,340
go to jail

7088
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:13,340
that's it okay yeah

7089
04:09:13,340 --> 04:09:15,340
take a life get out of here

7090
04:09:15,340 --> 04:09:17,340
take a life

7091
04:09:17,340 --> 04:09:19,340
kill

7092
04:09:19,340 --> 04:09:21,340
a wife

7093
04:09:21,340 --> 04:09:23,340
kill people for no reason

7094
04:09:23,340 --> 04:09:25,340
take my wife please

7095
04:09:25,340 --> 04:09:27,340
take a life take my wife take it all

7096
04:09:29,340 --> 04:09:31,340
you take the good you take the bad

7097
04:09:31,340 --> 04:09:33,340
you take the rest and there you have

7098
04:09:33,340 --> 04:09:35,340
the facts of life

7099
04:09:35,340 --> 04:09:37,340
speaking of good and bad

7100
04:09:37,340 --> 04:09:39,340
should we move on to voicemails

7101
04:09:39,340 --> 04:09:41,340
we've been going for 4 hours and 10 minutes

7102
04:09:41,340 --> 04:09:43,340

04:09:47,340 --> 04:09:49,340
we've gotten oh we've got

7106
04:09:49,340 --> 04:09:51,340
we've gotten two more voicemails

7107
04:09:51,340 --> 04:09:53,340
in the time

7108
04:09:53,340 --> 04:09:55,340
that we've been going so we should stop

7109
04:09:55,340 --> 04:09:57,340
because we don't we god we don't want any more voicemails

7110
04:09:57,340 --> 04:09:59,340

04:10:07,340 --> 04:10:09,340
don't worry about it

7116
04:10:09,340 --> 04:10:11,340
now

7117
04:10:11,340 --> 04:10:13,340
what a happy thought

7118
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:15,340
you're welcome

7119
04:10:15,340 --> 04:10:17,340
okay

7120
04:10:17,340 --> 04:10:19,340
let me just scroll down here I will put

7121
04:10:19,340 --> 04:10:21,340
the voicemails in

7122
04:10:21,340 --> 04:10:23,340
the chat

7123
04:10:23,340 --> 04:10:25,340
first one is

7124
04:10:25,340 --> 04:10:27,340
okay the first one is like

7125
04:10:27,340 --> 04:10:29,340
it's an emo it's like an emoji

7126
04:10:29,340 --> 04:10:31,340
but like it's not displaying so I don't know

7127
04:10:31,340 --> 04:10:33,340
what it's called whatever

7128
04:10:33,340 --> 04:10:35,340
here's the voicemail

7129
04:10:35,340 --> 04:10:37,340
three two one go

7130
04:10:37,340 --> 04:10:39,340
what if your life is a computer

7131
04:10:39,340 --> 04:10:41,340
simulation and you are the only one

7132
04:10:41,340 --> 04:10:43,340
in it so everyone you know

7133
04:10:43,340 --> 04:10:45,340
is an NPC do you think

7134
04:10:45,340 --> 04:10:47,340
this is a real possibility

7135
04:10:47,340 --> 04:10:49,340
it's sort of like 12 year old question

7136
04:10:49,340 --> 04:10:51,340
is this

7137
04:10:51,340 --> 04:10:53,340
yes and no

7138
04:10:53,340 --> 04:10:55,340
wait wait wait

7139
04:10:55,340 --> 04:10:57,340
xkcd train car

7140
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:01,340
that's so basic that's so basic

7141
04:11:01,340 --> 04:11:03,340
actually made me upset

7142
04:11:03,340 --> 04:11:05,340
I don't think it's a real possibility

7143
04:11:05,340 --> 04:11:07,340
it's a funny philosophical experiment

7144
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:09,340
I just want to know

7145
04:11:09,340 --> 04:11:11,340
who is running this fucking private server

7146
04:11:11,340 --> 04:11:13,340
with one player on it when they're hosting an MMO

7147
04:11:13,340 --> 04:11:15,340
it doesn't make any fucking sense

7148
04:11:17,340 --> 04:11:19,340
this is a classic xkcd

7149
04:11:19,340 --> 04:11:21,340
oh yeah

7150
04:11:21,340 --> 04:11:23,340
this exact topic

7151
04:11:23,340 --> 04:11:25,340
what if you're the only real one

7152
04:11:25,340 --> 04:11:27,340
you are

7153
04:11:27,340 --> 04:11:29,340
we're just ghosts

7154
04:11:29,340 --> 04:11:31,340
okay go ahead

7155
04:11:31,340 --> 04:11:33,340
here's my answer even if you're the only real person

7156
04:11:33,340 --> 04:11:35,340
you should still be nice to the NPCs

7157
04:11:35,340 --> 04:11:37,340
because you know

7158
04:11:37,340 --> 04:11:39,340
just don't be a piece of shit

7159
04:11:39,340 --> 04:11:41,340
come on

7160
04:11:41,340 --> 04:11:43,340
being a solopsist

7161
04:11:43,340 --> 04:11:45,340
and having no friends

7162
04:11:45,340 --> 04:11:47,340
you really are the only one in the universe then

7163
04:11:47,340 --> 04:11:49,340
if I was in a simulation on my own

7164
04:11:49,340 --> 04:11:51,340
I would say like why would they put me in such

7165
04:11:51,340 --> 04:11:53,340
a boring scenario

7166
04:11:53,340 --> 04:11:55,340
whoever's overseeing this

7167
04:11:55,340 --> 04:11:57,340
sim

7168
04:11:57,340 --> 04:11:59,340
dungeon master sucks

7169
04:11:59,340 --> 04:12:01,340
I'm obsessed about these hypotheticals

7170
04:12:01,340 --> 04:12:03,340
they're like what if this thing

7171
04:12:03,340 --> 04:12:05,340
that even if it was true wouldn't really have any bearing

7172
04:12:05,340 --> 04:12:07,340
on your life

7173
04:12:07,340 --> 04:12:09,340
like who gives a fuck

7174
04:12:09,340 --> 04:12:11,340
unless I can break the simulation

7175
04:12:11,340 --> 04:12:13,340
what am I supposed to do about it

7176
04:12:13,340 --> 04:12:15,340
that's true

7177
04:12:15,340 --> 04:12:17,340
next

7178
04:12:17,340 --> 04:12:19,340
okay

7179
04:12:19,340 --> 04:12:21,340
here we go

7180
04:12:21,340 --> 04:12:23,340
next one is called

7181
04:12:25,340 --> 04:12:27,340
it's called over cooked vocalist

7182
04:12:27,340 --> 04:12:29,340
over cooked vocalist

7183
04:12:29,340 --> 04:12:31,340
three two one

7184
04:12:31,340 --> 04:12:33,340
go

7185
04:12:33,340 --> 04:12:35,340
I

7186
04:12:35,340 --> 04:12:37,340
don't get fired

7187
04:12:37,340 --> 04:12:39,340
I

7188
04:12:39,340 --> 04:12:41,340
I

7189
04:12:41,340 --> 04:12:43,340
resigned

7190
04:12:43,340 --> 04:12:45,340
boo

7191
04:12:45,340 --> 04:12:47,340
no

7192
04:12:47,340 --> 04:12:49,340
no no no

7193
04:12:49,340 --> 04:12:51,340
that's enough

7194
04:12:51,340 --> 04:12:53,340
thank you for the voicemail

7195
04:12:53,340 --> 04:12:55,340
I like that one

7196
04:12:55,340 --> 04:12:57,340
fuck you for the voicemail

7197
04:12:57,340 --> 04:12:59,340
okay next

7198
04:12:59,340 --> 04:13:01,340
it's more intellectually stimulating

7199
04:13:01,340 --> 04:13:03,340
for sure

7200
04:13:03,340 --> 04:13:05,340
that was nothing

7201
04:13:05,340 --> 04:13:07,340
you people are insane

7202
04:13:07,340 --> 04:13:09,340
this is really what happens when I quit voicemails

7203
04:13:09,340 --> 04:13:11,340
yes this is what I said

7204
04:13:11,340 --> 04:13:13,340
no more good voicemail

7205
04:13:13,340 --> 04:13:15,340
quality of voicemail

7206
04:13:15,340 --> 04:13:17,340
it's cratered

7207
04:13:17,340 --> 04:13:19,340
you were keeping the whole

7208
04:13:19,340 --> 04:13:21,340
market afloat

7209
04:13:21,340 --> 04:13:23,340
the capital that they pumped into the stock

7210
04:13:23,340 --> 04:13:25,340
to keep it afloat

7211
04:13:25,340 --> 04:13:27,340
and now we've lost it

7212
04:13:27,340 --> 04:13:29,340
covid is running ramp at the omega variant

7213
04:13:29,340 --> 04:13:31,340
I meant to say omicron

7214
04:13:31,340 --> 04:13:33,340
but sure yeah let's go with omega

7215
04:13:33,340 --> 04:13:35,340
it's fucked

7216
04:13:35,340 --> 04:13:37,340
this is what we gotta work with

7217
04:13:37,340 --> 04:13:39,340
next one is an image

7218
04:13:39,340 --> 04:13:41,340
next voicemail is a picture

7219
04:13:41,340 --> 04:13:43,340
okay

7220
04:13:43,340 --> 04:13:45,340
I was approached by an odd looking 30 something guy

7221
04:13:45,340 --> 04:13:47,340
that said fuck dude

7222
04:13:47,340 --> 04:13:49,340
how tall are you you're huge

7223
04:13:49,340 --> 04:13:51,340
I said five foot one with my boots on

7224
04:13:51,340 --> 04:13:53,340
he said want to join our yig movement

7225
04:13:53,340 --> 04:13:55,340
to stir up more shit

7226
04:13:55,340 --> 04:13:57,340
I took off my sunglasses

7227
04:13:57,340 --> 04:13:59,340
and glazed hard at him

7228
04:13:59,340 --> 04:14:01,340
and showed him my belt buckle

7229
04:14:01,340 --> 04:14:03,340
he screamed like a little girl

7230
04:14:03,340 --> 04:14:05,340
and ran off he knew an ass kicking beat down

7231
04:14:05,340 --> 04:14:07,340
was next for him

7232
04:14:07,340 --> 04:14:09,340
laughing crying emojis

7233
04:14:09,340 --> 04:14:11,340
where do you get one of those belt buckles

7234
04:14:11,340 --> 04:14:13,340
uh why is it blue

7235
04:14:13,340 --> 04:14:15,340
looks great though

7236
04:14:15,340 --> 04:14:17,340
I should make those

7237
04:14:17,340 --> 04:14:19,340
don't tread on me though

7238
04:14:19,340 --> 04:14:21,340
I'd buy one

7239
04:14:21,340 --> 04:14:23,340
this is the gadson flag

7240
04:14:23,340 --> 04:14:25,340
don't bend saint oh no

7241
04:14:25,340 --> 04:14:27,340
angels don't step on saint

7242
04:14:27,340 --> 04:14:29,340
angels sing

7243
04:14:29,340 --> 04:14:31,340
my coming

7244
04:14:31,340 --> 04:14:33,340
okay oh speaking of

7245
04:14:33,340 --> 04:14:35,340
the next one is called cummy ben

7246
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:37,340
uh

7247
04:14:37,340 --> 04:14:39,340
here we go

7248
04:14:39,340 --> 04:14:41,340
there it is three two one go

7249
04:14:43,340 --> 04:14:45,340
please bring back gummy ben

7250
04:14:45,340 --> 04:14:47,340
keto gummies are the

7251
04:14:47,340 --> 04:14:49,340
best content you guys ever made

7252
04:14:49,340 --> 04:14:51,340
please ben I beg of you

7253
04:14:51,340 --> 04:14:53,340
I am sorry

7254
04:14:53,340 --> 04:14:55,340
but I can't

7255
04:14:55,340 --> 04:14:57,340
get the isomaltoligosaccharides

7256
04:14:57,340 --> 04:14:59,340
anymore

7257
04:14:59,340 --> 04:15:01,340
and it's the only thing that's good

7258
04:15:01,340 --> 04:15:03,340
I've tried other things that

7259
04:15:03,340 --> 04:15:05,340
everything else it's just not profitable at this point

7260
04:15:05,340 --> 04:15:07,340
to make them I mean

7261
04:15:07,340 --> 04:15:09,340
no I mean it was never not profitable

7262
04:15:09,340 --> 04:15:11,340
but you know it was never profitable it may saved money

7263
04:15:11,340 --> 04:15:13,340
for you in the sense that

7264
04:15:13,340 --> 04:15:15,340
it was a fit well I thought the whole point of making

7265
04:15:15,340 --> 04:15:17,340
gummies was you're like I don't want to pay these gummy

7266
04:15:17,340 --> 04:15:19,340
to sell me gummies I could make myself

7267
04:15:19,340 --> 04:15:21,340
it sort of was about that but then it became

7268
04:15:21,340 --> 04:15:23,340
more about the fact that they were just

7269
04:15:23,340 --> 04:15:25,340
good and I was just like I liked

7270
04:15:25,340 --> 04:15:27,340
that I could make them taste different ways

7271
04:15:27,340 --> 04:15:29,340
than I would normally be able to

7272
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:31,340
get he was he was pulling a review

7273
04:15:31,340 --> 04:15:33,340
bra and just doing something for himself yeah

7274
04:15:33,340 --> 04:15:35,340
just like to gummies and

7275
04:15:35,340 --> 04:15:37,340
he fell in love with it because he couldn't get

7276
04:15:37,340 --> 04:15:39,340
his Chinese chemicals it's not that

7277
04:15:39,340 --> 04:15:41,340
it became too expensive that I

7278
04:15:41,340 --> 04:15:43,340
couldn't buy it it's that like just

7279
04:15:43,340 --> 04:15:45,340
like I can't

7280
04:15:45,340 --> 04:15:47,340
I think I've said this before but like I

7281
04:15:47,340 --> 04:15:49,340
can't find anyone who will sell it to me

7282
04:15:49,340 --> 04:15:51,340
in like a reasonable quantity

7283
04:15:51,340 --> 04:15:53,340
like I can only find people

7284
04:15:53,340 --> 04:15:55,340
that will sell me like a metric ton of it

7285
04:15:55,340 --> 04:15:57,340
then do it make a metric just buy

7286
04:15:57,340 --> 04:15:59,340
a metric ton of it it's like

7287
04:15:59,340 --> 04:16:01,340
I don't want to spend thousands of fucking dollars

7288
04:16:01,340 --> 04:16:03,340
it'll be like that episode

7289
04:16:03,340 --> 04:16:05,340
of the Simpsons where Homer has the pile of sugar

7290
04:16:05,340 --> 04:16:07,340
in his backyard

7291
04:16:07,340 --> 04:16:09,340
but it's isomaltic

7292
04:16:09,340 --> 04:16:11,340
saccharides for gummies but think about how much money

7293
04:16:11,340 --> 04:16:13,340
you'll save on gummies over the course of the next

7294
04:16:13,340 --> 04:16:15,340
20 years no it'll just get rained on

7295
04:16:15,340 --> 04:16:17,340
the rain will just wash it all away

7296
04:16:17,340 --> 04:16:19,340
just kill him

7297
04:16:19,340 --> 04:16:21,340
it kills for your precious

7298
04:16:21,340 --> 04:16:23,340
acids I'm sad

7299
04:16:23,340 --> 04:16:25,340
I'm sad that I can't just buy

7300
04:16:25,340 --> 04:16:27,340
like a normal amount of it anymore

7301
04:16:27,340 --> 04:16:29,340
but I have not been able to

7302
04:16:29,340 --> 04:16:31,340
find a new supplier and other

7303
04:16:31,340 --> 04:16:33,340
like substitutes that I've tried

7304
04:16:33,340 --> 04:16:35,340
allulose tastes like shit cornfiber

7305
04:16:35,340 --> 04:16:37,340
tastes like shit it all sucks

7306
04:16:37,340 --> 04:16:39,340
it's all bad IMO is the only

7307
04:16:39,340 --> 04:16:41,340
stuff that made any kind of decent

7308
04:16:41,340 --> 04:16:43,340
final product and

7309
04:16:43,340 --> 04:16:45,340
it's straight up

7310
04:16:45,340 --> 04:16:47,340
my source is gone a metric ton of

7311
04:16:47,340 --> 04:16:49,340
Igaluga mogulagasecharides would be a

7312
04:16:49,340 --> 04:16:51,340
good stretch goal for

7313
04:16:51,340 --> 04:16:53,340
a new Kickstarter if you ever did another

7314
04:16:53,340 --> 04:16:55,340
metric ton

7315
04:16:57,340 --> 04:16:59,340
yeah well

7316
04:16:59,340 --> 04:17:01,340
no I love the future

7317
04:17:01,340 --> 04:17:03,340
where Ben is just throwing in gummies with

7318
04:17:03,340 --> 04:17:05,340
every package it's the new stupid thing

7319
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:07,340
that Ben needs but can't get it

7320
04:17:07,340 --> 04:17:09,340
honestly I would love

7321
04:17:09,340 --> 04:17:11,340
to make gummies

7322
04:17:11,340 --> 04:17:13,340
and give

7323
04:17:13,340 --> 04:17:15,340
those as backer rewards

7324
04:17:15,340 --> 04:17:17,340
or sell them to people or something

7325
04:17:17,340 --> 04:17:19,340
I would think that was really fun

7326
04:17:19,340 --> 04:17:21,340
dude you could

7327
04:17:21,340 --> 04:17:23,340
get a reputation as an art

7328
04:17:23,340 --> 04:17:25,340
comic convention type situation

7329
04:17:25,340 --> 04:17:27,340
you could be the gummy worm guy just hand out

7330
04:17:27,340 --> 04:17:29,340
gummy worms people would love you with a fire thing

7331
04:17:29,340 --> 04:17:31,340
everyone would be like oh check out the gummy guys stand

7332
04:17:31,340 --> 04:17:33,340
he makes a shitty slime comic but he gives out free gummies

7333
04:17:33,340 --> 04:17:35,340
yeah that's what I want everyone

7334
04:17:35,340 --> 04:17:37,340
to say about me

7335
04:17:37,340 --> 04:17:39,340
I wanted to get

7336
04:17:39,340 --> 04:17:41,340
a 3D mold I think

7337
04:17:41,340 --> 04:17:43,340
I talked to Smirig about this one time

7338
04:17:43,340 --> 04:17:45,340
and we never really went through with it

7339
04:17:45,340 --> 04:17:47,340
because I was still ironing out

7340
04:17:47,340 --> 04:17:49,340
the formula

7341
04:17:49,340 --> 04:17:51,340
but the idea at one point

7342
04:17:51,340 --> 04:17:53,340
was that I could maybe make

7343
04:17:53,340 --> 04:17:55,340
3D

7344
04:17:55,340 --> 04:17:57,340
printed gummy molds

7345
04:17:57,340 --> 04:17:59,340
of the various

7346
04:17:59,340 --> 04:18:01,340
fruits and vegetables that grow in

7347
04:18:01,340 --> 04:18:03,340
New Los Angeles city like dire apples

7348
04:18:03,340 --> 04:18:05,340
and

7349
04:18:05,340 --> 04:18:07,340
and phosphor poppies and stuff

7350
04:18:07,340 --> 04:18:09,340
custom gummies that's basic

7351
04:18:09,340 --> 04:18:11,340
custom New Los Angeles city gummies

7352
04:18:11,340 --> 04:18:13,340
that are like I could concoct

7353
04:18:13,340 --> 04:18:15,340
flavors for what each thing would taste

7354
04:18:15,340 --> 04:18:17,340
like and stuff

7355
04:18:17,340 --> 04:18:19,340
honestly I would

7356
04:18:19,340 --> 04:18:21,340
still do something like that I just

7357
04:18:21,340 --> 04:18:23,340
would need to get my fucking hands on

7358
04:18:23,340 --> 04:18:25,340
the other thing aside from not being able to get IMO

7359
04:18:25,340 --> 04:18:27,340
is that my kitchen now

7360
04:18:27,340 --> 04:18:29,340
is like shit

7361
04:18:29,340 --> 04:18:31,340
I used to have a slightly better kitchen

7362
04:18:31,340 --> 04:18:33,340
you know what that's not even that big

7363
04:18:33,340 --> 04:18:35,340
I could still do it I could just get

7364
04:18:35,340 --> 04:18:37,340
some new pots and pans and shit

7365
04:18:37,340 --> 04:18:39,340
and I could make it work if I wanted to

7366
04:18:39,340 --> 04:18:41,340
that's not really that big of a hurdle

7367
04:18:41,340 --> 04:18:43,340
stop getting this voicemailer's hope up if you're not going to return to the gummy arc

7368
04:18:43,340 --> 04:18:45,340
I'm saying

7369
04:18:45,340 --> 04:18:47,340
I wish I could return

7370
04:18:47,340 --> 04:18:49,340
I wish I could return to the gummy arc

7371
04:18:49,340 --> 04:18:51,340
honestly I kind of miss it

7372
04:18:51,340 --> 04:18:53,340
he likes gummies he just likes gummies

7373
04:18:53,340 --> 04:18:55,340
it's true

7374
04:18:55,340 --> 04:18:57,340
there's literally some PCP fan out there

7375
04:18:57,340 --> 04:18:59,340
who's just like god

7376
04:18:59,340 --> 04:19:01,340
Ben would make gummies again and talk about them

7377
04:19:01,340 --> 04:19:03,340
I would like nothing more

7378
04:19:03,340 --> 04:19:05,340
I would like nothing more

7379
04:19:05,340 --> 04:19:07,340
Ben talk about making roses and animal crossing again

7380
04:19:07,340 --> 04:19:09,340
that was

7381
04:19:09,340 --> 04:19:11,340
that was a mistake

7382
04:19:11,340 --> 04:19:13,340
that I should never

7383
04:19:13,340 --> 04:19:15,340
I should have never done that

7384
04:19:15,340 --> 04:19:17,340
at the end of the day there's just not that much

7385
04:19:17,340 --> 04:19:19,340
to say about it

7386
04:19:19,340 --> 04:19:21,340

7387
04:19:21,340 --> 04:19:23,340

I

7391
04:19:29,340 --> 04:19:31,340
maybe it was

7392
04:19:31,340 --> 04:19:33,340
later than that but

7393
04:19:33,340 --> 04:19:35,340

7449
04:21:25,340 --> 04:21:27,340
as they say or as bad as they say

7450
04:21:27,340 --> 04:21:29,340
and they didn't have to know where they talk about

7451
04:21:29,340 --> 04:21:31,340
all of his content

7452
04:21:31,340 --> 04:21:33,340
I hate it

7453
04:21:33,340 --> 04:21:35,340

7454
04:21:35,340 --> 04:21:37,340
that's the one

7455
04:21:37,340 --> 04:21:39,340
I know whatever I don't care

7456
04:21:39,340 --> 04:21:41,340
I didn't even know he was in it

7457
04:21:41,340 --> 04:21:43,340
and I hate everything thing

7458
04:21:43,340 --> 04:21:45,340
until I had seen a few episodes

7459
04:21:45,340 --> 04:21:47,340
I hate everything is good actually

7460
04:21:47,340 --> 04:21:49,340
I don't I genuinely don't know

7461
04:21:49,340 --> 04:21:51,340
I don't watch it

7462
04:21:51,340 --> 04:21:53,340
I come on jar media I have not watched one of his main channel videos

7463
04:21:53,340 --> 04:21:55,340
in years

7464
04:21:55,340 --> 04:21:57,340
I only know him from being on a podcast with

7465
04:21:57,340 --> 04:21:59,340
YMS

7466
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:01,340
that sucks

7467
04:22:01,340 --> 04:22:03,340
I haven't listened to it

7468
04:22:03,340 --> 04:22:05,340
I used to hate him because I hated his

7469
04:22:05,340 --> 04:22:07,340
weird angry cartoon avatar

7470
04:22:07,340 --> 04:22:09,340
but then I realized like it's easy

7471
04:22:09,340 --> 04:22:11,340
it has good branding

7472
04:22:11,340 --> 04:22:13,340
it's really ugly so it like you sticks out in

7473
04:22:13,340 --> 04:22:15,340
your memory like and I'm always saying

7474
04:22:15,340 --> 04:22:17,340
shit like why does everyone have to use a cute

7475
04:22:17,340 --> 04:22:19,340
cartoon avatar why can't everyone have weird ugly

7476
04:22:19,340 --> 04:22:21,340
looking avatars and there's one guy had that

7477
04:22:21,340 --> 04:22:23,340
and I'm like I fucking hate it it's ugly

7478
04:22:23,340 --> 04:22:25,340
yeah I saw the jar media

7479
04:22:25,340 --> 04:22:27,340
I think I probably started with the one about

7480
04:22:27,340 --> 04:22:29,340
the wall

7481
04:22:29,340 --> 04:22:31,340
and then I maybe saw one of their other ones about Doug

7482
04:22:31,340 --> 04:22:33,340
I watched their other one about Doug Walker

7483
04:22:33,340 --> 04:22:35,340
and then I think I was looking at their other ones

7484
04:22:35,340 --> 04:22:37,340
and I watched the one about angry Joe and I think that's the

7485
04:22:37,340 --> 04:22:39,340
video that's how I know most of what I know

7486
04:22:39,340 --> 04:22:41,340

7487
04:22:41,340 --> 04:22:43,340

7534
04:24:20,340 --> 04:24:22,340
with jealousy

7535
04:24:22,340 --> 04:24:24,340
when I see her it makes me

7536
04:24:24,340 --> 04:24:26,340
wanna flee

7537
04:24:26,340 --> 04:24:28,340
cause she looks so much more

7538
04:24:28,340 --> 04:24:30,340
cuter than me

7539
04:24:30,340 --> 04:24:32,340
oh god I am

7540
04:24:32,340 --> 04:24:34,340

04:24:34,340 --> 04:24:36,340
I haven't lost any steam

7542
04:24:36,340 --> 04:24:38,340
now let's try the

7543
04:24:38,340 --> 04:24:40,340
best

7544
04:24:40,340 --> 04:24:42,340
and be homeless

7545
04:24:46,340 --> 04:24:48,340
so I went down and bought me

7546
04:24:48,340 --> 04:24:50,340
an RV

7547
04:24:50,340 --> 04:24:52,340
that was a lie

7548
04:24:52,340 --> 04:24:54,340
there is no RV

7549
04:24:54,340 --> 04:24:56,340
in with my folks

7550
04:24:56,340 --> 04:24:58,340
they don't know

7551
04:24:58,340 --> 04:25:00,340
that I am a massive joke

7552
04:25:00,340 --> 04:25:02,340
then as a final like

7553
04:25:02,340 --> 04:25:04,340
ability cleanse

7554
04:25:04,340 --> 04:25:06,340
I tried to trash

7555
04:25:06,340 --> 04:25:08,340
it blew up in my face

7556
04:25:08,340 --> 04:25:10,340
as everything does

7557
04:25:10,340 --> 04:25:12,340
now I'm seething with rage

7558
04:25:12,340 --> 04:25:14,340
but pretends to love

7559
04:25:14,340 --> 04:25:16,340
oh god I am the American dream

7560
04:25:16,340 --> 04:25:18,340
fool the PCP

7561
04:25:18,340 --> 04:25:20,340
really makes me scream

7562
04:25:20,340 --> 04:25:22,340
and I'll do anything

7563
04:25:22,340 --> 04:25:24,340
to get some yen

7564

there's no in between

7583
04:26:08,340 --> 04:26:10,340
no one just

7584
04:26:10,340 --> 04:26:12,340
no one just like asks a normal

7585
04:26:12,340 --> 04:26:14,340
thought provoking question or anything

7586
04:26:14,340 --> 04:26:16,340
it's just like

7587
04:26:16,340 --> 04:26:18,340
they have to scream and like shit into

7588
04:26:18,340 --> 04:26:20,340
a microphone

7589
04:26:22,340 --> 04:26:24,340

7590
04:26:24,340 --> 04:26:26,340

7591
04:26:26,340 --> 04:26:28,340
I don't sing

7592
04:26:28,340 --> 04:26:30,340
I rap badly

7593
04:26:30,340 --> 04:26:32,340

7594
04:26:32,340 --> 04:26:34,340

7595
04:26:34,340 --> 04:26:36,340
do we have any idea who that was by

7596
04:26:36,340 --> 04:26:38,340
well it's by the same guy

7597
04:26:38,340 --> 04:26:40,340
who is sending voicemails

7598
04:26:40,340 --> 04:26:42,340
under the name drydumpdecember

7599
04:26:42,340 --> 04:26:44,340

7600
04:26:44,340 --> 04:26:46,340

04:26:46,340 --> 04:26:48,340
that's all I know

7602
04:26:48,340 --> 04:26:50,340
just full credit to that person

7603
04:26:50,340 --> 04:26:52,340
cause that was incredible

7604
04:26:52,340 --> 04:26:54,340
I think maybe

7605
04:26:54,340 --> 04:26:56,340
Dusty Dumps is going in the voice

7606
04:26:56,340 --> 04:26:58,340

7617
04:27:20,340 --> 04:27:22,340
I like Frank Zappa

7618
04:27:24,340 --> 04:27:26,340
next one is called

7619
04:27:26,340 --> 04:27:28,340
British man is upset

7620
04:27:28,340 --> 04:27:30,340
3, 2, 1

7621
04:27:30,340 --> 04:27:32,340
go

7622
04:27:32,340 --> 04:27:34,340
hello PCP

7623
04:27:34,340 --> 04:27:36,340
now couple of episodes you go

7624
04:27:36,340 --> 04:27:38,340
you said you would put

7625
04:27:38,340 --> 04:27:40,340
Kringus Bingus in the voice

7626
04:27:40,340 --> 04:27:42,340
grail we did

7627
04:27:42,340 --> 04:27:44,340
now that sounded great to me

7628
04:27:44,340 --> 04:27:46,340
but I checked the google documents

7629
04:27:46,340 --> 04:27:48,340
and not a single trace

7630
04:27:48,340 --> 04:27:50,340
of Kringus Bingus' name

7631
04:27:50,340 --> 04:27:52,340
is on that thing

7632
04:27:52,340 --> 04:27:54,340
so this

7633
04:27:54,340 --> 04:27:56,340
makes me think

7634
04:27:56,340 --> 04:27:58,340
you

7635
04:27:58,340 --> 04:28:00,340
had something better to do

7636
04:28:00,340 --> 04:28:02,340
you were busy with stuff

7637
04:28:02,340 --> 04:28:04,340
I mean that is just unimaginable

7638
04:28:04,340 --> 04:28:06,340
so put

7639
04:28:06,340 --> 04:28:08,340
Kringus Bingus on the dock

7640
04:28:08,340 --> 04:28:10,340
right now

7641
04:28:10,340 --> 04:28:12,340
or I'll be cancelling my

7642
04:28:12,340 --> 04:28:14,340
subscription

7643
04:28:14,340 --> 04:28:16,340

7644
04:28:20,340 --> 04:28:22,340
not vaguely British man

7645
04:28:22,340 --> 04:28:24,340
we can't lose his paper

7646
04:28:24,340 --> 04:28:26,340
at Cluster Punk Kitchen while you're at it

7647
04:28:26,340 --> 04:28:28,340
you still haven't done it

7648
04:28:28,340 --> 04:28:30,340
still never got added despite the promise

7649
04:28:30,340 --> 04:28:32,340
was there a promise?

7650
04:28:32,340 --> 04:28:34,340
listen I promise a lot of things

7651
04:28:34,340 --> 04:28:36,340
when Keto Delito happened

7652
04:28:36,340 --> 04:28:38,340
everyone was

7653
04:28:38,340 --> 04:28:40,340

7654
04:28:40,340 --> 04:28:42,340

04:28:42,340 --> 04:28:44,340
voice grail, voice grail

7656
04:28:44,340 --> 04:28:46,340
and then I checked the document and it never got updated

7657
04:28:46,340 --> 04:28:48,340
you know what that sounds true

7658
04:28:48,340 --> 04:28:50,340
I believe it

7659
04:28:50,340 --> 04:28:52,340

I was on the PCP

7700
04:30:18,340 --> 04:30:20,340
I met spork IRL

7701
04:30:20,340 --> 04:30:22,340
they drove up to my place

7702
04:30:22,340 --> 04:30:24,340
I

7703
04:30:24,340 --> 04:30:26,340
wouldn't have a plan on what we were going to do

7704
04:30:26,340 --> 04:30:28,340
or hang out

7705
04:30:28,340 --> 04:30:30,340
they just kidnapped me they threw me in their car

7706
04:30:30,340 --> 04:30:32,340
and drove around the block once asked me where to pee

7707
04:30:32,340 --> 04:30:34,340
and I pointed them at a big lots

7708
04:30:34,340 --> 04:30:36,340
and then they dropped me off back at home

7709
04:30:36,340 --> 04:30:38,340
when I showed them road to rad con

7710
04:30:38,340 --> 04:30:40,340
and then they left

7711
04:30:40,340 --> 04:30:42,340

7712
04:30:42,340 --> 04:30:44,340

7717
04:30:52,340 --> 04:30:54,340
away I think

7718
04:30:54,340 --> 04:30:56,340
yeah spork just came by

7719
04:30:56,340 --> 04:30:58,340
we met

7720
04:30:58,340 --> 04:31:00,340
I spoke to her very briefly

7721
04:31:00,340 --> 04:31:02,340
we were like in the same area for like 20 minutes

7722
04:31:02,340 --> 04:31:04,340
and then she fucked off

7723
04:31:04,340 --> 04:31:06,340
she was just stopping by

7724
04:31:06,340 --> 04:31:08,340
as a pit stop on the way to somewhere else

7725
04:31:08,340 --> 04:31:10,340
hmmm

7726
04:31:10,340 --> 04:31:12,340
fascinating

7727
04:31:12,340 --> 04:31:14,340
neat

7728
04:31:14,340 --> 04:31:16,340
well I don't know

7729
04:31:16,340 --> 04:31:18,340
the only time I

7730
04:31:18,340 --> 04:31:20,340
come without ejaculating

7731
04:31:20,340 --> 04:31:22,340
is if I've jerked off so many times

7732
04:31:22,340 --> 04:31:24,340
that like I just can't come anymore

7733
04:31:24,340 --> 04:31:26,340
but I just keep going

7734
04:31:26,340 --> 04:31:28,340
so

7735
04:31:28,340 --> 04:31:30,340
but I don't think that kind of feels like

7736
04:31:30,340 --> 04:31:32,340
what it

7737
04:31:32,340 --> 04:31:34,340
we're ejaculating about coming

7738
04:31:34,340 --> 04:31:36,340
because that's happened to me

7739
04:31:36,340 --> 04:31:38,340
I don't get it

7740
04:31:38,340 --> 04:31:40,340
isn't that called pissing?

7741
04:31:40,340 --> 04:31:42,340
yes

7742
04:31:42,340 --> 04:31:44,340
yeah it felt like pissing

7743
04:31:44,340 --> 04:31:46,340
you know pissing is a very important topic today

7744
04:31:46,340 --> 04:31:48,340
I feel

7745
04:31:48,340 --> 04:31:50,340
in our modern era

7746
04:31:50,340 --> 04:31:52,340

04:32:08,340 --> 04:32:10,340
he is coming

7755
04:32:10,340 --> 04:32:12,340
indeed

7756
04:32:12,340 --> 04:32:14,340
still coming

7757
04:32:14,340 --> 04:32:16,340
without ejaculating

7758
04:32:16,340 --> 04:32:18,340
he just got held up in traffic a little

7759
04:32:18,340 --> 04:32:20,340
okay I'm glad to know

7760
04:32:20,340 --> 04:32:22,340
I'm glad to know yeah it's good

7761
04:32:22,340 --> 04:32:24,340
it's comforting

7762
04:32:24,340 --> 04:32:26,340
wouldn't want anything

7763
04:32:26,340 --> 04:32:28,340
to fuck it up

7764
04:32:28,340 --> 04:32:30,340
for him

7765
04:32:30,340 --> 04:32:32,340
okay next one is another

7766
04:32:32,340 --> 04:32:34,340
image

7767
04:32:34,340 --> 04:32:36,340
okay

7768
04:32:36,340 --> 04:32:38,340
here we go

7769
04:32:38,340 --> 04:32:40,340
I feel like this is an old meme

7770
04:32:40,340 --> 04:32:42,340
there's definitely been versions of this

7771
04:32:42,340 --> 04:32:44,340
okay the soy bensaint

7772
04:32:44,340 --> 04:32:46,340
has a year long beef with washed up youtubers

7773
04:32:46,340 --> 04:32:48,340
works on game that few will play

7774
04:32:48,340 --> 04:32:50,340
buy my comics please

7775
04:32:50,340 --> 04:32:52,340
spends his A.R.'s ring of people on twitter

7776
04:32:52,340 --> 04:32:54,340
covid makes his brain shrink

7777
04:32:54,340 --> 04:32:56,340
those boobs are too big

7778
04:32:56,340 --> 04:32:58,340
that's not true

7779
04:32:58,340 --> 04:33:00,340
that's the opposite of what I said

7780
04:33:00,340 --> 04:33:02,340
I'm saying that

7781
04:33:02,340 --> 04:33:04,340
big boobs need

7782
04:33:04,340 --> 04:33:06,340
more representation

7783
04:33:06,340 --> 04:33:08,340
the ones I'm seeing are not doing it

7784
04:33:08,340 --> 04:33:10,340
this guy fundamentally

7785
04:33:10,340 --> 04:33:12,340
misunderstands the character of bensaint

7786
04:33:12,340 --> 04:33:14,340
what about the last one

7787
04:33:14,340 --> 04:33:16,340
on your side though

7788
04:33:16,340 --> 04:33:18,340
that was it

7789
04:33:18,340 --> 04:33:20,340
spends his days arguing with people on twitter

7790
04:33:20,340 --> 04:33:22,340
do you want to read that one

7791
04:33:22,340 --> 04:33:24,340
okay I tried

7792
04:33:24,340 --> 04:33:26,340
I said that

7793
04:33:26,340 --> 04:33:28,340
yeah whatever

7794
04:33:28,340 --> 04:33:30,340
these are all true

7795
04:33:30,340 --> 04:33:32,340
yeah my brain did shrink due to covid

7796
04:33:32,340 --> 04:33:34,340
but it's just more efficient now

7797
04:33:34,340 --> 04:33:36,340
the chad nate bestman

7798
04:33:36,340 --> 04:33:38,340
makes you fail no nate november

7799
04:33:38,340 --> 04:33:40,340
with chad content

7800
04:33:40,340 --> 04:33:42,340
abandons his friends that don't generate him enough profit

7801
04:33:42,340 --> 04:33:44,340
only networks with people

7802
04:33:44,340 --> 04:33:46,340
larger than him

7803
04:33:46,340 --> 04:33:48,340
weird utilitarianism pilled

7804
04:33:48,340 --> 04:33:50,340
visits family even with covid

7805
04:33:50,340 --> 04:33:52,340
lives down on people less

7806
04:33:52,340 --> 04:33:54,340
successful than him

7807
04:33:54,340 --> 04:33:56,340
I think this person just hates both of us

7808
04:33:56,340 --> 04:33:58,340
yeah

7809
04:33:58,340 --> 04:34:00,340
I get to look down on nate

7810
04:34:00,340 --> 04:34:02,340
subscriber number

7811
04:34:02,340 --> 04:34:04,340
sub count

7812
04:34:04,340 --> 04:34:06,340
yeah

7813
04:34:06,340 --> 04:34:08,340
true

7814
04:34:08,340 --> 04:34:10,340
kill him

7815
04:34:16,340 --> 04:34:18,340
I can't believe someone with more subscribers

7816
04:34:18,340 --> 04:34:20,340
than nate bestman is on the procrastinators podcast

7817
04:34:20,340 --> 04:34:22,340
that's unthinkable to me

7818
04:34:22,340 --> 04:34:24,340
oh my god I kind of forgot

7819
04:34:24,340 --> 04:34:26,340
cyber shell is just

7820
04:34:26,340 --> 04:34:28,340
just one of the bullets

7821
04:34:28,340 --> 04:34:30,340
but you only have

7822
04:34:30,340 --> 04:34:32,340
guests more popular than you

7823
04:34:32,340 --> 04:34:34,340
you fucking scumbag

7824
04:34:36,340 --> 04:34:38,340
you

7825
04:34:38,340 --> 04:34:40,340
yeah but not on youtube

7826
04:34:40,340 --> 04:34:42,340
cyber shell is like two nates in a trench coat

7827
04:34:42,340 --> 04:34:44,340
with his subscriber count

7828
04:34:44,340 --> 04:34:46,340
that's true

7829
04:34:46,340 --> 04:34:48,340
but you know

7830
04:34:48,340 --> 04:34:50,340
my subscribers are sonic fans

7831
04:34:50,340 --> 04:34:52,340
so do they really count as like a mole

7832
04:34:52,340 --> 04:34:54,340
true

7833
04:34:54,340 --> 04:34:56,340
according to god

7834
04:34:56,340 --> 04:34:58,340
a sonic fan is only half a human being

7835
04:34:58,340 --> 04:35:00,340
if that

7836
04:35:00,340 --> 04:35:02,340
I was hoping we could get to three quarters

7837
04:35:02,340 --> 04:35:04,340
but I guess

7838
04:35:04,340 --> 04:35:06,340
three fifths

7839
04:35:06,340 --> 04:35:08,340
three fifths

7840
04:35:08,340 --> 04:35:10,340
compromise

7841
04:35:10,340 --> 04:35:12,340
that was the real agreement

7842
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:14,340
they agreed

7843
04:35:14,340 --> 04:35:16,340
when noah's arc in the rainbow

7844
04:35:16,340 --> 04:35:18,340
fans will be three fifths

7845
04:35:18,340 --> 04:35:20,340
and that's just been the law

7846
04:35:20,340 --> 04:35:22,340
ever since

7847
04:35:22,340 --> 04:35:24,340
of course

7848
04:35:24,340 --> 04:35:26,340
next voicemail is called

7849
04:35:26,340 --> 04:35:28,340
where is it here we go

7850
04:35:28,340 --> 04:35:30,340
more ways to humiliate tricksy

7851
04:35:30,340 --> 04:35:32,340
ideas for ben

7852
04:35:32,340 --> 04:35:34,340
oh my god

7853
04:35:34,340 --> 04:35:36,340
two seconds

7854
04:35:36,340 --> 04:35:38,340
okay three two one go

7855
04:35:38,340 --> 04:35:40,340
kill her

7856
04:35:42,340 --> 04:35:44,340
that would be hilarious

7857
04:35:44,340 --> 04:35:46,340
that would be a humiliation

7858
04:35:46,340 --> 04:35:48,340
that would just be like

7859
04:35:48,340 --> 04:35:50,340
ultimate break

7860
04:35:50,340 --> 04:35:52,340
ultimate break

7861
04:35:54,340 --> 04:35:56,340
that's like the business simpsons were homeless

7862
04:35:56,340 --> 04:35:58,340
thinking of revenge for net flanders

7863
04:35:58,340 --> 04:36:00,340
and it's like the leftorium closes

7864
04:36:00,340 --> 04:36:02,340
then it goes further and flanders is dead

7865
04:36:02,340 --> 04:36:04,340
and he's like no too far

7866
04:36:04,340 --> 04:36:06,340
yeah too far

7867
04:36:06,340 --> 04:36:08,340
it wouldn't be funny then

7868
04:36:08,340 --> 04:36:10,340
yeah yeah yeah

7869
04:36:10,340 --> 04:36:12,340
I think

7870
04:36:12,340 --> 04:36:14,340
it might be a little funny

7871
04:36:14,340 --> 04:36:16,340
it might be a little funny

7872
04:36:20,340 --> 04:36:22,340

7878
04:36:32,340 --> 04:36:34,340

no objectification

7881
04:36:38,340 --> 04:36:40,340
without representation

7882
04:36:40,340 --> 04:36:42,340
not loot

7883
04:36:42,340 --> 04:36:44,340

7884
04:36:44,340 --> 04:36:46,340

7885
04:36:46,340 --> 04:36:48,340
that is good squish

7886
04:36:48,340 --> 04:36:50,340

7887
04:36:50,340 --> 04:36:52,340
I'm very

7888
04:36:52,340 --> 04:36:54,340
excited about how I came across

7889
04:36:54,340 --> 04:36:56,340
the huge forehead

7890
04:36:56,340 --> 04:36:58,340
my huge forehead

7891
04:36:58,340 --> 04:37:00,340
I appreciate it

7892
04:37:00,340 --> 04:37:02,340
I appreciate that you made me a girl

7893
04:37:02,340 --> 04:37:04,340
but you didn't just like take the easy way out

7894
04:37:04,340 --> 04:37:06,340
and give me like a cute

7895
04:37:06,340 --> 04:37:08,340
a cute girl hair

7896
04:37:08,340 --> 04:37:10,340
I'm a freak

7897
04:37:10,340 --> 04:37:12,340
I'm a big egg-headed freak

7898
04:37:12,340 --> 04:37:14,340
as a girl same as

7899
04:37:14,340 --> 04:37:16,340
same as it ever was

7900
04:37:16,340 --> 04:37:18,340
also I spy

7901
04:37:18,340 --> 04:37:20,340
I spy that soft tum

7902
04:37:20,340 --> 04:37:22,340
good detail

7903
04:37:22,340 --> 04:37:24,340
I see it

7904
04:37:24,340 --> 04:37:26,340
I don't like it it's making me

7905
04:37:26,340 --> 04:37:28,340
it's making me self-conscious I gotta get back on my diet

7906
04:37:28,340 --> 04:37:30,340
I gotta get back

7907
04:37:30,340 --> 04:37:32,340
when you have big boobs

7908
04:37:32,340 --> 04:37:34,340
you need a soft tummy to like

7909
04:37:34,340 --> 04:37:36,340
for them to rest on

7910
04:37:36,340 --> 04:37:38,340
I haven't been able to lift

7911
04:37:38,340 --> 04:37:40,340
in like two weeks because of COVID

7912
04:37:40,340 --> 04:37:42,340
because your boobs are in the way

7913
04:37:42,340 --> 04:37:44,340
my huge

7914
04:37:44,340 --> 04:37:46,340
image is too accurate to reality

7915
04:37:46,340 --> 04:37:48,340
more than you realize audience

7916
04:37:48,340 --> 04:37:50,340
it's upsetting

7917
04:37:50,340 --> 04:37:52,340
sad but true

7918
04:37:54,340 --> 04:37:56,340
next one

7919
04:37:56,340 --> 04:37:58,340
is that blue pills

7920
04:37:58,340 --> 04:38:00,340
oh

7921
04:38:00,340 --> 04:38:02,340
you weren't on

7922
04:38:02,340 --> 04:38:04,340
you weren't on

7923
04:38:04,340 --> 04:38:06,340
this episode we talked about

7924
04:38:06,340 --> 04:38:08,340
eating blue pills

7925
04:38:08,340 --> 04:38:10,340
and having huge tits

7926
04:38:10,340 --> 04:38:12,340
I thought this was about

7927
04:38:12,340 --> 04:38:14,340
when like

7928
04:38:14,340 --> 04:38:16,340
we were talking about

7929
04:38:16,340 --> 04:38:18,340
what's their face from that video game

7930
04:38:18,340 --> 04:38:20,340
we talked about the cover art

7931
04:38:20,340 --> 04:38:22,340
and booby representation

7932
04:38:24,340 --> 04:38:26,340
that was like the one before

7933
04:38:26,340 --> 04:38:28,340
it is a

7934
04:38:28,340 --> 04:38:30,340
continuation of that

7935
04:38:30,340 --> 04:38:32,340
the blue pills are

7936
04:38:32,340 --> 04:38:34,340

04:38:34,340 --> 04:38:36,340

04:38:50,340 --> 04:38:52,340
Trixie will never recover

7945
04:38:52,340 --> 04:38:54,340
next voicemail

7946
04:38:54,340 --> 04:38:56,340
is not an RPG maker

7947
04:38:56,340 --> 04:38:58,340
expert

7948
04:38:58,340 --> 04:39:00,340
there it is

7949
04:39:00,340 --> 04:39:02,340
okay

7950
04:39:02,340 --> 04:39:04,340
3, 2, 1, go

7951
04:39:04,340 --> 04:39:06,340
hey

7952
04:39:06,340 --> 04:39:08,340
so I heard you guys talking about that RPG maker

7953
04:39:08,340 --> 04:39:10,340
I haven't really dabbled in it

7954
04:39:10,340 --> 04:39:12,340
much myself but from my understanding

7955
04:39:12,340 --> 04:39:14,340
if you want something done in RPG maker

7956
04:39:14,340 --> 04:39:16,340
then chances are someone has already made a plugin

7957
04:39:16,340 --> 04:39:18,340
for it like for example

7958
04:39:18,340 --> 04:39:20,340
simply having 8-way run is still

7959
04:39:20,340 --> 04:39:22,340
somehow not a standard feature

7960
04:39:22,340 --> 04:39:24,340
and it's absolutely the first thing you're

7961
04:39:24,340 --> 04:39:26,340
going to want to look for to implement

7962
04:39:26,340 --> 04:39:28,340
your game so many people

7963
04:39:28,340 --> 04:39:30,340
have managed to reverse engineer plugins

7964
04:39:30,340 --> 04:39:32,340
that work for RPG maker and a quick search

7965
04:39:32,340 --> 04:39:34,340
to hopefully find you one that works

7966
04:39:34,340 --> 04:39:36,340
and then of course it's just a matter

7967
04:39:36,340 --> 04:39:38,340
of debugging and testing to make sure

7968
04:39:38,340 --> 04:39:40,340
that you know it works

7969
04:39:40,340 --> 04:39:42,340
just for reference's sake

7970
04:39:42,340 --> 04:39:44,340
Life 2D has been a real game

7971
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:46,340
changer for the hentai game scene

7972
04:39:46,340 --> 04:39:48,340
that should even work for the old

7973
04:39:48,340 --> 04:39:50,340
RPG maker not even VXA's

7974
04:39:50,340 --> 04:39:52,340
which is the new one just look up

7975
04:39:52,340 --> 04:39:54,340
any games made by Happy Pink I swear

7976
04:39:54,340 --> 04:39:56,340
they operate on black magic or something

7977
04:39:56,340 --> 04:39:58,340
as an alternative

7978
04:39:58,340 --> 04:40:00,340
you can try Wolf RPG editor

7979
04:40:00,340 --> 04:40:02,340
it's basically the same thing from my understanding

7980
04:40:02,340 --> 04:40:04,340
you know look up a bunch of plugins

7981
04:40:04,340 --> 04:40:06,340
they're probably already made

7982
04:40:06,340 --> 04:40:08,340
there's a Toho fan game called Genius of Sapphire

7983
04:40:08,340 --> 04:40:10,340
which is made with a heavily

7984
04:40:10,340 --> 04:40:12,340
edited wolf editor I think

7985
04:40:12,340 --> 04:40:14,340
it's probably one of my favorite RPGs

7986
04:40:14,340 --> 04:40:16,340
in general very heavily

7987
04:40:16,340 --> 04:40:18,340
inspired by the saga series

7988
04:40:18,340 --> 04:40:20,340
so yeah

7989
04:40:20,340 --> 04:40:22,340
indie RPGs have been

7990
04:40:22,340 --> 04:40:24,340
easier to make than ever before

7991
04:40:24,340 --> 04:40:26,340
crap out there but at the same time

7992
04:40:26,340 --> 04:40:28,340
there's some releases that put swear to shame

7993
04:40:28,340 --> 04:40:30,340
so yeah that's great

7994
04:40:30,340 --> 04:40:32,340
and all I'm not

7995
04:40:32,340 --> 04:40:34,340
interested in plugins

7996
04:40:34,340 --> 04:40:36,340
and shit

7997
04:40:36,340 --> 04:40:38,340
that's not real

7998
04:40:38,340 --> 04:40:40,340
I might be

7999
04:40:40,340 --> 04:40:42,340
maybe okay

8000
04:40:42,340 --> 04:40:44,340
could be some very good useful information

8001
04:40:44,340 --> 04:40:46,340
for someone watching

8002
04:40:46,340 --> 04:40:48,340
I learned a lot this past year

8003
04:40:48,340 --> 04:40:50,340
working on Phantom's Revenge

8004
04:40:50,340 --> 04:40:52,340
because I actually had to

8005
04:40:52,340 --> 04:40:54,340
code it with GML

8006
04:40:54,340 --> 04:40:56,340
I think if I

8007
04:40:56,340 --> 04:40:58,340
I don't know I can't even imagine

8008
04:40:58,340 --> 04:41:00,340
like a universe where

8009
04:41:00,340 --> 04:41:02,340
instead of that I like

8010
04:41:02,340 --> 04:41:04,340
found plugins and like

8011
04:41:04,340 --> 04:41:06,340
drop them into my game and like

8012
04:41:06,340 --> 04:41:08,340
modify it and like it's like oh does this plugin

8013
04:41:08,340 --> 04:41:10,340
work does this plugin

8014
04:41:10,340 --> 04:41:12,340
conflict with a lot of plugins

8015
04:41:12,340 --> 04:41:14,340
this sounds so stupid

8016
04:41:14,340 --> 04:41:16,340
I don't know

8017
04:41:18,340 --> 04:41:20,340
dumb

8018
04:41:20,340 --> 04:41:22,340
oh my god but I just reversed

8019
04:41:22,340 --> 04:41:24,340
image searched that

8020
04:41:24,340 --> 04:41:26,340
big booby ban image

8021
04:41:26,340 --> 04:41:28,340
see if maybe it's been posted

8022
04:41:28,340 --> 04:41:30,340
so I could find the artist

8023
04:41:30,340 --> 04:41:32,340
and all it says is did you mean objectification

8024
04:41:32,340 --> 04:41:34,340
yes

8025
04:41:34,340 --> 04:41:36,340
sorry related content

8026
04:41:36,340 --> 04:41:38,340
I did

8027
04:41:38,340 --> 04:41:40,340
just

8028
04:41:40,340 --> 04:41:42,340
okay

8029
04:41:42,340 --> 04:41:44,340
just don't be an idiot

8030
04:41:44,340 --> 04:41:46,340
just fuck around

8031
04:41:46,340 --> 04:41:48,340
with your coding language of choice

8032
04:41:48,340 --> 04:41:50,340
and just figure out how to do 8

8033
04:41:50,340 --> 04:41:52,340
just figure out how to do 8 way run yourself

8034
04:41:52,340 --> 04:41:54,340
just like don't be stupid

8035
04:41:54,340 --> 04:41:56,340
just fucking be like how do I do it

8036
04:41:56,340 --> 04:41:58,340
and think about it for a second

8037
04:41:58,340 --> 04:42:00,340
and then do it

8038
04:42:00,340 --> 04:42:02,340
duh

8039
04:42:02,340 --> 04:42:04,340
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

8040
04:42:04,340 --> 04:42:06,340
if you just don't care about that shit

8041
04:42:06,340 --> 04:42:08,340
and you just want to like make a game

8042
04:42:08,340 --> 04:42:10,340
especially if it's just a fucking hentai game

8043
04:42:10,340 --> 04:42:12,340
then go ahead and use rpg maker plugins

8044
04:42:12,340 --> 04:42:14,340
but I agree with you in theory it's better

8045
04:42:14,340 --> 04:42:16,340
especially if you really want to make a game

8046
04:42:16,340 --> 04:42:18,340
just to know

8047
04:42:18,340 --> 04:42:20,340
actually make it yourself

8048
04:42:20,340 --> 04:42:22,340
if something goes wrong and you don't know

8049
04:42:22,340 --> 04:42:24,340
how it works you can't fix it

8050
04:42:24,340 --> 04:42:26,340
right

8051
04:42:26,340 --> 04:42:28,340
you don't want to be relying on plugins

8052
04:42:28,340 --> 04:42:30,340
you have no idea how they work

8053
04:42:30,340 --> 04:42:32,340
a hentai game

8054
04:42:32,340 --> 04:42:34,340
is a hentai game even a game

8055
04:42:34,340 --> 04:42:36,340
like if there's a loose state

8056
04:42:36,340 --> 04:42:38,340
I don't want to have is this a game

8057
04:42:38,340 --> 04:42:40,340
discourse on this fucking podcast

8058
04:42:40,340 --> 04:42:42,340
but like you're talking about like a visual novel

8059
04:42:42,340 --> 04:42:44,340
right

8060
04:42:44,340 --> 04:42:46,340
there's no if you have choices

8061
04:42:46,340 --> 04:42:48,340
it's a game

8062
04:42:48,340 --> 04:42:50,340
okay that's not what I mean but like

8063
04:42:50,340 --> 04:42:52,340
there's no

8064
04:42:52,340 --> 04:42:54,340
there's no like coding right there's no like

8065
04:42:54,340 --> 04:42:56,340
game design

8066
04:42:56,340 --> 04:42:58,340
involve

8067
04:42:58,340 --> 04:43:00,340
there's a lot of if this then that

8068
04:43:00,340 --> 04:43:02,340
so it's a fucking game

8069
04:43:02,340 --> 04:43:04,340
and it's easy to do

8070
04:43:04,340 --> 04:43:06,340
you fucking idiots I'm not

8071
04:43:06,340 --> 04:43:08,340
damn it I'm not trying to do a semantic like

8072
04:43:08,340 --> 04:43:10,340
that's not a real game yes I get it is technically

8073
04:43:10,340 --> 04:43:12,340
a game but like whatever

8074
04:43:12,340 --> 04:43:14,340
that's not like a game design

8075
04:43:14,340 --> 04:43:16,340
thing that's not something you have to

8076
04:43:16,340 --> 04:43:18,340
sit down and be like how am I gonna

8077
04:43:18,340 --> 04:43:20,340
how am I gonna achieve this like no

8078
04:43:20,340 --> 04:43:22,340
it's just like yeah obviously you can use plugins

8079
04:43:22,340 --> 04:43:24,340
absolutely can be

8080
04:43:24,340 --> 04:43:26,340
obviously you can use plugins for that because like

8081
04:43:26,340 --> 04:43:28,340
you don't need it to do anything

8082
04:43:28,340 --> 04:43:30,340
right

8083
04:43:30,340 --> 04:43:32,340
I don't agree

8084
04:43:32,340 --> 04:43:34,340
like I've

8085
04:43:34,340 --> 04:43:36,340
spoken to for eyes a lot about

8086
04:43:36,340 --> 04:43:38,340
like potential like hentai game

8087
04:43:38,340 --> 04:43:40,340
ideas and a lot of them like would involve

8088
04:43:40,340 --> 04:43:42,340
like actual game mechanics that revolve

8089
04:43:42,340 --> 04:43:44,340
around sex in interesting

8090
04:43:44,340 --> 04:43:46,340
ways

8091
04:43:46,340 --> 04:43:48,340
better not it's not just oh there's a

8092
04:43:48,340 --> 04:43:50,340
you lose and then you get fucked and it's just imagining

8093
04:43:50,340 --> 04:43:52,340
the most basic visual

8094
04:43:52,340 --> 04:43:54,340
awful possible and yeah to do that kind of shit

8095
04:43:54,340 --> 04:43:56,340
yeah you don't need plugins or anything but like

8096
04:43:56,340 --> 04:43:58,340
making basic visual novels yeah obviously

8097
04:43:58,340 --> 04:44:00,340
but like you can like make RPGs

8098
04:44:00,340 --> 04:44:02,340
and or things we have like sex

8099
04:44:02,340 --> 04:44:04,340
stats and I don't know

8100
04:44:04,340 --> 04:44:06,340
I

8101
04:44:06,340 --> 04:44:08,340
I'm not sorry enough to think of it but I

8102
04:44:08,340 --> 04:44:10,340
it's not easier to build that kind of game around an RPG

8103
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:12,340
maker type framework than it is to like

8104
04:44:12,340 --> 04:44:14,340
code a visual novel from the ground up

8105
04:44:16,340 --> 04:44:18,340
okay sure I

8106
04:44:18,340 --> 04:44:20,340
guess I'm just like

8107
04:44:20,340 --> 04:44:22,340
all right it depends what kind of project it is

8108
04:44:22,340 --> 04:44:24,340
like for yeah for some

8109
04:44:24,340 --> 04:44:26,340
projects I'm sure that like just

8110
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:28,340
putting just putting together plugins

8111
04:44:28,340 --> 04:44:30,340
to achieve a desired

8112
04:44:30,340 --> 04:44:32,340
prefab format

8113
04:44:32,340 --> 04:44:34,340
is like fine sure

8114
04:44:34,340 --> 04:44:36,340
okay

8115
04:44:36,340 --> 04:44:38,340
I

8116
04:44:38,340 --> 04:44:40,340
recognize a lot of the fucking plugins from

8117
04:44:40,340 --> 04:44:42,340
like Lisa the Painful like there's one

8118
04:44:42,340 --> 04:44:44,340
where like you go in a room and the light

8119
04:44:44,340 --> 04:44:46,340
like like shines around you and it's like

8120
04:44:46,340 --> 04:44:48,340
really weird because it's like the only room in the game like that

8121
04:44:48,340 --> 04:44:50,340
I was like oh I remember seeing that plugin when I was

8122
04:44:50,340 --> 04:44:52,340
fucking around with RPG maker

8123
04:44:52,340 --> 04:44:54,340
yeah

8124
04:44:54,340 --> 04:44:56,340
oh no don't tell me that a game

8125
04:44:56,340 --> 04:44:58,340
that I like use plugins that makes me

8126
04:44:58,340 --> 04:45:00,340
Lisa is an RPG maker game

8127
04:45:00,340 --> 04:45:02,340
and it uses plugins I promise you

8128
04:45:02,340 --> 04:45:04,340
in fact he lists plugins into credits

8129
04:45:04,340 --> 04:45:06,340
using plugins it's just a tool

8130
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:10,340
he didn't personally hand code every single thing in that game

8131
04:45:10,340 --> 04:45:12,340
even before

8132
04:45:12,340 --> 04:45:14,340
I knew about the game when I saw screenshots

8133
04:45:14,340 --> 04:45:16,340
I could tell was made an RPG maker

8134
04:45:16,340 --> 04:45:18,340
I know it was made an RPG maker

8135
04:45:18,340 --> 04:45:20,340
I used it so much

8136
04:45:20,340 --> 04:45:22,340
I know it was made an RPG maker but like

8137
04:45:22,340 --> 04:45:24,340
okay fine I'm just okay

8138
04:45:24,340 --> 04:45:26,340
you know what here's what I think it would be

8139
04:45:26,340 --> 04:45:28,340
well if you knew how to

8140
04:45:28,340 --> 04:45:30,340
code he wouldn't make it an RPG maker

8141
04:45:30,340 --> 04:45:32,340
it would be a better game if he had

8142
04:45:32,340 --> 04:45:34,340
hand coded that light

8143
04:45:34,340 --> 04:45:36,340
effect

8144
04:45:36,340 --> 04:45:38,340
why?

8145
04:45:38,340 --> 04:45:40,340
no I'm joking

8146
04:45:40,340 --> 04:45:42,340
I basically agree with Ben's

8147
04:45:42,340 --> 04:45:44,340
advice that you should code

8148
04:45:44,340 --> 04:45:46,340
you shouldn't rely on plugins like he's basically right

8149
04:45:46,340 --> 04:45:48,340
I just want to say

8150
04:45:48,340 --> 04:45:50,340
it depends on the type of game

8151
04:45:50,340 --> 04:45:52,340
I'm being salty

8152
04:45:52,340 --> 04:45:54,340
obviously

8153
04:45:54,340 --> 04:45:56,340
I guess obviously for something like that

8154
04:45:56,340 --> 04:45:58,340
it doesn't matter

8155
04:45:58,340 --> 04:46:00,340
I'm just thinking about it

8156
04:46:00,340 --> 04:46:02,340
in terms of the game that I've been making

8157
04:46:02,340 --> 04:46:04,340
and I literally can't imagine

8158
04:46:04,340 --> 04:46:06,340
finding it useful

8159
04:46:06,340 --> 04:46:08,340
because I

8160
04:46:08,340 --> 04:46:10,340
understand my

8161
04:46:10,340 --> 04:46:12,340
I understand my game

8162
04:46:12,340 --> 04:46:14,340
like inside and out I know how

8163
04:46:14,340 --> 04:46:16,340
all the pieces of it work

8164
04:46:16,340 --> 04:46:18,340
and to like just take a big like

8165
04:46:18,340 --> 04:46:20,340
black box of code and drop it

8166
04:46:20,340 --> 04:46:22,340
in there and be like I hope it does

8167
04:46:22,340 --> 04:46:24,340
what I want it to do is unthinkable

8168
04:46:24,340 --> 04:46:26,340
it's sort of the equivalent of using

8169
04:46:26,340 --> 04:46:28,340
things that some people would consider

8170
04:46:28,340 --> 04:46:30,340
crutches in like drawing

8171
04:46:30,340 --> 04:46:32,340
like a stabilizer or whatever

8172
04:46:32,340 --> 04:46:34,340
it's just a tool that you can use or not

8173
04:46:34,340 --> 04:46:36,340
and it's fine

8174
04:46:36,340 --> 04:46:38,340
it doesn't make anything good or bad

8175
04:46:38,340 --> 04:46:40,340
it just depends on what the final product is

8176
04:46:40,340 --> 04:46:42,340
at the end of the day

8177
04:46:42,340 --> 04:46:44,340
I'm not arguing from like a

8178
04:46:44,340 --> 04:46:46,340
moral standpoint

8179
04:46:46,340 --> 04:46:48,340
I'm saying I don't think I could use it

8180
04:46:48,340 --> 04:46:50,340
to do anything

8181
04:46:50,340 --> 04:46:52,340
when an alternate timeline Ben who loves plugins

8182
04:46:52,340 --> 04:46:54,340
would have had phantoms revenge out like six months ago

8183
04:46:54,340 --> 04:46:56,340
I

8184
04:46:56,340 --> 04:46:58,340
I listen I want it I would

8185
04:46:58,340 --> 04:47:00,340
have taken shortcuts if I thought

8186
04:47:00,340 --> 04:47:02,340
it would achieve the

8187
04:47:02,340 --> 04:47:04,340
effect that I was looking for

8188
04:47:04,340 --> 04:47:06,340
but I don't think it would have

8189
04:47:06,340 --> 04:47:08,340
so

8190
04:47:08,340 --> 04:47:10,340
nobody else should use them either there

8191
04:47:10,340 --> 04:47:12,340
that's what I think

8192
04:47:12,340 --> 04:47:14,340
a little mouth

8193
04:47:14,340 --> 04:47:16,340
I need to use plugins for like After Effects

8194
04:47:16,340 --> 04:47:18,340
I don't I try to do everything from scratch using

8195
04:47:18,340 --> 04:47:20,340
the built-in things and it's slow

8196
04:47:20,340 --> 04:47:22,340
and painful making a game

8197
04:47:22,340 --> 04:47:24,340
game maker first of all

8198
04:47:24,340 --> 04:47:26,340
why don't you program it from the ground up Ben

8199
04:47:26,340 --> 04:47:28,340
like a real adult

8200
04:47:32,340 --> 04:47:34,340
game maker

8201
04:47:34,340 --> 04:47:36,340
why didn't I

8202
04:47:36,340 --> 04:47:38,340
why didn't I write it in notepad

8203
04:47:38,340 --> 04:47:40,340
why didn't I code my game in fucking notepad

8204
04:47:40,340 --> 04:47:42,340
why didn't you code it in an assembly

8205
04:47:42,340 --> 04:47:44,340
why didn't you code it out of raw binary

8206
04:47:46,340 --> 04:47:48,340
what do you mold it out of clay you weirdo

8207
04:47:48,340 --> 04:47:50,340
I don't know

8208
04:47:50,340 --> 04:47:52,340
I'm sorry

8209
04:47:52,340 --> 04:47:54,340
that's all I can contribute

8210
04:47:54,340 --> 04:47:56,340
I don't know anything about game development

8211
04:47:56,340 --> 04:47:58,340
yeah I don't even know anything about game development

8212
04:47:58,340 --> 04:48:00,340
so I can't even really have any insight into this

8213
04:48:00,340 --> 04:48:02,340
did you farm that silicone yourself for that chip

8214
04:48:02,340 --> 04:48:04,340
that's in your computer

8215
04:48:06,340 --> 04:48:08,340
did I mind this video

8216
04:48:08,340 --> 04:48:10,340
why not cobalt

8217
04:48:10,340 --> 04:48:12,340
did you ever see the video about the guy

8218
04:48:12,340 --> 04:48:14,340
who like made a sandwich himself like he

8219
04:48:14,340 --> 04:48:16,340
did everything like he grew the bread

8220
04:48:16,340 --> 04:48:18,340
yeah it was that episode of Spongebob

8221
04:48:18,340 --> 04:48:20,340
where Spongebob fight

8222
04:48:20,340 --> 04:48:22,340
he does the battle against neptune

8223
04:48:22,340 --> 04:48:24,340
and neptune like grows the wheat

8224
04:48:24,340 --> 04:48:26,340
he like divinely

8225
04:48:26,340 --> 04:48:28,340
makes the wheat grow and then he like

8226
04:48:28,340 --> 04:48:30,340
transmutes it into buns

8227
04:48:30,340 --> 04:48:32,340
some guy like did that

8228
04:48:32,340 --> 04:48:34,340
with like an actual sandwich like he raised the chicken

8229
04:48:34,340 --> 04:48:36,340
like he did everything himself

8230
04:48:36,340 --> 04:48:38,340
didn't he even like get the water from the ocean

8231
04:48:38,340 --> 04:48:40,340
and purify it I forget the exact details

8232
04:48:40,340 --> 04:48:42,340
but I wouldn't be surprised if he did something insane like that

8233
04:48:42,340 --> 04:48:44,340
and the point is like he did all that it probably cost like a thousand

8234
04:48:44,340 --> 04:48:46,340
dollars to do everything put together

8235
04:48:46,340 --> 04:48:48,340
and then he like ate the sandwich and he was like

8236
04:48:48,340 --> 04:48:50,340
that was okay

8237
04:48:50,340 --> 04:48:52,340
fine

8238
04:48:52,340 --> 04:48:54,340
and the conclusion this is why capitalism is good

8239
04:48:54,340 --> 04:48:56,340
because if you don't have it thousand dollars sandwiches

8240
04:48:58,340 --> 04:49:00,340
I mean yeah

8241
04:49:00,340 --> 04:49:02,340
markets are

8242
04:49:02,340 --> 04:49:04,340
effective

8243
04:49:04,340 --> 04:49:06,340
scale is what is the good thing

8244
04:49:06,340 --> 04:49:08,340
yeah that's true

8245
04:49:08,340 --> 04:49:10,340
scale does not belong to capitalism

8246
04:49:10,340 --> 04:49:12,340
it belongs to everyone

8247
04:49:12,340 --> 04:49:14,340
division of labor and all that

8248
04:49:14,340 --> 04:49:16,340
it's good

8249
04:49:16,340 --> 04:49:18,340

yeah let's try again

8255
04:49:28,340 --> 04:49:30,340

huh

8257
04:49:32,340 --> 04:49:34,340
what

8258
04:49:34,340 --> 04:49:36,340
welcome to the procrastinators podcast

8259
04:49:36,340 --> 04:49:38,340
next voicemail is called

the point of the account is to post

8286
04:50:30,340 --> 04:50:32,340
liberals taking

8287
04:50:32,340 --> 04:50:34,340
L's basically on tiktok

8288
04:50:34,340 --> 04:50:36,340
this post was

8289
04:50:36,340 --> 04:50:38,340
it was that girl

8290
04:50:38,340 --> 04:50:40,340
who makes like seven figures a year

8291
04:50:40,340 --> 04:50:42,340
pretending to be a dog

8292
04:50:42,340 --> 04:50:44,340
I don't

8293
04:50:44,340 --> 04:50:46,340
I am aware of this

8294
04:50:46,340 --> 04:50:48,340
she's like a fat

8295
04:50:48,340 --> 04:50:50,340
she's like a fetish

8296
04:50:50,340 --> 04:50:52,340
she's like a fetish actress

8297
04:50:52,340 --> 04:50:54,340
but I don't think I don't even know if she even

8298
04:50:54,340 --> 04:50:56,340
like gets nude but like she pretends

8299
04:50:56,340 --> 04:50:58,340
to be a dog right she just has a leash

8300
04:50:58,340 --> 04:51:00,340
and she acts like a dog

8301
04:51:00,340 --> 04:51:02,340
and people pay her an exorbitant amount of money

8302
04:51:02,340 --> 04:51:04,340
for this

8303
04:51:04,340 --> 04:51:06,340
and the libs of tiktok just posted this like

8304
04:51:06,340 --> 04:51:08,340
a gas

8305
04:51:08,340 --> 04:51:10,340

8312
04:51:22,340 --> 04:51:24,340
these are not libs

8313
04:51:24,340 --> 04:51:26,340
these are porn fetish actors

8314
04:51:26,340 --> 04:51:28,340
and you are watching pornography

8315
04:51:28,340 --> 04:51:30,340

8316
04:51:30,340 --> 04:51:32,340
fetish pornography

8317
04:51:32,340 --> 04:51:34,340
is what it was

8318
04:51:34,340 --> 04:51:36,340
um

8319
04:51:36,340 --> 04:51:38,340
the libs have really gone too far this time

8320
04:51:38,340 --> 04:51:40,340
the libs have gone too far that accounts great

8321
04:51:40,340 --> 04:51:42,340
because it will just post like pictures

8322
04:51:42,340 --> 04:51:44,340
of like people like committing crimes

8323
04:51:44,340 --> 04:51:46,340
and be like lol liberals

8324
04:51:46,340 --> 04:51:48,340
just like

8325
04:51:48,340 --> 04:51:50,340
there was one of like a bunch of people like smashing

8326
04:51:50,340 --> 04:51:52,340
a bunch of windows and like looting a store

8327
04:51:52,340 --> 04:51:54,340
and it's just like

8328
04:51:54,340 --> 04:51:56,340
like crime is just by default

8329
04:51:56,340 --> 04:51:58,340
liberal

8330
04:51:58,340 --> 04:52:00,340
be gay do crimes

8331
04:52:00,340 --> 04:52:02,340
you know these were liberals because they

8332
04:52:02,340 --> 04:52:04,340
broke into a store

8333
04:52:04,340 --> 04:52:06,340
you know they voted for Biden

8334
04:52:06,340 --> 04:52:08,340
like they loved Kamala

8335
04:52:08,340 --> 04:52:10,340
because she

8336
04:52:10,340 --> 04:52:12,340
that's why else would they be

8337
04:52:12,340 --> 04:52:14,340
stealing you know

8338
04:52:14,340 --> 04:52:16,340
I have a pee and drink water

8339
04:52:16,340 --> 04:52:18,340
I don't think anyone likes Kamala

8340
04:52:18,340 --> 04:52:20,340
who isn't like mmmmmm

8341
04:52:20,340 --> 04:52:22,340
are you joking

8342
04:52:22,340 --> 04:52:24,340
Kamala was the first woman to hold presidential power

8343
04:52:24,340 --> 04:52:26,340
while

8344
04:52:26,340 --> 04:52:28,340
Biden was unconscious and sedated

8345
04:52:28,340 --> 04:52:30,340
for a routine

8346
04:52:30,340 --> 04:52:32,340
colonoscopy and that makes her

8347
04:52:32,340 --> 04:52:34,340
a girl boss

8348
04:52:34,340 --> 04:52:36,340
that literally sounds like an episode of like veep or something

8349
04:52:36,340 --> 04:52:38,340

8350

8499
04:57:54,340 --> 04:57:56,340
I liked the part where it said

8500
04:57:56,340 --> 04:57:58,340
the shitting on Beatrice

8501
04:57:58,340 --> 04:58:00,340
that made me happy

8502
04:58:00,340 --> 04:58:02,340
yeah that is a thing

8503
04:58:02,340 --> 04:58:04,340
taking a dry dump on Beatrice

8504
04:58:04,340 --> 04:58:06,340
is that what I said?

8505
04:58:06,340 --> 04:58:08,340
oh yeah

8506
04:58:08,340 --> 04:58:10,340
that's what I said

8507
04:58:10,340 --> 04:58:12,340
it said dry dump

8508
04:58:12,340 --> 04:58:14,340
I remember it said dry dumps

8509
04:58:14,340 --> 04:58:16,340
I'm just combining the two ideas

8510
04:58:16,340 --> 04:58:18,340
you're just taking

8511
04:58:18,340 --> 04:58:20,340
that's called the juxtaposition

8512
04:58:20,340 --> 04:58:22,340
and that's the root of all

8513
04:58:22,340 --> 04:58:24,340
you're just seething descent

8514
04:58:24,340 --> 04:58:26,340
you're just seething

8515
04:58:26,340 --> 04:58:28,340
descent

8516
04:58:28,340 --> 04:58:30,340
you're just coping

8517
04:58:30,340 --> 04:58:32,340
descent right now

8518
04:58:32,340 --> 04:58:34,340
okay

8519
04:58:34,340 --> 04:58:36,340
next voicemail

8520
04:58:36,340 --> 04:58:38,340
is called

8521
04:58:38,340 --> 04:58:40,340
mystical hobo

8522
04:58:40,340 --> 04:58:42,340
three two one

8523
04:58:42,340 --> 04:58:44,340
go

8524
04:58:44,340 --> 04:58:46,340
I'm the mystical hobo

8525
04:58:46,340 --> 04:58:48,340
of Hoboken

8526
04:58:48,340 --> 04:58:50,340
and my question is this

8527
04:58:50,340 --> 04:58:52,340
have either of you

8528
04:58:52,340 --> 04:58:54,340
or any guests involved

8529
04:58:54,340 --> 04:58:56,340
tried meditation

8530
04:58:56,340 --> 04:58:58,340
and if not would you

8531
04:58:58,340 --> 04:59:00,340
what do you think about meditation

8532
04:59:00,340 --> 04:59:02,340
never do you think it's

8533
04:59:02,340 --> 04:59:04,340
fucking cringe

8534
04:59:04,340 --> 04:59:06,340
and bullshit

8535
04:59:06,340 --> 04:59:08,340
I think it's a valid way to soothe

8536
04:59:08,340 --> 04:59:10,340
anxiety in this modern age

8537
04:59:10,340 --> 04:59:12,340
let me know

8538
04:59:14,340 --> 04:59:16,340
I only

8539
04:59:16,340 --> 04:59:18,340
engage in negative meditation

8540
04:59:18,340 --> 04:59:20,340
which is like regular meditation

8541
04:59:20,340 --> 04:59:22,340
but I do it to get angry and pissed off about things

8542
04:59:22,340 --> 04:59:24,340
I never tried to meditate to calm down

8543
04:59:24,340 --> 04:59:26,340
that seems impossible

8544
04:59:26,340 --> 04:59:28,340
I feel like the boundaries

8545
04:59:28,340 --> 04:59:30,340
and the rules of meditate

8546
04:59:30,340 --> 04:59:32,340
I feel like it works for people who

8547
04:59:32,340 --> 04:59:34,340
I don't know

8548
04:59:34,340 --> 04:59:36,340
don't need specific instructions

8549
04:59:36,340 --> 04:59:38,340
but when people say just

8550
04:59:38,340 --> 04:59:40,340
feel the air around you

8551
04:59:40,340 --> 04:59:42,340
I'm like okay I feel it

8552
04:59:42,340 --> 04:59:44,340
I don't know whether I'm doing anything

8553
04:59:44,340 --> 04:59:46,340
right I don't feel it

8554
04:59:46,340 --> 04:59:48,340
I don't feel anything I can't do it

8555
04:59:48,340 --> 04:59:50,340
it doesn't work it doesn't make sense

8556
04:59:50,340 --> 04:59:52,340
these instructions are terrible

8557
04:59:52,340 --> 04:59:54,340
I can't get into it no teacher

8558
04:59:54,340 --> 04:59:56,340
has ever explained meditation

8559
04:59:56,340 --> 04:59:58,340
properly

8560
04:59:58,340 --> 05:00:00,340
I'll explain

8561
05:00:00,340 --> 05:00:02,340
what it is and what about it works

8562
05:00:02,340 --> 05:00:04,340
taking slow deep breaths

8563
05:00:04,340 --> 05:00:06,340
that's it

8564
05:00:06,340 --> 05:00:08,340
that's the part that has an effect

8565
05:00:08,340 --> 05:00:10,340
I don't know

8566
05:00:10,340 --> 05:00:12,340
I think there's a little more to it

8567
05:00:12,340 --> 05:00:14,340
than that

8568
05:00:14,340 --> 05:00:16,340
there's probably a little more to it

8569
05:00:16,340 --> 05:00:18,340
but that alone will calm you down

8570
05:00:18,340 --> 05:00:20,340
a certain calm

8571
05:00:20,340 --> 05:00:22,340
times, spaces

8572
05:00:22,340 --> 05:00:24,340
and locations usually

8573
05:00:24,340 --> 05:00:26,340
will calm me down

8574
05:00:26,340 --> 05:00:28,340
if it's like a nice sunset and there's a cool breeze

8575
05:00:28,340 --> 05:00:30,340
and I'm not bothered by anything

8576
05:00:30,340 --> 05:00:32,340
and I'm just sitting around

8577
05:00:32,340 --> 05:00:34,340
then yeah of course I'll feel calmer

8578
05:00:34,340 --> 05:00:36,340
but like I don't know how to

8579
05:00:36,340 --> 05:00:38,340
like

8580
05:00:38,340 --> 05:00:40,340
create that

8581
05:00:40,340 --> 05:00:42,340
when I don't have it

8582
05:00:42,340 --> 05:00:44,340
I think

8583
05:00:44,340 --> 05:00:46,340
that part of meditation

8584
05:00:46,340 --> 05:00:48,340
sometimes is about

8585
05:00:48,340 --> 05:00:50,340
imagining

8586
05:00:50,340 --> 05:00:52,340
yourself from the outside

8587
05:00:52,340 --> 05:00:54,340
like when you're angry

8588
05:00:54,340 --> 05:00:56,340
like thinking about

8589
05:00:56,340 --> 05:00:58,340
like part of it can be like

8590
05:00:58,340 --> 05:01:00,340
thinking about it from the outside

8591
05:01:00,340 --> 05:01:02,340
like from an observer

8592
05:01:02,340 --> 05:01:04,340
observing your own anger

8593
05:01:04,340 --> 05:01:06,340
and thinking about like

8594
05:01:06,340 --> 05:01:08,340
why are you angry

8595
05:01:08,340 --> 05:01:10,340
and becoming an outside

8596
05:01:10,340 --> 05:01:12,340
observer to yourself

8597
05:01:12,340 --> 05:01:14,340
and that is a great thing

8598
05:01:14,340 --> 05:01:16,340
to be able to do

8599
05:01:16,340 --> 05:01:18,340
and if you can do it it's very helpful

8600
05:01:18,340 --> 05:01:20,340
in a lot of situations

8601
05:01:20,340 --> 05:01:22,340
I feel like I do that all the time though

8602
05:01:22,340 --> 05:01:24,340
and that just makes me more upset

8603
05:01:24,340 --> 05:01:26,340
because I sort of

8604
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:28,340
there's something different from what you're saying

8605
05:01:28,340 --> 05:01:30,340
but like I think to myself

8606
05:01:30,340 --> 05:01:32,340
like why am I angry, why am I so stupid

8607
05:01:32,340 --> 05:01:34,340
why am I like, why is my life so bad

8608
05:01:34,340 --> 05:01:36,340
um

8609
05:01:36,340 --> 05:01:38,340
maybe I'm like emotionally compromised

8610
05:01:38,340 --> 05:01:40,340
and I can't actually answer those questions properly

8611
05:01:40,340 --> 05:01:42,340
but I just end up like berating myself

8612
05:01:42,340 --> 05:01:44,340
like there's another version of me

8613
05:01:44,340 --> 05:01:46,340
just saying wow give you suck

8614
05:01:46,340 --> 05:01:48,340
and here's all of the proof

8615
05:01:48,340 --> 05:01:50,340
and I have the receipts and it makes sense

8616
05:01:50,340 --> 05:01:52,340
and I'm logically explaining

8617
05:01:52,340 --> 05:01:54,340
why you suck so hard

8618
05:01:54,340 --> 05:01:56,340
of course

8619
05:01:56,340 --> 05:01:58,340
I tried medification

8620
05:01:58,340 --> 05:02:00,340
a few times but I could never get like the fighting game

8621
05:02:00,340 --> 05:02:02,340
input down and pull off the move

8622
05:02:02,340 --> 05:02:04,340
and I kept dropping the combo and failing it

8623
05:02:04,340 --> 05:02:06,340
didn't work

8624
05:02:06,340 --> 05:02:08,340
I lay on the floor once for like 20 minutes

8625
05:02:08,340 --> 05:02:10,340
or maybe 30 minutes once in 2012

8626
05:02:10,340 --> 05:02:12,340
and I just lay on the wood floor

8627
05:02:12,340 --> 05:02:14,340
and just felt the floor and didn't think about anything

8628
05:02:14,340 --> 05:02:16,340
and it was calming

8629
05:02:16,340 --> 05:02:18,340
as I have mentioned before

8630
05:02:18,340 --> 05:02:20,340
I can only do the, no sorry

8631
05:02:20,340 --> 05:02:22,340
no go ahead

8632
05:02:22,340 --> 05:02:24,340
I was just gonna say I could only do that when I'm high

8633
05:02:26,340 --> 05:02:28,340
as I have mentioned before

8634
05:02:28,340 --> 05:02:30,340
um

8635
05:02:30,340 --> 05:02:32,340
when I used to do kendo

8636
05:02:32,340 --> 05:02:34,340
at the beginning of kendo practice

8637
05:02:34,340 --> 05:02:36,340
and at the end we would meditate

8638
05:02:36,340 --> 05:02:38,340
for like a few minutes

8639
05:02:38,340 --> 05:02:40,340
and the way that

8640
05:02:40,340 --> 05:02:42,340
the teacher would have us do that

8641
05:02:42,340 --> 05:02:44,340
is we would um

8642
05:02:44,340 --> 05:02:46,340
he described it as just sit there

8643
05:02:46,340 --> 05:02:48,340
and just deliberately

8644
05:02:48,340 --> 05:02:50,340
don't think about anything

8645
05:02:50,340 --> 05:02:52,340
and if you have a thought

8646
05:02:52,340 --> 05:02:54,340
imagine yourself like

8647
05:02:54,340 --> 05:02:56,340
like your mind is like the surface

8648
05:02:56,340 --> 05:02:58,340
of like still water

8649
05:02:58,340 --> 05:03:00,340
and if any thought disturbs the surface

8650
05:03:00,340 --> 05:03:02,340
imagine yourself like

8651
05:03:02,340 --> 05:03:04,340
taking the thought and throwing it away

8652
05:03:04,340 --> 05:03:06,340
like pluck it out and throw it away

8653
05:03:06,340 --> 05:03:08,340
and just like try to sit there

8654
05:03:08,340 --> 05:03:10,340
with the least disturbed mind

8655
05:03:10,340 --> 05:03:12,340
like no ripples

8656
05:03:12,340 --> 05:03:14,340
see I've tried

8657
05:03:14,340 --> 05:03:16,340
I've tried to do that before

8658
05:03:16,340 --> 05:03:18,340
like I've heard all these things and it's like

8659
05:03:18,340 --> 05:03:20,340
I just

8660
05:03:20,340 --> 05:03:22,340
I feel like

8661
05:03:22,340 --> 05:03:24,340
the metaphors they're using

8662
05:03:24,340 --> 05:03:26,340
to describe what you're supposed to do

8663
05:03:26,340 --> 05:03:28,340
I interpret them wrong and then I do something wrong

8664
05:03:28,340 --> 05:03:30,340
or I don't feel confident enough

8665
05:03:30,340 --> 05:03:32,340
that what I'm doing is the right thing

8666
05:03:32,340 --> 05:03:34,340
I've never really felt

8667
05:03:34,340 --> 05:03:36,340
like

8668
05:03:36,340 --> 05:03:38,340
like when I

8669
05:03:38,340 --> 05:03:40,340
deliberately tried to do a meditate

8670
05:03:40,340 --> 05:03:42,340
I can't do it

8671
05:03:42,340 --> 05:03:44,340
I felt calm before

8672
05:03:44,340 --> 05:03:46,340
but like I don't know how

8673
05:03:46,340 --> 05:03:48,340
the things people say to explain it

8674
05:03:48,340 --> 05:03:50,340
don't make any sense to me and I can't make sense of them

8675
05:03:52,340 --> 05:03:54,340
I get the feeling meditation is almost

8676
05:03:54,340 --> 05:03:56,340
one of those psychosomatic things where like

8677
05:03:56,340 --> 05:03:58,340
if you believe it it'll

8678
05:03:58,340 --> 05:04:00,340
have a perceived effect for you like almost like

8679
05:04:00,340 --> 05:04:02,340
a placebo kind of thing

8680
05:04:02,340 --> 05:04:04,340
that's probably a really mean way of talking about it

8681
05:04:04,340 --> 05:04:06,340
but to me that's the impression we've got

8682
05:04:06,340 --> 05:04:08,340
because I was doubtful of it and tried it

8683
05:04:08,340 --> 05:04:10,340
I fully believe that's what it is

8684
05:04:10,340 --> 05:04:12,340
it's that combined with the fact that you're probably

8685
05:04:12,340 --> 05:04:14,340
like breathing slower

8686
05:04:14,340 --> 05:04:16,340
and calm which does actually calm you down

8687
05:04:16,340 --> 05:04:18,340
whenever I'm agitated

8688
05:04:18,340 --> 05:04:20,340
I just take a deep breath

8689
05:04:20,340 --> 05:04:22,340
and that like helps

8690
05:04:22,340 --> 05:04:24,340
it's like a bit of that

8691
05:04:24,340 --> 05:04:26,340
it's not just about

8692
05:04:26,340 --> 05:04:28,340
being calm

8693
05:04:28,340 --> 05:04:30,340
it's not merely about

8694
05:04:30,340 --> 05:04:32,340
becoming calmer

8695
05:04:32,340 --> 05:04:34,340
from a state of upset

8696
05:04:34,340 --> 05:04:36,340
it's about like

8697
05:04:36,340 --> 05:04:38,340
I don't know I think if you do it right

8698
05:04:38,340 --> 05:04:40,340
it changes your

8699
05:04:40,340 --> 05:04:42,340
perspective a little bit and it gets you

8700
05:04:42,340 --> 05:04:44,340
it gets you into a

8701
05:04:44,340 --> 05:04:46,340
sort of a mood or a mindset

8702
05:04:46,340 --> 05:04:48,340
that is just more

8703
05:04:48,340 --> 05:04:50,340
focused and better

8704
05:04:50,340 --> 05:04:52,340
unless stupid

8705
05:04:52,340 --> 05:04:54,340
my form of

8706
05:04:54,340 --> 05:04:56,340
meditation is playing the first 200 turns

8707
05:04:56,340 --> 05:04:58,340
of a Civilization 6 game

8708
05:04:58,340 --> 05:05:00,340
and then going sleep

8709
05:05:00,340 --> 05:05:02,340
I mean

8710
05:05:02,340 --> 05:05:04,340
good breathing exercises

8711
05:05:04,340 --> 05:05:06,340
are also good for focus

8712
05:05:06,340 --> 05:05:08,340
I feel like if there's anything

8713
05:05:08,340 --> 05:05:10,340
oxygen flow to your brain

8714
05:05:10,340 --> 05:05:12,340
I think the only thing that's

8715
05:05:12,340 --> 05:05:14,340
like been consistently

8716
05:05:14,340 --> 05:05:16,340
a good thing to calm me down or focus

8717
05:05:16,340 --> 05:05:18,340
like if I'm having like

8718
05:05:18,340 --> 05:05:20,340
an anxiety moment

8719
05:05:20,340 --> 05:05:22,340
is to go outside only if it's like

8720
05:05:22,340 --> 05:05:24,340
really cold it works

8721
05:05:24,340 --> 05:05:26,340
and I just lay on like the earth

8722
05:05:26,340 --> 05:05:28,340
I lay on the ground on the stone

8723
05:05:28,340 --> 05:05:30,340
and I just become

8724
05:05:30,340 --> 05:05:32,340
really cold

8725
05:05:32,340 --> 05:05:34,340
I don't know why that helps

8726
05:05:34,340 --> 05:05:36,340
and then I come in and I'm shivering

8727
05:05:36,340 --> 05:05:38,340
but it's like now I can warm up

8728
05:05:38,340 --> 05:05:40,340
and now my brain is not

8729
05:05:40,340 --> 05:05:42,340
like I don't know foggy

8730
05:05:46,340 --> 05:05:48,340
I need one of those ice waterfalls

8731
05:05:48,340 --> 05:05:50,340
to sit under

8732
05:05:54,340 --> 05:05:56,340
one of them good old ice waterfalls

8733
05:05:56,340 --> 05:05:58,340
get that installed in the back garden

8734
05:05:58,340 --> 05:06:00,340
you need a

8735
05:06:00,340 --> 05:06:02,340
Joe Rogan freezing cold

8736
05:06:02,340 --> 05:06:04,340
flotation thing

8737
05:06:04,340 --> 05:06:06,340
is that like a sunbed

8738
05:06:06,340 --> 05:06:08,340
no what are those things

8739
05:06:08,340 --> 05:06:10,340
called where you lay inside of a thing

8740
05:06:12,340 --> 05:06:14,340
a sensory deprivation chamber

8741
05:06:14,340 --> 05:06:16,340
but like a cold

8742
05:06:18,340 --> 05:06:20,340
I'm sure you could make

8743
05:06:22,340 --> 05:06:24,340
I like the cool air

8744
05:06:24,340 --> 05:06:26,340
it's definitely something I appreciate

8745
05:06:30,340 --> 05:06:32,340
well that's the last voicemail

8746
05:06:32,340 --> 05:06:34,340
I thought we were going to go

8747
05:06:34,340 --> 05:06:36,340
for another 58,000 years

8748
05:06:38,340 --> 05:06:40,340
and I would die in collapse

8749
05:06:40,340 --> 05:06:42,340
no there weren't that many

8750
05:06:42,340 --> 05:06:44,340
but we are past the eight hour mark

8751
05:06:44,340 --> 05:06:46,340
so eight hours

8752
05:06:46,340 --> 05:06:48,340
no we really uh

8753
05:06:48,340 --> 05:06:50,340
sorry five hours

8754
05:06:50,340 --> 05:06:52,340
I meant five

8755
05:06:52,340 --> 05:06:54,340
well you heard him we have to go for another

8756
05:06:54,340 --> 05:06:56,340
three hours we were at five

8757
05:06:56,340 --> 05:06:58,340
hours and eight minutes on my

8758
05:06:58,340 --> 05:07:00,340
audacity and I fucked it up

8759
05:07:00,340 --> 05:07:02,340
I fucked it

8760
05:07:04,340 --> 05:07:06,340
you imagine ever putting out an eight hour episode

8761
05:07:06,340 --> 05:07:08,340
I have done that

8762
05:07:08,340 --> 05:07:10,340
well not a pcp but like

8763
05:07:10,340 --> 05:07:12,340
arm retrieval I think the last episode

8764
05:07:12,340 --> 05:07:14,340
was like almost eight hours

8765
05:07:14,340 --> 05:07:16,340
was it

8766
05:07:16,340 --> 05:07:18,340
god

8767
05:07:18,340 --> 05:07:20,340
dang

8768
05:07:20,340 --> 05:07:22,340
went all the way through the night and it was the sun was coming up

8769
05:07:22,340 --> 05:07:24,340
holy moly

8770
05:07:24,340 --> 05:07:26,340
by the time we had finished

8771
05:07:26,340 --> 05:07:28,340
that's a real ass

8772
05:07:28,340 --> 05:07:30,340
podcast

8773
05:07:30,340 --> 05:07:32,340
none of that is five hour bullshit

8774
05:07:32,340 --> 05:07:34,340
since we are since I imagine we're coming

8775
05:07:34,340 --> 05:07:36,340
since I imagine we're coming up on the end

8776
05:07:36,340 --> 05:07:38,340
I will take this opportunity to say

8777
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:40,340
by plebe and the wee blue rays

8778
05:07:40,340 --> 05:07:42,340
link in the description

to paypal

8784

at gmail.com

8786
05:07:56,340 --> 05:07:58,340
or 45

8787
05:07:58,340 --> 05:08:00,340
if you're foreign and not in America

8788
05:08:00,340 --> 05:08:02,340
because postage costs more

8789
05:08:02,340 --> 05:08:04,340
and that's it that's how you get it

8790
05:08:04,340 --> 05:08:06,340
get blue rays I have 50 left

8791
05:08:06,340 --> 05:08:08,340
and I would like to have zero

8792
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:10,340
what a deal

8793
05:08:10,340 --> 05:08:12,340
what a deal it is a deal

8794
05:08:12,340 --> 05:08:14,340
it's not that bad

8795
05:08:14,340 --> 05:08:16,340
it's pretty

8796
05:08:16,340 --> 05:08:18,340
you can't afford not to

8797
05:08:18,340 --> 05:08:20,340
you literally can't afford not to

8798
05:08:20,340 --> 05:08:22,340
I can't afford you not to

8799
05:08:22,340 --> 05:08:24,340
please

8800
05:08:24,340 --> 05:08:26,340
but you the viewer could technically afford not to do it

8801
05:08:26,340 --> 05:08:28,340
no no that's not

8802
05:08:28,340 --> 05:08:30,340
what I that's not the right message

8803
05:08:30,340 --> 05:08:32,340
shhh cyber show shut the fuck up

8804
05:08:32,340 --> 05:08:34,340
okay

8805
05:08:34,340 --> 05:08:36,340
just reminding you

8806
05:08:36,340 --> 05:08:38,340
I just want to say if you're

8807
05:08:38,340 --> 05:08:40,340
if you're listening the PCP in 2022

8808
05:08:40,340 --> 05:08:42,340
but you're like

8809
05:08:42,340 --> 05:08:44,340
you got cash

8810
05:08:44,340 --> 05:08:46,340
I'm not a real PCP yeah I'm not going to buy

8811
05:08:46,340 --> 05:08:48,340
plebe and the weeb like who the fuck are you

8812
05:08:48,340 --> 05:08:50,340
honestly you're so right

8813
05:08:50,340 --> 05:08:52,340
you're so right like imagine

8814
05:08:52,340 --> 05:08:54,340
you'd be like you're listening to this stupid podcast

8815
05:08:54,340 --> 05:08:56,340
you're one of the like

8816
05:08:56,340 --> 05:08:58,340
10% of people

8817
05:08:58,340 --> 05:09:00,340
who are still here after all this shit

8818
05:09:00,340 --> 05:09:02,340
you're still like six years later

8819
05:09:02,340 --> 05:09:04,340
and you're like I remember

8820
05:09:04,340 --> 05:09:06,340
the plebe and the weeb red con too

8821
05:09:06,340 --> 05:09:08,340
but

8822
05:09:08,340 --> 05:09:10,340
am I interested in owning

8823
05:09:10,340 --> 05:09:12,340
an exclusive one of the kind

8824
05:09:12,340 --> 05:09:14,340
piece of that history

8825
05:09:14,340 --> 05:09:16,340
I'm ambivalent

8826
05:09:16,340 --> 05:09:18,340
like what's wrong with you

8827
05:09:18,340 --> 05:09:20,340
Ben now that you've said that

8828
05:09:20,340 --> 05:09:22,340
you need to check what this episode gets

8829
05:09:22,340 --> 05:09:24,340
in the first week in terms of views

8830
05:09:24,340 --> 05:09:26,340
and make a print exactly that

8831
05:09:26,340 --> 05:09:28,340
I think you're right

8832
05:09:28,340 --> 05:09:30,340
I think I

8833
05:09:30,340 --> 05:09:32,340
honestly I would expect someone

8834
05:09:32,340 --> 05:09:34,340
that's still invested after all this time

8835
05:09:34,340 --> 05:09:36,340
yeah I would expect the viewership to 100%

8836
05:09:36,340 --> 05:09:38,340
be like I'll pay anything

8837
05:09:40,340 --> 05:09:42,340
you viewers do you even understand

8838
05:09:42,340 --> 05:09:44,340
when you own this Blu-ray

8839
05:09:44,340 --> 05:09:46,340
you can just like hold it in your hand

8840
05:09:46,340 --> 05:09:48,340
just you owning that would make Trixie mad

8841
05:09:48,340 --> 05:09:50,340
like just existing

8842
05:09:50,340 --> 05:09:52,340
honestly

8843
05:09:52,340 --> 05:09:54,340
you got to do it like that live streamer

8844
05:09:54,340 --> 05:09:56,340
low tier god and say like I'm not even going to start

8845
05:09:56,340 --> 05:09:58,340
the stream or the podcast until you guys pay me

8846
05:09:58,340 --> 05:10:00,340
enough money to talk to you

8847
05:10:00,340 --> 05:10:02,340
the fact that they are all coordinated

8848
05:10:02,340 --> 05:10:04,340
like deliberately not

8849
05:10:04,340 --> 05:10:06,340
saying anything about it makes it really obvious

8850
05:10:06,340 --> 05:10:08,340
that like yes they are definitely

8851
05:10:08,340 --> 05:10:10,340
pissed off about it and it would upset

8852
05:10:10,340 --> 05:10:12,340
them a lot if

8853
05:10:12,340 --> 05:10:14,340
the more they got sold

8854
05:10:14,340 --> 05:10:16,340
you really would have expected some kind

8855
05:10:16,340 --> 05:10:18,340
of comment right at least be like

8856
05:10:18,340 --> 05:10:20,340
oh this is bad Ben shouldn't have done this

8857
05:10:20,340 --> 05:10:22,340
because you know he's profiting off my work

8858
05:10:22,340 --> 05:10:24,340
or something like I would expect

8859
05:10:24,340 --> 05:10:26,340
something like that

8860
05:10:26,340 --> 05:10:28,340
at least a diss track

8861
05:10:28,340 --> 05:10:30,340
I think I do expect something

8862
05:10:30,340 --> 05:10:32,340
but I think it'll probably get

8863
05:10:32,340 --> 05:10:34,340
maybe commented on and like avoid gazers

8864
05:10:34,340 --> 05:10:36,340
or something I think they will

8865
05:10:36,340 --> 05:10:38,340
I don't know

8866
05:10:38,340 --> 05:10:40,340
yeah they're doing that

8867
05:10:40,340 --> 05:10:42,340
they're doing a Q&A at some point aren't they

8868
05:10:42,340 --> 05:10:44,340
they'll probably mention at the end of that

8869
05:10:44,340 --> 05:10:46,340
I just find it impossible to imagine that she's not annoyed

8870
05:10:46,340 --> 05:10:48,340
like there's no way that she's just like

8871
05:10:48,340 --> 05:10:50,340
that's fine I don't care that Ben's doing that

8872
05:10:50,340 --> 05:10:52,340
you know what I mean

8873
05:10:52,340 --> 05:10:54,340
I know that she is because I know

8874
05:10:54,340 --> 05:10:56,340
that Riley would respond

8875
05:10:56,340 --> 05:10:58,340
to the tweets that I've made at him

8876
05:10:58,340 --> 05:11:00,340
because it's more engagement than he usually gets on twitter

8877
05:11:00,340 --> 05:11:02,340
there's no way he doesn't see them

8878
05:11:02,340 --> 05:11:04,340
the only reason he wouldn't engage with them

8879
05:11:04,340 --> 05:11:06,340
is if Trixie was like don't engage with them

8880
05:11:06,340 --> 05:11:08,340
please

8881
05:11:08,340 --> 05:11:10,340
like I just want to ignore it until it goes away

8882
05:11:10,340 --> 05:11:12,340
like she's told him not to

8883
05:11:12,340 --> 05:11:14,340
that's the only explanation

8884
05:11:14,340 --> 05:11:16,340
also they've been deleting comments about it

8885
05:11:16,340 --> 05:11:18,340
on their

8886
05:11:18,340 --> 05:11:20,340
on their channel so

8887
05:11:20,340 --> 05:11:22,340
that's amazing

8888
05:11:22,340 --> 05:11:24,340
I've seen a few comments that have

8889
05:11:24,340 --> 05:11:26,340
that have disappeared

8890
05:11:26,340 --> 05:11:28,340
the rise and fall

8891
05:11:28,340 --> 05:11:30,340
ah oh shit my headphones fell out

8892
05:11:30,340 --> 05:11:32,340
okay anyway

8893
05:11:32,340 --> 05:11:34,340
I just wanted to remind everyone

8894
05:11:34,340 --> 05:11:36,340
to please give me money

8895
05:11:38,340 --> 05:11:40,340
can I also

8896
05:11:40,340 --> 05:11:42,340
ask for money

8897
05:11:42,340 --> 05:11:44,340
I will ask to

8898
05:11:44,340 --> 05:11:46,340
you the viewer should

8899
05:11:46,340 --> 05:11:48,340
if you're not going to donate to Ben's saint

8900
05:11:48,340 --> 05:11:50,340
for whatever reason you should consider giving money to laserbot

8901
05:11:50,340 --> 05:11:52,340
because he could really use it

8902
05:11:52,340 --> 05:11:54,340
yeah I just

8903
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:56,340
did you know Trixie is making like three times as much

8904
05:11:56,340 --> 05:11:58,340
as Tails gets trolled is

8905
05:11:58,340 --> 05:12:00,340
that sounds

8906
05:12:00,340 --> 05:12:02,340
that sounds about right

8907
05:12:02,340 --> 05:12:04,340
bad timeline

8908
05:12:04,340 --> 05:12:06,340
yeah

8909
05:12:06,340 --> 05:12:08,340
laserbot's making three times as much quality content

8910
05:12:10,340 --> 05:12:12,340
I know

8911
05:12:12,340 --> 05:12:14,340
we're getting money from

8912
05:12:16,340 --> 05:12:18,340
infinity

8913
05:12:18,340 --> 05:12:20,340
it's actually

8914
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:22,340
I spit the inside of my mouth and I'm in pain

8915
05:12:22,340 --> 05:12:24,340
but I'm gonna sold drawn

8916
05:12:24,340 --> 05:12:26,340
good work

8917
05:12:26,340 --> 05:12:28,340
we actually need more money than usual

8918
05:12:28,340 --> 05:12:30,340
because we have to pay all the artists too

8919
05:12:30,340 --> 05:12:32,340
yeah I mean

8920
05:12:32,340 --> 05:12:34,340
we have to divide it amongst ourselves

8921
05:12:34,340 --> 05:12:36,340
well I'm not taking any but

8922
05:12:36,340 --> 05:12:38,340
that latest page

8923
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:40,340
I forget what you said the artist's name was

8924
05:12:40,340 --> 05:12:42,340
like that person definitely deserves to be

8925
05:12:42,340 --> 05:12:44,340
paid for that

8926
05:12:44,340 --> 05:12:46,340
yeah

8927
05:12:46,340 --> 05:12:48,340
yeah I paid them

8928
05:12:48,340 --> 05:12:50,340
there's been some really good guest art

8929
05:12:50,340 --> 05:12:52,340
so yeah obviously

8930
05:12:52,340 --> 05:12:54,340
it's easier to pay good artists

8931
05:12:54,340 --> 05:12:56,340
than just to beg them to do free good art for you

8932
05:12:56,340 --> 05:12:58,340
yeah

8933
05:12:58,340 --> 05:13:00,340
yeah

8934
05:13:00,340 --> 05:13:02,340
that's the whole reason the Patreon exists

8935
05:13:02,340 --> 05:13:04,340
I would encourage people

8936
05:13:04,340 --> 05:13:06,340
to support

8937
05:13:06,340 --> 05:13:08,340
the ongoing

8938
05:13:08,340 --> 05:13:10,340
like you said earlier

8939
05:13:10,340 --> 05:13:12,340
Cybershell like

8940
05:13:12,340 --> 05:13:14,340
like wow

8941
05:13:14,340 --> 05:13:16,340
tails gets trolled is actually putting out regular

8942
05:13:16,340 --> 05:13:18,340
pages like that's kind of

8943
05:13:18,340 --> 05:13:20,340
crazy

8944
05:13:20,340 --> 05:13:22,340
it is honestly

8945
05:13:22,340 --> 05:13:24,340
it was over

8946
05:13:24,340 --> 05:13:26,340
it was dead

8947
05:13:26,340 --> 05:13:28,340
luckily CC

8948
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:30,340
had to help revive it

8949
05:13:30,340 --> 05:13:32,340
with the help of laserbot

8950
05:13:32,340 --> 05:13:34,340
and Embergram and a bunch of other people

8951
05:13:34,340 --> 05:13:36,340
but CC did a lot

8952
05:13:36,340 --> 05:13:38,340
well actually

8953
05:13:38,340 --> 05:13:40,340
I guess this is a big deal to people

8954
05:13:40,340 --> 05:13:42,340
but laserbot actually came back

8955
05:13:42,340 --> 05:13:44,340
oh yeah I forgot

8956
05:13:44,340 --> 05:13:46,340
he probably even announced that on the podcast

8957
05:13:46,340 --> 05:13:48,340
yeah cause he like left the project but now he's back on the project

8958
05:13:48,340 --> 05:13:50,340
and you know he'll do pages

8959
05:13:50,340 --> 05:13:52,340
I didn't know that

8960
05:13:52,340 --> 05:13:54,340
I almost was going to be like

8961
05:13:54,340 --> 05:13:56,340
when you first announced he left I was almost going to be like

8962
05:13:56,340 --> 05:13:58,340
you know you could just not announce it

8963
05:13:58,340 --> 05:14:00,340
because maybe he'll come back someday

8964
05:14:00,340 --> 05:14:02,340
but I didn't want to

8965
05:14:02,340 --> 05:14:04,340
you should be transparent you should be honest

8966
05:14:04,340 --> 05:14:06,340
people would want to know why is

8967
05:14:06,340 --> 05:14:08,340
the art not his

8968
05:14:08,340 --> 05:14:10,340
but part of me was hoping maybe he'll come back

8969
05:14:10,340 --> 05:14:12,340
but I didn't want to jinx it and be like

8970
05:14:12,340 --> 05:14:14,340
cause you never know

8971
05:14:14,340 --> 05:14:16,340
I went along with those guys

8972
05:14:16,340 --> 05:14:18,340
I actually thought about that

8973
05:14:18,340 --> 05:14:20,340
I wish I didn't

8974
05:14:20,340 --> 05:14:22,340
I wish I didn't

8975
05:14:22,340 --> 05:14:24,340
say he was leaving because

8976
05:14:24,340 --> 05:14:26,340
5 million people retweeted that

8977
05:14:26,340 --> 05:14:28,340
and then I said oh actually he's coming back

8978
05:14:28,340 --> 05:14:30,340
like nobody

8979
05:14:30,340 --> 05:14:32,340
it's not as exciting to people who aren't invested

8980
05:14:32,340 --> 05:14:34,340
in the comic you know where he's always leaving

8981
05:14:34,340 --> 05:14:36,340
even if you don't know anything about the comic

8982
05:14:36,340 --> 05:14:38,340
you can sort of be like oh that's big news

8983
05:14:38,340 --> 05:14:40,340
I see

8984
05:14:40,340 --> 05:14:42,340
they wrote the whole article about it

8985
05:14:42,340 --> 05:14:44,340
on Know Your Meme

8986
05:14:44,340 --> 05:14:46,340
whatever

8987
05:14:46,340 --> 05:14:48,340
but what can you do

8988
05:14:48,340 --> 05:14:50,340
it'll be fine like he's going to continue doing pages

8989
05:14:50,340 --> 05:14:52,340
and most people

8990
05:14:52,340 --> 05:14:54,340
especially as the time goes on will that

8991
05:14:54,340 --> 05:14:56,340
announcement fade from people's memory

8992
05:14:56,340 --> 05:14:58,340
yeah I think it's already

8993
05:14:58,340 --> 05:15:00,340
started to fade because

8994
05:15:00,340 --> 05:15:02,340
people used to think the comic was cancelled

8995
05:15:02,340 --> 05:15:04,340
but I think most people

8996
05:15:04,340 --> 05:15:06,340
don't

8997
05:15:06,340 --> 05:15:08,340
also the Five Nights at Freddy's thing helped

8998
05:15:08,340 --> 05:15:10,340
I mean the Five Nights at Funkin

8999
05:15:10,340 --> 05:15:12,340
Friday Night Funkin

9000
05:15:12,340 --> 05:15:14,340
yeah

9001
05:15:14,340 --> 05:15:16,340
Five Nights at Funkin

9002
05:15:16,340 --> 05:15:18,340
you don't know about that Ben?

9003
05:15:18,340 --> 05:15:20,340
well I know what the game is

9004
05:15:20,340 --> 05:15:22,340
there's a Tails gets trolled mod

9005
05:15:22,340 --> 05:15:24,340
for Friday Night Funkin

9006
05:15:24,340 --> 05:15:26,340
do you remember last time

9007
05:15:26,340 --> 05:15:28,340
ages and ages ago I was like dude Ben

9008
05:15:28,340 --> 05:15:30,340
I don't have the most

9009
05:15:30,340 --> 05:15:32,340
viewed Tails gets trolled video on YouTube

9010
05:15:32,340 --> 05:15:34,340
and I have number 2 and you were like oh Pog

9011
05:15:34,340 --> 05:15:36,340
dude now there's like some Friday Night Funkin

9012
05:15:36,340 --> 05:15:38,340
video with over a million views

9013
05:15:38,340 --> 05:15:40,340
that like loads of shit

9014
05:15:40,340 --> 05:15:42,340
just search Tails gets trolled on YouTube right now

9015
05:15:42,340 --> 05:15:44,340
and you'll see what we're talking about

9016
05:15:44,340 --> 05:15:46,340
there's probably like multiple videos

9017
05:15:46,340 --> 05:15:48,340
oh yeah there's multiple videos showing off the mod

9018
05:15:48,340 --> 05:15:50,340
that all have more than our shit

9019
05:15:50,340 --> 05:15:52,340
yeah the first result

9020
05:15:52,340 --> 05:15:54,340
Friday Night Funkin versus Sonic and Tails

9021
05:15:54,340 --> 05:15:56,340
gets trolled 2.0

9022
05:15:56,340 --> 05:15:58,340
and Tails

9023
05:15:58,340 --> 05:16:00,340
okay

9024
05:16:00,340 --> 05:16:02,340
I can't get mad at it even though

9025
05:16:02,340 --> 05:16:04,340
it's introducing a ton of new people to comic

9026
05:16:04,340 --> 05:16:06,340
it's ultimately a good thing

9027
05:16:06,340 --> 05:16:08,340
as far as I'm concerned

9028
05:16:08,340 --> 05:16:10,340
but they are consumers

9029
05:16:10,340 --> 05:16:12,340
and they are cringe for not knowing

9030
05:16:12,340 --> 05:16:14,340
about Tails gets trolled already

9031
05:16:14,340 --> 05:16:16,340
well this is a shocking development

9032
05:16:16,340 --> 05:16:18,340
damn

9033
05:16:18,340 --> 05:16:20,340
I should have been on the internet for 30 years

9034
05:16:20,340 --> 05:16:22,340
like we were

9035
05:16:22,340 --> 05:16:24,340
oh you passed me Cybershell

9036
05:16:24,340 --> 05:16:26,340
the biggest

9037
05:16:26,340 --> 05:16:28,340
it's Friday Night Funkin with 1.4 million

9038
05:16:28,340 --> 05:16:30,340
and then you with just under 600k

9039
05:16:30,340 --> 05:16:32,340
and then my lecture

9040
05:16:32,340 --> 05:16:34,340
with 530k

9041
05:16:34,340 --> 05:16:36,340
and then after that is

9042
05:16:36,340 --> 05:16:38,340
Tails gets trolled is back

9043
05:16:38,340 --> 05:16:40,340
PCP episode with 22k

9044
05:16:40,340 --> 05:16:42,340
and then it's

9045
05:16:42,340 --> 05:16:44,340
chapter 1

9046
05:16:44,340 --> 05:16:46,340
part 1 of is it the audio

9047
05:16:46,340 --> 05:16:48,340
book after that?

9048
05:16:48,340 --> 05:16:50,340
I wish the audio comic book

9049
05:16:50,340 --> 05:16:52,340
or whatever the proper term for it had more views

9050
05:16:52,340 --> 05:16:54,340
like the ultimate Tails gets trolled

9051
05:16:54,340 --> 05:16:56,340
although that one is sort of split because there was an original

9052
05:16:56,340 --> 05:16:58,340
Tails gets trolled channel that uploaded the first

9053
05:16:58,340 --> 05:17:00,340
4 videos or whatever

9054
05:17:00,340 --> 05:17:02,340
and that one's got 180k

9055
05:17:02,340 --> 05:17:04,340
and then the ultimate Tails gets trolled

9056
05:17:04,340 --> 05:17:06,340
the latest one has 12k views

9057
05:17:06,340 --> 05:17:08,340
which I think is the most

9058
05:17:08,340 --> 05:17:10,340
maybe I'm not sure

9059
05:17:10,340 --> 05:17:12,340
I don't know if you can answer like an ultimate

9060
05:17:12,340 --> 05:17:14,340
but it's less

9061
05:17:14,340 --> 05:17:16,340
that channel's only got 8000

9062
05:17:16,340 --> 05:17:18,340
chapter 8 got 57k

9063
05:17:18,340 --> 05:17:20,340
so some of them are a bit bigger

9064
05:17:20,340 --> 05:17:21,340
ok

9065
05:17:21,340 --> 05:17:22,340
I still think

9066
05:17:22,340 --> 05:17:24,340
still more people watch the audio drama

9067
05:17:24,340 --> 05:17:26,340
than the

9068
05:17:26,340 --> 05:17:28,340
read the comic because I hear people say

9069
05:17:28,340 --> 05:17:30,340
oh you know the Friday Night Funkin' Mom got me to

9070
05:17:30,340 --> 05:17:32,340
watch the original

9071
05:17:32,340 --> 05:17:34,340
to watch the original

9072
05:17:34,340 --> 05:17:36,340
ah

9073
05:17:36,340 --> 05:17:38,340
it's the game of the anime of the manga

9074
05:17:38,340 --> 05:17:40,340
well I mean if you live on YouTube

9075
05:17:40,340 --> 05:17:42,340
maybe you just

9076
05:17:42,340 --> 05:17:44,340
just think

9077
05:17:44,340 --> 05:17:46,340
I guess if you've never heard of it before

9078
05:17:46,340 --> 05:17:48,340
YouTubers were all in creative endeavors that originate from

9079
05:17:48,340 --> 05:17:50,340
YouTube

9080
05:17:50,340 --> 05:17:52,340
well whatever

9081
05:17:52,340 --> 05:17:54,340
as long as people are enjoying

9082
05:17:54,340 --> 05:17:56,340
the content

9083
05:17:56,340 --> 05:17:58,340
you know

9084
05:17:58,340 --> 05:18:00,340
who cares if they watch it sub

9085
05:18:00,340 --> 05:18:02,340
or read the manga, watch the anime

9086
05:18:02,340 --> 05:18:04,340
so we're all fans

9087
05:18:04,340 --> 05:18:06,340
speaking of enjoying content

9088
05:18:06,340 --> 05:18:08,340
is this the longest PCP episode now

9089
05:18:08,340 --> 05:18:10,340
or are we still not beat that last week

9090
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:12,340
it's gotta be close

9091
05:18:12,340 --> 05:18:14,340
I don't know

9092
05:18:14,340 --> 05:18:16,340
I don't know the exact count

9093
05:18:16,340 --> 05:18:18,340
because I started my audacity recording way earlier

9094
05:18:18,340 --> 05:18:20,340
so I'm at like 5.30

9095
05:18:20,340 --> 05:18:22,340
but I know we're only at like 5.10

9096
05:18:22,340 --> 05:18:24,340
5.15 is something like that

9097
05:18:24,340 --> 05:18:26,340
that sounds about right

9098
05:18:26,340 --> 05:18:28,340
that's pretty long

9099
05:18:28,340 --> 05:18:30,340
yeah I'm 5.20

9100
05:18:30,340 --> 05:18:32,340
if it's not the longest it's probably

9101
05:18:32,340 --> 05:18:34,340
I need to go get some food I'm hungry as fuck

9102
05:18:34,340 --> 05:18:36,340
the guests are overruling

9103
05:18:36,340 --> 05:18:38,340

9104
05:18:38,340 --> 05:18:40,340

05:18:40,340 --> 05:18:42,340

9107
05:18:44,340 --> 05:18:46,340

they're good

9123
05:19:20,340 --> 05:19:22,340

9125
05:19:24,340 --> 05:19:26,340

9129
05:19:32,340 --> 05:19:34,340
