1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Feels like it was like two days ago that we recorded the last time.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
Yeah, that's how I always feel. I'm like, where did my week go?

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,880
I only did like, I only got to spend like one and a half days doing the work I wanted to do.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,200
Oh well.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,440
Not doing the work I wanted to do today at all because I'm doing this fucking podcast.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,840
All right. I'll get the voicemails.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,600
Cyber Shell and Gamers Tavern, we're going to be on. Anyway, who's that? Gamers Tavern. Gamers Tavern.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,320
Can you hear me now?

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, we can hear you. And there's Cyber Shell. There's number, what's number five? Yo!

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm getting the voicemails.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
Can you believe we have a full roster of people on this episode?

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,240
It's like a real podcast. Oh, we, my God, we qualify.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,160
You thought it was going to be only four people.

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
Yeah, I saw your message and I was like, I'm going to ruin this guy's whole career.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
Okay. Well, day ruins.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
I only appear on this podcast to dab on Ben Saint and ruin his day.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
That's the only reason any of us are here, right?

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,680
The only reason I even am here is to bait people into trying to dunk on me by being on.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
To masturbate people.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,320
No.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
Voice mail, voicemails, voicemails.

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
There's not, there's not that many. There's like less than, there's a little less than usual,

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,120
so that's good. Fucking finally, yeah.

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,800
Only 90 minutes worth.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,920
There's only just over one full page of them, usually there's a page and a half.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,600
Yeah.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
They're all going to be like, only just a, only just an hour.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,680
If we only spend an hour on voicemails, I'll call that a win.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
There's no winning. I'll take whatever, I'll take it and it whatever.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,080
Maybe they're all just like really well thought out questions and they're all just very good.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,560
It's possible, it's possible, like it's possible that the sun could simultaneously

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,520
go supernova right now. It's possible when the odds are possible.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,760
We're all praying for it, but who knows if it's going to happen.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah, yeah. Just like the heat death of the universe happening immediately.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,480
A quantum event, an atom spontaneously transforming into another element.

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
I have yearned to witness such a rare event.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,960
That's what the Dr. Manhattan says, right? That's like the...

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,920
Yeah, yeah. That's part of this little monologue, I believe.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
About how humans are all special.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,680
You know, I liked it better when Barney sang the song about how I'm special and I'm the only one.

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,320
I didn't like being condescended to by Dr. Manhattan. It just wasn't the same.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
Yeah, his thing was kind of some bullshit, to be honest. It was like, oh,

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,840
now I realize the odds of this specific person existing, this specific sperm and egg,

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
like what are cosmic twins? Yeah, whatever. It's like bullshit.

45
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
You could point to literally anything that exists and be like, it's...

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
I can't believe this exists. I can't believe what's on Mars is this shape.

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
Right. That's basically what he was like. He went to Mars and was like, this is so cool.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,640
That's what betrayed Dr. Manhattan, not as a super fucking genius scientist man,

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
but as a construct written by a normal comic book artist.

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
Yeah, he had to take this based character and turn him back into some cheesy fucking,

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
yeah, humanity's good kind of shit. Oof, big oof.

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,320
Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,240
Sad. Fuck you, Alan Moore, you hack.

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,400
They did a pretty good job of trying to write a character who loses all his humanity,

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,600
but I guess it would be a little too depressing if that was just the...

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,320
I mean, he does fuck off at the end of the story, but if he just was like,

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,520
nah, I'm not even going to fucking help a little bit during the climax,

58
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,120
that would have been a little too depressing.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
I don't know. I think it would have been pretty sick.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,920
People weren't ready for that yet. People were barely ready for Watchmen.

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,000
People are still like, they couldn't even conceptualize comics besides being just,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
you know, cape shit, whatever the standard was in the 80s.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Fair enough.

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,200
I mean, I'm sure there were good comics before Watchmen and fucking Dark Knight Returns,

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,920
but I don't know. I'm not really a comics expert.

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,200
Um, there was, um, there was, uh, oh, who was that? I was just reading about...

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
He wasn't like a comic book character. He was like a radio serial character,

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,920
and he's the guy who Darkwing Duck is based on. I think he's called The Shadow.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
I think he's like... Oh yeah, I know, I know what you're talking about.

70
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,640
Yeah, The Shadow's a real thing.

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
Yeah, I guess he was not a comic book character.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,800
He was like a film noir guy, right?

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
It was before they invented drawing,

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,040
so they just had to tell stories about him on the radio, I think.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, jeez. It was a long time ago.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
It was like a big inspiration on Batman or something.

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Yes, yes. I think so.

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
They like homage The Shadow in an episode of Batman the Animated Series

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,920
by making their own version of Shadow called The Great.

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
And what if The Shadow was a furry? That's Batman.

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
And Darkwing Duck is also, he's kind of like, he's more The Shadow,

82
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,440
but like, since The Shadow is like such a dated reference,

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
he was he was often more of like a Batman parody because like that was

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,040
contemporaneous.

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Well, they're a duck man.

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
That's right, it's Darkwing Duck, isn't it?

87
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,360
No, I mean, like a guy who's got like a spandex, he's got like, you know,

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,800
suit, but then his signature moot aesthetic is that his mask is like a duck bill,

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
and he makes a duck quank.

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
I mean, ducks aren't that scary, but I mean, Goose Man, that could be scary.

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm kind of scared of Gooses.

92
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
His signature move is ducking.

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,680
Yeah, you can't hit me if I'm if I'm going to duck under it.

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,640
That's good.

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,280
You could definitely get a really gross looking cartoon called Duck.

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,120
There is, there is a, does Donald get turned into a superhero by that one,

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
like Professor Duck?

98
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
No, no, it's not.

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
It's another character from Duck Towns.

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
I forgot his name.

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Duck Dodgers?

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,360
No, is it?

103
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
Um, that's that's Daffy.

104
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,440
Is it?

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,840
Is it the who's the fucking the big duck, the big guy, uh, Launchpad?

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,800
Launchpad McQuack?

107
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,720
He does not become the it's like some scientist guy who works and like he

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,960
gets like the suit and he becomes so like he becomes a gizmo duck.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
That's true.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
I remember gizmo duck.

111
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah.

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
I remember gizmo duck.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Learning a lot.

114
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,320
Universe is so extensive.

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
Why does it exist?

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
Such a, such a mystery.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
You've got to find like the equivalent of the flan.

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,800
Fenton is his name.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,040
Fenton becomes gizmo.

120
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,080
What do ducks do?

121
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
I guess they just honk.

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Why are there so many ducks?

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,520
But they, uh, there was a duck.

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Gizmo, gizmo, but gizmo duck is not the guy who gets, there's like a game.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
There's like a video game about not technically it's Donald, but they don't

126
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
call him Donald and I think he's technically not the same character.

127
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
I know, I know what you mean.

128
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,480
Uh, I forgot the name, but it was a game on a super Nintendo and the Genesis.

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,320
We're learning so many things right now in a podcast.

130
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,400
There was a show in the late 90s about Donald duck becoming like a ninja.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,080
Yeah.

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
The ninja one.

133
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
The ninja one.

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
I think there was maybe a game grumps about it.

135
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,160
Maui Mallard?

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
Yeah, that's the one.

137
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah, maybe.

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
Maui Mallard.

139
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah.

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Oh, yeah.

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
I actually recognize this box art now.

142
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
I can't believe there was a Donald duck as a ninja game.

143
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,800
What the fuck?

144
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,200
It's actually weirder than kind of words.

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah, I rented that game years ago and it's, uh, it's kind of mediocre, honestly.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Maui Mallard is a medium boiled detective.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Oh, because of eggs.

148
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,680
Jesus Christ.

149
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Wait, you can't medium boil out an egg.

150
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Why is he medium boiled?

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,280
You can hard boil it and you can soft boil it.

152
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
I think she's not hardcore enough.

153
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,320
So it's just in between soft and hard boiled.

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,800
Okay.

155
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,120
Yeah.

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
This is not hard enough.

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Lane.

158
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,640
There was a lot of demand for duck and Donald duck related media in the 90s.

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,720
It's huge in like parts of Europe.

160
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,880
Like in some European countries, duck stuff is like really big in culture.

161
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,640
Uh, in Germany, I went to, there was a like a celebration when I was there and there

162
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
were a bunch of, I saw people dressed as it's the goons.

163
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,640
It's like the evil goons that like try to steal Scrooge's fortune.

164
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,280
And like, I didn't even know what they were all the be the be the beagle boys.

165
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes.

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
I saw people dressed as the beagle boys.

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,760
It's like, I don't even know if anyone would know what that is.

168
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm looking at the list of fictional ducks on Wikipedia.

169
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,960
And I've got like the ducks from duck hunt in video game section.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,160
If they remade duck tails, they would just replace them with Jeff Bezos, right?

171
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,840
No, they replaced, uh, one of the rich ducks in the duck tails remake with like basically

172
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Mark Zuckerberg.

173
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
That makes sense.

174
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
There are a lot of ducks.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Social media fictional ducks, I mean.

176
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
There's so many ducks.

177
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,560
I mean, there's, I mean, the whole, the whole duck of verse is.

178
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,360
Are we just going to have the duck episode where it's like, all right.

179
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
We're not even recording.

180
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
This is completely wasted.

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,320
Donald Duck.

182
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
No, Craig's recording.

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
This is all the bonus episodes.

184
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
Thank fucking God.

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,640
Yeah.

186
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,400
This is going to be a really short episode.

187
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,880
I started recording.

188
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
I was saying.

189
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,680
I just throw out my audacity because I was like, this is too good.

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,840
I think ducks in other media.

191
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,880
And the second example is duck guy from don't hug me.

192
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,520
I'm scared.

193
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah.

194
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Oh yeah, I remember that.

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,160
The duck guy.

196
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't know why it just cracks you up.

197
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,800
It doesn't have a name or anything.

198
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
Pretty fair.

199
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,920
Maybe we should just, maybe Ellie is, I should just put this in the main episode.

200
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm not against it.

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,960
I started recording, but I don't have the, I don't have the beginning of the duck conversation.

202
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,400
I know Craig should have it, but.

203
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
Craig has, Craig has, I just.

204
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
You can have 15 minutes of an episode if we just include all of this.

205
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,160
I didn't even get to start off with my customary joke.

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,240
Well, we can have an official start and then the unofficial start, which is our duck conversation.

207
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,440
Let's, let's sync now while we've got the chance on the count of three, say sync.

208
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,280
One, two, three, saying.

209
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,600
Same.

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,640
Why?

211
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Sorry, my headphones were off.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,040
Fringe.

213
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,040
Okay, I'll do it again.

214
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
One, two, three, saying.

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:12,720
Same.

216
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,120
Same.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
One, two, three, saying.

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,600
Same.

219
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,320
Same.

220
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
Okay, I'm gonna move my mic.

221
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
Ha, ha, ha.

222
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,200
Yeah.

223
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,840
Okay, there we go.

224
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,040
Um, ducks thumbs up.

225
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,840
Duck tails.

226
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,080
I didn't like, I feel like maybe I talked about this on another episode,

227
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
but I didn't like duck tails.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,040
I thought that, I thought that cartoons with animal characters were baby shit.

229
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
I thought Disney cartoons were baby shit and I thought animals were baby shit.

230
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
You definitely weren't a furry.

231
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,000
No, no.

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
Sounds like an opinion edge lord contrarian fancy.

233
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,640
Yeah, a little.

234
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,440
I thought animal shows were baby shit until I grew up.

235
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
And then I got all into my little ponies.

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,160
Then I thought they were hot.

237
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,560
Take care.

238
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Until I saw the quantities.

239
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Well, after my sexual awakening, I realized that they, the ducks could be fucks as well.

240
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,800
I could fuck the ducks and now everything changed.

241
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Things would never be the same after the Fire Nation attacks.

242
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
After the, ah, whatever.

243
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh, after the Duck Nation attacks with the duck bending powers.

244
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,200
After everything changed after Duckburg attack.

245
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
Duckburg would never be the same.

246
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,240
My favorite duck show actually was Darkwing duck and not duck tails because

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
I liked the concept of a hero who sucks at everything

248
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,440
because that was basically the plot of the show.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
Just so relatable.

250
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,600
No, he's, he's good when he, when he tries.

251
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,280
He's mostly incompetent.

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
I don't agree.

253
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
He's, he's not motivated.

254
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,280
He doesn't want to, he's unmotivated, but when he puts his mind to it, he's pretty good at crime fighting.

255
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,320
He mostly does it to become popular.

256
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,960
So it kind of reminds me of like a YouTuber that just does videos to become popular.

257
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,560
Like every YouTuber.

258
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,160
So he just wants to be a hero to be popular and he kind of sucks at it.

259
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,760
I just liked it because it was very, it was a very cynical show, even though it was a kid's show.

260
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Yeah.

261
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,040
Now, now I'm thinking of like a YouTuber going around dressed up as a superhero,

262
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,240
going into alleyways and beating people up for views.

263
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
Yeah, that would be a good idea actually.

264
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
That probably exists to some degree.

265
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
That's like Phoenix Jones, right?

266
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,280
I was gonna say that.

267
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
He wasn't like a full-on YouTuber, but like that's basically what it is.

268
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
He had a, he had a big social media presence.

269
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Yeah, he had a YouTube channel.

270
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess he was a YouTuber.

271
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
I guess he could technically be considered one.

272
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,520
I just, I just, I watched that atrocity guy the other day.

273
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Maybe that's an idea for the YID crew.

274
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,800
Ooh.

275
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,280
Which is gonna become crime fighters.

276
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a new niche on YouTube.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
I could definitely see that.

278
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
People would love that content.

279
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
Riley already has a cape.

280
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,680
That's true.

281
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
I mean, that could be the name, that could be the name of their like superhero team,

282
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
the branches of YID.

283
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,440
Dude, that is like a bad idea.

284
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Um, did you guys see that May is pregnant?

285
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
Excuse me?

286
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,240
What?

287
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,880
I saw you celebrating the good news on Twitter.

288
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
He seems so happy about it.

289
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,280
Oh, you saw that?

290
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,520
Yeah.

291
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,320
She, she's, you know, I'm just, god, I'm glad someone is protecting the white race.

292
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,800
All right.

293
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,400
Because Biden sure as hell isn't doing a, doing a damn thing.

294
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,880
Um, what a night.

295
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,280
No, Maya, she, she tweeted like the, the census stats saying that like white people,

296
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,320
there are fewer white people and she said, oh, I'm so, this is a girl.

297
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm so glad I'm having a baby now.

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
This is the now is the best time I need to be having babies now.

299
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
This is so weird.

300
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
Good for you.

301
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,960
Love it for you.

302
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,400
That's so strange.

303
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
It almost sounds like a coat.

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,640
It's totally.

305
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,440
It almost.

306
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
I don't even know whether she's happy about it or not.

307
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,960
I guess she is.

308
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,400
I, I can, I, yeah, I feel, yeah, I feel like I want to read it that way.

309
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,840
I guess I could, I could maybe see.

310
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,320
Oh, I mean, no, no, no, no, no, this is good.

311
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,800
This is good.

312
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
The white, white race needs this.

313
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,560
I, I should be happy about it.

314
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
Maybe, maybe.

315
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Having children just sounds like a nightmare.

316
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
And so, yeah, it doesn't matter who is having children.

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm always just like, no.

318
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,720
I mean, I don't want to, I'm not actually that caught up with my Ethan Ralph

319
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,600
Laura, but he didn't.

320
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,000
He just had like another child born to some other woman who's like.

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
Yeah, the last training order against him or some shit now.

322
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,880
So it's just like, you know, he's staying busy.

323
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
You got to respect the hustle, just constantly having new children.

324
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
The first won't share the first, the first marriage and immediate pregnancy,

325
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
and then divorce ended in like extra, it protracted, you know,

326
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,200
divorce proceedings and harassment lawsuits and all that.

327
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,440
But I'm sure this time it'll work out a lot different.

328
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,640
The best thing you can do is have a rock solid foundation.

329
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,000
Make it all content for social media and be posting that all the time.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
So there's no way you can bite your in the ass when it goes wrong.

331
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
It's all going to work out.

332
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,760
And if it doesn't, hey, it's great.

333
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
It's going to make great content.

334
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Yeah, it's good content either way.

335
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
God, I only have to be on the fucking show.

336
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,280
Going to the divorce, going to divorce court, going to divorce court

337
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,480
and just being like, hey guys, it's your boy vlogging you from,

338
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,600
from divorce court.

339
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
So big dance is going to be great.

340
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,920
Yeah, that's a good idea.

341
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm going to get married for content.

342
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,320
Get married.

343
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,800
Why not?

344
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,080
They're worse.

345
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,280
They're worse reasons.

346
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,440
Yeah, it's a fantastic idea.

347
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,320
So much, so many like donations coming in.

348
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,680
We'll be great.

349
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,520
This childbirth will be great content.

350
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,960
I bet, I bet somewhere.

351
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,280
I think there's already a, I think there's already an entire genre of YouTubers

352
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
that have done that before.

353
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,960
Yeah, I love the idea of someone like live streaming their whole wedding

354
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,640
and like right in the middle of the proceedings.

355
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,600
Like, yo, what's up?

356
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,560
Thanks, pussy fucker 69 for the $100 donation.

357
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,440
Really appreciate it.

358
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,760
That's definitely real.

359
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,840
That's, that's, it's definitely happened.

360
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,200
I know people have live streamed their weddings,

361
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,280
but I don't know if anyone's ever stopped for donuts.

362
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
That's not in the future.

363
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,920
That's the past.

364
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,480
Before the vows, can we just catch up on donuts quickly?

365
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,880
Do you take your fellow content creator to be your, your YouTube partner?

366
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,160
Uh, uh, uh, till, uh, till a copyright, copyright strikes.

367
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
What are you doing at this wedding?

368
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,760
The first streamer to get married in a chat.

369
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
They turn, they turn the wedding into a review of something.

370
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
Like, like this is the pretext, this like the beginning skit is the wedding.

371
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
And then they turn the camera and they start talking about fucking.

372
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm here to review, I don't know.

373
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
Reviewing marriage.

374
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,040
You know, it started off like a, the plot of super paper Mario.

375
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,360
First, first wedding.

376
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,040
This is a good like a concept for like boomer reviews on YouTube.

377
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,840
Like, uh, today I'm reviewing my dumb bitch wife.

378
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
First of all, I hate my fucking wife.

379
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
The game feel, the game feel is, it leaves a lot to be desired.

380
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,680
The graphics are pretty, pretty realistic.

381
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,040
Um, you know, maybe a little too realistic.

382
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,520
There was a lot of false advertising for this game.

383
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,080
A lot of bull shots before the marriage started, but, uh,

384
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,040
now that it's released, definitely a visual downgrade.

385
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,320
The devs, not a lot of replay value patches.

386
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,560
The patches just starting to know what that would mean.

387
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,960
It's, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a band and wear.

388
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,800
This marriage is a band and wear.

389
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,480
Now that I'm a few months into this marriage,

390
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
it's pretty obvious to me the economy is very pay to win.

391
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Hahahahaha!

392
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,660
Yes!

393
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,240
This game is not fucking balanced.

394
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,720
This sucks.

395
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
Just gotta, you just gotta patch it, I don't know.

396
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,120
You just gotta, well, but at least it's good content.

397
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,760
At least I can stream it on Twitch.tv.

398
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,440
Uh, uh, I'm, I'm, yeah.

399
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm what you could call the DSP of getting married.

400
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,920
Um, you know, I complain, you just edit the game.

401
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,480
You walk home and your fucking wife's cheating on you

402
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,800
and you're just like, wow, there was nothing I could do!

403
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Just get good, oh my god, omega lull, just get good, marriage, just get good, and she wants you.

404
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Get a cut to the chat, it's just omega lulling at you.

405
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Compilations, guys, this is how you don't get married.

406
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
This is how you don't live your domestic life.

407
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,800
When people do mukbang, and I think people like livestream them sleeping, I don't even know if that's allowed.

408
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,800
You could do the entire, entire life challenge livestream, entire life livestreamed.

409
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:03,800
There's like, in real life streamers, you basically just stream their whole lives like, just incidentally, so I'm not surprised if someone out there is basically doing that right now.

410
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Having a baby, so I can mount a fucking digital head camera to it, and then just livestream, it's POV 24, it's entire life.

411
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,800
You can basically do this, you know, you can like, have a kid and be like, on broadcasting it every day on social media.

412
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
You're basically making them have like, a little Truman show, and they got it sent to a channel.

413
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,800
We gotta monetize. Baby, you're not, this baby, I gotta feed and clothe it while it better pay for itself with content.

414
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Wait, wait, wait, I need to write all these ideas down.

415
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
The Gamer's Tavern Empire is about to begin.

416
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
This is the next wave of content.

417
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
This is the rocketing to Twitch stardom.

418
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Every time you sit down to have just dinner with your family, you like, have to set up all these like, mics.

419
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
They're like, Dad, we don't wanna do a podcast, we just wanna eat dinner.

420
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,800
It's like, shut up, we gotta do another podcast episode. This is the bonus episode.

421
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Honey, did you wash your hands before the podcast?

422
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Did you, uh, did you, uh, make, make sure you gotta clean your plate before we, before we, uh, sign off the podcast and ask everyone to like, comment, and subscribe?

423
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
It's like, uh, Dad, we're tired, we just wanna go to bed.

424
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,800
He's like, quiet, we only have a few more pages of voicemails, just be quiet.

425
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Damn, this is, this is too real.

426
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Uh, this, this is, this is just, damn, I can't believe we live in 1984 and the world is really like this now.

427
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I mean, it's not even that far removed from like, celebrities, children being in the spotlight and having to like,

428
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,800
growing up, like, knowing to pose for cameras and doing photo shoots and being so disconnected from actual real life.

429
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Man, this is just the modern, this is the modern version of that.

430
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Like, uh, if I can, Jayden Smith or something.

431
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Yeah.

432
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Right.

433
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Yeah, you know, it is kind of like Jayden Smith has said some infamously hilarious things, but like, I mean, you know,

434
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah, he actually had people paying attention like his Twitter account when he was like a tiny little kid, you know what I mean?

435
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Like, of course he's gonna have all the dumb shit he said recorded.

436
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
It's, can you really hold that against him?

437
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I probably said some pretty stupid shit as a kid, but luckily nobody cared.

438
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I said some pretty stupid shit like last year.

439
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Oh, we know, we know.

440
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Just as embarrassing.

441
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
We didn't forget.

442
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Um, it's like.

443
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Got my wrist, it's ready to go.

444
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Was it, was it the, was it the YMS review of the, that one movie with the Ursa?

445
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Which fucking?

446
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
After Earth.

447
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Oh, yeah.

449
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,800
There's the clips, there's the clips of like the, it's like Will Smith and his whole family on talk shows and sometimes like,

450
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:39,800
sometimes like they make jokes like at Jayden's expense and like they laugh at him and like his dad like laughs at him when he makes a fool of himself.

451
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,800
It's kind of funny, but it's also like, wow, that's bizarre.

452
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:49,800
There are a lot of interesting like things you can find from those just like behind the scenes, like touring and like promotional videos.

453
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Like cause they record so much promotional bullshit.

454
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Like that's something I appreciate.

455
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Like YMS will like, nobody's doing like a Lion King review.

456
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:03,800
He'll like go through like all the fucking promotional red carpet shit just looking for the highlights of like cringe and just weird interpersonal moments like that.

457
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
You know what I mean?

458
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Yeah.

459
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:13,800
It's, it is like, I remember in that one, it does like the way Will Smith talks about the movie is like, yeah, I guess you can,

460
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,800
he had a certain attitude toward the production and it does kind of come across in the movie itself and like why it is the way it is, you know,

461
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,800
why is my son the star of this movie even though he's bad at playing this role?

462
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Well, it was a little family project.

463
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,800
That movie had like weird Scientology undertones to it.

464
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
What kind of undertones?

465
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Scientology, I don't know.

466
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
There's like a lot of weird parallels.

467
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:47,800
That movie was just weird because like they decided to have Will Smith be like calm and like not emote, which is like, that's not really the kind of acting he's the best at.

468
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
He just had a vehicle for his son.

469
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
So he had to take the backseat before.

470
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Right.

471
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Right.

472
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
It was a vehicle for his son, I guess, but nobody wanted that.

473
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
They just wanted to see Will Smith be Will Smith.

474
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Not even Jaden Smith wanted it.

475
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Right.

476
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Is he still acting and stuff?

477
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I mean, I assume it has to be, right?

478
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,800
The only thing I remember Jaden Smith being in was what was that fucking anime on Netflix?

479
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Oh, right.

480
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Right.

481
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Oh, the one with the Tobleron?

482
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Neo-Yokio.

483
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Neo-Yokio.

484
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
That was it.

485
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
That was it.

486
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I only remember that image of the Tobleron.

487
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Yeah, I think it was.

488
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I think it was Neo-Yokio.

489
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
It was pretty funny.

490
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Oh, no.

491
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm real at it.

492
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Oh, no.

493
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I only have disk space remaining for three hours and 14 minutes.

494
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Oh, dear.

495
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800
I got to clear some space.

496
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
That's pretty mad.

497
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I guess.

498
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I guess that means no voicemails this week.

499
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Oh, no.

500
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
What a nightmare.

501
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
It's like four hours now, so.

502
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
There's five people on here.

503
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
I can see ourselves going four hours easy.

504
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Since Cyber Shield is on this one, it's probably going to be five hours.

505
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Well, we had to take, last time we had Laserbot.

506
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
That was like a historic moment.

507
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
That was a world historic event that'll be in history books.

508
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
That's true.

509
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
It's all been overshadowed.

510
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,800
It's all been overshadowed by the Chris Chan news.

511
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
It's such.

512
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,800
It is so funny the timing of that and how you had to rush to put out your Sonichu thing.

513
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I mean, you didn't actually have to, but I agree that that was probably the best way

514
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
to do it.

515
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
I was better immediately than later, I think.

516
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I wish I had just put it out a year ago.

517
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Like you said, it's not like, if it was already out, it would still be getting a spike of

518
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
views.

519
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
All Chris Chan content was getting a spike.

520
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Ideally, it would have been better if you just had put it out like a year ago or at

521
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
least six months ago.

522
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Yeah.

523
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I didn't gain anything by waiting.

524
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,800
I thought, I mean, I thought, I really thought that it was the end of Crystory and nothing

525
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
else of interest was ever going to happen.

526
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Truly, it didn't matter if it came out.

527
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Nothing had happened for like years.

528
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
It really seemed like it was sort of tucking in.

529
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
And now it's like, this is the most relevant Chris Chan will ever be.

530
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I have to believe in my heart that there will never be another like more mainstream event

531
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
than this.

532
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Like please, for God's sake.

533
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Yeah.

534
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I hope it never gets more, any more confidence.

535
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,800
As someone who has known about Chris Chan since like, I don't know, before 2010, watching

536
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,800
all of this was pretty surreal for me.

537
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
It's horrifying.

538
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
It's just, it's just horrifying.

539
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I think I watched that Tucker segment on a voucher.

540
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
I didn't watch the segment.

541
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,800
The segment is weird because it's, he says like, you know, Baba Chris Chan, Baba biological

542
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
male, and then he moves on to like some other talking point.

543
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
He barely even, barely knows anything about.

544
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
He's literally just like, oh, we can say this is bad because of trans people.

545
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I feel like it's not as like a pivotal turn.

546
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
I don't think it's a pivotal turning point that's like, Oh no, now loads more people

547
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
are going to think that trans people are just like this.

548
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
I think it was just like one in like just another.

549
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Any, any same thing will realize there's like no connection.

550
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,800
It's just, it's just a talking point.

551
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Yeah, I already have the same talking point.

552
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Like you said, he barely, he barely mentions Chris Chan.

553
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,800
It's, it's, it's like you could just, just have a list just like any time a trans person

554
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
does a crime.

555
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Just like talking was like, all right, time for the segment.

556
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
And he'll just read off the list.

557
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
This crime, this crime, this crime.

558
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Okay, there we go.

559
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Trans bad.

560
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Someone pointed out that it was like, I think Tucker Carlson thought his name or thought

561
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Christine's name was Chris Chan.

562
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Like everybody thinks that.

563
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
But it's not.

564
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
I mean, that's not, that doesn't even make sense.

565
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Like do people, I mean, okay, whatever.

566
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I guess it makes even theoretically possible.

567
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,800
But like even people that should know, I've seen them writing it as two separate words,

568
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Chris space, capital Chan.

569
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
And like, no, it's Chris dash Chan.

570
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
It's the Japanese diminutive.

571
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Maybe I've just been too much online, but like that seems so obvious to me.

572
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Like obviously it's short for something.

573
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
It's the Japanese diminutive.

574
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,800
It's the Japanese diminutive and it's short for Chandler, but it's not a name in and of

575
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
itself.

576
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
She's not Chris.

577
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
We have to forgive Tucker.

578
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
He's not very cultured.

579
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Yeah.

580
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
He doesn't know deep internet lore, which is embarrassing.

581
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
You should watch Ben's lecture.

582
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
You should watch.

583
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
You should watch.

584
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Ben, you should add him on Twitter.

585
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
We're still weird.

586
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
I got the inside scoop, Tuck.

587
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
You do.

588
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Hey, Tuck.

589
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,800
It's weird how he picked Christian.

590
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,800
If he didn't really mention him much at all is like, why pick Christian out of like anybody

591
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
else?

592
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Literally just because it was like trending on Twitter and it was like, oh, this is just

593
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
some easy thing I can say for like five seconds without having to like formulate an argument.

594
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
You know what I mean?

595
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Yeah.

596
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,800
It's just so weird to me how many people are like, I never even heard of CWC before this

597
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
week.

598
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
And I'm like, damn, you people aren't as online as me, I guess.

599
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah.

600
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I guess.

601
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
It makes perfect sense to me.

602
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,800
It's kind of like a really weird internet thing that you have to have been using internet

603
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
for a long time to be fair.

604
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,800
It's like, I have a, it's hard for me to even understand like how quote unquote mainstream

605
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
it is.

606
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
But like, I don't expect everyone to have like a deep knowledge of Christianry, but I do

607
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
expect someone who's been online for a long time to have like heard of Sonichu.

608
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,800
It's a pretty like not seen one image with the medallion ever in their whole life.

609
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Like it's a pretty widespread.

610
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,800
I remember only ever hearing about Christian and Sonichu from Ben, not from the lecture,

611
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
but from just talking.

612
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,800
I hadn't heard about it until that point.

613
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,800
People in my discord were telling me that I should, that I should call it, that I shouldn't

614
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,800
call it a Sonichu lecture, that I should call it a Chris Chan lecture because the name

615
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Chris Chan is more recognizable than Sonichu.

616
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
And I thought that was so bizarre.

617
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
At this point now, that's probably true, but that didn't used to be true.

618
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,800
No, to me, Chris Chan is the creator of Sonichu.

619
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Like that's, that's who they are first and foremost and everything else is like,

620
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I like about those lectures that they are looking at it through the lens of Sonichu,

621
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,800
which is the only real reason you should be interested in Chris Chan.

622
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
You know what I mean?

623
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Like you shouldn't be like, oh, I want to troll this person.

624
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
You should be like, oh, I want to see this weird thing they made.

625
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
You know what I mean?

626
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
People, people asked me in the, in the comments, like, are you going to do,

627
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
are you going to do a lecture, a 103?

628
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
And I'm like, what would I do it on?

629
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I talked about the whole comic.

630
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
The comic is over.

631
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Literally just bait them and be like, do Sonichu 103 and get those clicks.

632
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,800
And it's just like one, like a couple like minutes on the remainder of the special issues.

633
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
And then the rest is just summarizing slime and punishment.

634
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Maybe you never know.

635
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Maybe it might be Radcon 5, baby.

636
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,800
There might be more Sonichu coming out of prison.

637
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Yeah, we don't technically know that Sonichu is over.

638
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I saw some people saying like, oh, it's over at this point, but we don't know necessarily.

639
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
I mean, I don't know.

640
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
I mean, I'm not necessarily saying we're going to get more.

641
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
So we'll see.

642
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
We might get the prison arc.

643
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,800
I think this, this might be the most like a new and like more productive era.

644
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,800
You know, we had a Sonichu Dark Age for a while there.

645
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
There was no Sonichu.

646
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Right.

647
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
Maybe now we'll get more than ever because Chris will just have like, what else is she going to do in?

648
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I don't think she'll end up in prison.

649
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I think she'll end up in an institution or something.

650
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Even in an institution or you're in prison, they let you have crayons there apparently.

651
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Those are some of the only things you're allowed to draw with because they don't want you having sharp things.

652
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
This is the long game.

653
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Chris was preparing for this whole time.

654
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,800
It all comes back as full circle.

655
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,800
You start as a child when you're drawing with crayons and then you end as an adult in prison and you're only allowed to do that.

656
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
That's why she never got more advanced.

657
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
She knew.

658
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Right.

659
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
This is going to happen eventually.

660
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
She knew.

661
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
She knew it was going to come back to this.

662
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
You saw her in her mind.

663
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
She used Future Sight.

664
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Just like she used Future Sight to avoid being raped by her son, Sonichu.

665
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,800
In issue 13, she used Future Sight to see that this was going to happen.

666
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Honestly, I mean, I don't know.

667
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,800
It's like part of me feels weird going back and trying to look at an old F-shoes of Sonichu and laugh at them,

668
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
but there's some things that are still so funny.

669
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
It's just like that one panel where he's like,

670
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Begged your pardon, miss, but nice rack or whatever.

671
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh, Blake.

672
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
It's so fucking funny.

673
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Blake.

674
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Yeah, Blake.

675
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Confidential Christie.

676
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Thanks, Blake.

677
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Don't get any fucking ideas.

678
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
They all just want to fuck her.

679
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
They all just want to fuck her.

680
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Of course.

681
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Wouldn't you?

682
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Of course.

683
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Of course.

684
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
It is one of those weird things where it's like,

685
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,800
God, just because of how obscenely, ridiculously documented every aspect of Christine's life was,

686
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
there are a million red flags in hindsight,

687
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
and there are a million, a million people have pointed out things like there.

688
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
You know, Chris is really weirdly affectionate with Barb.

689
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
It's like, hmm, yeah.

690
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
There was a, this was like months ago,

691
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
but there was a tweet she made that was like,

692
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
it was like apropos of nothing.

693
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
She made a tweet that was like,

694
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Yes, I have slept in my mother's bed,

695
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
but only sleeping, only sleeping.

696
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Have a good and safe day.

697
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Lightning bolt, blue heart, lightning bolt.

698
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Let's talk about a red flag.

699
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I was like, hmm, yeah.

700
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Like, hmm, my tweet about how I only slept and did nothing else in my mother's bed

701
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,800
is raising a lot of questions that were already answered by my tweet.

702
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I don't, I don't see what the problem is.

703
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Some people just have to take things out of context.

704
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I know.

705
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Yeah, sometimes it's better to take something out of context.

706
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
That's, I just, that was like months and months ago.

707
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
That was like earlier in the year.

708
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
It's, might genuinely have been unrelated.

709
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Well, I can't, I can't say I'm too surprised,

710
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
honestly, knowing the history of Chris,

711
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,800
it's kind of par for the course, I guess.

712
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
This is what I said.

713
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Not really.

714
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm just saying by Ben, which is that.

715
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
It's a little stranger than anything that's happened before.

716
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Yeah.

717
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
I would say.

718
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
I kind of thought Chris was over.

719
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,800
I thought we were entering the boring twilight years of just boring commissions

720
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,800
and all sorts of other weird, you know, nonsense.

721
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
And yeah, honestly, I don't want to get too into it,

722
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
because actually I'm on the same page as you, Ben,

723
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
which is I saw there's like more lore about some Chris being manipulated.

724
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
And I was like, I don't even want to, I don't want to read this.

725
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
It seems too, it seems too upsetting.

726
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I just don't want to get into it.

727
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I'll let everyone else take care of this.

728
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I've seen a bunch of it.

729
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
And I'm like, I think it's like, yeah, that seems plausible.

730
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Sure.

731
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I believe Chris might be manipulated, but like.

732
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
It doesn't absolve responsibility or anything.

733
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
It's just like another factor.

734
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Another thing that's going to be complicating this whole ordeal.

735
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Chris has been, Chris has been manipulated into doing very,

736
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
very bizarre and like harmful things.

737
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Hardly anyone could possibly be on the record as much as Christine

738
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
as like being easily manipulatable and like having just like on record

739
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
is doing like being tricked into doing all sorts of ridiculous things.

740
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
So I mean, again, I'm not saying absolves responsibility.

741
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I'm just saying it's another thing to make it more complicated.

742
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,800
But blackmailed for thousands of dollars by someone telling her

743
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,800
that a laser on the moon was going to blow up quick bill.

744
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,800
It was literally a thing that happened.

745
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
So not nothing is off the table.

746
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
I don't understand.

747
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Why do they think financially extorting was going to be the best option

748
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
for, you know, ruining Christine's life?

749
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Like that's just a weird saga for me.

750
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
I think they just wanted money.

751
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,800
They were just like, hey, we can just get some money from this person.

752
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Lol.

753
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
OK.

754
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
You could just get a job.

755
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
It's not an epic troll, guys.

756
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,800
You could spend months trolling this fucking weirdo

757
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
and manipulating them and gaslighting them until you can get their fucking

758
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
like PlayStation online gift cards or whatever.

759
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Or you just get a fucking job.

760
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
It's like, OK, so these people really in their mind, the idea guys

761
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
and whatever this new chick is, they in their mind like,

762
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I'm really owning Christine by spending hours and hours in my life,

763
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
literally like my life every day and feeding into her delusions

764
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,800
and just being, you know, it's like you're wasting your own life.

765
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
You know what I mean?

766
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Like I've seen like chat logs leak and they're like, they're very long.

767
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
You know what I mean?

768
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I mean, Christine just wants to talk about lots of bullshit.

769
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
So you have to do a lot of just entertaining.

770
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,800
I mean, if the rumors are to be believed, the new girl is just like a sadist

771
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
who just likes to torture people

772
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
and wanted Chris to kill herself eventually

773
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,800
and was playing the long game to get Chris to commit suicide just for fun.

774
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
There's a lot of psychos on the Internet.

775
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
It's a scary place to be honest.

776
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
And yeah, it's kind of sad that someone would target Christine

777
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
just because how famous she is.

778
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Basically, I would assume that's the main reason just like, you know.

779
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,800
How famous and how famously vulnerable.

780
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,800
If you've been using the Internet as long as I have none of this is surprising.

781
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Right.

782
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Just the kinds of people that are out there.

783
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Yeah, me and Gamer, we're old friends on.

784
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
We go back to the LP days and we just, we've seen it all.

785
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
We've seen it all.

786
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
We've seen all the horrible.

787
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I mean, even like something like that exists out there.

788
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,800
It's just sort of, it's sort of stranger when you have like a face

789
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,800
or a name to an actual person who does that sort of stuff.

790
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Like there's always this amorphous like, oh, the dark web,

791
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
the worst kinds are on there.

792
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,800
And then you see one in real life in some capacity and you're like, oh my God.

793
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
How does somebody end up like that?

794
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,800
It is different when it's like versus like, oh, there are creepy people on the net

795
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,800
versus like this, here's a specific person, all the weird fucked up shit they've done.

796
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
And it's like, damn, it's kind of harder to like, you know,

797
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
pretend they don't exist or whatever when, you know, I know what they are.

798
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
You know what I mean?

799
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
But I don't know.

800
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,800
Well, there was a time when the regular internet was basically the dark web

801
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,800
and the average forum was like a four-shand board, you know?

802
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Yeah, the internet used to be a lot meaner in general to the point where,

803
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,800
I mean, there was this weirdly like lighthearted element to it all,

804
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800
but I don't know, yeah, like the idea of harassing people and stuff.

805
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I mean, a lot of this harassment to Chris Chan back in the day was like,

806
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
not even seen as that malicious.

807
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I mean, there are obviously a few malicious actors,

808
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
but a lot of it was just people were like, lols, it's just trolling.

809
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
It's just trolling for the lols.

810
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,800
It's all been agglomerated onto like, you know, individual, like social media sites.

811
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:36,800
It's all been like collected into, you know, like private platforms, right?

812
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Instead of the discourse being all spread out across like forums and message boards

813
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
and private servers and stuff.

814
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Right. People in general are just less psycho on the internet now that people,

815
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,800
you know, a lot of people tie to real names and identities to their online identity,

816
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
whereas back in the day it was like everybody, you can't be using your real name online

817
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
or you're going to get kidnapped and killed.

818
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,800
So everyone has to do everything anonymously, you know what I mean?

819
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
And now everybody just willingly offers the government all their personal information.

820
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Yeah, now they want to make it a crime to be anonymous on the internet.

821
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,800
There's like people like, we see these trolls hiding behind their anonymity,

822
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
like all the, you know, like the blue check marks on Twitter.

823
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,800
They're like, they shouldn't be allowed to be anonymous and not,

824
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
because they can make fun of me and my face, but it's like, I don't know.

825
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I don't want anonymity to go away, but I do understand there's people who abuse it,

826
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,800
but I don't think the solution is making it so everyone has to use the real name all the time.

827
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:40,800
It's okay. The vaccine microchip will automatically be uploading your data to your Twitter account soon.

828
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
It will upload your DNA to your profile picture.

829
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,800
As soon as Bill Gates is going to wait until 99% vaccine saturation,

830
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,800
then he's going to push the big red upload button, and then the blue check marks will be safe.

831
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,800
The blue check marks are the only people who are going to be spared in like the post-apocalypse.

832
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
It's like every single other person is going to be purged.

833
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Only the most valuable people recognized by their blue check mark will survive.

834
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,800
It's the mark of the beast. It's the mark of the beast.

835
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Mark of the best, more like.

836
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Yeah, exactly.

837
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,800
I got a pee. Sorry, I'll be back in a minute.

838
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Excuse me. Pardon me, bad time.

839
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,800
All right, everybody, now we can finally shit-talk Ben, get all of our hot Ben takes out.

840
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Hot Ben Saint takes out.

841
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Can you believe that Ben Saint doesn't have 30 plus tabs open on his web browser at any given time?

842
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,800
What a dork. How does he even use the internet if he doesn't have that many tabs?

843
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
He's barely using it.

844
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,800
He needs at least that many.

845
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,800
My favorite thing about Ben Saint is his Twitter timeline.

846
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
It's basically just him listing all the people he hates.

847
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Somebody has to dab on them.

848
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,800
I saw a series of tweets the other day where the entire day was just him tweeting,

849
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,800
I hate this guy and I hate this other guy and I hate that guy.

850
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,800
That's our Ben. He hates a lot of people.

851
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
There just wasn't enough negativity on the internet.

852
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,800
So Ben was like, you know, someone really needs to close the gap between the endless positivity on the web

853
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
and someone who's just solely focused on the negative.

854
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
There was too much discourse on Twitter.

855
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,800
There were too many people having conversations and someone needed to come in and be a little agitator,

856
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,800
a little disruptor and throw a wrench into the works and be like, you know what?

857
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm going to say what nobody else is going to say, which is that some of these people online suck.

858
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
And you know what? He's a hero for saying it.

859
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Here's a list of all the content creators I don't like.

860
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
And why I don't like them and how they can be better.

861
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,800
That's the, you know, people are afraid to tell it like it is.

862
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
They just want to sugarcoat everything.

863
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,800
They're too afraid to constantly be getting into arguments with everyone who approaches them on Twitter.

864
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I think our boy does though.

865
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Gamers Tavern was following it with silence because he loves everyone.

866
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Yeah, exactly.

867
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
No, no, no, it's all good.

868
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
It's all good.

869
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
If you're listening to this episode right now, definitely do not bother Ben Saints on Twitter

870
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
because he will definitely listen to this part back and know what's happening.

871
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Yep.

872
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,800
We're all fucked.

873
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
Nah, he'll never.

874
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,800
There's no way he'll ever listen to me say fuck Ben Saint, more like Duck Ben Saint, more like Duck Saint, more like Quack.

875
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Eleazar, make sure that Ben Saint has been thoroughly dabbed on and that he never knows about this.

876
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,800
And if you ever find out about it, it's your fault.

877
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:58,800
There's so many fictional ducks. I'll never know them all. I'm actually upset looking at like the page of fictional ducks isn't that long, but there's still so many I've never even heard of before.

878
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
I actually know most of the video games.

879
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:11,800
I'm back and I just want you to know that you're all great chums and pals and I'm just glad to share my good times.

880
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Share some positive vibes with all of you here on the Procrastinator's podcast.

881
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I'm so glad you said that, Ben, because we weren't shit talking to you the whole time you were gone or anything like that.

882
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I know. I assume so.

883
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Yeah, we definitely weren't doing that at all.

884
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
What else? Why would I think anything differently?

885
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
What did I miss?

886
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
I don't know. We're back on the ducks.

887
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
We're like, I don't know. I think this happened before the episode started.

888
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,800
We accidentally pulled up a list of fictional ducks on Wikipedia and we can't stop.

889
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,800
Well, it was no accident. We deliberately wanted to talk about ducks.

890
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
It was a guided discussion towards ducks and Darkwing duck and a lot of ducks.

891
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Doctor Quack from Sonic the Hedgehog.

892
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Oh my God. I remember Doctor Quack. Jesus Christ.

893
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I don't.

894
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,800
That's an interesting example because it's a non-game example.

895
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Yeah, it was from...

896
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
I actually don't remember Doctor Quack.

897
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
That's from the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, right?

898
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Yeah.

899
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I like, at the bottom of the page by the video game section, it has Bruce the Duck from the Atari 2600 video game Duck Attack.

900
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
I don't know why, just the image of this super low-poly duck.

901
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
It's just a duck.

902
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,800
It's a low-poly looking, but with the description, with the Wikipedia description,

903
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,800
something about that cracks me up here. I'm gonna post it in chat so people will understand what I'm talking about later.

904
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Bruce the Duck is just a duck.

905
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,800
You know what they say, life comes at you fast like Sonic on a first date.

906
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Exactly. Except Sonic doesn't date. He's an incel.

907
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
No, he's a vol-cell.

908
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Sonic doesn't come in. He's a vol-cell.

909
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,800
He could get laid, but he would never.

910
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
He would never do that.

911
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
He would never dare do that to me.

912
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
He would never betray me like that.

913
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Dating would mean slowing down in life, and we all know he would never do that.

914
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,800
He's too much of a shan to get laid.

915
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,800
That's the opposite of like, celibate the word.

916
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Like, to have had sex in a celibate.

917
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
No, that's not it.

918
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Just laid.

919
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Based.

920
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
So like, vol-laid or inlaid?

921
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:29,800
In that one, in the Doom episode of Action Button, Tim Rogers is giving a bunch of lists of like,

922
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,800
how like everyone I knew in college had watched the animation for Nights of the Round from Final Fantasy VII,

923
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,800
and he says like, it doesn't matter if you were like, loser or Chad, virgin or laid.

924
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
So that's the dichotomy.

925
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
I see.

926
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,800
I don't think it's true that everybody watched that animation.

927
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
That seems a little strange.

928
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,800
He said that like, he would be like, hey, I'm playing, you've heard of Final Fantasy VII,

929
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,800
and they're like, yeah, I've seen that poster of Cloud on the motorcycle,

930
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,800
and they're like, okay, cool, we'll just, hey, look at this cool summon I can do.

931
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Look at how these knights, and they go, wow.

932
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
It is a cool attack animation.

933
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,800
I'll give them some credit.

934
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:24,800
I appreciate when Tim Rogers tells me about video games in between monologuing about his life for three hours at a time.

935
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Yeah.

936
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,800
He is a, what a windbag.

937
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
What a bitch.

938
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,800
He's one of those people where it's like, oh yeah, well, of course you can have an interesting YouTube channel

939
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,800
because you've done all these cool things in your life, like go to Japan and translate games.

940
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
What am I supposed to talk about?

941
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Just being a fucking loser who makes YouTube videos and hasn't done those things?

942
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,800
I brought up Tim Rogers last, I think after the show last week, I brought him up and I showed,

943
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,800
and I mentioned him to Tom, and Tom looked up a picture of him,

944
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,800
and Tom was like, oh no, I don't like the look of this guy.

945
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
You know, sometimes you see a guy on the Internet,

946
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,800
and it's not fair to judge a book by its cover, but you just see him and you're just like, I don't like that guy.

947
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Ben's immediate defense, and I will defer to his expertise since he's more familiar,

948
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
that it was not the most flattering quote though.

949
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,800
I had that reaction with pro Jared.

950
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,800
He might be a nice guy, I don't know, but I just don't like his fucking face,

951
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,800
which isn't very polite or nice to say, but I just have had that reaction.

952
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,800
I see him in a thumbnail and I'm like, I'm not clicking that video, you piece of shit.

953
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,800
How dare you ask me to click this video by making a thumbnail?

954
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,800
For whatever reason, the women seem to really like him.

955
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Yeah, the only thing I know about pro Jared is that he got in that controversy.

956
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
I can't even remember how long ago that was.

957
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
They completely lost track of linear time.

958
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
That was before fucking COVID, wasn't it?

959
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Yeah, it must have been.

960
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,800
So it must have been like early 2020 or like late 2019 or something?

961
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,800
I think it was like 2019 or 2018.

962
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Oh my God, that shit was so funny.

963
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,800
That shit was so funny.

964
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,800
Bad things happen to people who aren't me.

965
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,800
I remember celebrating when I was watching his follower count drop.

966
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
I thought it was so funny.

967
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Watching him go down from a million subs to 750k.

968
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,800
But then I ended up hating other people involved in that situation more than I hated him about it.

969
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
It wasn't like it was all him or whatever.

970
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,800
I think Bethead Bernie or something had a good video where it was like pro Jared.

971
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,800
It wasn't just being a creepy.

972
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
Some people lie to him and some other bullshit.

973
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,800
I don't really want to rehash it all and I don't remember it properly.

974
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Just for the record, I'm not putting him on blast.

975
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
I literally do not hate the guy.

976
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
I just think he has a fucking weird face.

977
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Bethead Bernie asked me for my input about that video.

978
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,800
One of my tweets is in that video.

979
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,800
It's in some point.

980
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,800
It's screen-shotted.

981
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Your take on the Sitch.

982
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,800
That was the first thing that happened as soon as the fucking pro Jared drama dropped.

983
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
As soon as the Christian drama dropped, everyone was like,

984
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
what's Ben Sainz take on this?

985
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,800
It's the most important take to know about.

986
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
The only one.

987
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
All you need.

988
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
And that's all you need.

989
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,800
Pro Jared's face is like smoothed out grumbo.

990
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Is there any way to describe it?

991
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,800
He's got kind of a smooth face, but it's lumpy as well.

992
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
What are you talking about?

993
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
The way he wins.

994
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
I don't know.

995
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,800
It's kind of wet, but in a dry way.

996
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
It's kind of like a bird-like snout.

997
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
No.

998
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,800
The skin is like, he takes care of his skin.

999
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,800
He takes care of his hair, but he's got a lumpy, weirdo face.

1000
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
And bulging eyes.

1001
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,800
He does kind of have bug eyes, yeah.

1002
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,800
At least be thankful that you haven't seen his leaked nudes.

1003
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Oh, I think...

1004
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
I think they saw the editor version.

1005
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,800
It's not a pretty sight.

1006
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
I might have seen his dick.

1007
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,800
I saw a censored image.

1008
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,800
I laughed.

1009
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
I laughed.

1010
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,800
If you're an internet content creator and you're like taking pictures of yourself like that,

1011
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
you're basically asking for them to get leaked to the public.

1012
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Yeah, it's a time bomb.

1013
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
I'll say.

1014
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,800
It's a matter of a way.

1015
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
You can do it.

1016
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
I'm not saying you're not allowed to do that, but just be aware.

1017
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Knowing that it's going to happen, even.

1018
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Just make that your brand, if that happens.

1019
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
Fuck it.

1020
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Yeah, just have an open door policy.

1021
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Just like, yep.

1022
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
You have your video game review shown at the end.

1023
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
Now for the cock of the week.

1024
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
He should have leaned into it and been like, yeah.

1025
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
I'm cool, progerited.

1026
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
I'm going to have lots of sex with people now.

1027
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
I'm going to be the sex game reviewer.

1028
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,800
I'm going to be the sex YouTuber now.

1029
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,800
I'm going to be the gaming YouTuber.

1030
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
I'm opening up my secondary channel on porn hub.

1031
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,800
So if you guys want to come check that out,

1032
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,800
here's the link in the description.

1033
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
I think he's still really popular and successful.

1034
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,800
He's not like a top triple A tier YouTuber,

1035
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,800
but he's pretty popular, pretty successful.

1036
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,800
So I don't feel that bad making fun of him.

1037
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,800
In the long run, it didn't really hurt him that much.

1038
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,800
There's a lot of people getting these huge fucking controversies

1039
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,800
and traumas and people are like, oh, he's ruined.

1040
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
His channel is over, but no.

1041
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,800
It takes a lot to really ruin your channel.

1042
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
You'd have to be trying on purpose or something.

1043
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Unless you literally go to jail, usually it's okay.

1044
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,800
Even then, sometimes these fucking Minecraft predators

1045
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
will come back and then they'll just still start making videos

1046
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
and their fan base is so young and stupid

1047
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
that even if they lose 50% of their viewer base,

1048
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
that's still enough for them.

1049
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,800
There's two names that are coming up in my head

1050
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800
relating to this, Onision and Shane Dawson.

1051
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
I don't know whether they're the same guy or very similar.

1052
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
Are they both like sex freaks or is just one of them?

1053
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,800
Wait, Shane Dawson isn't like a sex freak, is he?

1054
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
He's not like a groom or anything.

1055
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,800
He's just kind of an asshole, right?

1056
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Am I wrong?

1057
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
I don't know.

1058
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,800
He has a bunch of weird drama.

1059
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
I'm not really sure about all the Shane Dawson drama,

1060
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
honestly, I kind of miss both of that.

1061
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,800
They strike me as like people who've been horrifically canceled

1062
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,800
because of things they did absolutely,

1063
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,800
and I don't know whether they've come back from that.

1064
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,800
You can't cancel someone who's as big as Shane Dawson.

1065
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
Right, you get to a certain point and it's really hard

1066
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,800
to truly cancel someone.

1067
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Again, you can make them lose popularity or whatever.

1068
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,800
That's fine, but to make them fully go away,

1069
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,800
if they're determined to stick around, it's tough.

1070
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,800
I've seen at least one popular YouTuber get...

1071
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,800
They do look exactly the same.

1072
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Completely canceled.

1073
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,800
There was Zero, the Smash Bros.

1074
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,800
He used to be one of the best Smash players in the world

1075
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
for Smash 4.

1076
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Right.

1077
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Oh yeah, yeah.

1078
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,800
There's a lot of Smash community people who have gotten...

1079
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,800
Oh, what's sorry about Leffen?

1080
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Are you talking about Hax and Leffen?

1081
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,800
No, just a different guy who's been accused of...

1082
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,800
I don't know if it was grooming or some shit, but...

1083
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,800
I heard there was a lot of grooming going on

1084
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
in the Smash community for a while.

1085
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
It's ironic that there was so much grooming going on

1086
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
because there was little to no self-grooming.

1087
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,800
They never took showers.

1088
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Look at these freaks, they're exactly the same guy.

1089
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,800
I do have that sort of...

1090
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,800
I'm a YouTube pretty boy face bullshit going on.

1091
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,800
I have no idea how they're both still around,

1092
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
but I think it's...

1093
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,800
I think younger Shane Dawson looks even more like Onision.

1094
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I think you could find even more similar pictures of these too.

1095
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Yeah, another thing about these guys,

1096
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
I'm not really that much of an expert on them.

1097
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I think I've seen a couple YouTube documentary type videos on them,

1098
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
but they've been around for ages.

1099
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
When you've been on the platform for this long,

1100
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,800
people will have these laundry lists of controversies.

1101
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
They never end, so it's like,

1102
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,800
is this latest thing going to be the thing to cancel them?

1103
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
I don't think so.

1104
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,800
At some point, your career just becomes like responding to

1105
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,800
people making videos about how you are a monster

1106
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
and need to be canceled.

1107
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,800
But randomly, there's a lot of people who want to watch those

1108
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
like apology videos.

1109
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
There's always get lots of views,

1110
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,800
so it's like profitable to be constantly apologizing.

1111
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,800
There should be a chance where the first video is an apology video

1112
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,800
and then every video after that is also an apology video.

1113
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,800
I'm so sorry for never making a video up until right now.

1114
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,800
There should be a gimmick.

1115
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,800
There should be a fucking like priest YouTuber,

1116
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,800
like a real priest who does like,

1117
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,800
what is the thing, where you go in the box and you say,

1118
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,800
oh, it's confessional.

1119
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Confession booth series YouTube show.

1120
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,800
I'd watch that.

1121
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,800
It doesn't look like a good gimmick.

1122
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,800
It's hidden camera confessions where he just like records

1123
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,800
everybody who comes in and confesses their sins

1124
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,800
and then exposes them.

1125
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,800
Completely goes against the idea of like the confession box,

1126
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,800
like the secretive private thing.

1127
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Yeah, but it's for content though.

1128
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
It's for content.

1129
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,800
The church is running out of funding.

1130
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,800
I gotta have a baby.

1131
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,800
I gotta have a baby so that I can raise that baby to be a sinner

1132
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,800
and then I can record my child in the confessional

1133
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,800
confessing his sins to the priest and then upload it to YouTube

1134
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
for content.

1135
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,800
You just stream the confessional all day.

1136
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Yeah, I was gonna say Twitch.

1137
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,800
And then in between people like coming and leaving,

1138
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
it's like, all right, we're gonna fucking read some doughnos.

1139
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,800
It's like America's funniest confessional.

1140
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Someone's like confessing in their booth,

1141
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
like it's like, Father, I'm so sorry.

1142
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,800
I hit someone with my car and the priest is like,

1143
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,800
can we get some Monka S in chat?

1144
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,800
This is not on open guys.

1145
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
Can we get some Monka S?

1146
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Yeah, of course.

1147
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,800
I like the idea that it's not like some third party,

1148
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,800
put the secret camera there.

1149
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Like the priest is the Twitch streamer.

1150
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Exactly, exactly.

1151
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
Like he's like pogging at the camera.

1152
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,800
He's like, oh.

1153
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,800
It's just like, you know, there's like two sides of the confessional.

1154
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,800
There's a little sliding door that opens so you can talk to him.

1155
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Father, I'm sorry, I sinned.

1156
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,800
He like closes it, turns on like the RGB lights and stuff.

1157
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
It has like this fucking gamer setup and turns it back off

1158
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
when it's back up, keeps talking.

1159
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,800
He's like, I cheated on my girlfriend with her sister

1160
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
and he goes like, oh, based.

1161
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh, like can we get, smash the like shit, like come and chat?

1162
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
No, no, no.

1163
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,800
Like the idea is that it's a secret.

1164
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Like he doesn't, he doesn't tell them he's live streaming

1165
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
and when he pogs, he's like silently pogging,

1166
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,800
but they can't see him through the thing.

1167
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
He's like, pogging to chat.

1168
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
The camera's on his side.

1169
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,800
And then they're hearing all of like this, the confession.

1170
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
He's like, oh, pog base.

1171
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Someone just realizes it's the perfect way to get content.

1172
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,800
These people are just coming in and telling all these embarrassing stories.

1173
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
Like where else are you going to get that?

1174
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,800
This is all, it's all been, all these confessions before

1175
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,800
they've all just been wasted content.

1176
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,800
We're just, we're just leaving money on the table.

1177
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,800
We have like thousands of years of wasted content

1178
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
in terms of confessions.

1179
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
If you think about it.

1180
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
As rid of all these ideas are.

1181
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
The problem is, I think this might be illegal.

1182
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,800
If you think about it.

1183
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
That's clearly never stopped the Catholic Church before.

1184
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
If you think about it, all of human history

1185
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,800
prior to the invention of like the written word

1186
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,800
was just wasted content.

1187
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,800
It really was, it really was.

1188
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Imagine having a life experience and not making content out of it.

1189
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
What a waste.

1190
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
I would rather not.

1191
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
I would rather not.

1192
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Imagine not having thousands of people watch you through your eyes

1193
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
and get like advertised to.

1194
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Imagine that didn't happen.

1195
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,800
I mentioned like, like 5,000 years ago, like around Stonehenge

1196
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,800
they're like passing down their songs to a world tradition.

1197
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
And one guy's just like, what's the point?

1198
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
We're not even monetizing this.

1199
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,800
We're not even getting any doughnuts.

1200
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
We're not getting any doughnuts, bro.

1201
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Oh my God.

1202
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
Oh my God.

1203
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Imagine, what a great conversation with a friend.

1204
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
No, no, no.

1205
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Imagine with like a great fucking Isekai show

1206
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,800
that would be like a fucking streamer gets sent back in time

1207
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,800
to like prehistoric days where there's no fucking content.

1208
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
All he's doing is like, he's like,

1209
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,800
he's like experiencing all these like fucking like historical events.

1210
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
He's like, I can't fucking vlog any of this.

1211
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,800
I would love for there to be like a Dr. Stone

1212
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,800
where he's like trying to teach these cavemen.

1213
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Alright, so this is when we have to start a fake beef

1214
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,800
and you're the heel which means you're the bad guy

1215
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
and we're going to have to start a whole rap battle

1216
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
that goes on between you guys

1217
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,800
and then we're going to do a boxing match

1218
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
and he's just like trying to explain the complicated

1219
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
like setting up a huge beef or whatever.

1220
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Yeah, the first thing that comes back

1221
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
is not like humanity infrastructure

1222
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,800
like countries or like society.

1223
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
It's vlogging.

1224
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,800
That's the first thing that we need.

1225
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,800
All those Islanders, like they're building the Moai statues

1226
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
and there's like, I know these seem totally like pointless now

1227
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,800
but like hundreds of years from now

1228
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
they're going to invent this thing called the Internet

1229
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,800
and then we can stream these

1230
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,800
and then we can, then we can, we'll get doughnuts.

1231
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Like, stream like aesthetic statue, not moving.

1232
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Yes, yes, like this is for content.

1233
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,800
This is for content.

1234
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,800
These are, these are too many good ideas.

1235
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
We need to pay people.

1236
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
Yeah, Aliza, cut this all out.

1237
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,800
We got to keep you close to the chest.

1238
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Listeners, if any of you do this, you owe us a cut.

1239
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Don't even think about inventing a time machine

1240
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
and going back and inventing streaming.

1241
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,800
If you even think about doing that.

1242
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Going back in time and inventing Stonehenge.

1243
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
It's like, it's like those, those movies.

1244
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Livestreaming the building of Stonehenge.

1245
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,800
Or like, oh, like the kid goes back in the past

1246
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,800
and he's like, whoa, what the fuck?

1247
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
There's horses and shit.

1248
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,800
Where's the video games?

1249
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Then he teaches like the princess about,

1250
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,800
I don't know, like skateboarding or whatever.

1251
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,800
But like a modern version of that would be like

1252
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
the kid going back in time

1253
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,800
and then teaching them about like,

1254
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
I don't know, Mario Kart.

1255
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
I would love like a training montage.

1256
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Like this is how you make a pog face.

1257
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,800
Or like practicing their pogs.

1258
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,800
That's kind of all to this point.

1259
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Bill and Ted, but instead of a history report,

1260
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,800
they go back to the live stream history

1261
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,800
because they want to become streamers.

1262
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,800
They've dropped out of school to become streamers

1263
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,800
and this is how they're going to get the big scoop.

1264
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,800
They go back to when Twitch was called JustinTV

1265
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,800
and then they start an account.

1266
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,800
Honestly.

1267
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
I remember JustinTV.

1268
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,800
Imagine if you could just go back to when the internet was new

1269
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,800
and just upload the same videos that you make now.

1270
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,800
You'd be huge.

1271
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
It would be so fucking easy to go viral

1272
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
like knowing everything you know today.

1273
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,800
It would be literally like, you know, the sports almanac

1274
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,800
from Back to the Future part two or you can win it every bet.

1275
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
But you just can predict every YouTube trend

1276
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,800
before it happens and you'd be making this worst clickbait garbage.

1277
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,800
You would have such terrible tools to use, though.

1278
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
Imagine having to do your shit in Windows Movie Maker

1279
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,800
and just be like, oh, God, my fucking Pentium 4

1280
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,800
is struggling to fucking edit this

1281
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,800
and I can only upload in 360p.

1282
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,800
Google's not good enough. I can't get all my footage.

1283
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,800
I can't just rip it. There's no tools to use it yet.

1284
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,800
It really was a fucking nightmare back then.

1285
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,800
Now you bring your bad memories.

1286
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,800
I go back to 1999 and I'm on Usenet forums

1287
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,800
and I'm like, hey, bros, listen, years from now,

1288
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,800
some person is going to put Sonic the Hedgehog

1289
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,800
and this new thing called Pokemon.

1290
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,800
They're going to combine them into one guy

1291
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,800
and make a comic about it and you're really going to

1292
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,800
and you're not going to believe what happens after that.

1293
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,800
I love the idea of like a John Teeter

1294
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,800
who just goes back to warn people about Sonichu

1295
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,800
and nothing important.

1296
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,800
No warnings about 9-11 or anything.

1297
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,800
No, no, just because no one would listen.

1298
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
No one would listen to that.

1299
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
I miss like you have like a time machine,

1300
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
like you give a kid a time machine and they're like, wow,

1301
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,800
I can go at any point in history and they just go back

1302
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,800
a couple of years to get YouTube famous.

1303
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,800
That's the only thing they do with it.

1304
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
What if you just did that now?

1305
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
What if you just went on a fucking forum

1306
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,800
and just said you were a time traveler and was like,

1307
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,800
oh, this new content creator is going to show up.

1308
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,800
It's going to be fucking ridiculous.

1309
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,800
Then you just wait two years and then you start that account.

1310
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,800
You start a prophecy about yourself?

1311
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,800
Yeah, you just start like a prophecy about yourself

1312
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,800
so you can like get that jumpstart to your career

1313
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,800
and just be like, it was this guy predicted it

1314
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
and now it's shown up, you know,

1315
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,800
and you just spanned ignorance the rest of the time.

1316
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
I love the idea.

1317
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Before you even start your streaming career,

1318
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
people always ask my advice.

1319
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,800
I was like, what should I do on YouTube?

1320
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,800
I was like, okay, before you even start YouTube,

1321
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,800
you need to spend five to 10 years foreshadowing

1322
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,800
your channel before it even exists.

1323
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
You need to be like dropping in some of your forums,

1324
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,800
fakingarchive.org results about...

1325
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,800
Organic growth doesn't exist anymore.

1326
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Therefore, you got to really fucking play the long game.

1327
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Right, you have to game the system

1328
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,800
by doing the most crazy outlandish stunts possible

1329
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,800
and like fake time travel.

1330
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,800
That's the only way to get your attention.

1331
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
And you also got to hope that nobody else

1332
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,800
decides to be that person that is foreshadowed.

1333
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,800
Oh yeah, nobody can like...

1334
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
You have to have some specific thing,

1335
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,800
otherwise someone can just swoop in and take all your glory.

1336
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
That was why the John Theater stuff works,

1337
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
there's so much hyper-specific bullshit

1338
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,800
that never even happened,

1339
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,800
but like, oh, it sounded legit.

1340
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,800
But it can all happen if you're the one controlling it.

1341
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,800
You can make sure everything comes true.

1342
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,800
Don't even think about starting YouTube channel

1343
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,800
if you don't have 10 years worth of deep lore plans.

1344
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Worth of prophecy.

1345
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,800
Worth of prophecy.

1346
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Isn't that basically how you got your start cyber shell?

1347
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
You've been doing this for quite a while.

1348
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Yeah, it was all prophesized back in the day.

1349
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
That's exactly how I got my start.

1350
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
I didn't want to be a guy who made videos

1351
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
that sound like that.

1352
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,800
Also, I love the idea...

1353
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
I love the idea that John Theater,

1354
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
you know, I dropped some clues here and there.

1355
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,800
I love the idea that there's a prophecy,

1356
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,800
the prophecy, the chosen one,

1357
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,800
and then it's like,

1358
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,800
it's like Link Carr in front of a couch.

1359
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Like, hey guys,

1360
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,800
we were doing this on YouTube.

1361
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Oh, it was Doug, it was Doug.

1362
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,800
Doug really is the chosen one.

1363
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,800
He's like the main character of this timeline.

1364
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Yeah.

1365
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
More like the awesome one.

1366
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:58,800
I saw...

1367
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,800
It was a YMS stream clip

1368
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,800
about Doug reacting to criticism of the wall.

1369
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
Oh, right.

1370
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,800
I think I saw this.

1371
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,800
He has a weirdly good and positive

1372
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,800
and wholesome attitude about it.

1373
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,800
He has a positive attitude,

1374
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
but he also just completely

1375
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,800
just talks around the actual criticism.

1376
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
Oh yeah, he'll never engage

1377
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,800
in the true substance of the criticisms.

1378
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,800
He'll be like,

1379
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,800
you know, I'm glad people are talking about it.

1380
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,800
It's like, hey,

1381
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,800
why did you make it so like confusing

1382
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,800
and contradictory and like bad?

1383
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
And he's like,

1384
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
I'm just glad people are talking about it.

1385
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Right.

1386
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,800
He said it in kind of a way like,

1387
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,800
oh, I understand those criticisms,

1388
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,800
and he sort of lumped that into like

1389
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
one general thing.

1390
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
And it's like,

1391
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
people are always going to dislike

1392
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
what you do on the internet.

1393
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,800
I know that.

1394
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,800
I've been on here for a long time.

1395
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,800
And everyone's always disliked everything I've done,

1396
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,800
so it was just haters.

1397
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,800
He clearly doesn't realize

1398
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,800
that there's a distinct like confusing aspect

1399
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,800
of his video.

1400
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,800
He just thinks people don't like it.

1401
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
And that's just how it is sometimes.

1402
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,800
It's just, you know,

1403
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,800
no learning capability.

1404
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,800
They're always going to have haters.

1405
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,800
They're always going to have haters.

1406
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
They're always dissecting the wall

1407
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,800
because it was just,

1408
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,800
they were haters.

1409
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
They're just,

1410
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
oh, of course,

1411
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
there's going to be some people who don't like it.

1412
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
It was like a fascinatingly bad piece of media.

1413
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I don't think I understand that.

1414
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
Yeah.

1415
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,800
Like it's not a normal level of criticism

1416
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,800
that was being levied.

1417
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,800
Like it is a uniquely,

1418
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,800
it's like a uniquely bad cultural artifact.

1419
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,800
And he's,

1420
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
yeah,

1421
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
it's a little disappointing that he's just like,

1422
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,800
eh,

1423
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
eh,

1424
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
it just rolls right off me.

1425
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
Like I said,

1426
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
hey,

1427
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
I still think he had a good positive attitude

1428
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
about the whole thing.

1429
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
There's guys like just going on right now,

1430
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,800
like only plays have made a few like Linkara jokes.

1431
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
And someone like asked Linkara

1432
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:39,800
what he thought about it.

1433
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,800
He's like, I don't like it.

1434
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,800
I don't think it's funny.

1435
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,800
They make their people are calling me the light bringer

1436
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:43,800
and I don't like it.

1437
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
But that's,

1438
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:45,800
but that is funny.

1439
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
I know it is funny.

1440
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
It is funny when people call you the light bringer.

1441
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
It is funny.

1442
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
I mean,

1443
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
I don't know.

1444
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
Which not funny to him.

1445
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Again,

1446
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
I don't,

1447
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
just lean into it.

1448
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Yeah.

1449
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
You literally have to lean into it when that's the case.

1450
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Like you should literally just be grateful

1451
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,800
that people still care who he is after 10 plus years.

1452
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,800
You know what I mean?

1453
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
This is,

1454
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
this is what I said.

1455
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Oh,

1456
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
absolutely.

1457
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Like this is what I said.

1458
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
I,

1459
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,800
I saw,

1460
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,800
I saw Nate the other day.

1461
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
He just like happened to be in town

1462
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,800
and like I hung out with him for a day

1463
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,800
and we were talking about the PCP stuff

1464
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,800
and the,

1465
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
and the rad con stuff.

1466
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,800
And I told him like, you know,

1467
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,800
yeah,

1468
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,800
the rad con stuff,

1469
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,800
it's a year late and like the PCP has like,

1470
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
you know,

1471
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
I wouldn't,

1472
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
I mean imploded is a strong word,

1473
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,800
but you know what I mean?

1474
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Like it's all,

1475
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,800
the whole landscape has changed

1476
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
and it's really awkward to now just be like,

1477
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
well,

1478
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,800
here's these videos of a totally different PCP

1479
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
from a completely bygone era.

1480
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,800
And I'm just like,

1481
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
I think that's funny.

1482
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,800
It's just,

1483
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
just lean into it.

1484
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
Like,

1485
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,800
yeah,

1486
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,800
like here it is.

1487
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,800
It's changed in just what,

1488
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,800
18 months or whatever.

1489
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,800
Yeah.

1490
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,800
Yeah.

1491
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,800
Yeah.

1492
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
I mean,

1493
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,800
it was funny seeing the reactions to the music video

1494
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,800
when I would,

1495
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,800
you mean the,

1496
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,800
not the music,

1497
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,800
the rap,

1498
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,800
the rap,

1499
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
the rad lecture.

1500
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,800
Yeah.

1501
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,800
Cause like,

1502
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,800
that one in particular was like,

1503
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,800
that one was heavily steeped in PCP lore.

1504
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,800
You know what I mean?

1505
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,800
Like that one was,

1506
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
yeah,

1507
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
the OVA will be even more.

1508
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,800
It's even more.

1509
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
Oh my God.

1510
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,800
It's going to be that times 10.

1511
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
The OVA,

1512
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
age,

1513
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
like,

1514
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,800
people are going to be like,

1515
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,800
people don't even remember Brad Garlinghouse at this point.

1516
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,800
No,

1517
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,800
it was,

1518
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
it was a,

1519
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,800
the saga is over.

1520
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,800
The Brad Garlinghouse saga was over when Radcon happened.

1521
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,800
It had already been solved.

1522
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
It was only like,

1523
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
while the,

1524
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,800
the,

1525
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,800
the campaign was going,

1526
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,800
that like,

1527
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,800
it was a thing.

1528
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,800
The OVA is going to be like,

1529
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,800
it's going to be like,

1530
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
like a,

1531
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,800
a time capsule that you bury in the past and open the future.

1532
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,800
And they're like,

1533
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Oh, remember that?

1534
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,800
Except it was just late.

1535
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
Only,

1536
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,800
only you had to put $31,000 into it.

1537
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,800
And the time capsule is a hard drive.

1538
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
All the footage is on.

1539
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
It was,

1540
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
it was like,

1541
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,800
it's like a gotcha game that you,

1542
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
yeah,

1543
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,800
you put $31,000 in and then a year and a half later,

1544
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,800
you get some,

1545
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
some videos out.

1546
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,800
I can't wait to roll for the PCP dojin.

1547
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,800
Oh, I got the OVA instead.

1548
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,800
This is my favorite gotcha game.

1549
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,800
Just got to keep rolling.

1550
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,800
You just got to keep putting those PC pennies into the machine.

1551
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
That's,

1552
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
that's,

1553
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
that's why you don't release it at all.

1554
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,800
So even now that it's like post-apocalypse arc or whatever,

1555
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
you can still tell people,

1556
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
we still have nuggets of the pre-PCP,

1557
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,800
the,

1558
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,800
the good days.

1559
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,800
We're like the brother gotcha game was on,

1560
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,800
was on the,

1561
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,800
the PCP discord channel.

1562
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,800
It's like,

1563
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,800
I'm going to fucking roll for,

1564
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
for another lecture.

1565
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,800
Ah,

1566
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,800
branches of yig video again today.

1567
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,800
Oh yeah.

1568
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,800
The,

1569
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,800
the bot was only uploading branches of yig videos for some

1570
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,800
reason.

1571
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,800
I don't know who,

1572
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
I don't even know who made the bot.

1573
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,800
Yeah.

1574
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,800
I was trying to look into it.

1575
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,800
I have no idea how to edit it.

1576
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,800
Yeah.

1577
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,800
I think I know.

1578
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Appropriate.

1579
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
But yeah.

1580
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
It's confused.

1581
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,800
So I just,

1582
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,800
An ancient long since gun PCP fan.

1583
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,800
Hmm.

1584
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
And I saw it was,

1585
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
the,

1586
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,800
the bot was going,

1587
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
the bot was going crazy as a,

1588
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,800
as,

1589
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,800
as Trixie was surreptitiously,

1590
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,800
uh,

1591
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,800
like re-uploading stuff from the main channel to the side

1592
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
channel.

1593
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
And I like,

1594
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
I see the feed and I'm like,

1595
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,800
these are all,

1596
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,800
I don't,

1597
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I don't need this.

1598
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,800
Just get rid of this fucking channel.

1599
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,800
We don't need,

1600
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,800
we don't need to fucking see this bullshit.

1601
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
Uh,

1602
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
and that's what I did.

1603
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,800
Uh,

1604
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,800
the,

1605
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,800
anyway.

1606
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,800
We don't even need a bot.

1607
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,800
We didn't even make videos anymore.

1608
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,800
I actually,

1609
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,800
Yeah.

1610
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
I have a,

1611
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
uh,

1612
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
a couple of,

1613
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,800
of gamers at Tavern exclusive Trixie stories.

1614
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,800
Uh,

1615
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,800
What?

1616
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Oh,

1617
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,800
what?

1618
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,800
What's this?

1619
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,800
Like, um,

1620
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,800
How,

1621
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,800
how is this possible?

1622
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,800
Uh,

1623
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,800
last,

1624
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,800
last year when,

1625
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
uh,

1626
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
I came on and,

1627
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,800
uh,

1628
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
it looked like at first,

1629
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
uh,

1630
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,800
it was just going to be me and you recording me and you, Ben.

1631
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,800
And then,

1632
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,800
uh,

1633
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,800
we were having a conversation about something

1634
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,800
while we were waiting for people.

1635
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,800
And,

1636
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
uh,

1637
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,800
I think I mentioned something about,

1638
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,800
uh,

1639
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,800
you were having a bunch of guests on and I was,

1640
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,800
uh,

1641
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,800
I made the point that

1642
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,800
it's going to be pretty difficult for you to keep that streak up that you had at the time.

1643
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
You had a,

1644
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,800
this streak of like,

1645
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
bunch of guests.

1646
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,800
Yeah.

1647
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
Yeah.

1648
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Maybe that was around the time

1649
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,800
that the Frog Fractions guy

1650
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,800
that lady who was running for sheriff were on

1651
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,800
or something like that.

1652
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Yeah, but anyways,

1653
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
uh,

1654
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Trixie came in,

1655
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
uh,

1656
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,800
during that conversation.

1657
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
She was on that episode,

1658
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
uh,

1659
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,800
that we did.

1660
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,800
Uh,

1661
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
and,

1662
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,800
uh,

1663
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,800
she said something kind of funny

1664
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
that I just wanted to bring up,

1665
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,800
uh,

1666
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,800
because of new information that,

1667
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,800
uh,

1668
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,800
I have now.

1669
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
She said,

1670
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,800
um,

1671
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,800
I was saying you can't just keep having new guests forever.

1672
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
You're going to run out of guests eventually.

1673
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,800
And she says,

1674
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,800
well,

1675
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,800
I know,

1676
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,800
uh,

1677
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,800
the guy who books guests for the dick show.

1678
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,800
And,

1679
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
uh,

1680
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,800
so,

1681
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
you know,

1682
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,800
he's pretty good at booking guests.

1683
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
We can,

1684
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,800
we can,

1685
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
that's a big money connection.

1686
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,800
That's what we call a big money connection.

1687
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
So,

1688
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,800
at the time,

1689
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,800
I didn't know who she was talking about.

1690
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
Uh,

1691
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,800
so I would just like,

1692
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:23,800
I would just like,

1693
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
okay,

1694
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
I guess,

1695
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
but,

1696
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,800
you know,

1697
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,800
thinking back on that now

1698
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
with everything that I know now,

1699
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,800
I'm pretty sure she,

1700
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,800
she met Riley.

1701
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
Yeah,

1702
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,800
she,

1703
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,800
that's,

1704
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,800
that's pretty,

1705
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
I think that's retroactively pretty funny now.

1706
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,800
I think,

1707
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,800
I think so.

1708
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,800
Uh,

1709
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,800
hmm,

1710
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,800
uh,

1711
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,800
uh,

1712
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
I don't like her at all.

1713
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
I think she's bad.

1714
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,800
I think,

1715
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,800
I think people should stop supporting her on Patreon.com.

1716
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,800
Uh,

1717
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,800
that's what my opinion.

1718
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Before,

1719
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,800
uh,

1720
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:00,800
it was actually before this episode that we recorded,

1721
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
but I,

1722
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
um,

1723
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,800
this is kind of embarrassing,

1724
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,800
I guess,

1725
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,800
but I actually paid for a couple of Trixie Rants

1726
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,800
and she never,

1727
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,800
you know,

1728
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,800
back when she was-

1729
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
No!

1730
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,800
Digi Bro,

1731
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,800
she never did them.

1732
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,800
You're kidding.

1733
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,800
You paid for a couple?

1734
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,800
Yeah,

1735
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
I paid,

1736
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,800
I think,

1737
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:19,800
for two.

1738
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,800
Neither of them happened.

1739
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,800
No Rants.

1740
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,800
That face went,

1741
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,800
no Rants.

1742
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,800
Brutal,

1743
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
I thought at least for sure,

1744
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
I just sat down and like,

1745
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,800
cranked out all the rest of them at once or something,

1746
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,800
but you know,

1747
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,800
it is what it is.

1748
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,800
I thought that happened as well.

1749
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,800
I thought I remembered that happening,

1750
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,800
yeah,

1751
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,800
but,

1752
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,800
hmm,

1753
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,800
I heard,

1754
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,800
I'll get it right after the,

1755
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,800
the Brony lecture goes up,

1756
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,800
don't worry.

1757
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Yeah, of course.

1758
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,800
She's got to release that Brony lecture.

1759
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,800
It's the way to kickstart the Branches of Yig Channel.

1760
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,800
It's the only way.

1761
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,800
She's getting double digit views.

1762
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
She needs,

1763
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,800
she needs a shot in the arm.

1764
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,800
It needs,

1765
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,800
wait,

1766
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,800
I forgot,

1767
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,800
she's an anti-vaxxer,

1768
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,800
so that's a bad metaphor.

1769
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,800
So,

1770
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
I can't say that,

1771
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,800
never mind,

1772
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,800
never mind.

1773
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,800
It's okay.

1774
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,800
I have no hard feelings over it,

1775
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
because I don't,

1776
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,800
I honestly don't really care,

1777
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
but I have the right to,

1778
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
to be angry.

1779
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
I'm just going,

1780
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
choosing not to exercise that right.

1781
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
Hmm.

1782
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,800
That's

1783
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,800
big of you.

1784
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,800
Fringe.

1785
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
Yeah.

1786
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,800
You know,

1787
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,800
you know me,

1788
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,800
you know I would never

1789
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,800
pass up an opportunity

1790
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,800
to get mad about something

1791
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:25,800
on Twitter.com.

1792
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,800
I can't think of any

1793
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,800
reason.

1794
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,800
I mean,

1795
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,800
getting mad,

1796
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,800
that's content.

1797
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,800
That's good content.

1798
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,800
That's good content, baby.

1799
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,800
That's a good point.

1800
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Now, that's what I call calm.

1801
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
I'm feeling an emotion.

1802
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,800
Turn on the camera.

1803
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,800
Oh, my God,

1804
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,800
I'm having a feeling.

1805
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
It must record.

1806
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,800
It must,

1807
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,800
must monetize.

1808
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,800
I made

1809
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,800
a content

1810
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,800
that's good content.

1811
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
That's good content, baby.

1812
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,800
That's a good point.

1813
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Now, that's what I call calm.

1814
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,800
Oh, I'm feeling an emotion.

1815
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,800
Turn on the camera.

1816
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,800
Turn on the camera.

1817
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,800
I made a comment.

1818
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
I made a YouTube comment.

1819
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,800
If you can believe it.

1820
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,800
I made it.

1821
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
I made a comment on.

1822
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,800
This sounds bad already.

1823
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Yeah.

1824
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,800
Well,

1825
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,800
it's kind of funny.

1826
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,800
I think,

1827
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,800
I think this is W.

1828
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,800
I think I'm going to call this W.

1829
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,800
I made a comment on,

1830
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
it's some other Chris Chan

1831
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,800
YouTuber.

1832
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
This guy's name is Dylan Thomas

1833
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,800
and he's one of these weirdos who just

1834
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,800
for years,

1835
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,800
he just uploads like weekly, like

1836
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
Chris Chan said something stupid

1837
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,800
on Twitter.

1838
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Chris Chan thinks cartoons are real.

1839
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,800
It's like this.

1840
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,800
This is the level that he's at.

1841
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,800
And he put out a video.

1842
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,800
Like,

1843
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,800
should we respect Chris's pronouns?

1844
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Short answer,

1845
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,800
his answer is no.

1846
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,800
And he gives all the usual,

1847
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,800
like,

1848
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,800
non-reasons that don't make any sense

1849
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
for why he shouldn't.

1850
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,800
So I just made one comment on the video.

1851
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,800
That's like,

1852
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,800
you know,

1853
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,800
pretty pathetic.

1854
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:50,800
You know,

1855
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,800
not a lot of intellectual rigor on display.

1856
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
Embarrassing.

1857
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,800
You know,

1858
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,800
you're irrational.

1859
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,800
And I'm looking today and there's a whole,

1860
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,800
like,

1861
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,800
40 reply thread.

1862
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
That's a win.

1863
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
40 replies.

1864
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,800
They're all like,

1865
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
oh,

1866
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
you're stupid.

1867
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,800
You're thinking too hard about it.

1868
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
You don't,

1869
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,800
no,

1870
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,800
you're stupid.

1871
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,800
No,

1872
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,800
you're a stupid one.

1873
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,800
Seeing the amount of people to actually

1874
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,800
unironically take that stance.

1875
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,800
It's really fucking bizarre to me because

1876
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,800
you can literally make the exact same argument.

1877
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:18,800
Well,

1878
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,800
you know,

1879
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,800
I don't like using the n-word,

1880
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,800
but I don't respect this black person.

1881
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,800
Therefore,

1882
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,800
I guess I should be allowed to use it, right?

1883
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,800
I guess they should be racist.

1884
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,800
Oh,

1885
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,800
this imperative to be racist.

1886
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,800
This black guy did a crime and you still,

1887
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,800
you still don't think we should call him the n-word?

1888
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
Not wanting to get called the n-word.

1889
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
Like, bruh,

1890
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,800
why are you defending his crime?

1891
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,800
It is like the exact same,

1892
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,800
like,

1893
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
line of thought and there's no substantial difference

1894
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,800
between the two in my opinion.

1895
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,800
Like,

1896
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
if you think one,

1897
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
you necessarily should think the other.

1898
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,800
You literally must think the other.

1899
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,800
It's,

1900
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,800
it's,

1901
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,800
I mean,

1902
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,800
it's embarrassing and this is,

1903
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,800
this is a,

1904
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
this is,

1905
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
I mean,

1906
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,800
this is the sad truth of,

1907
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,800
like,

1908
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,800
the,

1909
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,800
the Chris,

1910
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,800
the Chris-Chan community,

1911
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,800
if you want to call it that,

1912
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,800
like, the Chris-Chan fandom.

1913
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,800
Like,

1914
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,800
the devoted Chris-Chan fandom are all,

1915
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,800
they're all idiots.

1916
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,800
They're all Kiwi farmers.

1917
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,800
They're all,

1918
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,800
like,

1919
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,800
weirdos

1920
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
who are

1921
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,800
embarrassing.

1922
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,800
It's the,

1923
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,800
the sad truth is that,

1924
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,800
like, this is the audience that,

1925
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,800
like,

1926
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,800
I mean,

1927
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,800
that's not the,

1928
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,800
like,

1929
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:19,800
the main audience that's like,

1930
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,800
watch,

1931
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
for instance,

1932
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,800
my lecture.

1933
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,800
Like,

1934
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,800
I'm sure most people that watch the lecture are not,

1935
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,800
like this,

1936
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,800
but like,

1937
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
some people were giving you the debt,

1938
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,800
the debt,

1939
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,800
releasing the lecture,

1940
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,800
and they're like,

1941
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,800
oh,

1942
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,800
Ben was,

1943
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,800
you know,

1944
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,800
trying to capitalize on this.

1945
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
But I mean,

1946
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,800
I feel like there's a difference.

1947
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:37,800
There's a big difference between releasing a lecture,

1948
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
which was recorded

1949
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
over a year prior,

1950
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,800
versus making,

1951
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,800
like,

1952
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
daily.

1953
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
I was going to say,

1954
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,800
I was going to say weekly,

1955
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,800
but literally,

1956
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,800
lately,

1957
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
they're exploding,

1958
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
I see them all over the place,

1959
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,800
but it's,

1960
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,800
it's crazy to me that a few people,

1961
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,800
like,

1962
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,800
like,

1963
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,800
G.B.

1964
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,800
and Dylan Thomas,

1965
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,800
and,

1966
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,800
and,

1967
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:58,800
like,

1968
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
one or,

1969
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,800
and a base shaman,

1970
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,800
and like,

1971
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:02,800
a few others,

1972
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,800
their channels are just,

1973
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,800
like,

1974
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,800
like,

1975
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,800
how much is there to even talk about?

1976
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Like,

1977
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:08,800
like,

1978
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,800
Chris says the same,

1979
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,800
like,

1980
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,800
insane fucking merge shit

1981
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:12,800
on Twitter all the time.

1982
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,800
How many times can you just like,

1983
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,800
how wrong it is,

1984
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,800
and how the,

1985
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,800
there's no such thing as,

1986
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,800
cartoons.

1987
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,800
Guys,

1988
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
you might have heard of this thing

1989
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,800
called the Dimensional Merge.

1990
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,800
Let me tell you why it's not real.

1991
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,800
Let me break down

1992
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:24,800
where the Dimensional Merge is not real,

1993
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
with a 48 point list.

1994
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,800
I can prove,

1995
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
I can prove it,

1996
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:29,800
actually,

1997
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,800
and here's why.

1998
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,800
Debunking the Dimensional Merge

1999
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,800
with facts and logic.

2000
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
It's like,

2001
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,800
as I heard some shit

2002
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,800
about the Dimensions Merging,

2003
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,800
and I'm scared,

2004
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
and I need someone to tell me,

2005
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,800
it's all going to be okay.

2006
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,800
Chris says that if I don't respect my OCs,

2007
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
they're going to fucking kill me

2008
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,800
when the merge happens.

2009
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,800
There's a lot of content

2010
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,800
that can be derived from Twitter feed.

2011
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,800
Remember,

2012
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
when Trump still had his Twitter,

2013
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
and the mainstream media was just like

2014
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,800
24-7 broadcasting all his tweets?

2015
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:56,800
Yeah.

2016
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,800
And there will always be like,

2017
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,800
look how ridiculous this tweet is.

2018
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,800
It's horrible.

2019
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,800
Let's spend an entire segment

2020
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,800
explaining why that is.

2021
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,800
The amount of free advertising

2022
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,800
that Trump got was unfathomable.

2023
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,800
It's truly insane,

2024
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,800
both before and after getting elected.

2025
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
They were nonstop covering him.

2026
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,800
It was honestly,

2027
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,800
you have to appreciate that approach

2028
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,800
to getting elected,

2029
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,800
which is that have no qualifications.

2030
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,800
Just get on the news

2031
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,800
and have the news talk about you

2032
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,800
all the time.

2033
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,800
Yeah.

2034
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,800
Yeah, it worked.

2035
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,800
It worked.

2036
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,800
What can you say about it?

2037
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,800
It worked like a fucking dream, yeah.

2038
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,800
Can't wait for the next time it works.

2039
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,800
I'll never forget my favorite,

2040
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
my favorite Trump tweet.

2041
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Coca-Cola company.

2042
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
Not very happy with me.

2043
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
That's okay.

2044
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,800
I'll still drink that garbage.

2045
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,800
Poetry.

2046
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,800
Poetry.

2047
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,800
And he made some of that.

2048
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,800
Regardless of what you think about him.

2049
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,800
Some funny tweets.

2050
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,800
He was an eloquent Twitter user.

2051
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,800
He was a powerful poster.

2052
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:54,800
He made a lot of funny tweets.

2053
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,800
He really did.

2054
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,800
A lot of the things he would do

2055
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,800
over and over again

2056
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
are just like,

2057
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,800
popular things people do now.

2058
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,800
Like just saying an emotion

2059
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,800
in capital letters at the end.

2060
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,800
Sad.

2061
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,800
Yeah.

2062
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Dude, his way of speaking straight up.

2063
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,800
Well, first of all,

2064
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,800
I guess like half the site,

2065
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,800
all the conservatives like unironically

2066
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,800
wanted to emulate it.

2067
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,800
And then it's also funny as fuck.

2068
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,800
So a lot of people just ironically

2069
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
are doing shit like that.

2070
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,800
And then he had to change the way

2071
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,800
people spoke on Twitter.

2072
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,800
It's very effective to just like,

2073
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
just state very bluntly

2074
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,800
what you're trying to say

2075
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,800
and then say how you're supposed to

2076
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,800
feel about it and then just repeat it.

2077
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,800
Like that was a,

2078
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,800
I watched a,

2079
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,800
I think I watched a video

2080
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
that was like about,

2081
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
it was like a,

2082
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,800
the channel was about like teaching

2083
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
charisma or something.

2084
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
It was about like teaching,

2085
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,800
like how to be more persuasive

2086
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,800
or charismatic person.

2087
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
And they took like a video

2088
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,800
about Trump and it's like,

2089
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,800
how does Donald Trump speak

2090
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,800
in a way that is so compelling to people?

2091
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,800
And like one of his major tricks

2092
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
is just that he repeats himself

2093
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,800
over and over and over again.

2094
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,800
And he'll just say the same thing twice in a row.

2095
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,800
True.

2096
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,800
So you don't forget it.

2097
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,800
Yeah.

2098
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
There's a funny scene in The Simpsons

2099
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,800
where Marge is like,

2100
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
this town is a part of us all,

2101
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,800
a part of us all,

2102
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,800
a part of us all.

2103
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,800
Sorry to repeat myself,

2104
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,800
I don't know if you remember.

2105
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,800
Yeah.

2106
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,800
And that actually works.

2107
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,800
And Donald Trump literally got elected

2108
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,800
on that advice.

2109
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,800
So it works.

2110
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,800
Donald Trump watched The Simpsons.

2111
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,800
He got the idea of him running for president

2112
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,800
from that Simpsons episode.

2113
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
The Simpsons.

2114
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Yeah.

2115
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,800
People always say The Simpsons predicted it.

2116
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
Not enough people are giving Simpsons shit

2117
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,800
for causing it.

2118
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
They're the ones who cause all of this

2119
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,800
in the first place.

2120
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,800
Like he would,

2121
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,800
he would make up little nicknames

2122
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,800
for people like he would call Hillary.

2123
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800
He would call her,

2124
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,800
like Lion Hillary, right?

2125
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,800
I think that he called her like corrupt Hillary

2126
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,800
or something.

2127
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,800
Like crooked Hillary, wasn't she?

2128
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,800
Crooked Hillary.

2129
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,800
That was Lion Ted or some shit.

2130
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Right.

2131
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
He gave everyone a little nickname

2132
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,800
and that's funny because it's probably

2133
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
the only reason he could keep track of them.

2134
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,800
But it's like, you know,

2135
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
that's people love that shit.

2136
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,800
And it didn't even have to be like that.

2137
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,800
Like crooked Hillary.

2138
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
It didn't have to be clever or witty at all.

2139
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,800
It's not exactly a joke,

2140
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
but he just keeps saying it.

2141
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:51,800
He just keeps saying,

2142
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,800
yeah, crooked Hillary,

2143
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,800
yeah, crooked,

2144
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,800
and then he's thinking,

2145
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,800
you're mine.

2146
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,800
Oh yeah, crooked Hillary.

2147
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,800
And then the media,

2148
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
the news cry-ons are repeating that,

2149
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
like crooked Hillary on CNN.

2150
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,800
Yeah.

2151
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,800
And quotation marks, you know what I mean?

2152
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,800
Just say it enough.

2153
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,800
Right.

2154
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:05,800
That's why my next campaign

2155
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,800
is just going to be walking around.

2156
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,800
I'm just going to be walking around

2157
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:08,800
and publicly saying,

2158
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
I'm the president.

2159
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,800
I am the president.

2160
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,800
I'm the president.

2161
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,800
I'm just going to start walking around

2162
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
and telling people that.

2163
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,800
And eventually, I will be the president.

2164
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,800
And then literally,

2165
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,800
and then whatever people talk about,

2166
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,800
they'd be like,

2167
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,800
Cybershell, like,

2168
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:19,800
who's that?

2169
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:20,800
Like, oh, you know,

2170
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,800
that guy who always says he's the president.

2171
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:22,800
I guess he's the president.

2172
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,800
Oh yeah.

2173
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,800
Oh yeah, the president.

2174
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,800
He just seems so presidential.

2175
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,800
And then everyone's like,

2176
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:27,800
oh, you mean the president guy?

2177
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,800
Sounds like something off of it.

2178
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,800
Well, the real world is something awful.

2179
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,800
It just works.

2180
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,800
Psychology is so simple.

2181
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,800
It's the easiest thing in the world.

2182
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,800
Nothing to it.

2183
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Not much to it, yeah.

2184
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Yeah.

2185
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,800
I guess Trump is going to go down

2186
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,800
as the best, worst president in history.

2187
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
He will always be missed.

2188
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,800
Well, from this point on,

2189
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,800
there will be two histories.

2190
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,800
And one of them,

2191
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,800
people are going to say he's great.

2192
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,800
And the other one,

2193
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
people are going to say he's bad.

2194
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,800
And then luckily in the future,

2195
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,800
it'll continue to fracture out.

2196
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,800
We need to come together as a nation

2197
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,800
and reach across the aisle

2198
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,800
and agree that Trump was a legendary Twitter poster.

2199
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,800
That's the only way.

2200
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
That's true.

2201
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
It's the one thing that binds us all together.

2202
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
I honestly feel like he probably was more upset

2203
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,800
about losing his Twitter account

2204
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,800
than like almost anything else,

2205
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,800
than maybe even losing the presidency.

2206
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
I would assume that Twitter account

2207
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,800
gave him more power than the office of the president.

2208
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,800
I don't understand.

2209
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,800
I don't understand why it was like only then

2210
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,800
did they take his Twitter

2211
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
only when he lost the election.

2212
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,800
They were like, well, now we have to take it away.

2213
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,800
It was hilarious, the timing.

2214
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,800
Like he lost it.

2215
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:40,800
And then it was, I guess it was,

2216
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,800
it was right after the whole capital rate riot bullshit.

2217
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,800
So it was like, oh, we have to take it away.

2218
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Was that why?

2219
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Was it like,

2220
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,800
That was the reason I'm pretty sure they're like,

2221
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,800
he was inciting it by posting that video

2222
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
where he was like standby or whatever.

2223
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,800
I don't know.

2224
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,800
Yeah.

2225
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,800
Yeah.

2226
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,800
Yeah.

2227
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,800
We love you.

2228
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,800
You're very special.

2229
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,800
He's talking to them like fucking Barney.

2230
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
It's funny.

2231
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,800
It's so funny.

2232
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
A lot of the platforms like Twitter,

2233
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,800
they ban people based on like PR stuff,

2234
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,800
whatever makes them look best at that moment.

2235
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Right.

2236
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,800
That was absolutely PR move on Twitter's part.

2237
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,800
There was no like,

2238
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,800
any like reasoning they could have had,

2239
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,800
they could have done it way earlier,

2240
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,800
but they would have gotten so much shit from people

2241
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,800
when he was president.

2242
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,800
I mean, I would kind of respect the ballziness

2243
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,800
to just be like,

2244
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,800
we're just going to ban the standing president

2245
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,800
in the middle of his term,

2246
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,800
just because we don't like his politics.

2247
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
We just don't want him on our platform.

2248
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,800
Twitter literally wanted him there objectively

2249
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,800
because of the traffic he brought to the site.

2250
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,800
Yeah.

2251
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,800
I wonder if they didn't want to like be,

2252
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,800
I don't know,

2253
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,800
accused of like forcing,

2254
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
like silencing him.

2255
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,800
I know it's not actually censorship.

2256
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
People are already going to take that stance of like,

2257
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,800
oh, you ban all conservatives.

2258
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,800
Like you're censoring him

2259
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,800
and therefore people won't vote for him.

2260
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,800
You're basically like rigging the election.

2261
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,800
It could have backfired

2262
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,800
if they banned them at a bad time.

2263
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,800
Like you're right about that.

2264
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,800
Like people would have gotten upset.

2265
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,800
I mean, it did back.

2266
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,800
That's exactly what people said.

2267
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,800
I know.

2268
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,800
So it's weird.

2269
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,800
I just wonder why they didn't do anything

2270
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,800
up until that point.

2271
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,800
You're right, Ben.

2272
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
They literally could have just banned them

2273
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
at like in 2018.

2274
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,800
They could have done it way ages ago,

2275
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,800
but you know,

2276
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,800
like I said, his posts were too fucking funny.

2277
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,800
They really were like, you know,

2278
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,800
the presidency ones in particular,

2279
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
there's a lot of really funny ones.

2280
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,800
If we've got these fucking billionaire technocrats

2281
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
running these big tech conglomerations

2282
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,800
that literally own us all

2283
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,800
and manipulate our data

2284
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,800
and have us all in their pocket,

2285
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,800
I would at least like them.

2286
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,800
I would at least like my corporate masters

2287
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,800
to show a little bit of moral consistency,

2288
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,800
a little bit of backbone.

2289
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,800
Is it too much to ask?

2290
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
That is way too much to ask.

2291
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,800
Yes, it's far too much to ask.

2292
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,800
No, no, I see.

2293
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,800
Well, I apologize.

2294
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,800
I don't know.

2295
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Not until we do it.

2296
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,800
I was kind of bummed out when he got banned

2297
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,800
because I really liked reading his tweets.

2298
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,800
They were, you know,

2299
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
I always like when you read someone's tweets

2300
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,800
and you can easily like read it in their voice.

2301
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,800
You know what I mean?

2302
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,800
Like a tweet that sounds like

2303
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
there's a specific person talking

2304
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,800
and his tweets always like sounded like,

2305
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,800
you can easily imagine him saying it.

2306
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,800
Hmm.

2307
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
He was a great comedy.

2308
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,800
He didn't, he didn't say,

2309
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,800
say what you say what you will about the man.

2310
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,800
But he didn't post like a boomer.

2311
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,800
He just posted on a very like straight forward,

2312
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,800
like wet normal.

2313
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,800
Well, honestly, he just said what he wanted to say.

2314
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
The more I think about it, the more sad I am.

2315
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,800
We never got to see the post presidency

2316
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,800
Trump Twitter meltdown and just the subsequent

2317
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,800
daily Biden is a piece of shit.

2318
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,800
Yeah, that would have been great.

2319
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,800
I agree.

2320
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,800
I'm not sure banning him did any good

2321
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,800
for anyone really.

2322
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,800
I mean, I don't think.

2323
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Yeah, I don't think.

2324
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,800
I don't think you can really say that it stopped much harm.

2325
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,800
I mean, come on, anyone.

2326
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
No, I don't think that is.

2327
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,800
You could have made that choice.

2328
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,800
They decided to do it ages ago,

2329
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,800
but they basically waited until yeah,

2330
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,800
like you said, like right at the very end.

2331
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,800
You know what?

2332
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,800
It's just robbing us of content.

2333
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,800
It's just it's just wasted content.

2334
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,800
That's the name of this episode is wasted content.

2335
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,800
It's all about bemoaning all the things

2336
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,800
we'll never get to consume in his private life

2337
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,800
that were wasted content that we don't get to see.

2338
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,800
They weren't monetized.

2339
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Wasted content and wasted comedy.

2340
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,800
Exactly.

2341
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
I think he is.

2342
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
Money on the table.

2343
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Is he banned on YouTube?

2344
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Because when he got banned on Twitter,

2345
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,800
it was like a big, it wasn't just Twitter.

2346
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,800
He got banned off a shitload of social media apps.

2347
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,800
I think everybody banned him.

2348
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,800
Yeah.

2349
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,800
I think everybody banned him.

2350
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:33,800
Because I'm thinking that like he like.

2351
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,800
That's a shame.

2352
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,800
It really is a shame.

2353
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,800
Like I would love to watch the Donald Trump YouTube show.

2354
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,800
That would be fucking funny.

2355
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,800
I want to see the Donald Trump like

2356
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,800
Twitch stream fortnight.

2357
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
Yeah.

2358
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,800
I wanted to see Donald Trump let's play.

2359
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,800
Many of politicians have Twitch streams now,

2360
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,800
like for realsies.

2361
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,800
So it's not even all the possibilities.

2362
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,800
Didn't AOC play Among Us?

2363
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Among Us.

2364
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,800
Yeah.

2365
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
With Ilan Omar.

2366
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,800
Yeah.

2367
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,800
So funny.

2368
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,800
Yeah.

2369
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,800
It was pretty.

2370
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
I guess maybe it never materialized,

2371
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,800
but I was hearing when the election happened,

2372
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,800
I was hearing people talking about Trump was going

2373
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,800
to start like Trump TV and like start a whole

2374
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,800
like independent like media outlet.

2375
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
I thought, well, originally back in 2016,

2376
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
I thought Trump TV was the game plan.

2377
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
Like I didn't even think he really was trying to be president.

2378
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:17,800
That hard.

2379
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,800
I thought it was just get an absurd amount of press for free

2380
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
and then, you know, pivot into being a TV star.

2381
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
But this is what I read.

2382
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,800
It was like it was the plan at first,

2383
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,800
but then he became president.

2384
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,800
He's like, I guess we'll just roll with this now.

2385
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,800
I guess we'll just be president.

2386
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,800
Like, okay.

2387
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
Then I can get back to my real job of being a TV star.

2388
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,800
Making Trump TV.

2389
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,800
Yeah.

2390
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,800
I guess we'll just be president of the United States.

2391
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:38,800
I heard about Trump TV,

2392
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
but I haven't heard anything about it since.

2393
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
I first heard about it.

2394
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,800
Yeah.

2395
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,800
I feel like I haven't.

2396
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
I'm surprised he's been.

2397
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,800
I don't want to say he's been like quiet since leaving office,

2398
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,800
but like there's been a few like press statements by him or whatever,

2399
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
which are hilarious because they really like tweets.

2400
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,800
Press statements.

2401
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,800
And I keep seeing people say that someone basically just made

2402
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,800
like a new Twitter,

2403
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:01,800
like specifically just so that he could be on.

2404
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,800
I don't know what that is.

2405
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
I don't think it's Parler.

2406
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,800
Doesn't he just have a website?

2407
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,800
He just has a website where he like makes blog posts about how

2408
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,800
he just makes what are essentially tweets.

2409
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
I think he has like it's an email list,

2410
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,800
which is like probably the same.

2411
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,800
He's going to old school.

2412
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
Right.

2413
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,800
I think I think that's the current grift is just have an email list with

2414
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,800
literally like 50 million emails on it and send out like weekly begging

2415
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,800
for money.

2416
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,800
Because that's nobody outside.

2417
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,800
That really takes me back.

2418
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,800
Your fucking circle is going to see it.

2419
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,800
Those mailing lists take me back to like 2002 or 2003.

2420
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,800
That was like the first way to keep in touch with people on the web

2421
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,800
was like getting in that web ring or whatever.

2422
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,800
That's still a very effective method of marketing.

2423
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,800
Yeah.

2424
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,800
People still value that.

2425
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,800
You know what I mean?

2426
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
Yeah.

2427
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
Marketers are right.

2428
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,800
I always get people on your email list.

2429
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Yeah.

2430
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
I feel like it went out of fashion for a while,

2431
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,800
but then like two years ago or so,

2432
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,800
there was a kick of people being like,

2433
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,800
you know what,

2434
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,800
you know,

2435
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,800
social media is bad and it's owned by big Corpo and like it's more,

2436
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,800
it's kind of more effective.

2437
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
Yeah.

2438
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
Just an old school.

2439
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Join my mailing list.

2440
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,800
Join my mailing list because my Twitter could get banned

2441
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,800
for any reason at any time, right?

2442
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Well,

2443
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,800
I love that part of being on the modern web is,

2444
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:13,800
which is that, you know,

2445
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,800
oh, I have a YouTube channel,

2446
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,800
which is I make money.

2447
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,800
I could just get banned at any time for any reason

2448
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,800
that I would have no recourse.

2449
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
It could just get hacked by some,

2450
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:22,800
the only thing you can do,

2451
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,800
for instance,

2452
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:24,800
Brad Garley knows.

2453
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,800
Imagine if that happened.

2454
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,800
How embarrassed.

2455
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,800
So that's why it's good to diversify,

2456
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:29,800
have a Twitter,

2457
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,800
have a Twitter,

2458
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,800
even if you don't like Twitter,

2459
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,800
it's not bad to have one just,

2460
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,800
you know,

2461
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,800
as like a backup type situation.

2462
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,800
You got to diversify across different sites nowadays.

2463
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,800
Yeah.

2464
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,800
Just like investing in crypto or stocks,

2465
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,800
diversify your portfolio.

2466
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,800
Yeah.

2467
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,800
If you're a coward,

2468
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,800
you just put everything into one stock

2469
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,800
and then wait for it to pump

2470
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,800
and then take it off.

2471
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,800
I have a shameful,

2472
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,800
I have a shameful confession to make.

2473
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,800
You being a crypto boy again.

2474
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:53,800
I bought some,

2475
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,800
I bought some Bitcoin.

2476
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,800
Why would you buy it now?

2477
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,800
It's going up.

2478
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,800
It's going up.

2479
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,800
It's going up.

2480
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,800
I don't have anything bad.

2481
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,800
It's going up.

2482
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,800
It's going up.

2483
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,800
We're never going to get

2484
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,800
another cheap video card again.

2485
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,800
It was going up.

2486
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,800
That's like a thing of the past.

2487
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,800
People in like 60 years

2488
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,800
are going to be laughing like,

2489
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,800
oh my, people used to be able

2490
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,800
to buy video cards?

2491
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,800
What?

2492
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,800
You have not looked.

2493
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,800
You have not looked.

2494
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,800
No, it has,

2495
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,800
it fell in a big way.

2496
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
No, no, no.

2497
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,800
It's been going up for like a month

2498
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,800
or almost a month.

2499
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,800
I've had like a bit of Ethereum

2500
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,800
and a bit of Bitcoin for a while

2501
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,800
and it was really low for a while.

2502
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
And now it has been going up

2503
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,800
but it's really slowed down.

2504
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,800
I've just sold mine.

2505
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,800
I feel like it's going to go back down again.

2506
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,800
I mean, I don't know.

2507
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,800
Maybe.

2508
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,800
If you notice it's going up,

2509
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
you've already missed the window.

2510
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,800
That's not,

2511
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,800
that's not true.

2512
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
That's not true.

2513
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,800
I mean,

2514
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,800
maybe next week when Ben's

2515
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,800
complaining about crypto prices

2516
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,800
dropping and getting mad again,

2517
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,800
maybe I'm just saying people

2518
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,800
earlier in the year were predicting

2519
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,800
like Bitcoin hitting 100K.

2520
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,800
Everybody says that has a vested

2521
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
interest in Bitcoin hitting.

2522
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,800
And that's what I thought too.

2523
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:02,800
But then I thought,

2524
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
then I thought like it fell off a cliff

2525
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,800
after the big pump.

2526
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,800
And I was like,

2527
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:07,800
okay, it's down.

2528
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,800
But it's when you buy,

2529
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,800
if you actually want to get back in on this.

2530
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,800
But it started steadily.

2531
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,800
It started steadily.

2532
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,800
It's like almost halfway back up

2533
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,800
to where it was.

2534
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,800
And I'm like,

2535
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
I feel like there's a real possibility

2536
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,800
that it goes even higher

2537
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,800
than it did the first time.

2538
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:21,800
And I'm like, well,

2539
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:22,800
if it does that,

2540
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,800
it would be ashamed if I miss out.

2541
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,800
So I fucking was like,

2542
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,800
okay, fuck it.

2543
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,800
I'll gamble it.

2544
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,800
I'll just buy a little bit of Bitcoin.

2545
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,800
Just in case.

2546
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
I don't know.

2547
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,800
I don't think it's that stupid.

2548
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,800
I feel like I'm watching it every day.

2549
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,800
If you buy when it's like 50%.

2550
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
Cool.

2551
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,800
It's going up.

2552
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,800
But I want to not make the mistake

2553
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,800
I made before

2554
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,800
and not sell at the peak.

2555
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,800
I've sold and I've made a profit.

2556
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,800
And I'm hesitant to like jump back in

2557
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,800
because it does look like

2558
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,800
the curve upwards is like flattening out

2559
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,800
right now.

2560
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,800
Like it's slowing down a lot more

2561
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,800
than it was.

2562
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,800
But I don't know.

2563
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,800
By the time you,

2564
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,800
the viewer are listening to this,

2565
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,800
it's definitely too late for you.

2566
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Don't even fucking think about buying anything.

2567
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
Yeah, that's true.

2568
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,800
Look at, no, no.

2569
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,800
Look, I mean,

2570
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,800
look how it's,

2571
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,800
we got a fucking show.

2572
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,800
Look at this curve.

2573
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,800
Guys, if you want to get rich,

2574
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,800
just buy some Ripple XRP.

2575
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:16,800
That's my advice.

2576
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,800
Let's just all invest in Ripple.

2577
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,800
This curve,

2578
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,800
this pattern looks to me

2579
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,800
and obviously I don't know,

2580
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,800
but it looks to me there

2581
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,800
like it is like starting a bullish trend.

2582
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,800
Right.

2583
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,800
And that line is like a month long.

2584
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,800
It's been,

2585
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,800
it's been,

2586
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
I don't know.

2587
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
Well, how much Bitcoin do you have?

2588
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,800
I have like,

2589
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,800
it's not,

2590
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,800
not as much as I had before.

2591
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,800
I just,

2592
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,800
I don't want to say,

2593
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,800
I don't want to give numbers,

2594
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,800
but I have,

2595
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
I mean a fraction of a Bitcoin,

2596
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,800
like a small fraction of a Bitcoin.

2597
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,800
Cause like,

2598
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800
let's say it goes all the way back up

2599
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,800
to like 56 or 47, right?

2600
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,800
That's like a 20% increase.

2601
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
If you bought like $500

2602
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:57,800
in Bitcoin,

2603
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,800
a 20% increase is only like a hundred more dollars.

2604
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,800
It's not going to be significant.

2605
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,800
So I'll make a hundred dollars.

2606
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,800
Yeah.

2607
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,800
That's what I'm hoping to make a hundred dollars.

2608
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,800
I guess.

2609
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:10,800
What are you saying?

2610
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,800
You're,

2611
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,800
I don't understand.

2612
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,800
You're like,

2613
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,800
but Ben,

2614
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,800
sure if it goes up,

2615
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,800
you'll make money.

2616
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,800
But if it goes down,

2617
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:18,800
you'll lose money.

2618
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,800
I know.

2619
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:20,800
I'm saying the time to buy

2620
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:21,800
was when it was like

2621
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:22,800
way lower.

2622
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,800
So you could have bought

2623
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:24,800
$500 then.

2624
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,800
This is so foolish.

2625
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,800
You could have already opened up

2626
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,800
so much more money.

2627
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,800
We will see.

2628
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,800
Yes.

2629
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:30,800
Obviously.

2630
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Ben has bought his.

2631
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,800
So we'll see what he wins.

2632
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,800
Obviously it would have been better.

2633
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,800
Obviously it would have been better to buy

2634
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,800
when it was even lower.

2635
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,800
But if it goes up from here,

2636
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,800
it's still good to buy now.

2637
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,800
Sure.

2638
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,800
My bigger complaint

2639
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,800
is that we've been down this road

2640
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:44,800
like four times

2641
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,800
and explained this to you four times

2642
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,800
and you keep buying at the same time

2643
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,800
instead of revising your strategy.

2644
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,800
I don't think that's true.

2645
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,800
I don't really feel like that's true,

2646
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,800
actually.

2647
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,800
I do promise that I won't make it

2648
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,800
a big fucking thing.

2649
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,800
This won't be the crypto cast again.

2650
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,800
I can't believe that.

2651
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,800
Okay.

2652
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,800
Well.

2653
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,800
I'm afraid we can't trust your assurances,

2654
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,800
Ben.

2655
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,800
Here's the thing.

2656
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,800
If Ben loses money,

2657
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,800
if Ben loses money,

2658
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,800
it'll be like half a crypto cast.

2659
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,800
If Ben gains a lot of money,

2660
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,800
we're not going to hear the end of it.

2661
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,800
He's going to rub it in my face.

2662
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,800
He's going to rub it in our faces.

2663
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:24,800
Everyone in chat.

2664
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,800
No, that's a good point.

2665
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,800
YouTube comments.

2666
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,800
Be praying and emojis

2667
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,800
for Ben to be losing money.

2668
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:33,800
I think if I make a huge profits on crypto,

2669
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,800
I think I'll be embarrassed

2670
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,800
and I won't want to talk about it.

2671
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,800
Oh, well, if it isn't the capitalist Ben St,

2672
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
who loves cryptocurrency

2673
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
and all sorts of other currencies.

2674
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,800
See, this is why.

2675
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,800
I'm feeling the shame.

2676
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:46,800
I'm going to use all those profits

2677
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,800
to buy carbon credits

2678
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,800
to offset all the damage

2679
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,800
you're doing to the environment.

2680
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,800
Ben St.

2681
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:52,800
Oh, fuck.

2682
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,800
Yeah, for our socialists,

2683
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,800
you should enjoy capital.

2684
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,800
You sure do enjoy having money, you hypocrite.

2685
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,800
Yet you choose to participate

2686
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,800
in this society of ours.

2687
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,800
Why aren't you living in a commune

2688
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,800
waiting for the second coming of Christ?

2689
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,800
Like a good fucking commie.

2690
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,800
God, I wish.

2691
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,800
God, I wish.

2692
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,800
Jesus, love him.

2693
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,800
Now, there was some...

2694
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:18,800
the crucifixion of Christ?

2695
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,800
Now, there was some fucking content.

2696
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,800
They really milked the shit out of that one.

2697
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
They're still talking about it.

2698
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,800
That was...

2699
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,800
I mean, that was not wasted content.

2700
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:28,800
That one was...

2701
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,800
Yeah, that one was milked.

2702
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,800
That one was heavily monetized.

2703
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,800
They started a Twitch stream

2704
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,800
that you might have heard of.

2705
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,800
It's called the Roman Catholic Church.

2706
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,800
It's still good.

2707
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,800
They have so many subs.

2708
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
They get doughnose every fucking Sunday.

2709
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,800
I would love to see a video that says...

2710
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:45,800
They only stream once a week

2711
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
and somehow they still make a fuck ton of money.

2712
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,800
It's great.

2713
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,800
I would love to see an apology video

2714
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:54,800
from Judas Iscariot.

2715
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,800
He's just sitting there like,

2716
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,800
guys, I feel so shitty

2717
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
about what I did to Jesus.

2718
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,800
My apology.

2719
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,800
Judas Iscariot makes an apology video.

2720
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,800
It's like, I'm sorry.

2721
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,800
I'm sorry I gave Jesus to the Romans.

2722
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
It's like, oh, he monetized the video.

2723
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,800
He left ads on the video.

2724
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,800
Judas Iscariot.

2725
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,800
Ratted him out

2726
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,800
to fucking Twitch staff

2727
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
and then he got fucking banned for three days.

2728
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,800
But then he came back

2729
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
and was even bigger than before.

2730
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,800
He made partner.

2731
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,800
He made partner as a result.

2732
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,800
You know, I know it was a joke,

2733
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,800
but actual churches do have Twitch channels

2734
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,800
and they do stream their services.

2735
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,800
I've seen it before.

2736
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,800
Yeah, I've seen that.

2737
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,800
Do they get doughnose from Twitch chat?

2738
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:40,800
I think they do.

2739
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,800
They don't know as the substitute

2740
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,800
for the passing the thing around.

2741
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,800
How fucking great would it be

2742
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:47,800
if the priest did get up

2743
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,800
on the pulpit or whatever

2744
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,800
and just be like,

2745
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,800
all right, I've got to read up my doughnose

2746
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,800
for the stream before we move on

2747
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,800
with the actual mask.

2748
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:56,800
He gives live shout-outs.

2749
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,800
Interrupting the server

2750
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,800
and just go, oh, Pog.

2751
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:00,800
Omega Pog.

2752
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,800
Check out that doughnose.

2753
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,800
That's basically the reality we live in right now.

2754
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,800
Subscribe at tier three.

2755
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,800
You get an annulment.

2756
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,800
It's like when you put a 20

2757
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,800
into the collection plate,

2758
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,800
it's like a soundboard

2759
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,800
starts like air horn,

2760
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,800
like...

2761
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,800
lights light up behind him

2762
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,800
on the pulpit or whatever.

2763
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,800
Confetti is released.

2764
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Like the same confetti for weddings.

2765
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,800
Church needs to start a vtuber of Jesus.

2766
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,800
They've got to get their new image up there.

2767
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,800
Dude, I would love to see a hot tub stream,

2768
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,800
but it's all holy water

2769
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,800
and they're just like,

2770
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,800
you pay money to get your name written

2771
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,800
on one of those little crackers.

2772
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,800
A hot tub stream,

2773
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,800
but it's like baptisms.

2774
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
Yeah, baptizing people and shit.

2775
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,800
There was a church near my house

2776
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:52,800
where they had a big tank.

2777
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,800
They had a big water tank,

2778
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,800
and I guess the priest would bless the tank.

2779
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,800
And they had a dispenser.

2780
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,800
You could go up

2781
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,800
and you could rinse your hands

2782
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,800
on this little spout

2783
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,800
out of this little plastic tank.

2784
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,800
You could just dispense some holy water

2785
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,800
into your hands, I guess,

2786
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,800
if you wanted some.

2787
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,800
The tank was there.

2788
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,800
People have containers of holy water

2789
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,800
they use for stuff around their house.

2790
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,800
That was like a refill.

2791
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,800
Yeah, I had...

2792
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,800
What do you do with it?

2793
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,800
I'm not sure.

2794
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:22,800
What does he do to it

2795
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,800
to make it holy water?

2796
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,800
That's what I don't know.

2797
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,800
Does he piss in it?

2798
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,800
Do you spit in it?

2799
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,800
I thought it was so cool.

2800
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,800
I had a fancy,

2801
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,800
like an old glass perfume bottle,

2802
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,800
and I went and I filled it up with it.

2803
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,800
I was like, oh my God,

2804
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,800
I have this fancy red,

2805
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,800
this like red stained glass bottle.

2806
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,800
It's full of sacred water.

2807
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,800
It's so fucking holy.

2808
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,800
It's so ready to fight a vampire.

2809
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,800
Exactly.

2810
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,800
Yeah, exactly.

2811
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,800
You use it on vampires and zombies.

2812
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,800
That's what Castlevania taught me.

2813
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,800
That's why they put it out.

2814
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,800
It's like for a home,

2815
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
it's for a defense.

2816
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,800
It's important to have a lot of compartments in your house

2817
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,800
with holy water and whips and crosses.

2818
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,800
When the kids come around for trick or treat,

2819
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
you just splash it in their faces,

2820
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,800
and they throw it on demons.

2821
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,800
The best way is to throw it like a grenade,

2822
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,800
and then when it lands,

2823
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,800
it explodes with a little fire effect.

2824
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,800
Yep.

2825
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,800
I just throw the bottle,

2826
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,800
and it just clunks someone in the head

2827
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,800
and gives them a concussion.

2828
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,800
It strangely goes at a 45-degree angle,

2829
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,800
no matter how you throw it.

2830
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,800
It needs to shatter.

2831
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,800
Yeah.

2832
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,800
Now I'm second guessing

2833
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,800
the sale of Bitcoin.

2834
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
You can go all in,

2835
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,800
and if you lose money,

2836
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,800
I did make a profit.

2837
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,800
Think of it this way.

2838
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,800
If you don't own Bitcoin,

2839
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
and then it goes up, you lose.

2840
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,800
No, you don't.

2841
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,800
Yes, you do.

2842
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,800
I don't know.

2843
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,800
Ben is right. Every single day of your life,

2844
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,800
you are losing at casinos

2845
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,800
and all sorts of games that you're choosing

2846
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
not to take in.

2847
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,800
Think of how much money you're losing

2848
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,800
by not going to Vegas right now

2849
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,800
and betting on your money.

2850
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,800
Think of all the free V-Bucks I'm losing

2851
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,800
by not buying and getting my bonus

2852
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
on my purchases.

2853
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,800
You're actively losing money every second.

2854
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,800
That's how corporations

2855
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,800
plan their profit margins.

2856
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800
Exactly.

2857
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,800
Whenever it goes down,

2858
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,800
that's not money they're losing.

2859
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,800
That's money that they're not making.

2860
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,800
If they're still making money,

2861
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,800
but not...

2862
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Even if they're still making the same amount

2863
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,800
of money as before,

2864
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,800
that's terrible.

2865
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,800
We should have been making even more than we used to make.

2866
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,800
There's nothing wrong with

2867
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,800
expanding exponential growth forever.

2868
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,800
No, of course not.

2869
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,800
Man, it would be really unfortunate

2870
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,800
if the dominant business model

2871
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,800
of the entire planet was growth

2872
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,800
on a finite system like the planet Earth.

2873
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,800
Man, that'd be pretty fucking shitty, guys.

2874
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,800
I don't understand.

2875
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,800
I think it'll all be worth it

2876
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,800
as long as some specific shareholders

2877
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,800
make a lot of profit.

2878
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,800
We can always get another Earth.

2879
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,800
Those guys can just go to Mars.

2880
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,800
Right.

2881
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,800
So what's the big deal?

2882
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,800
There isn't a single motion right now

2883
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
who owns an Amazon Prime subscription.

2884
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,800
It's a completely untapped market.

2885
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,800
You just have to become one of those guys.

2886
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,800
If the existential Earth might fail on Earth,

2887
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,800
but on Mars, it's going to be different.

2888
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800
Mars is half the size,

2889
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,800
so the growth will be twice as fast.

2890
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,800
A civilization of people who all watch

2891
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,800
Rick and Morty. It would be so advanced.

2892
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,800
There'd be no stopping them.

2893
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,800
Yeah, that's true.

2894
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,800
Is that what Mars is?

2895
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,800
Yes, it's just going to be Elon Musk

2896
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,800
and the rest of his Rick and Morty pals.

2897
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
Did you see Elon Musk

2898
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,800
and Grimes on Twitter?

2899
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,800
These fucking freaks.

2900
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,800
They're being all like,

2901
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,800
Elon,

2902
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,800
make me a cyborg body, please.

2903
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,800
Yeah, they're cringe on Twitter,

2904
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,800
which is truly the highest crime possible.

2905
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,800
Why on Earth

2906
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,800
are you paying attention?

2907
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,800
Yeah, that was my question.

2908
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,800
I saw someone else retweet a screenshot of it,

2909
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,800
so I'm not following them,

2910
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,800
but I saw it rebask.

2911
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,800
Oh man, it just reminds me

2912
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,800
of dislike these people a lot.

2913
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,800
I so much hate things of many people.

2914
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,800
I hate them. I so much hate them.

2915
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,800
That's what I do.

2916
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,800
I wake up and I look at a list of every

2917
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,800
single famous person.

2918
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,800
I hate that person.

2919
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,800
That's how you wake up in the morning.

2920
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,800
That guy's just a problem.

2921
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,800
Ben, you should wake up in the morning

2922
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,800
and think of all the things you love.

2923
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,800
Done.

2924
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
Now you've got to think of more.

2925
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,800
You've got to start loving more things

2926
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,800
than zero things.

2927
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,800
Just think about how much money

2928
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,800
you're going to make off of Bitcoin

2929
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,800
and it's definitely not going to bite you in the ass

2930
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,800
because it can only go up.

2931
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,800
It will only eventually go up as long as you don't sell.

2932
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
It literally can only go up.

2933
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,800
You don't lose money until you've

2934
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,800
sold it at a loss.

2935
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,800
So if you never sell.

2936
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
That was that thing we came up with.

2937
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,800
If we do

2938
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,800
the opposite,

2939
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,800
then at least one of us will make money.

2940
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,800
Ben keeps his Bitcoin

2941
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,800
and I wait for it to crash before I put back in

2942
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,800
if at all.

2943
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
Then at least one of us

2944
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,800
will be with the winner.

2945
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
This is not a financial advice podcast,

2946
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,800
but if you follow one of them,

2947
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
you're guaranteed to make money

2948
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,800
because we're covering possible outcomes.

2949
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,800
Not having Bitcoin and having it.

2950
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,800
If it bit you in the ass,

2951
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,800
then it would be Bitcoin.

2952
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,800
The name would be apps.

2953
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,800
Aren't those the two genders?

2954
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,800
Not having Bitcoin and having Bitcoin?

2955
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,800
Sounds about right.

2956
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,800
I think so. I've read that somewhere.

2957
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,800
I still have Dogecoin though.

2958
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,800
If everything goes way up,

2959
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,800
I'll still have that Dogecoin.

2960
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,800
Literally, way before I knew this Doge should happen,

2961
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,800
like a year and a half or maybe two years ago,

2962
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:00,800
I didn't do it. I fucking hate myself so much.

2963
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,800
I almost bought a shitload of Dogecoin

2964
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,800
just because I was like, that dog

2965
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,800
is going to die pretty soon

2966
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,800
and it's probably going to spike in value.

2967
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,800
So I was just being very opportunistic about it.

2968
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
Dogecoin is

2969
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,800
well, it's almost back up to

2970
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,800
30 cents.

2971
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
It's doubled in the last...

2972
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,800
It's interesting. You watch Ethereum,

2973
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,800
Dogecoin and Bitcoin and their graphs

2974
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,800
are almost all the way back then.

2975
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,800
It's just people's faith.

2976
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,800
It's not that it's not the specific ones,

2977
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,800
but it's also...

2978
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,800
It's almost like these coins are just

2979
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,800
fucking investments and have no value

2980
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,800
outside of people hyping them up.

2981
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,800
I don't think I can agree with that.

2982
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,800
Are you seriously discounting

2983
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,800
the myriad of uses that you can have

2984
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,800
for Bitcoins like buying drugs

2985
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,800
online, buying

2986
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,800
pornography online.

2987
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,800
Those are the only two, but

2988
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,800
those exist.

2989
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,800
You're right.

2990
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,800
AMC is going to start accepting Bitcoin

2991
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,800
because they're a meme stock and they're leaning into it.

2992
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,800
Unironic, that is true.

2993
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,800
What could go wrong with a currency that can

2994
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,800
rapidly devalue itself to half

2995
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,800
in one day? There's no possible

2996
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,800
way that could bite them in the ass.

2997
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,800
What if you could leave your car idling

2998
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,800
and it would generate

2999
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,800
arcade tokens that you could

3000
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,800
trade for heroin and that's what Bitcoin is?

3001
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,800
It already does.

3002
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,800
You can just hook up like a bag

3003
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,800
to your car exhaust and then huff the fumes

3004
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,800
and then get high off that and you can trade that for drugs.

3005
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,800
Just put your mouth over

3006
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,800
the environment.

3007
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,800
Just deep-throat that...

3008
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,800
That's a solution.

3009
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,800
Just an illusion, yeah.

3010
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
That's a solution to climate change.

3011
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,800
Just put bags over your car exhaust

3012
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,800
so it doesn't go into the atmosphere and sell it for drugs.

3013
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,800
Just put a big garbage bag over the back

3014
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,800
of your car and then when you're done

3015
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,800
just bury the bag in your backyard

3016
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,800
and then there's no problem.

3017
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,800
Just put the carbon back in the ground

3018
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,800
where we got it from.

3019
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,800
Right, just burying it, grow a carbon tree.

3020
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,800
A lot of good ideas

3021
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,800
in this episode.

3022
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,800
Dude, we're like solving all the world's problems.

3023
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,800
Million-dollar ideas here.

3024
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:04,800
They're all patented by the way.

3025
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,800
We will sue the fuck out of you if anyone's

3026
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,800
asking for any of these things.

3027
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,800
Exactly.

3028
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,800
If you could hook up a car engine...

3029
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,800
You only pay me a bitcoin, by the way.

3030
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,800
You know how

3031
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
bitcoins always like, oh, we gotta get computers

3032
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,800
or whatever to do it.

3033
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,800
What if you could hook up mining bitcoin

3034
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,800
to a car exhaust and then people

3035
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,800
would drive to make bitcoin

3036
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,800
and then that would be like so much bitcoin.

3037
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,800
Sheet.

3038
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,800
Infinite funds.

3039
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
Never mind the greenhouse gases accelerating.

3040
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,800
Someone gets a toshi on the line.

3041
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,800
We gotta fucking figure this out.

3042
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,800
A boat.

3043
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,800
What if you build a sailboat and you just

3044
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,800
attached a big fan to it

3045
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
that would blow air into the sail

3046
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,800
and then you would just push the boat

3047
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,800
in a perpetual

3048
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,800
motion machine?

3049
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,800
What if you covered yourself in oil

3050
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,800
and then you went out when it was raining

3051
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,800
and then you started flying because oil is lighter than water?

3052
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,800
I'm not sure if that would work.

3053
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,800
You should live stream that.

3054
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,800
You should live stream it.

3055
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,800
Live stream perpetual motion machine

3056
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,800
test number one.

3057
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,800
Yes, please.

3058
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,800
Do we think it's time to start listening

3059
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,800
to voicemails?

3060
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,800
An hour and a half, give or take.

3061
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,800
Well, I've got one thing to talk about.

3062
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,800
We haven't even talked about

3063
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,800
anything.

3064
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,800
Zero topics of discussion.

3065
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,800
We've literally just been like, um,

3066
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,800
for like an hour and a half.

3067
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Usually, by this point, I would have been like,

3068
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,800
I would have been like, yeah.

3069
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,800
Let's start the fucking show, guys.

3070
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,800
Let's get down to business.

3071
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,800
At least I even cut out everything that happened

3072
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,800
before this point.

3073
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,800
Let's cut the crap and get down to brass tax.

3074
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,800
We've got business to attend to.

3075
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,800
There was one thing I wanted to get on record.

3076
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,800
Uh,

3077
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
because I don't think people are aware of this,

3078
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,800
but, uh,

3079
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,800
I've been a fan of Cyber Shell

3080
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,800
since around 2008 or so,

3081
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,800
I think.

3082
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,800
Wait, what? Before the PCP was even a

3083
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,800
twinkle in anybody's eye.

3084
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,800
Yeah, me and gamers have been

3085
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,800
our old school LP heads

3086
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,800
from when that was a brand new

3087
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:22,800
and creative art form

3088
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:24,800
just bursting onto the scene

3089
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:26,800
and everybody was so excited about it

3090
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,800
that they could have predicted how horrible it would become

3091
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,800
and how awful modern twitch culture

3092
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,800
will be. And it's definitely not my fault.

3093
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,800
I didn't need to contribute to this at all.

3094
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,800
Yeah, don't try and play me.

3095
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,800
That's definitely true.

3096
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,800
Uh, but I never,

3097
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,800
I never thought I'd eventually

3098
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,800
be talking to the great Sonic lore master himself.

3099
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,800
This kind of just

3100
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,800
happened, uh,

3101
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,800
by mere happenstance

3102
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,800
because I wasn't, uh, I didn't even know

3103
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,800
what the PCP was until 2018

3104
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,800
when I was, uh,

3105
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,800
invited on by, uh,

3106
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,800
I specifically remember that

3107
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,800
because, you know, the PCP

3108
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,800
used to be a very non-guest

3109
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:06,800
type podcast, you know what I mean?

3110
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,800
I was very surprised when I got asked to be on

3111
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,800
because it was like, I was not the first guest ever

3112
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,800
obviously, but like, I was like the first

3113
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,800
guest in a long, like there was a,

3114
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,800
it became guest time for quite a while after that

3115
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,800
so I was like, what the fuck?

3116
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,800
I had, I had literally never,

3117
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
I had literally never even heard of

3118
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,800
Cybershell. How dare you.

3119
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,800
Not be a Sonic fan. Until someone

3120
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,800
said, Ben,

3121
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,800
Cybershell, reference your, your lecture

3122
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,800
in a video and I looked

3123
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,800
at my, my ad sense and like

3124
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,800
I had made like more ad revenue

3125
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,800
than usual in the last couple days.

3126
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,800
You could actually see the runoff effect

3127
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,800
of people going to that video from

3128
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,800
my tale to get strolled video. Yeah.

3129
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,800
Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh, really

3130
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,800
surprising to me when I saw, uh,

3131
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,800
that, uh, you were on

3132
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,800
a PCP Cybershell and I heard somebody

3133
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,800
mentioned that you, you were, uh,

3134
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,800
a PCP fan.

3135
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,800
So that, uh, surprised me even more.

3136
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,800
I was like, whoa. I was, I didn't

3137
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,800
believe, I still don't believe it.

3138
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,800
I mean, I remember seeing, I remember

3139
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,800
seeing Cybershell's like name

3140
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,800
and, and, uh, avatar

3141
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,800
like in comments of early PCP

3142
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,800
or at least some, like

3143
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,800
some amount of PCP episodes.

3144
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,800
You can go back and find out. I had no idea you were a big

3145
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,800
YouTuber. Well, I wasn't a big YouTuber

3146
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,800
at the time, especially back then. It's like, if you

3147
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,800
find my like 2016 comments, I was like,

3148
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,800
um, well, I had my one

3149
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:26,800
little let's play I did for something

3150
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,800
awful back in the day and I had like, I don't know,

3151
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,800
under 10K subs. I can't

3152
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,800
remember the exact amount, but it was like some amount

3153
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,800
of subs. And then it was just like

3154
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,800
in 2017, all these people

3155
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,800
were making videos and I was like, I guess I can

3156
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,800
make a video. Making a video doesn't seem like it'd be that hard

3157
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,800
to do, right? Because, um,

3158
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,800
I just had this weird thing where I promised

3159
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,800
I was going to do a Sonic 2 bonus video

3160
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:48,800
back in 2008 and then I never did it.

3161
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,800
So I had eight years worth

3162
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,800
of just cheeky comments of people going, oh,

3163
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,800
when's the Sonic 2 bonus video? So I

3164
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,800
took all of those comments. I made a little

3165
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,800
montage and I was like, fine, I'll make

3166
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,800
the little video you guys wanted. Are you happy now?

3167
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,800
And then I just made a couple more videos

3168
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,800
and I don't know, you know, we make a couple videos

3169
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,800
they do well. So you want to keep making

3170
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,800
more ones, I guess. I don't know.

3171
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,800
Yeah, I remember that. You do a little content.

3172
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:12,800
You do a little content.

3173
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,800
Yeah. Cyber show at one point

3174
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,800
and maybe hard to believe this now was

3175
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,800
an underdog

3176
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,800
video maker on YouTube.

3177
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,800
And I was following him since back

3178
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,800
in those days.

3179
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,800
But it's, um, it's just weird

3180
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,800
how I never knew about

3181
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,800
the PCP and now I'm,

3182
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,800
you know, I'm on it and I'm a fan of it

3183
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,800
and it just so happens that Cyber show

3184
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,800
we both ended up on

3185
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,800
the same episode because I had the same thing where I recognize

3186
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,800
gamers taverns avatar

3187
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,800
from like comments from like ages

3188
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,800
and ages and ages ago. So I just, I don't know.

3189
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,800
You just see people in the comments enough, you sort of like

3190
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,800
start to just, you know, remember them or whatever.

3191
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,800
I always just, for some reason

3192
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,800
is his avatar of just gamers tavern

3193
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,800
where it's like a shade of brown and then like

3194
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,800
like a slightly different shade of brown

3195
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,800
for some reason that always just stuck in my mind.

3196
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,800
But that means I did

3197
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,800
a pretty good job designing that logo

3198
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,800
for not being an artist. It's minimalistic

3199
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,800
but it works. It's

3200
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,800
enough.

3201
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
It's enough. At least it's not a fucking

3202
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,800
anime avatar. Yeah.

3203
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,800
Am I right? Not one of these sick

3204
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,800
fucks. Anime people.

3205
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,800
Those are pretty

3206
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,800
terrible. Something else

3207
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,800
that surprised me is to find out that

3208
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,800
Shuga Conroy

3209
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,800
is a big fan of yours

3210
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,800
Cyber show.

3211
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,800
Yeah. There are a few

3212
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,800
like, you know,

3213
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,800
bigger people who are like still doing

3214
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,800
Let's Plays or whatever, you know, like Shuga Conroy

3215
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,800
which is crazy to me that there are still

3216
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,800
people out there making money and like continuing

3217
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,800
to keep the Let's Play tradition alive.

3218
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,800
And I mean, most of Let's Plays tradition

3219
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,800
sort of exists now on like Twitch, you know what I mean?

3220
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,800
And like live streaming which is fine

3221
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,800
and is like good but it's sort of a separate thing,

3222
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,800
you know, from like the

3223
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,800
pre-recorded Let's Play days of old

3224
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,800
Yeah, Shuga Conroy

3225
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,800
was one of the original YouTube Let's

3226
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,800
Players I think back from

3227
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,800
2006 or something and I

3228
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,800
started watching him on and off since around

3229
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,800
that time. And

3230
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,800
he's one of the pre-game grumps

3231
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,800
appears and

3232
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,800
it's pretty surprised that he knew

3233
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,800
of you and is a fan of yours.

3234
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,800
That's pretty cool.

3235
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,800
Yeah, I actually never

3236
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,800
like talked to him that much back in the day.

3237
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,800
I actually knew, he's part of a group called

3238
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,800
The Runaway Guys with a guy called Proton

3239
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,800
John and I knew Proton John from something

3240
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,800
awful because, you know,

3241
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,800
that's where all the cool kids were hanging out

3242
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,800
back in 2007-2008, you know,

3243
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,800
the hub of all cool

3244
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,800
internet activity that sort of became a nasty

3245
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,800
little seed which blossomed

3246
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,800
into a million other parts of

3247
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,800
modern internet culture of something awful,

3248
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
you know what I mean?

3249
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,800
Well, I figure since

3250
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,800
Shuga Conroy is a fan of yours, maybe you should

3251
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,800
you could pitch him my

3252
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,800
LPs one day.

3253
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,800
Oh yeah, I'll definitely

3254
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,800
Yeah, you, you, you're also

3255
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,800
making good Let's Plays, a very

3256
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,800
I really like, I really like the

3257
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,800
Gamer's Tavern, the Gamer's Tavern

3258
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,800
collection of Let's Plays.

3259
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,800
Nobody, nobody tries to be funny in their Let's Plays

3260
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,800
everybody just thinks their stupid natural

3261
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,800
personality was going to be enough

3262
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,800
to cut like, you know, carry the

3263
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,800
I just thought, I thought maybe he'd like

3264
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,800
them because he's a, from what I hear

3265
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:18,800
he's a big pun guy and

3266
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,800
that's kind of my specialty.

3267
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,800
I feel like he absolutely would like your videos, definitely

3268
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,800
he's got that kind of very

3269
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,800
you know, you know, humorous

3270
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,800
sensibility, you know what I mean? Where it's just like

3271
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,800
a lot of unrelenting punchlines after another

3272
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,800
which is great. Nobody, nobody writes

3273
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,800
material for their Let's Plays

3274
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,800
It's a loss, a lost art.

3275
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,800
It's ironic to like complain about that

3276
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,800
Part of me does miss that, you know what I mean?

3277
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,800
That's exactly why I chose to do it because

3278
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,800
I figured nobody in their right mind

3279
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
would do this.

3280
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,800
That's how you know you have a good video

3281
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,800
That's reason enough.

3282
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,800
I agree.

3283
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,800
It's funny because back in the day

3284
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,800
people used to accuse Let's

3285
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,800
players of scripting their videos

3286
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,800
but actually

3287
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,800
nobody ever did that because that would require

3288
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,800
you know, effort.

3289
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,800
To fully script out a video

3290
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,800
yeah, that would be like a lot of work.

3291
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,800
Usually I would just have like, you know

3292
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,800
things I want to talk about that I try to

3293
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,800
make sound natural.

3294
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,800
If you thought that

3295
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,800
the banter in a Let's Play

3296
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,800
was so sharp that you were like

3297
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,800
this can't be off the cuff

3298
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,800
this has to have been like prescripted

3299
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,800
and like written and produced

3300
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,800
I was just like, wow

3301
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,800
The news comes out, Aaron Hansen

3302
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,800
has never played a video game.

3303
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,800
It's all been scripted.

3304
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,800
It really tells you a little bit about

3305
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,800
the person that they can't imagine

3306
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,800
having a funny conversation like that.

3307
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,800
Some people are natural entertainers

3308
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,800
it's kind of weird. Some people like Jerma

3309
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,800
they can just flip a switch

3310
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:52,800
and they're just like on, you know what I mean?

3311
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
They can just be funny for like extended periods of time.

3312
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,800
Yeah, that's definitely true

3313
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,800
and I'm not one of those people

3314
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,800
that's why I need a script.

3315
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,800
Hey, there's nothing wrong with that

3316
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,800
nothing wrong with a nice bit of scripted content.

3317
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,800
Not everyone has to be a

3318
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,800
Twitch streamer in my book

3319
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,800
You're missing out on content though

3320
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,800
as you've been saying.

3321
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,800
Every second in your life is content

3322
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,800
You should live stream

3323
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,800
your script writing

3324
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,800
We should live stream us

3325
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,800
recording the episode

3326
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,800
before we release the episode

3327
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,800
You live stream the recording of the episode

3328
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,800
then you have the episode premiere

3329
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,800
and then you can have the post premiere

3330
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,800
look back at the episode

3331
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,800
the walking dead and the talking dead

3332
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,800
look back at the episode

3333
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,800
look back at the PCP we just were on

3334
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,800
Which then we live stream our

3335
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,800
after like how do we feel about the reception

3336
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,800
of this episode

3337
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,800
That was a few bonus episodes where we just talk it over

3338
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,800
a PCP

3339
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,800
as if it was a mystery science

3340
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,800
theatre in your old episodes

3341
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,800
I think we haven't done another one in a while

3342
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,800
Yeah, you were on the one

3343
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,800
because we did your old episode

3344
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,800
the first episode you were on

3345
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,800
we did the re...

3346
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,800
the PCP will never die

3347
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,800
it'll be like a loop

3348
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,800
it starts back at the beginning

3349
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,800
now we're going to be commenting on the first episode again

3350
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,800
We should just not even have those as bonus episodes

3351
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,800
that should be the next

3352
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,800
That's the next phase of the PCP

3353
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,800
just redoing every old episode

3354
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,800
commenting on the old ones

3355
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,800
People love your old content

3356
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:28,800
like all the people pitching about

3357
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,800
the old days

3358
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,800
They can give them what they want

3359
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,800
the old episodes again

3360
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,800
like the exact same episode

3361
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,800
commentary tracks

3362
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,800
We literally scripted it

3363
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,800
we would get the transcript

3364
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,800
and then say the things again

3365
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,800
If somebody is not there

3366
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,800
play your new person

3367
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,800
I give you

3368
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,800
we hire a bunch of actors

3369
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,800
I give you a live

3370
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:56,800
I'm imagining it at a local theatre

3371
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,800
like on stage

3372
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,800
in front of a curtain

3373
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,800
just people standing there

3374
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,800
with scripts doing a live reading

3375
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,800
a live performance of

3376
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,800
episode 4 of the program

3377
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:10,800
they think it's just like a fucking podcast

3378
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:12,800
or something but they don't understand

3379
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,800
every single line has been prescripted

3380
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,800
This is starting to become an actual good idea

3381
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,800
It's kind of funny

3382
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,800
the idea of doing commentary

3383
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,800
has always been funny to me

3384
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,800
the idea of doing commentary

3385
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,800
let's play is already commentary

3386
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,800
only you're not the director

3387
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,800
so I did a video once that was commentary

3388
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,800
on my first let's play video

3389
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,800
and I was like this is my commentary on my thoughts

3390
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,800
and then I immediately did a commentary on that video

3391
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,800
and then I did a commentary on that video

3392
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,800
I did that I was like I got 4 deep

3393
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,800
and then I stopped

3394
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,800
the commentary on a commentary

3395
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,800
but on a podcast is like extra funny

3396
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,800
because it's already pure audio

3397
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,800
it would be so hard to tell

3398
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,800
especially if it wasn't some of the same voices

3399
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,800
it is hard

3400
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,800
it's very confusing

3401
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,800
what if we literally do that

3402
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,800
and we get the transcript

3403
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,800
the closed captions from a video

3404
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,800
and we just re-record a re-performance of it

3405
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,800
and we make it a bonus

3406
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,800
we're doing it

3407
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,800
we're fucking doing it

3408
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,800
do we have that

3409
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:14,800
on our channel

3410
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
do we have to enable that

3411
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:18,800
or is it just automatic

3412
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,800
there's automatic captions

3413
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,800
the captions are pretty decent now

3414
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,800
the automatic ones

3415
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,800
if you have some specific proper nouns

3416
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:28,800
it might not get but for the most part it's pretty good

3417
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,800
you don't even need to hire someone

3418
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,800
you could but you can also just use

3419
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,800
the AI text to speech has gotten pretty good

3420
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,800
you can just synthesize new cast members

3421
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,800
here's what we do

3422
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,800
we replace everybody who's not here

3423
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,800
on the podcast

3424
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,800
just run their scripts through all the

3425
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,800
Pony video audio generators

3426
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,800
so we just have Twilight and Applejack

3427
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,800
we're placing Trixie and Nate

3428
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,800
and all the other stuff

3429
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,800
that's the final stage of the podcast

3430
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,800
is you actually talking to the Ponies

3431
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,800
it's where we've been heading this whole time

3432
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,800
speaking of Pony

3433
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,800
have you seen the trailer

3434
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,800
for the new movie

3435
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,800
I did

3436
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,800
I didn't actually watch it but I've been seeing images

3437
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
from it

3438
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,800
it looks like really

3439
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,800
really lame

3440
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,800
you wouldn't have expected much else

3441
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,800
but it was just like

3442
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,800
no jokes in the trailer landed

3443
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,800
at all

3444
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,800
I saw people saying that that one Pony looks like

3445
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,800
she's the daughter of

3446
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:32,800
Mordecai and Twilight

3447
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,800
oh yeah with the blue hair or whatever

3448
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,800
that meme is pretty funny

3449
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,800
cutie mark even has like three little things

3450
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,800
coming off it that looks like Mordecai's tail feathers

3451
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,800
like it's a bit of a stretch

3452
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,800
but it's like

3453
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,800
it's not the biggest stretch

3454
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,800
it just seems very generic

3455
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,800
it seems like what you would have expected

3456
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,800
G4 to be going into it I guess

3457
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,800
yeah

3458
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,800
back to the same old like corporate nothing

3459
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,800
well now they have like a huge

3460
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,800
fan base of like

3461
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,800
there are obviously always been some my little Pony fans

3462
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,800
but I feel nothing now they can make some generic shit

3463
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,800
and it would still probably sell really well

3464
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,800
so they're like hey let's just make some generic shit

3465
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,800
it's got

3466
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,800
they really reinvigorated the brand

3467
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,800
with G4 they don't have to try that hard

3468
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,800
all the people who have the content

3469
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,800
they have to make the content

3470
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,800
by reacting to the episodes

3471
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,800
they'll drive up the engagement

3472
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,800
people bitching about the Pony's and saying how ugly they are

3473
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,800
and how bad they are and how not good they are

3474
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,800
Dr. Wolf is making bank

3475
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,800
Dr. Wolf's not wasting any of this content

3476
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,800
he's monetizing his every thought

3477
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,800
there's a lot of the bronies who really

3478
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,800
stuck through it and they never once

3479
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,800
even considered covering a different

3480
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,800
show or something and they just

3481
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,800
they're just gonna wait until the next fucking generation

3482
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:44,800
of Pony shit comes out fucking

3483
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,800
I know my niche

3484
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,800
they've been doing it for 10 years

3485
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,800
can you imagine being a content creator

3486
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,800
that just stuck to one topic

3487
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,800
and that was it

3488
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,800
I mean

3489
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,800
maybe I would have more money

3490
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,800
were you gonna pivot to being a full time

3491
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,800
sonichu channel now

3492
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,800
me

3493
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,800
no, full time Winnie the Pooper

3494
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
oh yeah, hell yeah dude

3495
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,800
if Chris was releasing

3496
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:12,800
monthly updates I might

3497
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:14,800
I don't know, no I wouldn't do

3498
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,800
no, no I couldn't do it

3499
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,800
I couldn't do it, I don't have it

3500
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,800
it's one thing to do if there's actually something to talk about

3501
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,800
it's one thing if you have to just make up shit

3502
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,800
to get angry about it

3503
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:26,800
read a new tweet that says the same thing

3504
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,800
another deranged tweet that's exactly like all the ones

3505
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,800
as he always makes

3506
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,800
Ben just doesn't have it in him

3507
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,800
to be too successful

3508
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,800
no

3509
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,800
oh you think you're too good to read tweets

3510
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,800
just as a hardcore anti-capitalist

3511
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,800
can't let yourself get too successful

3512
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:44,800
otherwise you might get seduced

3513
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,800
by the system

3514
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,800
I gotta, you know it's like

3515
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,800
that's why I love Bernie Sanders so much

3516
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,800
he knew that like if he actually

3517
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,800
won anything it would just defeat the whole

3518
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,800
point so he has to

3519
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,800
he's just there to give people hope

3520
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,800
he's not actually there to fix it

3521
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,800
controlled opposition

3522
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,800
he had to do a classic

3523
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,800
pratfall

3524
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,800
pivot to, pivot crash and burn at the last

3525
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,800
minute and you know he pulled it off

3526
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,800
crash and burn

3527
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,800
he's a comedian at heart

3528
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:16,800
it really was like a perfect example of like a

3529
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,800
sideshow bob stepping on a million rakes

3530
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,800
and he was like he pulled it off with a plum

3531
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,800
I'm much respected in it

3532
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,800
you should never

3533
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,800
seen anyone step on rakes

3534
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,800
with such poise

3535
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,800
such grace

3536
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,800
also he wants to prove that he's legit

3537
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,800
so if he actually won then you know he's

3538
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,800
one of them

3539
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,800
I'm glad he didn't win that we didn't have to get disappointed

3540
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,800
by him winning and then not fixing everything

3541
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,800
absolutely

3542
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,800
nothing

3543
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,800
that would have been great because then

3544
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,800
once everybody realized that Bernie wasn't the answer

3545
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,800
it would have taken up their pitchforks

3546
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,800
that's why they couldn't let him win

3547
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,800
they weren't afraid that he was going to fix everything

3548
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,800
but they were afraid

3549
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,800
it doesn't matter who we elect

3550
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,800
it's never going to change

3551
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,800
we can't let him

3552
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,800
eat the carrot

3553
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,800
we can't let him eat the carrot that we're dangling

3554
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:10,800
because we only have one

3555
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,800
carrot

3556
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,800
you have to keep using the stick forever

3557
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,800
I don't know I think you're

3558
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,800
placing too much faith on people

3559
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,800
people never seem to

3560
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,800
learn

3561
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,800
that idea

3562
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,800
I don't actually think

3563
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,800
they would learn a lesson from any

3564
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,800
from anything that happened

3565
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,800
I think you're probably right

3566
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,800
history

3567
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,800
is doomed to repeat itself

3568
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,800
at least that means

3569
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,800
we're going to get a few more good sonic games

3570
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,800
before it's over

3571
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,800
wait because Bernie's going to

3572
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,800
well if history is going to repeat itself

3573
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,800
we're going to get to go through the 90s again

3574
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,800
oh

3575
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,800
yeah I guess you're right

3576
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,800
but the problem is it's not going to happen until

3577
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,800
the 2000

3578
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,800
ah god

3579
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,800
I need to put myself in sort of Walt Disney

3580
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,800
cryo storage or something

3581
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,800
wasn't there a plague in like 1920

3582
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,800
yes there was

3583
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,800
and there was another one in 2020

3584
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,800
there was also one in 1820

3585
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,800
yeah the spanish window was like 100 years ago

3586
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,800
yeah I heard about that one

3587
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,800
yeah

3588
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,800
anyway speaking of

3589
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:20,800
speaking of elected officials

3590
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,800
I have the lord of ghosts

3591
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,800
the lord mayor of ghosts

3592
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,800
is with me

3593
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:28,800
the plush exists

3594
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,800
and he's here right now

3595
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,800
he's got his funny little hand

3596
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,800
spent so much on shipping

3597
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,800
he's on the podcast

3598
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,800
oh god I gotta

3599
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,800
I guess I've got her

3600
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,800
wait you're not shipping them like now are you

3601
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,800
changing my address in

3602
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,800
this is just the

3603
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,800
sample I've been waiting to see it

3604
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:50,800
in person he looks great

3605
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,800
and he's squishy

3606
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,800
and he's like you can pick him up and throw him

3607
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,800
no problem

3608
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,800
that's important

3609
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,800
that's what you want

3610
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,800
he's adorable and now I have

3611
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,800
something that I can like fashion a little

3612
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,800
the little like ghost costume

3613
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,800
it's going to be like the size

3614
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,800
of a like a handkerchief

3615
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,800
which is super adorable

3616
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,800
I'm gonna have to figure out how to make those in bulk

3617
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,800
but yeah

3618
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:18,800
things are happening it's exciting

3619
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:20,800
but also terrifying

3620
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:22,800
yeah now you have to do it now you have all this responsibility

3621
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,800
I have to keep track

3622
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,800
of everybody who pledged

3623
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,800
and how much they pledged and if anybody

3624
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,800
wants like a plush

3625
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,800
I haven't ordered them yet

3626
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:34,800
and if they want one I can

3627
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,800
maybe like accommodate

3628
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
adding that to like

3629
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:40,800
a thing that I'll figure it out

3630
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,800
I need to like ask everybody before

3631
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
I start buying stuff because

3632
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,800
some people may have changed their minds I know Tom

3633
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,800
wanted one so I have to like buy

3634
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,800
an extra I couldn't believe this

3635
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,800
I was looking at the battle gem ponies

3636
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,800
Kickstarter

3637
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,800
and I saw that there is apparently an

3638
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,800
option to like add to

3639
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,800
a Kickstarter tier

3640
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,800
you can add like optional bonuses where

3641
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,800
you can like hit a button and be like okay I want this tier

3642
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,800
but I'll also add like five dollars

3643
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,800
and I'll also get this add-on to it

3644
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,800
or I'll add ten dollars and I'll get this other add-on

3645
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,800
and like I had no idea

3646
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,800
you could do that

3647
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,800
on Kickstarter that was like exactly

3648
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,800
the feature that like

3649
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,800
it would have been really useful for me

3650
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,800
with the vapors it would have been useful for you

3651
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,800
with the Lord of Ghosts and adding the plush

3652
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,800
like I've never seen it before

3653
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,800
I guess I'm glad it's there but I wish I knew

3654
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,800
about it

3655
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,800
yeah it's pretty stupid that I didn't

3656
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,800
like figure that out

3657
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,800
it was right there

3658
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,800
I was just like oh I don't want to do anything wrong

3659
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,800
I'm not even gonna click on anything

3660
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,800
as long as you don't forget

3661
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,800
to fulfill any rent

3662
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,800
that people paid for you'll be fine

3663
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,800
nobody would ever want me

3664
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,800
to rent about anything

3665
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,800
that's impossible

3666
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,800
who could think of such a thing

3667
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
well we've been going we've been ranting

3668
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:04,800
and raving for

3669
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,800
almost

3670
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,800
we're almost at two hours now

3671
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,800
I'm trying to think was there anything that

3672
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,800
I fucking had to

3673
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,800
bring up this Wii anything I wanted

3674
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,800
to mention

3675
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,800
that I didn't already touch on

3676
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,800
maybe maybe not

3677
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,800
last week did I mention the funny thing

3678
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:24,800
about

3679
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,800
when May and Ethan Ralph

3680
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,800
went to the arrest took a Christian

3681
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,800
arrest

3682
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,800
he says you know my friend Ben's name

3683
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,800
did I mention that before?

3684
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,800
I don't know if you mentioned it I saw that

3685
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,800
you got fucking name dropped

3686
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,800
I got name dropped

3687
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,800
I didn't see that

3688
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,800
I don't know

3689
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,800
I just think that's really funny

3690
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,800
that's really funny and bizarre

3691
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,800
I guess she thought

3692
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:56,800
your name is part of the

3693
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,800
historical record

3694
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,800
I'm getting arrested video

3695
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,800
future historians

3696
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,800
who was this mysterious Ben saint

3697
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,800
that was the

3698
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,800
that'll be the only artifact that exists of our civilization

3699
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,800
that was the friend of

3700
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,800
the holy lady

3701
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,800

there's no better way

3706
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,800
to get in Chris's good graces

3707
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,800

3708
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,800

I guess other than that no I had

3711
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,800
I didn't do anything

3712
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,800
I didn't do anything

3713
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,800
and I never will do anything ever again

3714
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,800
what about the game Ben?

3715
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,800
oh god I um

3716
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,800
yeah I've been working

3717
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:48,800
I have been working on the game

3718
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,800
I made a

3719
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,800
I added blood

3720
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,800
I added animated blood effects

3721
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,800
I've been like

3722
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,800
I've been like splatter all over the world

3723
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,800
it might be a little too much

3724
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,800
I might dial it back and make it a little less

3725
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,800
there's like a lot

3726
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,800
it gets everywhere now

3727
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,800
the game is no longer appropriate for children

3728
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,800
I was going to make some children play it but now I can't

3729
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,800
I might force some children

3730
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,800
these kids in the park want to play this game

3731
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,800
and they're like no

3732
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,800
it's cool like body parts

3733
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,800
this is important

3734
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,800
and my little pony

3735
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
spray out like a stream of blood

3736
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,800
out of like the severed part

3737
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,800
and like the blood like arcs across

3738
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,800
like the floor and the wall and like splatters

3739
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,800
and like patterns

3740
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:34,800
it actually looks pretty cool

3741
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,800
I mean it's a pretty basic but it's a

3742
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,800
it's a funny effect

3743
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,800
this is sounding kind of like a feature creep to me

3744
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:42,800
you're right

3745
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,800
but I've been this is a feature that I have been imagining

3746
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
I've been thinking of adding it for a long time

3747
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,800
and I finally sat down the other day

3748
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,800
and I did it

3749
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,800
there's only so many features that I actually need

3750
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,800
there's only so many features that I actually need

3751
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,800
there's only there's

3752
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
there's no

3753
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,800
I feel I feel okay

3754
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,800
because this isn't like a new thing that I thought of

3755
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:04,800
like yesterday or what the other day

3756
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,800
when I was working I was like wait what if I did

3757
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,800
this is a thing I'd already had like on a list

3758
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,800
that I had I mean a mental list

3759
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,800
but it was an old list

3760
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,800
no no feature creep

3761
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,800
never feature creep

3762
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,800
um

3763
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:20,800
maybe a little bit but not too much

3764
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,800
just just the right amount of feature creep

3765
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,800
just the right amount of crypto creep

3766
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,800
yes

3767
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,800
bitcoin is going to the moon

3768
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,800
and you're all just jealous

3769
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,800
you should add a slime coin idle game

3770
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,800
oh like it's like oh

3771
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,800
just in the middle of

3772
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,800
in the middle of battle you can just open up your

3773
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,800
your gel phone and just look at a little like

3774
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,800
stock and just like trade stocks

3775
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:46,800
like between attacks or whatever

3776
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,800
it's like oh shit I gotta sell I gotta sell my

3777
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,800
stock

3778
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,800
you know what I'm like KFC no don't

3779
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,800
it was a silly joke

3780
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:56,800
you know what feature creep actually sounds kind of cool

3781
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,800
actually it's a good thing

3782
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,800
right it's like more features creeping and make

3783
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,800
the game better yeah I like that

3784
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,800
correct I like when the game get better

3785
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,800
you can expect the release of this game in

3786
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:10,800
2034

3787
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,800
no

3788
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,800
I can't even believe that that year will pass

3789
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,800
someday that doesn't make sense to me

3790
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,800
I remember feeling that way about

3791
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,800
2021 you know what I mean like back in

3792
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:22,800
like 2016

3793
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,800
media in like 2020 like that's so far in the future

3794
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:26,800
I'm never gonna be there

3795
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,800
I felt that way about the year 2000

3796
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,800
now

3797
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,800
well that's weird

3798
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:34,800
I can't imagine living in

3799
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:36,800
an era where there's a two on the end

3800
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,800
of time imagine

3801
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,800
how good the world's gonna be by then

3802
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:42,800
yeah imagine how cool

3803
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,800
a technologically advanced it'll be

3804
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,800
we'll have flying cars and

3805
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,800
how old were you in 2000

3806
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,800
I was 12

3807
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,800
or 11 or 12

3808
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,800
okay

3809
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,800
yeah it was 11

3810
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,800
I think I was a little too young to even

3811
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,800
anticipate like what even that

3812
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,800
means for like the millennium

3813
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:04,800
the year 2000

3814
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,800
like huh what

3815
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,800
I thought that shit was crazy

3816
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,800
I'm going back to playing with

3817
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:12,800
whatever

3818
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,800
these fucking zoomers who have the privilege of

3819
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,800
being born in the year 2000 so they always

3820
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,800
know exactly how old they are because they can just

3821
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,800
look at what year it is and like oh that's how old I am

3822
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,800
yeah I was thinking about that the other day

3823
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,800
that's really convenient

3824
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,800
well I know how old I am because

3825
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,800
I just google how old is the Simpsons

3826
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,800
and I'm as old as the Simpsons is

3827
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,800
so

3828
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,800
on a separate note that's depressing

3829
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,800
as fuck I was thinking about how like Homer

3830
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,800
Simpson he's like supposed to be in his 30s

3831
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,800
he's like there's not like a one

3832
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,800
clear canon answer but he's been

3833
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:44,800
portrayed as 32 and 36

3834
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:46,800
I don't want to be as old as Homer

3835
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,800
Simpson though I would prefer not to be dead

3836
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,800
I think there was a tweet going around where they were saying like there's one of the recent episodes

3837
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,800
of the Simpsons

3838
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,800
portrayed Homer as like a young Rebellies

3839
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,800
teenager in the 90s and I was like

3840
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,800
well they have that sliding time scale

3841
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
because I mean yeah he's like they're not getting older

3842
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
but things are still

3843
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,800
current events are still happening so

3844
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,800
okay I'm pretty sure that he

3845
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,800
was canonically 39

3846
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,800
but then like at some point

3847
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,800
they changed it to 40

3848
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,800
I always thought of him as yeah closer to 40 to be honest

3849
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,800
but yeah you can find shit that

3850
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,800
say is he's like in his mid 30s

3851
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,800
it's not like there's one canon answer

3852
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,800
like I said it's

3853
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:24,800
I remember there's an episode where there's a

3854
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,800
his crisis is that he's literally

3855
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,800
he's hit the like halfway point of like the average

3856
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,800
age

3857
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,800
he's literally like halfway through his life because he's

3858
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:34,800
you know he thinks he's 38

3859
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,800
and

3860
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
but he's actually he forgets that he's actually

3861
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,800
39 so he's actually more than half

3862
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,800
I remember there's like a bit in there

3863
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,800
I wouldn't be surprised

3864
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,800
it probably does vary

3865
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,800
at some point they must have made like

3866
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,800
a decision but made probably early on they like

3867
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,800
weren't 100% sure about it

3868
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,800
I googled my

3869
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:56,800
birth year and like what happened

3870
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,800
in this year and

3871
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,800
I'm scrolling through and there's a lot of like

3872
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,800
you would never think to remember this

3873
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,800
like oh Ben Johnson

3874
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,800
is banned from athletics for life

3875
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,800
I don't

3876
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,800
I don't know what that is

3877
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,800
who is that

3878
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:14,800
the Indonesia earthquake

3879
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,800
earthquake hits flora's Indonesia

3880
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,800
2200 dead

3881
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,800
that's how old I am

3882
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,800
sorry I only know

3883
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:24,800
the release dates of video games I don't know

3884
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,800
years

3885
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,800
such a useless list

3886
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,800
not world historic events

3887
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,800
like stuff happens in the year

3888
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,800
and it's just a bunch of

3889
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,800
boring news articles

3890
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,800
and like war

3891
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,800
lame

3892
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,800
where's the real shit

3893
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:46,800
what video games came out that's all that matters

3894
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:48,800
I know in 1988

3895
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,800
the year Ben was born

3896
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,800
is when Mario 3 came out in Japan

3897
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:54,800
Mario 3

3898
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,800
wait really

3899
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,800
yeah Mario 3 came out in US

3900
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,800
in 1990 and in Japan

3901
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,800
it came out in 88 I believe

3902
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,800
I was playing the NES

3903
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,800
as a kid thinking it was like new

3904
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,800
hot shit I didn't even realize

3905
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,800
that it was like old busted

3906
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,800
bullshit technology

3907
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,800
my parents probably got it at a

3908
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,800
fucking bargain Ben at the library

3909
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,800
I'm kind of grateful to have grown up

3910
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,800
and been able to appreciate like the Super Nintendo

3911
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,800
and Genesis just to have like been there

3912
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,800
for that big jump into 3D

3913
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,800
like whoa it's fucking

3914
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,800
3D

3915
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,800
quick facts from 1993

3916
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:32,800
world's changing event

3917
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:34,800
Intel introduced the Pentium family

3918
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:36,800
of 32-bit microprocessors

3919
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,800
the world was never the same after that

3920
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,800
it's just so rememberable

3921
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,800
I remember seeing

3922
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:44,800
it wasn't like a commercial

3923
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,800
for the Game Boy Advance

3924
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,800
it was like a commercial for like

3925
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:50,800
McDonald's

3926
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:52,800
and McDonald's was doing like a Mario

3927
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,800
tie-in

3928
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:56,800
doing some kind of like tie-in promotion

3929
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,800
with like Mario 64

3930
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,800
or something

3931
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,800
and they fucking

3932
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,800
the commercial showed a Game Boy

3933
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,800
color or maybe it was a Game Boy Advance

3934
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,800
I think it was something like Mario 64 on the Game Boy color

3935
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,800
I think I remember that commercial

3936
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:12,800
and I remember being pissed off and like you can't do that

3937
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,800
technology I wish I had that

3938
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:16,800
like oh my god a handheld with 3D graphics

3939
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,800
I can't even fucking believe this

3940
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,800
if I could just have Mario 64

3941
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,800
in a handheld I'd be so happy

3942
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,800
that it happened on the fucking DS

3943
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:26,800
and it was like whatever it's fine

3944
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,800
I think one of the biggest

3945
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:30,800
I played it in like a week because that was cool

3946
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:32,800
look at this fucking this thing

3947
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:34,800
the conversation Ted Danson

3948
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,800
wore black place and used the N word

3949
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,800
at girlfriend whoopee Goldberg's roast

3950
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,800
at the Friars Club

3951
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,800
this looks like it was like AI generated list

3952
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:44,800
it says the most famous person in America

3953
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,800
was probably

3954
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,800
where did you find this list

3955
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,800
I'm just googling place it like

3956
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,800
pop culture all of facts and trivia

3957
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:54,800
I remember the shipping news

3958
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,800
by E. Annie Prowles

3959
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:58,800
had the price of a Domino's Pizza

3960
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,800
two toppings in 1993

3961
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,800
it was a different time

3962
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,800
back then you could wear black face

3963
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,800
and say the N word it was okay in those days

3964
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,800
it was a different time

3965
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,800
it was charming

3966
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:12,800
cool and epic as a matter of fact

3967
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
Intel introduced a Pentium

3968
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,800
there used to be a micro process

3969
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,800
pretty good

3970
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,800
okay I guess Dune came out

3971
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,800
that's a pretty big release

3972
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,800
is it the initial yeah 10th of December

3973
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:30,800
1993

3974
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:32,800
like Ted Danson wore black face

3975
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:34,800
and used the N word at girlfriend

3976
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,800
whoopee Goldberg's roast

3977
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:38,800
at the Friars Club

3978
02:18:38,800 --> 02:18:40,800
we gotta cancel Ted Danson what the fuck

3979
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,800
is going on here we gotta dig up this roast

3980
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,800
how old are you

3981
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,800
remember when Ted Danson said the N word

3982
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,800
you remember that

3983
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:50,800
you remember the rascal Ted Danson

3984
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,800
I'm trying to imagine like what the context

3985
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,800
was that like maybe at the time

3986
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,800
not everyone thought

3987
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,800
that was like really

3988
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:00,800
cringe to do

3989
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,800
hmm

3990
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:04,800
the 90s was a world before cringe existed

3991
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,800
everybody just did everything genuinely

3992
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:08,800
and nobody was embarrassed

3993
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:10,800
by anything

3994
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,800
there's only once YouTube and the internet existed

3995
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:14,800
that cringe culture came into being

3996
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,800
well it wasn't that long ago

3997
02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:18,800
that the PCP used to

3998
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:20,800
say the N word quite often

3999
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,800
we're just like Ted Danson

4000
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,800
we're even better

4001
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,800
we said it even more

4002
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,800
than Ted Danson did

4003
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:30,800
and later so for all you know

4004
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,800
we were in black face the entire time

4005
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:34,800
did you know

4006
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:36,800
you can't prove that they weren't

4007
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,800
did you know that behind the scenes

4008
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:40,800
we all wore black face all up the first

4009
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:42,800
entire year we were recording

4010
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:44,800
and we never talked about it

4011
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:46,800
we thought it just went without saying

4012
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,800
we thought it was black face but it was actually

4013
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,800
a bunch of soot like we were in Mary Poppins

4014
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,800
and we were cleaning the chimneys

4015
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:54,800
because well you see because

4016
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,800
we had all been holding like we had all

4017
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,800
collectively been holding a large cartoon

4018
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:00,800
bomb that had like exploded at us

4019
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,800
and you know covered us

4020
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,800
and that's basically what it was like in the 90s

4021
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,800
it was a lot like the early PCP episodes

4022
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,800
in a roundabout sort of way

4023
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,800
good times

4024
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:14,800
those were the days

4025
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,800
love that cartoon ball

4026
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,800
celestine prophecy

4027
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,800
classic a classic

4028
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,800
game of the year

4029
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,800
game of the year of the year of your birth

4030
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:34,800
what do you got?

4031
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,800
let's compare like year birth games

4032
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,800
who's got the best gamer

4033
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,800
we're pretty sure

4034
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,800
I'm slightly miffed

4035
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:44,800
I'm one year early to be Sonic the Hedgehog

4036
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,800
so I have to say Super Mario World

4037
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,800
that's a pretty good one

4038
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,800
it is a good game

4039
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,800
from the year I was born

4040
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:58,800
I'm going to deal with ones that were released in America

4041
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:00,800
Super Mario Bros. 2

4042
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,800
was released in America

4043
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:04,800
see I don't even need to do this because we have the same birth

4044
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:06,800
so whatever your answer

4045
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,800
let me just take it

4046
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,800
Master Blaster

4047
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,800
damn

4048
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,800
I might win I've got Mega Man X

4049
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:18,800
Monopoly on the Sega Master System

4050
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,800
it's Mega Man X

4051
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,800
the secret man of this doom

4052
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:26,800
Disney's Aladdin on Genesis

4053
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,800
Mega Man X kind of came out in 94

4054
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,800
in US I think

4055
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,800
in 93 in Japan

4056
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,800
I didn't click on the thing

4057
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,800
Zelda came out in 1988

4058
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,800
so that's pretty good

4059
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,800
that's pretty solid

4060
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:42,800
I thought it was 1987

4061
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:46,800
not according to computer gaming world magazine

4062
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:50,800
why is it always got to be like you gotta check things

4063
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:54,800
I typed in it in google and I have to go and check

4064
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,800
what year it came out in what country

4065
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:00,800
actually something that fascinated me is that

4066
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,800
with some really old games

4067
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,800
they actually don't know when they came out exactly

4068
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:08,800
because they used to not keep track of that sort of thing as much

4069
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:10,800
like there's a big debate

4070
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:14,800
as to when the original Super Mario Bros. came out

4071
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,800
some people say it was 1985

4072
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,800
others say it was 1986

4073
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,800
it was an actual year

4074
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,800
package with the NES

4075
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,800
with like Duck Hunt cartridge

4076
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:28,800
well Nintendo officially lists it

4077
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,800
as 1985

4078
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:34,800
but the NES only had a limited release in the US in 1985

4079
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,800
it was only released like in a couple of cities

4080
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,800
and I think it wasn't until 1986

4081
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,800
that the NES had a

4082
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:46,800
a release across the entire country

4083
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:48,800
okay riddle me this Nintendo

4084
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:51,800
you say it's called the family computer

4085
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:53,800
then why does it only play games for babies

4086
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:55,800
explain that to me

4087
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:57,800
where's the porn

4088
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:59,800
where's the porn games

4089
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:01,800
and a spreadsheet accounting software

4090
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,800
for mommy and dad

4091
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:05,800
the Famicom actually did have

4092
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:07,800
a couple of antigames

4093
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:11,800
I need my adult themes

4094
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:13,800
and situations

4095
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,800
and mature situations

4096
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:17,800
I need to be titillated

4097
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:20,800
I need the Famicom to do a fucking digital

4098
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:23,800
striptease for me on my television set

4099
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:25,800
you ever seen a Takeshi's challenge

4100
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,800
I think it was called

4101
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,800
I've seen the Jontron

4102
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:31,800
video about it

4103
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:33,800
it was popular before Jontron did a video on it

4104
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:35,800
yeah but I'd never heard of it before that

4105
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,800
I think maybe AVGN did a video on it first

4106
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:41,800
but I'm not sure

4107
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:43,800
maybe he did it after

4108
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,800
wait what game

4109
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:47,800
Takeshi's challenge

4110
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:49,800
no I don't think AVGN did that

4111
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:51,800
Jontron did that one

4112
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:53,800
yes that's what I remember

4113
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:57,800
uhhhh

4114
02:23:57,800 --> 02:23:59,800
are we still looking at

4115
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:01,800
video game years

4116
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:03,800
legend is all though

4117
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,800
can you imagine being an old enough piece of shit

4118
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:07,800
to play Atari games

4119
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,800
and enjoy them

4120
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:11,800
even though they suck

4121
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:13,800
I watch this youtube channel

4122
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,800
sometimes called Kim Justice

4123
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:17,800
and Kim Justice talks

4124
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,800
about

4125
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:21,800
pre-NES games

4126
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:23,800
in Britain

4127
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:25,800
and Britain

4128
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:27,800
they had the Zidic Spectrum

4129
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:29,800
the Zidic Spectrum

4130
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:31,800
UK didn't get games

4131
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,800
from the rest of the world until

4132
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:35,800
the NES

4133
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:37,800
they had their own homebrew

4134
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:39,800
they had a whole different video game scene

4135
02:24:39,800 --> 02:24:41,800
guys are there, they love Dizzy

4136
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:43,800
the Ig, they love that guy

4137
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,800
they have all sorts of weird shit they like

4138
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:47,800
the second master system is not popular in the UK

4139
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:49,800
I think

4140
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:51,800
this is in the late 80s

4141
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:53,800
that one where you're the little guy

4142
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:55,800
Kim

4143
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:57,800
there's like one of like a bunch of sequels

4144
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,800
she's made a

4145
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:01,800
sort of a documentary about the life of this like

4146
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:03,800
kid who like made this game

4147
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,800
where you're a guy running around like a hotel

4148
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,800
and it was like a

4149
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:09,800
huge fucking hit

4150
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:11,800
it was like a massive success in the UK

4151
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:13,800
and nowhere else and the guy was like

4152
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:15,800
a fucking rockstar and he like

4153
02:25:15,800 --> 02:25:17,800
got into drugs and like burnt out

4154
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,800
really young after making one sequel

4155
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:21,800
and like he had like a whole

4156
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:23,800
like rise and fall like celebrity

4157
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,800
that's just so weird to me you're like a rockstar

4158
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:27,800
video game dev but like in the fucking

4159
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:29,800
late 80s when all the games sucked

4160
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:31,800
basically again I'm not even trying to be mean

4161
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:33,800
but like Atari games are just so primitive

4162
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:35,800
that they're just like they're basically like

4163
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,800
unplayable by today's standards again but it's just

4164
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:39,800
weird to me like imagine video games don't even exist

4165
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,800
like you don't even know I mean I guess Pong existed

4166
02:25:41,800 --> 02:25:43,800
and then like all of a sudden there's this new

4167
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:45,800
thing called Atari you probably think it's pretty cool

4168
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:47,800
but like it's impossible to show it to a

4169
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:49,800
kid nowadays and have them actually be

4170
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,800
interested in it

4171
02:25:51,800 --> 02:25:53,800
let me let me let me show you

4172
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:55,800
there are probably some good Atari games

4173
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:57,800
let me show you the game this guy made

4174
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:59,800
this guy was um

4175
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,800
was like living this rockstar lifestyle

4176
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,800
off of it looked like it looked like

4177
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:05,800
I'm gonna post a script this

4178
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:07,800
it's called Jet Set Willy

4179
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,800
this guy was like

4180
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:11,800
because I remember hearing Jet Set in the titles

4181
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:13,800
like what the fuck is going on but yeah just a weird ass game

4182
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:15,800
is that the prequel of Jet Set Radio

4183
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:17,800
that's what I thought but I don't think so

4184
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,800
I think I think this is the sequel

4185
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:23,800
this is number two I think

4186
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:25,800
I've seen games that look like this before

4187
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:27,800
but I forgot what it was called

4188
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:29,800
but I played actually

4189
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:31,800
a ZX Spectrum game once

4190
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:33,800
in Donkey Kong 64

4191
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:35,800
there's a mini game where you can play

4192
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:37,800
a ZX

4193
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:39,800
Jetpack, that's the one

4194
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:41,800
you can play that

4195
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:43,800
it's I think the real original

4196
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,800
version of the game

4197
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:47,800
Rareware got their start making ZX Spectrum games

4198
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:49,800
so yeah you can

4199
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:51,800
find a few of them on like the Rare

4200
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:53,800
Replay or whatever

4201
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,800
I actually thought Jetpack was pretty cool

4202
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:57,800
even though it's a very simplistic

4203
02:26:57,800 --> 02:26:59,800
primitive game

4204
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,800
I thought it was not so bad

4205
02:27:01,800 --> 02:27:03,800
it's kind of fun to play for a couple of minutes at a time

4206
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:05,800
right yeah I

4207
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,800
was sort of being comedic in how

4208
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:09,800
overly harsh I am I know there are some good old

4209
02:27:09,800 --> 02:27:11,800
games it's just like they're rarer

4210
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:13,800
and you find a lot of just bullshit that sucks

4211
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,800
and you have to use your imagination

4212
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:17,800
which is the last thing I want to be doing when I'm playing a video game

4213
02:27:17,800 --> 02:27:19,800
I play that to have

4214
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:21,800
imagery force fed to me not so I can imagine

4215
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:23,800
things

4216
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:25,800
door fortress

4217
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,800
I mean it's easy

4218
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:29,800
to make fun but like I'm doing

4219
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:31,800
some game dev shit and I have like software

4220
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:33,800
that's specifically built for it

4221
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:35,800
imagine trying to make this

4222
02:27:35,800 --> 02:27:37,800
you have to like program

4223
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:39,800
it must be really hard to make games

4224
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:41,800
like draw the sprite

4225
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:43,800
you have to like I remember seeing

4226
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:45,800
like

4227
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:47,800
for Mario or whatever they have like

4228
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:49,800
paper where they would draw

4229
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,800
yeah they drew it on graph paper

4230
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:53,800
like where the pixels would be and then they would have to

4231
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:55,800
type up like okay this coordinate

4232
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,800
here draw this pixel

4233
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:59,800
and they would do that

4234
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:01,800
and then that's how they would draw pixel art

4235
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,800
so it was incredibly difficult for them

4236
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,800
to make fine

4237
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,800
tune changes to the levels

4238
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:09,800
since they

4239
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:11,800
they'd have to draw it on the graph paper

4240
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:13,800
first and go back and

4241
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:15,800
type in the code to change something

4242
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:17,800
mm-hmm

4243
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:19,800
yeah that

4244
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,800
sounds about the size of it

4245
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:23,800
I think also back then they had to use

4246
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:25,800
like certain

4247
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,800
ROM cartridges that would

4248
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:29,800
only be erased

4249
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:31,800
if you shined light into

4250
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,800
the ship

4251
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:35,800
add like a little hole for ultra

4252
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:37,800
violet light

4253
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:39,800
what

4254
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,800
I don't even understand

4255
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:43,800
that's wild

4256
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:45,800
you mean like to

4257
02:28:45,800 --> 02:28:47,800
erase data

4258
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:49,800
they had to like sack it

4259
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:51,800
that is weird I was not aware of that

4260
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,800
but it was just a feature

4261
02:28:53,800 --> 02:28:55,800
I completely had the weird arcade technology like that

4262
02:28:55,800 --> 02:28:57,800
it was like it was a read only

4263
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:59,800
memory ship but you can erase

4264
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:01,800
the data on it by

4265
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,800
shining light into a little hole on the ship

4266
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:05,800
you have to like manually do it

4267
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:07,800
yeah I think they had to

4268
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,800
manually do this kind of thing back then

4269
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:11,800
it was pretty

4270
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,800
inconvenient you know making games back then

4271
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:15,800
was very difficult

4272
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:17,800
that's why it's pretty impressive

4273
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:19,800
I always had my mind blown

4274
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:21,800
I had like small of like disk space

4275
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:23,800
you know they had to work with those games

4276
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:25,800
like in the original Super Mario Bros they had to reuse

4277
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:27,800
like the fucking clouds as the bushes and shit

4278
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:29,800
you know what I mean because just anywhere to save

4279
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:31,800
a little bit of space

4280
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:33,800
that's why a lot of the levels are kind of samey

4281
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,800
but it's impressive

4282
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:37,800
they were able to make a you know a pretty

4283
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,800
playable game off of

4284
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:41,800
the technology they had at the time

4285
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:43,800
you ever watch those videos there's a guy

4286
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:45,800
who does like sort of like how it works

4287
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:47,800
like old gaming tech and he

4288
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:49,800
there's one where he explains like

4289
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:51,800
he explains why missing no looks the way it does

4290
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:53,800
but in the course

4291
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:55,800
is that the 8-bit guy

4292
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:57,800
it's not the 8-bit guy

4293
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:59,800
no that's a different guy

4294
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,800
LGR

4295
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,800
um

4296
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:05,800
why missing no

4297
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,800
I haven't seen that video specifically but

4298
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:09,800
I think maybe I know you're talking about

4299
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,800
I think it's called missing no

4300
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,800
explained

4301
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:15,800
I may have seen this video it's ringing some bells

4302
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,800
but yeah it is interesting hearing just like

4303
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:19,800
the exact minutiae of like

4304
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:21,800
like why does it come out is this weird

4305
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:23,800
garbled box like what exactly is it trying to do

4306
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:25,800
you know what I mean

4307
02:30:25,800 --> 02:30:27,800
is it like explaining how

4308
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,800
it like it's it decides

4309
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:31,800
to be printed in that weird

4310
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:33,800
pattern like we all know why

4311
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:35,800
there's a glitch but like is he going into like

4312
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:37,800
it's called it's called

4313
02:30:37,800 --> 02:30:39,800
the channel is called retro game mechanics

4314
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:41,800
explained the video is called missing

4315
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:43,800
those glitchy appearance explained

4316
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,800
and it's basically I mean

4317
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:47,800
he he he says he

4318
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:49,800
explains why missing no has that sprite

4319
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:51,800
and he and to do so he has to

4320
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,800
explain the whole like process by which

4321
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:55,800
Pokemon sprite data

4322
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:57,800
this is a good video and then like

4323
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:59,800
translated and compressed and stuff

4324
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:01,800
I appreciate anyone who will go to like

4325
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:03,800
I've seen lengths to like

4326
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:05,800
like look at this the visualizations that he

4327
02:31:05,800 --> 02:31:07,800
does to like don't like

4328
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:09,800
I need to explain to me very basically

4329
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:11,800
you know what I mean so for me to understand

4330
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:13,800
something of this like when he's pulling out the math

4331
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:15,800
and shit I'm like okay oh this this is good

4332
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,800
I want to watch this

4333
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:19,800
this is a good video yeah I like I appreciate anyone

4334
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:21,800
who's like oh did you know this

4335
02:31:21,800 --> 02:31:23,800
missing no is a thing that happens

4336
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:25,800
right right right this is

4337
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:27,800
just glitching this you know it's like a

4338
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:29,800
why why is it like you know

4339
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:31,800
missing no is a

4340
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:33,800
a very mysterious thing to have discovered

4341
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:35,800
as a kid

4342
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:37,800
because it's kind of like the father

4343
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,800
or mother of all glitches it's

4344
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:41,800
it's quite amazing

4345
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:43,800
yeah I remember it was really cool

4346
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,800
it was like yeah it wasn't hard to do

4347
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:47,800
but it was like you had to do these weird

4348
02:31:47,800 --> 02:31:49,800
esoteric steps which were easy to

4349
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:51,800
explain luckily and it's so weird to

4350
02:31:51,800 --> 02:31:53,800
me how it could like fuck up your game it

4351
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:55,800
like clone your items

4352
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:57,800
it's accessible and you can do it

4353
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:59,800
and it's fun how it

4354
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:01,800
sort of works like it's sort of you can

4355
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:03,800
sort of just use it as a pokemon

4356
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:05,800
kind of and it like does things to your

4357
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:07,800
game that are like it breaks your game

4358
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:09,800
but like it doesn't break it's so bad that

4359
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:11,800
like it doesn't work it doesn't like hard crash the game

4360
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:13,800
it actually has like you can like put your master

4361
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,800
ball or rare candy in a certain slot and get

4362
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:17,800
infinite which is like incredibly useful I mean

4363
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:19,800
sort of breaks a game and like makes it too easy

4364
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:21,800
blah blah blah but you know as a kid I didn't

4365
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:23,800
give a fuck about that I was just like whoa this is epic

4366
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:25,800
it was a really easy glitch pull off

4367
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:27,800
but it was just so

4368
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,800
weird it didn't make sense how it

4369
02:32:29,800 --> 02:32:31,800
work and

4370
02:32:31,800 --> 02:32:33,800
as a kid I couldn't figure out if the developers

4371
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:35,800
did this on an on purpose

4372
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:37,800
or if it was

4373
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:39,800
not on purpose it was just

4374
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:41,800
it just didn't make sense until I got older

4375
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:43,800
it was hard to imagine like yeah how could there be like

4376
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:45,800
accidentally put a pokemon in the game with like

4377
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:47,800
a unique name and sprite like how does

4378
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,800
accidentally happen to like oh yeah exactly

4379
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,800
these aren't on purpose these are like default error

4380
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:53,800
messages basically like missing number

4381
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:55,800
means like we couldn't find the fucking pokemon's name

4382
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:57,800
just crazy that so much

4383
02:32:57,800 --> 02:32:59,800
comes up from just this one

4384
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:01,800
uh tiny error

4385
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:03,800
it is cool I like to think of how much like

4386
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:05,800
people who are like inspired by missing know just

4387
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:07,800
in terms of like glitch hunting and just people

4388
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:09,800
make their own games so they're inspired probably

4389
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:11,800
not directly but just like that kind of glitchy

4390
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:13,800
shit is inspired like creepypasta to you know

4391
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,800
just some degree which is actually I was gonna say that

4392
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:17,800
inspired by other games missing know actually kind

4393
02:33:17,800 --> 02:33:19,800
of scared me a little bit as a kid because

4394
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:21,800
it felt like a creepypasta

4395
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:23,800
it is like it's basically

4396
02:33:23,800 --> 02:33:25,800
like a creepypasta that's what creepypastas are all like

4397
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:27,800
they all have that start off it's like a missing

4398
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:29,800
no shit well you have to go here and do all this obscure

4399
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:31,800
shit that's like a reason why you know

4400
02:33:31,800 --> 02:33:33,800
no one else has found this hidden ghost

4401
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:35,800
bullshit in the game it's interesting

4402
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:39,800
as like when you're a kid you you think

4403
02:33:39,800 --> 02:33:41,800
that uh your game got

4404
02:33:41,800 --> 02:33:43,800
infected by a ghost

4405
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:45,800
virus or something I was very

4406
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,800
you know when I realized

4407
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:49,800
that that it had corrupted my

4408
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:51,800
I didn't realize until later that it would

4409
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:53,800
corrupted my elite four data and I was

4410
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:55,800
very bummed I was very bummed about that

4411
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,800
the first time I got

4412
02:33:57,800 --> 02:33:59,800
like poisoned in Pokemon

4413
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:01,800
I thought the game was glitching out because it

4414
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:03,800
went you know does the whole

4415
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:05,800
thing with it when you walk a few steps

4416
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:07,800
it beeps and it flashes and I'm

4417
02:34:07,800 --> 02:34:09,800
like oh shit I did

4418
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:11,800
I do something wrong oh no the game's gonna break

4419
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:13,800
I'm gonna get in trouble

4420
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,800
I was very scared very

4421
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:17,800
upset I had no idea that's

4422
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:19,800
what the poison was your first explosion of poison mechanic

4423
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:21,800
yeah it's not it doesn't make sense and that is

4424
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:23,800
why I mean it's not they don't explain it but like

4425
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:25,800
it's easy to have it happen to you and not know

4426
02:34:25,800 --> 02:34:27,800
what's going on for the first time so

4427
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:29,800
that's fine and eventually the Pokemon fainted

4428
02:34:29,800 --> 02:34:31,800
and I was like oh it's a thing that was going

4429
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:33,800
on

4430
02:34:33,800 --> 02:34:35,800
I love that feeling when you think the game

4431
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:37,800
is breaking and then you realize oh that's just a mechanic

4432
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,800
yeah that's a great feeling

4433
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:43,800
that's what

4434
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:45,800
that's what eternal darkness does on purpose

4435
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:51,800
you have the sanity mechanic

4436
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:53,800
and as you lose sanity

4437
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:55,800
the game tries to trick you into thinking

4438
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:57,800
more games haven't ripped off the sanity meter

4439
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:59,800
but I guess it's like a trick that doesn't you know

4440
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:01,800
it only really works when it's novel

4441
02:35:01,800 --> 02:35:03,800
and fresh you know what I mean

4442
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:05,800
I don't think many people remember eternal darkness

4443
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:07,800
it's like mainstream

4444
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:09,800
right you know I don't know what that is

4445
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,800
not anymore

4446
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,800
everyone's practically forgotten about it

4447
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:15,800
now but it was a

4448
02:35:15,800 --> 02:35:17,800
pretty interesting mechanic

4449
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:21,800
the end

4450
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:23,800
so fucked up the end

4451
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:25,800
thanks for listening

4452
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:27,800
that's the end of the procrastinator's podcast

4453
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:29,800
it's voicemails

4454
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,800
do you have enough time left on your recording for voicemails

4455
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:33,800
oh no I cleared some data

4456
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:35,800
I cleared some data I'm good

4457
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:37,800
I have space for 17 more hours

4458
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:39,800
and I intend to go

4459
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:41,800

4460
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:43,800

4461
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:45,800
I have space for 52 more hours

4462
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:47,800
I don't know I can keep going

4463
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:49,800

02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:51,800

4465
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,800

4466
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:55,800
Ben just deleted all of his game files

4467
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:57,800
if anything I do placate it

4468
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:01,800
let's see

4469
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:03,800

4473
02:36:09,800 --> 02:36:11,800

4474
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:13,800

I'm in the wrong channel

4481
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,800
I'm looking at the wrong channel

4482
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:29,800

4483
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:31,800

02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:39,800
even though the lord of ghosts kickstarter

4487
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:41,800
is already funded I keep coming back

4488
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:43,800
to the page just to rewatch

4489
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,800
the like trailer announcement video

4490
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:47,800
thing because it's so good

4491
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:49,800
it's so funny

4492
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:51,800
it's evergreen even though it is

4493
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:53,800
about a limited time event

4494
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:55,800
the video alone

4495
02:36:55,800 --> 02:36:57,800
is worth the money that I pledged

4496
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:59,800
thank you gib for making

4497
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:01,800
for being epic

4498
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,800
you're welcome

4499
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:05,800
it's a funny video I love the

4500
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:07,800
sports theme

4501
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:09,800
I saw tim and eric live once they did it

4502
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:11,800
sports live it was cute

4503
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:13,800
I have not seen it just think it comes from

4504
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:15,800
that reminds me of

4505
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:17,800
when John and Aaron used to do

4506
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:19,800
those videos advertising

4507
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:21,800
when they're going to do

4508
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:23,800
some kind of new content

4509
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:25,800
and sometimes those videos were funnier

4510
02:37:25,800 --> 02:37:27,800
than the actual things they were doing

4511
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:29,800
or advertising

4512
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:31,800
yeah I used to like the skits

4513
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:33,800
for like oh crunchyroll subscription

4514
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:35,800
or a new t-shirt

4515
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:37,800
and they that was

4516
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:39,800
those were good

4517
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:41,800
I definitely wanted that video to be

4518
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:43,800
like I remember

4519
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:45,800
the punk plush kickstarter where I

4520
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:47,800
was just sort of explaining what it was

4521
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:49,800
in front of a camera

4522
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:51,800
and I don't think I think that was

4523
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,800
kind of lame

4524
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:55,800
I wanted this one to be like memorable and fun

4525
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,800
and cool and people like oh

4526
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:59,800
I'm excited about this now

4527
02:37:59,800 --> 02:38:01,800
I did it I think

4528
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:03,800
better to do something that like

4529
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:05,800
gets the energy across

4530
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,800
than to do something that just like

4531
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,800
explains what it is but without like

4532
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:11,800
you know

4533
02:38:11,800 --> 02:38:13,800
an impact

4534
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:15,800
yeah making the impact is the important

4535
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:17,800
thing

4536
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:19,800
explaining things in front of a camera that's a

4537
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:21,800
very tricksy move

4538
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:23,800
I mean it's normal

4539
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:25,800
it's a normal thing

4540
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:27,800
to do

4541
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:29,800
ranting about

4542
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:31,800
the lord of the ghost kickstarter

4543
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:33,800
yes

4544
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:35,800

is called

2 1 go

4551
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:49,800

is set no more setbacks

4553
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:53,800
no more regret it seems

4554
02:38:53,800 --> 02:38:55,800
I've come up with a perfect plan

4555
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:57,800
I'll tie my artistic brand to Christian

4556
02:38:57,800 --> 02:38:59,800

02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:01,800

02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:03,800

02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:11,800
a canon end for this tale of strife

4563
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:13,800
I just can't stop merging

4564
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:15,800

I enjoy it

4568
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:23,800
I enjoy it

4569
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:25,800
I think we can all find that

4570
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:27,800
relatable who among us hasn't

4571
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:29,800
you just got merged on

4572
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:31,800
in this kind of situation

4573
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:33,800
who here hasn't done a lecture on chris

4574
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:35,800
who here hasn't invariably

4575
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:37,800
tied their brand to chris chan

4576
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:39,800
at some point or another

4577
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:41,800
who hasn't merged their canons

4578
02:39:41,800 --> 02:39:43,800
together

4579
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:45,800
into a strange bizarre

4580
02:39:45,800 --> 02:39:47,800
crossover story of

4581
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:49,800
things nobody has ever heard of

4582
02:39:49,800 --> 02:39:51,800
not I

4583
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,800
okay

4584
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:55,800
the next voicemail is called

4585
02:39:57,800 --> 02:39:59,800
an elegy for a fallen hero

4586
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:05,800
an elegy

4587
02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:07,800
but the next one says ignore the previous one

4588
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:09,800
but I'm not going to ignore the previous one

4589
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,800
elegy for a fallen hero

4590
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:13,800
3, 2, 1, go

4591
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:17,800
it was a battle of the pcp

4592
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:23,800
maybe you watch

4593
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:25,800
what he took of me

4594
02:40:29,800 --> 02:40:31,800
no matter how I try

4595
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:33,800
I could not break free

4596
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:39,800
and he maybe eased his slasps

4597
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:41,800
I think this is a resend

4598
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:43,800
yeah maybe they accidentally

4599
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:45,800
posted this one but it was good still

4600
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:47,800
it's good

4601
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:49,800
even the voicemails you accidentally resend

4602
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:51,800
are getting played on the podcast

4603
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:53,800

02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:55,800

4609
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:15,800
how they told us

4610
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:17,800
what they had been

4611
02:41:17,800 --> 02:41:19,800
and when they creamed

4612
02:41:21,800 --> 02:41:23,800
I do

4613
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:25,800

4614
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:45,800

4618
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,800
that was

4619
02:42:21,800 --> 02:42:23,800
that was the first good voicemail to be over

4620
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:25,800
one minute long

4621
02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:27,800
I think he did it

4622
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:29,800
I think he did the impossible

4623
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:31,800
it made a good long voicemail

4624
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:33,800
you should redo the whole

4625
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,800
of the wall

4626
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:37,800
with pcp memes

4627
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:39,800
definitely do that

4628
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:41,800
please

4629
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:43,800
if you can make something like this

4630
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:45,800
why would you send it in as a voicemail

4631
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:47,800
yeah

4632
02:42:47,800 --> 02:42:49,800
the juxtaposition of

4633
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,800
putting an effort post into

4634
02:42:51,800 --> 02:42:53,800
a shitty voicemail

4635
02:42:53,800 --> 02:42:55,800
to get played 2 and a half hours deep

4636
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:57,800
into some podcast

4637
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,800
that's the appeal

4638
02:42:59,800 --> 02:43:01,800
that is its own reward

4639
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:03,800
next voicemail

4640
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:05,800
is called son of marowak

4641
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:07,800
3, 2, 1, go

4642
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:13,800
son of marowak

4643
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:15,800
so I just got back from odicon

4644
02:43:15,800 --> 02:43:17,800
participated in the art show

4645
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:19,800
people bid for items at an auction

4646
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:21,800
online auction

4647
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:23,800
the odicon

4648
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:25,800
art stuff was asking for a lot of hentai

4649
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:27,800
we only had about 10 pieces

4650
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:29,800
this year

4651
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:31,800
usually it's pretty small

4652
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:33,800
but I'm determined

4653
02:43:33,800 --> 02:43:35,800
for the next year until the next odicon

4654
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:37,800
I'm going to submit at least 20 to 40

4655
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:39,800
pieces of hentai

4656
02:43:39,800 --> 02:43:41,800
it's going to be monster girls

4657
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:43,800
I'll let you know how it goes

4658
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:45,800
submit them for what

4659
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:47,800
is it an art show

4660
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:49,800
I don't understand

4661
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:51,800
I thought he was talking about the vendor hall

4662
02:43:51,800 --> 02:43:53,800
was he talking about selling them

4663
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:55,800
you can never have enough hentai

4664
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:57,800
I do not know

4665
02:43:57,800 --> 02:43:59,800
the mechanics of odicon

4666
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:01,800
I'm sorry

4667
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:03,800
what they're being submitted for

4668
02:44:03,800 --> 02:44:05,800
but I mean good luck

4669
02:44:05,800 --> 02:44:07,800
if he's a son of marowak

4670
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:09,800
he's a cubon

4671
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:11,800
he's not just a cubon

4672
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:13,800
he's a special cubon

4673
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:15,800
I drew him on the radcon 4 poster

4674
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:17,800
he's got a whole backstory

4675
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:19,800
he wears a hoodie

4676
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:21,800
he's a cubon with a hoodie

4677
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:23,800
and he's got a special

4678
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:25,800
you don't have to go on it

4679
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:27,800
I was already sold on the hoodie

4680
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:29,800
say no more

4681
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:31,800
what if a cubon had a hoodie

4682
02:44:31,800 --> 02:44:33,800
also did you know that

4683
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:35,800
Ethan Ralph was at odicon

4684
02:44:35,800 --> 02:44:37,800
I did

4685
02:44:37,800 --> 02:44:39,800
someone did say that

4686
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:41,800
may drag Ethan Ralph to odicon

4687
02:44:41,800 --> 02:44:43,800
which sounds so awkward

4688
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:45,800
I just can't imagine

4689
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,800
I just

4690
02:44:47,800 --> 02:44:49,800
sounds like there's going to be some fights

4691
02:44:49,800 --> 02:44:51,800
sounds like there's going to get in fights

4692
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:53,800
you missed a great opportunity

4693
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:55,800
to go have a fist fight with Ethan Ralph

4694
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:57,800
and upload the video to your channel

4695
02:44:57,800 --> 02:44:59,800
I could have done it

4696
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:01,800
you missed out on some primo content

4697
02:45:01,800 --> 02:45:03,800
you left it on the table

4698
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:05,800
I did

4699
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:07,800
that's wasted content

4700
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:09,800
the worst wasted content is the content

4701
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:11,800
that never even happened

4702
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:13,800
that could have been recorded

4703
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:15,800
think of all the boxing matches

4704
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,800
that aren't currently going on between YouTubers

4705
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:19,800
think of everyone

4706
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:21,800
in the world

4707
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:23,800
who isn't punching someone right now

4708
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:25,800
think of how many hundreds of boxing matches

4709
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:27,800
that you're not participating in right now

4710
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:29,800
you should be ashamed of yourself

4711
02:45:29,800 --> 02:45:31,800
it boggles

4712
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:33,800
you need to get swollen

4713
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:35,800
and start challenging

4714
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,800
all the content creators to boxing matches

4715
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:39,800
all the content creators you hate

4716
02:45:41,800 --> 02:45:43,800
I mean

4717
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:45,800
that's one way to get my

4718
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:47,800
revenge

4719
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:49,800
on this world, on this bitch of an earth

4720
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:51,800
the next voicemail

4721
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:53,800
is called

4722
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:55,800
Mordecai Saint

4723
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:57,800
3, 2, 1, go

4724
02:45:57,800 --> 02:45:59,800
Ben Saint

4725
02:45:59,800 --> 02:46:01,800
is just Mordecai

4726
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:03,800
from regular show

4727
02:46:03,800 --> 02:46:05,800
I will not be elaborating

4728
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:07,800
cause he fucks horses

4729
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:09,800
cause I, yeah

4730
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:11,800
cause I fucked Twilight

4731
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:13,800
child is in the new generation

4732
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:15,800
is that a good show

4733
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:17,800
regular show?

4734
02:46:17,800 --> 02:46:19,800
it looks like adventure time

4735
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:21,800
but it doesn't have adventure in it

4736
02:46:21,800 --> 02:46:23,800
that's literally why I watched it

4737
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:25,800
I was a big fan of adventure time

4738
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:27,800
similar right? and I watched the first season or two

4739
02:46:27,800 --> 02:46:29,800
and it is good

4740
02:46:29,800 --> 02:46:31,800
but it's sort of a slice of life

4741
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:33,800
shit happens

4742
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:35,800
sometimes the funny shit happens

4743
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:37,800
they had an episode making fun of Billy Mitchell

4744
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:39,800
I've seen some pretty good shit

4745
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:41,800
I like that it's just about some guys

4746
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:43,800
working at a job

4747
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:45,800
I really like the premise

4748
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:47,800
and find them being groundskeepers

4749
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:49,800
at a park

4750
02:46:49,800 --> 02:46:51,800
you ever see 4 in the ampm

4751
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:53,800
the student film by the guy

4752
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:55,800
he's good

4753
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:57,800
he takes acid and he's tripping

4754
02:46:57,800 --> 02:46:59,800
he turns in the character from a regular show

4755
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:01,800
that's just his regular voice

4756
02:47:01,800 --> 02:47:03,800
his Mordecai voice

4757
02:47:03,800 --> 02:47:05,800
J.G. Quendall

4758
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:07,800
he's the creator of the show

4759
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:09,800
cause you watch his new show

4760
02:47:09,800 --> 02:47:11,800
he's the exact same voice

4761
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:13,800
yeah he's a new show on HBO Max

4762
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,800
I think about being a dad guy

4763
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:17,800
I hate it

4764
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:19,800
I hate it

4765
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:21,800
we were bitching together about

4766
02:47:21,800 --> 02:47:23,800
Brad Neely's new show

4767
02:47:23,800 --> 02:47:25,800
I'm not gonna say it's bad

4768
02:47:25,800 --> 02:47:27,800
but just based on the trailer

4769
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:29,800
it didn't look interesting

4770
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:31,800
it's another family show

4771
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:33,800
the last thing the world needs is another show

4772
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:35,800
about being a parent

4773
02:47:35,800 --> 02:47:37,800
adult animation cartoon

4774
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:39,800
that looks kind of like family guy

4775
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:41,800
and it's about

4776
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:43,800
the only reason

4777
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:45,800
I'll give it a shot

4778
02:47:45,800 --> 02:47:47,800
because I like Brad Neely

4779
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:49,800
he's made some amazing shit

4780
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:51,800
I like China the way the show

4781
02:47:51,800 --> 02:47:53,800
but the funniest thing about it

4782
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:55,800
is Professor Bros.

4783
02:47:55,800 --> 02:47:57,800
the YouTube videos are just better

4784
02:47:57,800 --> 02:47:59,800
I don't even want to be mean about it

4785
02:47:59,800 --> 02:48:01,800
but they're just so funny

4786
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:03,800
I watched some of the show

4787
02:48:03,800 --> 02:48:05,800
and it was okay

4788
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:07,800
it doesn't even need the animation

4789
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:09,800
somehow it works perfectly

4790
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:11,800
when it's just comic panels in sequence

4791
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:13,800
somehow it just works perfectly with that style

4792
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:15,800
bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

4793
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:17,800
bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

4794
02:48:17,800 --> 02:48:19,800
oh my god

4795
02:48:19,800 --> 02:48:21,800
it's so weird

4796
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:23,800
it's like baby cakes and the Professor Bros.

4797
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:25,800
are just such memorable amazing characters

4798
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:27,800
I don't know

4799
02:48:27,800 --> 02:48:29,800
they don't really come across

4800
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:31,800
they don't really come across that

4801
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:33,800
they still have their personality in the show

4802
02:48:33,800 --> 02:48:35,800
but I don't think they come across as well

4803
02:48:35,800 --> 02:48:37,800
it's just fundamentally

4804
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:39,800
is different and feels different on

4805
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:41,800
aspect of it being an actual show

4806
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:47,080
And I'm not even like mad or anything, but just like a part of me. I can't help but prefer the original YouTube videos

4807
02:48:47,480 --> 02:48:49,880
Yeah, I don't know. It was a

4808
02:48:50,840 --> 02:48:52,840
Just just it's like Carson's

4809
02:48:53,320 --> 02:48:56,360
Carsonization like every every evolutionary line eventually

4810
02:48:56,920 --> 02:49:02,440
Takes on a crab-like form because it's just the most effective shape and similarly every

4811
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:07,800
Eventually finds itself working on an adult animated cartoon about being a dad or whatever

4812
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:16,760
So we desperately need more family animated shows obviously so funny like Simpsons and Family Guy are both still airing new episodes

4813
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:18,600
Yeah, they are

4814
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:20,600
They never stopped

4815
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:23,960
Uh, okay next

4816
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:30,360
Uh, was that the one we just listened to? Yeah, Mordecai. That's right. Um, next one is called

4817
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:34,840
Oh, the next one is an image. So here's here's the image. I haven't looked at it

4818
02:49:35,560 --> 02:49:37,560
Oh, there it is

4819
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:41,320
I hate the anti-christ

4820
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:43,880
We've got you surrounded

4821
02:49:44,600 --> 02:49:46,600
That's it's the name of the Nerf gun

4822
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:52,120
It's this name that I still don't really get it's the Nerf gun from the the the fucking ragcon three

4823
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:54,760
arena ragcon three good attention

4824
02:49:55,560 --> 02:50:00,840
That's a nice deep cut. Azumi has one has one arm. So big crimp. Yeah, but that's okay

4825
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:02,280
Oh

4826
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:08,840
This is before the accident. She lost the irs. Oh, fuck back story confirmed. It was the irs

4827
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,960
Right the irs chopped her arm off

4828
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:16,360
Well, nobody like they'll do that in real life if you get behind on your payments

4829
02:50:16,360 --> 02:50:20,280
They will come cut your arm off like a samurai. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's true

4830
02:50:20,600 --> 02:50:23,720
Is the anti-christ in the rebel pixels like grain red

4831
02:50:24,760 --> 02:50:30,040
You know, well, I see it's got the irs highlighted. Oh, yeah, I noticed that I didn't realize but yeah

4832
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:32,760
Yeah, you're right. That is like the that color schema

4833
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:37,400
I don't know like

4834
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:42,520
Yes, I guess I agree. I will say I guess I agree with this image. Tom is insane. I've definitely made

4835
02:50:43,400 --> 02:50:47,160
The repo time in my life just just today honestly

4836
02:50:48,520 --> 02:50:50,520
So that's pretty true

4837
02:50:52,200 --> 02:50:57,560
Relatable base to make a to be fair. I'm not a ton of debt. I'm just in student debt, but who is

4838
02:50:58,520 --> 02:51:03,480
Mmm smart people many you didn't get your student debt canceled. No

4839
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:06,520
Biden Biden

4840
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:15,000
Well rich people are in debt all the time rich people take on more debt

4841
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,040
You can't make money without being in a shitload of debt

4842
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:23,000
That's what sam sam hide told me that actually max out all your credit cards

4843
02:51:23,320 --> 02:51:29,080
Rich people just borrow just they just keep borrowing more and more money and never pay it back and like whatever

4844
02:51:29,560 --> 02:51:30,760
What are they gonna do?

4845
02:51:30,760 --> 02:51:35,880
The gold knife is just to make as much debt as you possibly can rack up as much debt as you can and then die and leave it all

4846
02:51:35,880 --> 02:51:36,680
to your kids

4847
02:51:36,680 --> 02:51:41,240
Wasn't there like a greek philosopher or someone who was constantly like in debt to everyone?

4848
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:44,680
But he was like, yeah, it's great because when when you owe other people money

4849
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:49,080
They're always trying to like hook you up with like connections that like will make you money

4850
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,240
Making money and like they don't want to see you debt

4851
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:56,040
They have a vested interest in you sticking around because yeah, you get in debt to everyone

4852
02:51:56,040 --> 02:52:01,960
And they're all like they're all like pulling for you and like like like on your team now because they need you to succeed

4853
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:07,720
Well, I certainly certainly seems to work for the us because I think the us isn't like

4854
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:12,040
27 trillion dollars insane amount of debt. That's like good though

4855
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:18,360
National debt is like good for some reason right that's what they can't just nuke us because they have to collect

4856
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:20,440
They're dead first

4857
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:24,120
Yeah, they'll just repossess our country when we can't pay it

4858
02:52:24,840 --> 02:52:27,960
Oh, that's fine. I'll be dead by then the zoomers can deal with that

4859
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:33,400
I'm already adopting the boomer mindset of just all okay. It's fine. I'm just ruin everything and die

4860
02:52:33,480 --> 02:52:35,480
They make so much more sense now that I'm getting older

4861
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:41,560
Why solve the problems we create? Uh, it's too late to fix things might as well just not do anything

4862
02:52:42,680 --> 02:52:45,400
Yeah, just pass everything on to the next generation

4863
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:50,440
The next voicemail is called

4864
02:52:51,320 --> 02:52:55,400
Um, it is called a worst idea ever. She they

4865
02:52:56,120 --> 02:52:58,120
three two one go

4866
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:04,680
So when discussing how older games have soul while newer games often don't Nate said this on his gamer zone podcast

4867
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,240
People argue about that word soul so often one day. I want to make a video defining

4868
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:14,680
And it really struck me this is the quintessential example of something that is both the worst idea

4869
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:17,560
He's ever had and also the most best guy ever idea

4870
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:22,520
He's ever had and I finally fully grasp how those two things are directly correlated with each other

4871
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:25,720
I see okay

4872
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:31,240
You know, I I listened to that a gamer zone podcast and uh, I I left a comment

4873
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:37,240
I really thought that everyone involved with that project was should just be ashamed of themselves

4874
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:40,680
I uh, I feel like it's the new hot thing. I feel like the pcp

4875
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:45,320
That's gonna be on the way out and everybody should drop and start pledging to the gamer zone podcast

4876
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:50,600
Which doesn't or doesn't even exist doesn't even have a patreon. Um, what can I say? I never say no to a podcast appearance

4877
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:52,680
I'm here now aren't I?

4878
02:53:53,800 --> 02:53:56,360
The standards are the bottom bottom floor

4879
02:53:57,240 --> 02:54:03,720
I uh, I don't worry. I'll I'll sneak in plenty of um, I'll be sneaking in plenty of pcp references that and like

4880
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:07,000
I'll be mind fucking Nate's audience tricking them. It's coming back

4881
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:11,960
Nate uh, like oh my god, I've never heard like have you

4882
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:19,400
The Nate Nate fans will be blindsided to know that he was once on a podcast. What Nate podcast what?

4883
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:21,560
um, um

4884
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:28,680
So I don't know if this is the person I'm thinking of but I saw someone in the comments of the gamer zone making a comment about

4885
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:33,400
Soul and being irritated that like Nate describes things as having soul

4886
02:54:34,040 --> 02:54:40,200
And being like that's so vague and it's literally just something you can say you like anything you like you can just say it has soul

4887
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:45,320
Yeah, that's right. Everything I like is good wherever you want it and everything that's bad and new is soulless

4888
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:47,400
That's just the way the world works and I like yeah

4889
02:54:47,960 --> 02:54:49,960
I guess yeah, it is. Um, I mean

4890
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:56,120
I mean it's sort of an extension of just saying like if if it's good if if I like it then it's good

4891
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:59,560
And if I don't like it basically yes, but like describing the words to that

4892
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:03,640
To imply that there's more is that Nate could just make make a 50 minute video

4893
02:55:03,640 --> 02:55:06,840
That's just like like this is what it means to have a soul and first of all

4894
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:11,560
Let's take a look at the first game to involve souls undertale. It's like a look here

4895
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:14,920
They invented it

4896
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:21,240
My take on soulfulness really quick is like I feel soul what it means is like you can tell the people working on the game

4897
02:55:21,240 --> 02:55:23,640
Like liked it and they tried they were trying to make a good game

4898
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:29,960
They weren't just trying to make a quick book again. I know that's not something you can just quantify but like there's it's some

4899
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:32,360
slight difference between

4900
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:34,360
soul versus like me likey thing

4901
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:38,600
It basically isn't there basically is no difference between that but like I think it's sort of it's like

4902
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:43,160
Knowing that people are getting a sense at least that people cared about the product

4903
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:51,160
They were making is a feeling that affects your opinion of the game in some way that is that the game itself

4904
02:55:51,480 --> 02:55:54,120
Doesn't really have anything to do with it's just sort of like right

4905
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:58,760
You just feel happier thinking about the fact that people put their heart and soul

4906
02:55:59,160 --> 02:56:04,600
Into a product. I always thought it was less corporate therefore you like it more for no real reason

4907
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:08,920
But I just thought a soul basically means personality when something has a lot of

4908
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:13,240
Personality to it. I think it it definitely doesn't have like one set meaning

4909
02:56:13,320 --> 02:56:17,720
So this is sort of just what our takes on it are and I feel like both of those takes are pretty accurate in terms of just

4910
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:20,120
As opposed to something that is a homogenized

4911
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:25,880
Because like for example, you can you can look at the new super mario bros games that everybody hates

4912
02:56:26,520 --> 02:56:31,080
And uh, you can say those games kind of lack personality and therefore soul

4913
02:56:31,560 --> 02:56:35,880
But then you look at mario world and mario bros 3 and 2

4914
02:56:36,520 --> 02:56:38,760
And those games have a lot more personality

4915
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:44,440
See the thing is it's not a very useful term to use and I I don't use it myself

4916
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:46,920
When somebody does use it, I know what they're getting at

4917
02:56:47,320 --> 02:56:52,840
Generally speaking, it's a little bit of a fortune. It's kind of unquantifiable because it really does what uses it

4918
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:55,400
It relies a lot on

4919
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:58,600
Your perception and if you have nostalgia or not that

4920
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:04,600
Influences whether you think there's soul in a product, right two examples of uh games

4921
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:07,480
I think are soulful it's like sonic adventure is a soulful game

4922
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:13,480
That's not necessarily always good, but it like it feels like they had fun making it and they were trying really hard

4923
02:57:13,560 --> 02:57:17,800
And they were like trying to make a good game. That's why it's like crammed full of ideas even if they don't all work

4924
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:22,920
I feel like another example of a soulful game is earthbound because it was made by an auteur and it wasn't like

4925
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:24,920
Yeah, I was gonna say trying to be

4926
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:28,520
Earthbound is quirky and stuff, but it's not like trying to be a quirky in the rpg

4927
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:32,840
It was just trying to be like itoy just made this game based off of like his life experiences and stuff

4928
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:35,880
You know what I mean? Like it's I don't know it's hard to explain

4929
02:57:35,960 --> 02:57:39,560
It really is hard to explain and it's not something you can easily quantify and a lot of it just does come down

4930
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:41,080
How do you personally feel about a game?

4931
02:57:41,080 --> 02:57:47,720
It's like if you if you look at uh a typical ubisoft like open world

4932
02:57:49,160 --> 02:57:53,160
Kind of shooting game you can kind of tell that that doesn't have much salt to it

4933
02:57:53,160 --> 02:57:58,840
It's almost easier to point to the soullessness than soulfulness. Yeah, it's just a pure corporate production

4934
02:57:59,320 --> 02:58:02,280
People just have to make it and they have to make a million of them

4935
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:08,920
Okay, but I think it's possible for a corporate entity to make a game

4936
02:58:09,240 --> 02:58:11,240
Yeah feels like it does have soul

4937
02:58:11,400 --> 02:58:17,080
You're absolutely right like a shitload of art throughout human history has been commissioned, you know by like, you know

4938
02:58:17,320 --> 02:58:21,480
Not not not just corporations, but like, you know wealthy, you know patrons of the arts and like the

4939
02:58:22,040 --> 02:58:24,280
You know the renaissance and stuff like a lot of art

4940
02:58:24,760 --> 02:58:26,760
I wish art could just exist spontaneously

4941
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:31,240
You know without having to be you know fit within the monetary framework of reality

4942
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,280
But you know

4943
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:35,320
It doesn't so yeah a lot of good art can come from a corporate shit too

4944
02:58:35,480 --> 02:58:39,480
But like there is still element of soullessness and homogeneity that you can see and identify

4945
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:44,760
Well, a corporation has to hire artists and artists might care about the work they're doing

4946
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:46,520
right

4947
02:58:46,520 --> 02:58:50,280
Yeah, it's really kind of a useless metric by wish to judge a game

4948
02:58:51,080 --> 02:58:52,760
um

4949
02:58:52,760 --> 02:58:57,080
Like it whether or not it's like you think it's has soul or it doesn't

4950
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:00,920
The game is the same and if it's made corporately

4951
02:59:01,640 --> 02:59:05,560
Uh or like artistically the end product is the only thing you're experiencing

4952
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:09,480
You don't really know and that can't possibly influence

4953
02:59:10,760 --> 02:59:12,760
Anything right like you know

4954
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:19,880
It's just the the end product is the thing that you end up experiencing and the the soul is just added on on top of your own

4955
02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:23,960
Yeah, it's what you're extrapolating backwards based on what you think happened during game development

4956
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:29,000
Which is again like you will have a different opinion of how soulful a game is if you were there for the entire process of making it

4957
02:59:29,080 --> 02:59:31,320
Which obviously, you know, you can't be for that's true

4958
02:59:31,880 --> 02:59:37,880
When you when you say it has soul you're saying that it feels as though someone put a lot of work and love into it

4959
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:41,240
And maybe they did or maybe they didn't but like you don't you don't know at the end of the day

4960
02:59:41,320 --> 02:59:45,320
You're you're just saying it feels like they did and that's good at the end of the day

4961
02:59:45,320 --> 02:59:48,040
It is a nebulous term. It doesn't really have much

4962
02:59:48,920 --> 02:59:54,200
Or not narrative doesn't have much like analytical value because it's so unquantifiable

4963
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:59,000
It's better to like if you feel like something has soul, it's better to kind of extrapolate

4964
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:04,760
What about it is resonating with you that way emotionally you can you can be like I feel like it has soul

4965
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:08,680
But you got to explain like what okay, what what about it makes you say

4966
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:15,320
If it resonates with you and an emotional level like that and you're trying to make an analytical point or trying to like

4967
03:00:15,720 --> 03:00:20,760
Explain what that means you have to then extrapolate into something much more concrete

4968
03:00:21,080 --> 03:00:25,000
So someone else can understand why what you're coming from just defining soul

4969
03:00:25,880 --> 03:00:32,120
Will not solve the problem. You're defining your feelings. You could just double down on on the feeling aspect and just say

4970
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:35,960
There's just something unquantifiable about this that I just really love and I don't

4971
03:00:37,080 --> 03:00:42,120
I don't think Nate would accept that if someone else. Yeah, that's that's what I was just saying either way like you can't

4972
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:45,320
Either way it all comes down to the specific thing what like it was a specific game

4973
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:48,520
I think it's all four or not it's hard to do this is in the abstract make a video

4974
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:51,240
That's just about soul. You know what I mean like that would be really

4975
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:54,760
I like to list specific examples like

4976
03:00:55,640 --> 03:01:00,200
In earthbound there's an enemy called mad duck and one of his attacks

4977
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:04,680
I forget what it does, but one of his attacks is to spin something around

4978
03:01:05,640 --> 03:01:09,240
Which like confuses you or whatever and it doesn't tell you what he spins around

4979
03:01:09,320 --> 03:01:13,320
He just spins something around, you know the dialogue says that

4980
03:01:13,880 --> 03:01:17,560
So it's little things like that that are sprinkled throughout the game that I think

4981
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:22,040
Adds personality and you could say it's uh, it's soul

4982
03:01:23,720 --> 03:01:28,680
I can I can imagine though a game where like the developer really cared about what they were making

4983
03:01:29,160 --> 03:01:34,840
And they really put a lot of themselves into it and they worked really hard and they poured love and time and energy into making

4984
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:37,480
Exactly the product that they wanted to make

4985
03:01:37,960 --> 03:01:41,400
But like it's bad and it's something that you hate and you don't like it. Yeah

4986
03:01:42,040 --> 03:01:44,040
What what it's still

4987
03:01:44,520 --> 03:01:46,040
That can certainly happen

4988
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:50,600
What it's was it is it still I guess that you'd still yeah, it's it's soulful, but it's not good

4989
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:54,200
I I guess that would make I guess that can exist. It's gonna be pretty rare

4990
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:57,480
You'd see people say shit like that, but I mean like I guess you're right

4991
03:01:57,640 --> 03:02:03,160
Actually, I think a good example of that is uh, what was that game called a deadly premonition? I think

4992
03:02:03,960 --> 03:02:08,360
Well, most of the time when you're saying, oh, it's soulful and you say why and then you oh, well, you know

4993
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:11,240
Here's some here's a detail that I like here's a story

4994
03:02:11,320 --> 03:02:17,000
That's a that's a game that uh is kind of bad, but a lot of people loved it. Yeah, it's like a

4995
03:02:17,560 --> 03:02:18,520
game

4996
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:21,640
It's people love it in spite of the fact that it's kind of a hotness

4997
03:02:22,840 --> 03:02:24,040
Hmm

4998
03:02:24,040 --> 03:02:31,000
Yeah, but that's because uh, it was clear the the developer put a lot of love into it even though it's kind of bad

4999
03:02:32,760 --> 03:02:35,560
I'm thinking of uh, I'm thinking of limbo of the lost

5000
03:02:36,520 --> 03:02:38,520
as a soul a soulful

5001
03:02:38,680 --> 03:02:41,560
Game with a lot of a personality that's just piece of shit

5002
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:45,720
Game, yeah, you know, you know that one right the uh the one with uh

5003
03:02:46,360 --> 03:02:48,360
The one that's the box art, right?

5004
03:02:49,080 --> 03:02:54,760
The I don't know the box. It's the one that ends with the the king limbo song

5005
03:02:55,240 --> 03:03:00,120
Uh, oh, yeah, it's not the box. I'm thinking of it's uh, but yeah, um mandalore gaming had a good video on this

5006
03:03:00,200 --> 03:03:05,000
Which is how yeah, yeah, it's a good bad game. This is again. I had like lots of blood ledgerism and didn't it

5007
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:07,560
Yeah

5008
03:03:07,880 --> 03:03:10,760
Stuff just in it. They just stole assets from skyrim

5009
03:03:11,800 --> 03:03:15,480
Uh, nothing nothing says soul more than stealing assets

5010
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:19,560
Well, okay, they stole a lot of stuff

5011
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:26,680
But the stuff that they did is original is very weird and very like unique. Um, I mean an a tour made this

5012
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:29,080
I don't agree with some of the vision assets

5013
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:34,360
But like that doesn't necessarily preclude something from being soulful like barkley shut up in jam

5014
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:39,880
Guiding it has a lot of stolen assets, but like that's part of the joke like that's intentional. It's not like they're it was

5015
03:03:39,960 --> 03:03:45,720
That's uh, that's almost like a a rom hack from back in the days when people used to do rom hacks and

5016
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:48,360
that kind of thing

5017
03:03:48,360 --> 03:03:54,520
Something useful about rom hacks in general just the way that it's like such a purely fan driven out of love

5018
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:58,520
Not for a problem. A rom hack is uh, when you think about it, it's kind of like a fanfic

5019
03:04:00,360 --> 03:04:01,960
Just uh from a

5020
03:04:02,040 --> 03:04:03,960
Programming standpoint, right?

5021
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:07,800
Basically every good programmer got their start like modding some other game, you know what I mean?

5022
03:04:07,880 --> 03:04:09,880
Well, not like every good programmer, but you know a lot of

5023
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:15,560
I think that's uh, that's a case for a christian whitehead who made sonic mania

5024
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:21,960
Yeah, a lot of the modern sonic mania team in particular is basically made up of fans from the rom hacking scene, which is pretty cool

5025
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:24,920
Um

5026
03:04:24,920 --> 03:04:29,880
I think I think we can go to the next voicemail. Oh, yeah, I forgot that that was all just soul

5027
03:04:30,040 --> 03:04:34,840
So we basically made Nate's video for him. We just talked about it for 15 minutes about yeah

5028
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:39,880
But he can't if he just clips our audio and makes that video. He's got to pay for it

5029
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:43,400
Wouldn't be a very soulful explanation

5030
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:47,000
This clip so it else's podcast here's my video

5031
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:54,760
Then the next voicemail is called, uh, it's called nothing can stop me. No, there is nothing that can stop me now

5032
03:04:55,080 --> 03:04:57,080
Uh, sorry, it's it's loading

5033
03:04:57,080 --> 03:05:00,120
There it is. Okay, three two one go

5034
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:08,680
None of you can stop my evil machinations from coming at your fruition. None of you can stop my

5035
03:05:09,400 --> 03:05:11,400
history plans

5036
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:15,880
And underneath the table of justice. I reside

5037
03:05:16,760 --> 03:05:17,800
sticking

5038
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:19,800
sticky six of gum

5039
03:05:20,600 --> 03:05:23,000
under the table and which I

5040
03:05:23,800 --> 03:05:27,800
I reside which I will reign supreme

5041
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:30,840
Sir, you may lift the table up

5042
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:37,480
But I will win as soon as the table turns you have flipped the tables yourself leaving me

5043
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:41,800
That victor sure you can punch me in the face

5044
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:48,120
But I have a face mask that can block exactly one punch

5045
03:05:48,440 --> 03:05:50,440
He thought of everything

5046
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:56,600
What can you do? Why can't you say there is nothing that can't stop me now?

5047
03:05:58,600 --> 03:06:01,320
I like imagining that he recorded that under the table

5048
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:05,640
Where he was sticking during class the tables sure have turned

5049
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:15,560
Well, I'm intimidated sounds like he won and I feel like there's nothing we can do about it other than admit defeat a big

5050
03:06:15,880 --> 03:06:18,040
w for that guy who

5051
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:26,280
Uh, I don't know. I don't remember being under the table guy under the table guy is uh, he's he's thought of everything

5052
03:06:26,440 --> 03:06:29,320
Uh, next voicemail is called

5053
03:06:30,200 --> 03:06:34,840

Hold on. Let me put it in the dang chat. Okay, there it is three two one go

5067
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:58,280
Hello, how are you today? I am chewing gum in your ear. What? No, I am a real person

5068
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:03,960
Can we continue? This is the asmr you ordered

5069
03:08:05,480 --> 03:08:08,040
I am a real person. Did you hear me okay?

5070
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:16,600
This is a bar package was ordered by Nate on october 19th 2017

5071
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:19,160
Yes, I'm a real person

5072
03:08:19,320 --> 03:08:25,720
There is a live person here. We're sorry for the delayed shipping. Who's the real person? I am a real person. Oh

5073
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:28,440
I am a real person

5074
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:30,760
God

5075
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:32,120
Is that it?

5076
03:08:32,120 --> 03:08:35,720
Okay, that was good fine. Well, that was great whatever that was

5077
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:39,640
We did they were a real person. They obviously

5078
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:45,000
I mean that was never in question. That's what real people do is insist how real they are over and over again

5079
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:47,080
I I am a real person

5080
03:08:47,080 --> 03:08:49,640
You see this is what is known as performance art

5081
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:55,880
Your question about whether I'm real has already been answered by my statements

5082
03:08:56,520 --> 03:08:58,840
About that. I am real, uh, actually

5083
03:08:59,480 --> 03:09:04,520
Uh, next one is called one upping. Sorry. It's bad. Uh, she her

5084
03:09:05,480 --> 03:09:10,280
Here did I already put it in the yeah, there it is. Okay, three two one go

5085
03:09:12,120 --> 03:09:16,440
All right, so a little bit towards the end of the episode of last week

5086
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:22,200
You guys were all, you know, kind of just going a little bit crazy over the fact that somebody had been watching

5087
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:25,480
Um watching your pony videos since they were 11

5088
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:32,040
And you know, I I thought that was a bit weird. Um, because I've been watching your videos

5089
03:09:32,600 --> 03:09:35,240
Since I was 11. Um, I got into the pcp

5090
03:09:35,960 --> 03:09:38,200
Like at the tail end of fifth grade

5091
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:41,800
Um, I was

5092
03:09:41,800 --> 03:09:48,520
Looking for something to listen to while I got um got my work done. Um, it started ironically with, um

5093
03:09:48,680 --> 03:09:54,200
Monkey jones and the biggest problem in the universe and I'm no not the biggest problem in the universe. Whatever they're, uh

5094
03:09:54,600 --> 03:10:00,600
In sufferable social insufferable social media or whatever and off of that since they kept referencing the pcp

5095
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:05,240
I ended up getting into it. So, um, I am currently 14 years of age

5096
03:10:06,680 --> 03:10:10,360
So I you know, I I just wanted to let you guys know

5097
03:10:10,840 --> 03:10:16,120
That that there are active young people in your audience currently and I'm sure that I'm not the only one

5098
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:19,560
I can't terrify your band. Yeah. Yeah, this fair is banned. I'm sorry

5099
03:10:20,360 --> 03:10:23,320
We mark every episode as not suitable for children

5100
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:25,960
Get the it fuck out of here

5101
03:10:26,200 --> 03:10:33,240
It kind of it kind of doesn't surprise me that much really that there would have been like kids like young kids that found

5102
03:10:33,640 --> 03:10:35,800
Us through the pony stuff because that's kid shit

5103
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:42,440
It it's a little more surprising that like a kid would still find us in like a post pony era because like what's the

5104
03:10:42,920 --> 03:10:48,760
Through like monkey jones. I guess if you like monkey, are you an edgy 14 year old? Who is it?

5105
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:53,800
Uh, if you're an edgy 14 year old you find us through monkey if you are a

5106
03:10:54,040 --> 03:10:56,440
Korean 14 year old you find us through

5107
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:02,680
Uh, uh, all the rest of us through normal means everyone else. Yeah. Yeah. I'll you find us on reddit

5108
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:06,520
Insufferable social media podcast is the gateway drug to pcp

5109
03:11:08,680 --> 03:11:12,440
It is it probably was I don't even remember them saying the pcp that much

5110
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:17,560
I thought I felt felt like a very self-contained old show. I never actually never actually listened to it

5111
03:11:17,800 --> 03:11:21,880
So I I actually quite enjoyed it. It was probably my favorite thing. Mumki did

5112
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:25,720
I remember the gimmick was that they were both saying outrageous shit

5113
03:11:25,880 --> 03:11:29,960
Like that was so obviously like, you know, just clearly like in character

5114
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:34,200
You know what? I mean like the whole time like they're just trying to one up each other who could say the most ridiculous thing

5115
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:38,440
Which I think is a pretty interesting premise. Also. It was like short for a podcast. It wasn't a long

5116
03:11:38,760 --> 03:11:40,760
It was like 20 minutes to 30 minutes

5117
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:46,040
But that's uh, that's a good bit for back then but probably not. Oh, yeah nowadays. Um, yeah

5118
03:11:46,040 --> 03:11:49,080
It was some edgy shit edgy humor in general attracts 14 year olds

5119
03:11:49,160 --> 03:11:52,280
I'm not that surprised. It would get an audience of that. But um, yeah

5120
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:59,080
Yeah, yeah, I don't know if you're a new pcp fan listening to this explain how and why and

5121
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:05,640
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of curious the ultimate question tell we want to hear your pcp stories

5122
03:12:05,800 --> 03:12:07,240
We want to hear

5123
03:12:07,240 --> 03:12:11,480
From the audience like what the fuck are you doing and why and why are you still here?

5124
03:12:11,560 --> 03:12:14,840
I do I do find that kind of thing really interesting. Uh, whenever somebody

5125
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:21,000
Mentioned that they are a fan of mine or whatever. I'm always interested or how did you find me?

5126
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:25,320
Yeah, it is interesting. I've been running in hiding for so long

5127
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:30,120
There's probably at least one person out there who found me through the pcp, which is funny

5128
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:33,160
Yeah, actually, I got uh, I got two comments, uh

5129
03:12:34,520 --> 03:12:39,000
On my stuff saying they found you through the pcp. That's uh, that's kind of weird

5130
03:12:40,120 --> 03:12:42,120
That is weird

5131
03:12:42,360 --> 03:12:45,640
Why would they go to your channel? Thanks for letting me know, I guess

5132
03:12:45,880 --> 03:12:49,160
I don't know why they posted comments on on on comments. I left

5133
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:55,720
Uh, and they were like, uh, hey, I know you from the pcp and I I found out about cybershell from the pcp too

5134
03:12:56,680 --> 03:13:01,880
There's a huge contingent of quadruple pcp fans. You guys are like just oh, let's just do another episode

5135
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:08,280
Whatever, we'll there's like a millions of people out there. They're the silent majority. They're the silent majority just clamoring

5136
03:13:08,920 --> 03:13:10,600
Uh, uh, silently, of course

5137
03:13:10,600 --> 03:13:15,320
I would love if it was like like some foreign country like japan or a weirder one like iran

5138
03:13:15,320 --> 03:13:19,000
Like you have a huge fan base over there, but they never can interact with you

5139
03:13:20,040 --> 03:13:22,040
We're uh, afghanistan

5140
03:13:22,200 --> 03:13:25,880
There are a pretty sizable number of like, uh, south american

5141
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:33,400
Listeners, I feel I feel like that's I feel like those that continent is fairly well represented among the really big

5142
03:13:35,240 --> 03:13:39,320
There's a lot of youtube and and social media stuff in like brazil and things

5143
03:13:39,320 --> 03:13:43,080
I see lots of like come to brazil comments. I think it's like a meme like they just yeah

5144
03:13:43,240 --> 03:13:47,880
We'll leave a big population. It makes sense that there's like a lot of people there, but you're big in south america

5145
03:13:47,880 --> 03:13:51,160
I know at least four or five people from south america actually

5146
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:59,000
Um, not even in the same country just different countries. Yeah different countries, but all from those

5147
03:13:59,720 --> 03:14:06,040
Sorts, how can I tell youtube? I only want americans watching my content. Nobody else. No other countries should be allowed to access it

5148
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:08,120
You can block

5149
03:14:08,440 --> 03:14:10,440
Maybe we should build a wall in youtube

5150
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:13,640
We should build a fire

5151
03:14:13,960 --> 03:14:19,320
That you have to like play brick breaker to get through if you're from a different country. Yeah. Yeah, yeah

5152
03:14:19,960 --> 03:14:23,240
Yeah, it shouldn't be impossible to get over the wall just like a slight inconvenience

5153
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:27,880
Just just to let you know that we really don't want you got to do a mario

5154
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:34,040
Jump like triple jump over the wall. You got to do a triple wall. You have to backwards long jump through the videos to get

5155
03:14:34,680 --> 03:14:37,720
Yeah, yeah, you got a blj like like speed clip

5156
03:14:37,800 --> 03:14:43,880
You gotta you you have to yeah, you have to um you have to build up speed for 12 hours to clip into a qpu

5157
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:46,600
In order to get over to get through the wall

5158
03:14:46,760 --> 03:14:48,200
actually

5159
03:14:48,200 --> 03:14:53,720
And if you hit a if you press a at all you're uh your bands, you know if that's how vpns worked

5160
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:55,400
I would actually play one

5161
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:57,400
If it was mario 64

5162
03:14:58,600 --> 03:15:03,000
You know if a vpn was mario 64 i might also play

5163
03:15:04,040 --> 03:15:09,400
Just like too confusing so they just have to build video games like into them so people can like get excited about them

5164
03:15:09,560 --> 03:15:11,880
You jump into a painting. It's like a video

5165
03:15:12,600 --> 03:15:17,960
You jump into the youtube painting like yeah, it's like it organizes the internet as the castle from mario 64

5166
03:15:18,360 --> 03:15:23,640
Opening up microsoft word. I'm like typing is boring. I wish I could type by playing mario 64

5167
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:32,040
Like like yeah, I'm pounding the the keyboard. They did make a they did make a mario's typing game for the pc whatever it was called

5168
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:37,800
Um, yeah, tom even fucking around with linux like how would you feel about if instead of the current graphic user interface?

5169
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:42,840
They just replaced everything with mario 64. Would that be an improvement? It'd be better than linux. That's for sure

5170
03:15:46,040 --> 03:15:51,640
Hot take um next voicemail, I guess uh is called

5171
03:15:52,840 --> 03:15:59,880
Uh, oh wait, I didn't fucking I didn't put it in the chat. Sorry. Here it is. It's called. No, it's called one upping

5172
03:15:59,880 --> 03:16:02,440
It's bad she heard did I just play this one?

5173
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:05,720
Or are you that's a title?

5174
03:16:05,800 --> 03:16:11,400
Oh, i'm stupid. No, no, no that sorry. Okay. Let's play the one that's number 35 40 at the end

5175
03:16:11,640 --> 03:16:16,360
It's called some dumb shit one. Okay, three two one go

5176
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:20,040
Okay, so I got some dumb shit to say nice. Um

5177
03:16:20,840 --> 03:16:22,840
I was reading this thing on the pcp

5178
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:25,000
subreddit, I think

5179
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,800
And it mentions a couple things about gib

5180
03:16:28,680 --> 03:16:34,840
And it also mentions gib's real dead name. Maybe I don't know if you've changed your name yet gib, but

5181
03:16:36,760 --> 03:16:42,440
Apparently gib are you actually like a professionally trained guitarist? I thought you did some kind of like

5182
03:16:44,280 --> 03:16:46,120
Writing job

5183
03:16:46,120 --> 03:16:49,880
I'm not a professional. I mean I had it said something about you being a professional guitarist

5184
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:53,400
and how is gib a musician

5185
03:16:54,280 --> 03:16:56,920
And somehow trixie is the one who thinks she's

5186
03:16:57,960 --> 03:17:00,440
A musician when she's the worst

5187
03:17:02,120 --> 03:17:04,120
Okay, well first first off

5188
03:17:04,600 --> 03:17:06,600
I have not changed my name

5189
03:17:06,600 --> 03:17:09,240
Um because I have no issues with it. So I don't mind

5190
03:17:09,880 --> 03:17:11,880
Uh, so my name's the same. Um

5191
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:19,320
I'm not professionally trained. I don't know I I I've played guitar at a few gigs before

5192
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:24,440
Um, and they weren't for money. They were just sort of like like at various events

5193
03:17:24,520 --> 03:17:27,800
And I was like, hey, do you want to play guitar the thing? I'm like, yeah, all right

5194
03:17:28,280 --> 03:17:31,400
I've played with my my dad and his band a couple times

5195
03:17:32,040 --> 03:17:34,520
But I'm not like a professional musician by any metric

5196
03:17:35,160 --> 03:17:38,360
Uh, and I do like hobbyist stuff. I have a band camp with some

5197
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:43,720
Some good stuff and some shit stuff. I should get rid of some of the shit stuff

5198
03:17:47,080 --> 03:17:49,080
I haven't posted any music in a while

5199
03:17:49,720 --> 03:17:53,720
I haven't it's it's mostly just sort of a like I have a guitar and occasionally I just

5200
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:59,800
Pick it up and play for like a few hours and then it's fun. It's like it is like a hobbyist sort of thing

5201
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:03,960
I don't really intend to make music because making music involves like

5202
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:07,800
Putting multiple instruments together or thinking of lyrics

5203
03:18:08,680 --> 03:18:14,840
And I just don't have the patience for that like recording and and like mastering anything. I'm just like fuck it

5204
03:18:15,240 --> 03:18:19,480
I don't care. I enjoy playing the guitar. I don't enjoy recording their guitar

5205
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:23,640
Also, uh, I would need like a manager for all that

5206
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:29,640
Also Trixie isn't a musician. She's a rapper. There is a difference

5207
03:18:32,440 --> 03:18:34,360
No, I mean

5208
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:38,360
It's a subcategory. I guess she doesn't play an instrument. I think you have to be a

5209
03:18:39,880 --> 03:18:43,080
To play an instrument. I guess your voice your voice is an instrument

5210
03:18:43,720 --> 03:18:49,560
I think the the the term people use as artists rather than musician just like you create

5211
03:18:50,520 --> 03:18:56,520
You create some music, but you don't literally create the music you you rap over beats that other people make

5212
03:18:57,080 --> 03:18:59,640
Artists works just as a catch-all. Yeah

5213
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:02,600
sure

5214
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:05,240
Not only should you not be allowed to rap over other people's beats

5215
03:19:05,240 --> 03:19:10,600
You shouldn't even be allowed to play an instrument unless you built it yourself. That's the only you shouldn't even be allowed to rap

5216
03:19:10,760 --> 03:19:12,760
I built a guitar once

5217
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:15,800
You're allowed to play it then

5218
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:18,600
Yeah, you you you you're safe

5219
03:19:18,920 --> 03:19:20,920
You're safe for now

5220
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:27,400
Okay, the next one is called dumb shit, uh, two. It's the next one. Okay three two one go

5221
03:19:29,160 --> 03:19:31,160
Uh, so

5222
03:19:32,280 --> 03:19:36,360
Tom's discussion about laptop hardware shit

5223
03:19:37,160 --> 03:19:40,040
Might be the hardest I have ever zoned out

5224
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
Of any person speaking

5225
03:19:43,560 --> 03:19:49,240
About any subject I'll be honest that was I kind of zoned out as well the yellow light discussion

5226
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:54,600
Um, I don't okay. It wasn't like you got that deep in the technical stuff

5227
03:19:54,600 --> 03:20:00,040
You basically had one point which is that you know modular laptops where you can take shit out is good

5228
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:05,720
Instead of have anything be soldered to like the motherboard and shit, which is a perfectly fine take. Yeah, I think that's fine

5229
03:20:06,280 --> 03:20:08,280
It wasn't something I had a lot of

5230
03:20:08,360 --> 03:20:12,760
The yellow light thing literally took hours and derailed the entire

5231
03:20:13,560 --> 03:20:19,720
Yellow light thing was funny. Wait wait. What the yellow light thing took hours and derailed the episode

5232
03:20:19,800 --> 03:20:21,800
It came up multiple times

5233
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:28,840
Throughout the episode there was a cutaway. I remember where Trixie had like a whole like live action vlog thing for a little bit talking about

5234
03:20:29,400 --> 03:20:31,400
It was a whole

5235
03:20:31,880 --> 03:20:33,560
Wait, what are you talking about?

5236
03:20:33,640 --> 03:20:38,120
We're talking about the like like five years ago the yellow light episode of the pcp

5237
03:20:38,200 --> 03:20:43,640
Where jesse had a meltdown because you guys accuse his videos of having warm light instead of cold light

5238
03:20:45,080 --> 03:20:50,520
I thought oh, you're comparing. Oh, you're come. I thought you were saying that this happened last episode

5239
03:20:51,320 --> 03:20:54,200
He was saying it was the worst thing since the yellow light

5240
03:20:54,760 --> 03:20:56,600
Uh, oh

5241
03:20:56,600 --> 03:21:01,080
Oh, I get it. I get it. I guess the yellow light thing was good though. I don't know why yeah, that was a great meme everybody

5242
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:06,200
Love that except you this day. Literally the most memorable thing that ever happened on the pcp

5243
03:21:06,760 --> 03:21:10,280
He was still bringing it up like five years later. He just brought it up right now

5244
03:21:13,960 --> 03:21:18,360
The best thing that ever happened on the pcp is also the worst thing that ever happened

5245
03:21:18,440 --> 03:21:24,040
Uh, that sounds about right. It's the second worst thing talking about the framework laptop. Was it the worst?

5246
03:21:24,840 --> 03:21:27,640
Five years from now people are gonna be like this was worse than that time

5247
03:21:27,640 --> 03:21:31,080
Tom had to got dastic to talk about laptop talk about a modular laptop

5248
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:38,200
See, this is this is why this product is necessary because all you fucking smooth brains out there are fine with throwing away your laptop every two years

5249
03:21:38,920 --> 03:21:43,880
Fucking yeah, laptops have never appealed to me basically because of that. You know, they're like such like a specific thing

5250
03:21:43,960 --> 03:21:46,120
Like I mean they have their uses. I mean nothing against it

5251
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:50,360
But like I just like a computer because it's like a real thing you can upgrade and stuff

5252
03:21:51,320 --> 03:21:54,040
I'm a bit of a computer tech guy myself

5253
03:21:54,040 --> 03:22:00,200
So I really would appreciate if all laptops were designed in a modular manner. Do you want to talk about it for like 20 minutes?

5254
03:22:00,280 --> 03:22:03,720
Yeah, let's get into it. Let's just just piss this guy off because I mean come on

5255
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:07,320
Why would you not want that? I mean at least if he didn't like the conversation

5256
03:22:07,320 --> 03:22:09,160
He at least should admit that you were right

5257
03:22:09,160 --> 03:22:14,360
But I just want to say I watched a youtube video about it recently by uh, what's that guy's name?

5258
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:18,600
Linus. Yeah, Linus tech tips. Yeah, we mentioned it last week. It's really good

5259
03:22:20,040 --> 03:22:22,360
I watched the entire video was pretty interesting great idea

5260
03:22:22,600 --> 03:22:27,240
Unfortunately, I don't think it's gonna catch on. That's the pessimistic side of myself. Yeah

5261
03:22:27,240 --> 03:22:30,600
I just I just want them to exist as like a niche

5262
03:22:31,160 --> 03:22:33,560
enthusiast brand for for smart people

5263
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:37,720
Like just even existing is like what we have to take at this point

5264
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:43,560
Not that it's the industry standard that like it exists at all in any capacity is what we're taking as a w

5265
03:22:44,040 --> 03:22:49,160
That's that's that's capitalism for you. Yeah, that's that's that's basically where we at

5266
03:22:49,560 --> 03:22:52,360
Take what I can get I'll take what I can get

5267
03:22:53,160 --> 03:22:57,160
Uh next voicemail is called. I think it's on dumb shit number three

5268
03:22:58,040 --> 03:23:00,840
Yes, dumb shit three three two one go

5269
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:04,680
This one time I tried to mess with chris chan

5270
03:23:05,480 --> 03:23:07,880
This was in like 08 or 09

5271
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:13,160
And this girl I was hanging out with I got her really into chris chan stuff

5272
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:16,360
And she wanted to send chris a picture of her boobs

5273
03:23:17,320 --> 03:23:19,320
But chris said no, thank you

5274
03:23:19,960 --> 03:23:21,960
So really

5275
03:23:22,440 --> 03:23:24,440
My point is a story

5276
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:27,880
Fuck people who think that everyone who

5277
03:23:28,600 --> 03:23:31,640
Goes to the kiwi farms to think about chris

5278
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:35,320
Wants chris to kill themselves like

5279
03:23:36,120 --> 03:23:39,640
Some of us just want chris to just not be a shithead

5280
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:42,600
That's kind of where I've always been

5281
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:46,520
Um, I saw some people getting upset at crack for saying like

5282
03:23:47,160 --> 03:23:49,000
Destroy kiwi farms at four chan

5283
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:50,840
But like the point is like yes

5284
03:23:50,840 --> 03:23:56,920
No one thinks every single human being on kiwi farms is like a psycho a log wants chris to die

5285
03:23:57,000 --> 03:24:02,760
But like the fact is if you post there you're posting alongside people like that and the whole point of the site is that

5286
03:24:03,000 --> 03:24:07,560
They will not face repercussions for being like that. I I completely understand

5287
03:24:08,440 --> 03:24:14,840
Why you would be interested in the sorts of things they talk about on kiwi farms for like non malicious reasons

5288
03:24:14,840 --> 03:24:19,000
It's a gossip brag, right? I mean it's the human nature people love to gossip about shit

5289
03:24:19,480 --> 03:24:22,200
But I doesn't mean I think it's like a good place

5290
03:24:22,760 --> 03:24:25,720
The the thing that bothered me most about it is what you brought up a while ago

5291
03:24:25,880 --> 03:24:29,160
Ben saying which is that they loved a posture like oh, we're not transphobic

5292
03:24:29,320 --> 03:24:31,080
We just allow any kind of free speech

5293
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:36,280
But if you go in and use the proper pronouns people have a bigger meltdown and they get upset

5294
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:39,240
It's they get upset being not transphobic is like

5295
03:24:39,880 --> 03:24:42,440
Theoretically allowed, but you will you will start a fight?

5296
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:46,600
You will start a fight if you do it just without even trying like you know what I mean?

5297
03:24:46,600 --> 03:24:49,480
It's like so I don't know so to it's a little disingenuous

5298
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:54,760
Also, it's not an anti trans site because there's nothing in the rules that says you have to be anti trans or whatever

5299
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:58,840
So I don't know paper. It's not on paper. They have no ideology of any kind

5300
03:24:58,920 --> 03:25:02,200
They're completely free of all of all bias or political

5301
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:04,920
The idea is whatsoever

5302
03:25:04,920 --> 03:25:06,920
But you mean of course

5303
03:25:07,160 --> 03:25:09,160
The most the most political

5304
03:25:09,160 --> 03:25:12,120
The most ideological people are the ones that claim that they have no

5305
03:25:12,760 --> 03:25:19,640
Ideology it's a kind of a bad place, but it's a little bit too useful if you want to find out information about people

5306
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:21,800
Yeah

5307
03:25:21,800 --> 03:25:23,800
I mean, that's why I sometimes look at it

5308
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:29,080
So I'm like if I I mean if I want to know what like what is the gossip about someone's like

5309
03:25:29,400 --> 03:25:34,280
Yeah, if you want to find out all the terrible things ben saint has done or has ever said in his life

5310
03:25:34,440 --> 03:25:36,440
That's a place to go

5311
03:25:37,080 --> 03:25:38,360
Uh

5312
03:25:38,360 --> 03:25:41,640
No, you just go to my youtube channel. You just go to my twitter feed for that

5313
03:25:42,360 --> 03:25:42,920
See them

5314
03:25:42,920 --> 03:25:47,560
Yeah, you need to cut them out of the equation and do all your embarrassing shit publicly loudly on your twitter

5315
03:25:47,560 --> 03:25:52,120
So it's like nobody even needs to like go find a thread on you. You can just be an asshole in public

5316
03:25:52,120 --> 03:25:59,080
Well, that was that was that was chris chan's strategy is it's like, you know four cent garbage is posting all these lies about me

5317
03:25:59,480 --> 03:26:02,760
So I will flood out the lies with with with the honest truth

5318
03:26:03,480 --> 03:26:06,680
I think I'm pretty sure that worked. I think it works perfectly

5319
03:26:07,160 --> 03:26:11,240
Well, it it's sort of work. I mean it didn't have exactly the consequences

5320
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:16,200
I think I think though. I think everything had a happy ending in the whole chris chan story. I haven't looked into it recently

5321
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:18,200
I don't know about that

5322
03:26:18,200 --> 03:26:22,120
Yeah, I haven't looked at it in a while, but last I checked everything was just pretty much fine

5323
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:30,760
Next voicemail is called let me put it here in the chat it is called um

5324
03:26:31,480 --> 03:26:34,840
The I it's called I I meant parasailing

5325
03:26:35,560 --> 03:26:37,560
three two one go

5326
03:26:40,680 --> 03:26:42,680
Hang gliding is scary

5327
03:26:44,360 --> 03:26:48,840
Yeah, sarah palin more like parasailing

5328
03:26:50,680 --> 03:26:52,680
That one got me

5329
03:26:52,920 --> 03:26:54,520
um

5330
03:26:54,520 --> 03:26:56,520
Hang

5331
03:26:56,600 --> 03:26:58,600
What's the difference uh

5332
03:26:59,560 --> 03:27:04,040
Hang gliding is all glide on the air parasailing is where you sail on the ocean

5333
03:27:04,600 --> 03:27:09,320
Parasailing seems less dangerous because if you fell you would just fall into the water

5334
03:27:09,400 --> 03:27:15,240
Yeah, Paris seems less scary than hang-hiding. Hang-hiding is like you jump off a cliff. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah

5335
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:20,040
If you played uh sonic 2 3 game gear you would uh, oh, yeah

5336
03:27:20,440 --> 03:27:25,480
This little hang glider item. There's most of my hang gliding and knowledge comes from pilo wings from that game

5337
03:27:25,720 --> 03:27:31,720
Hang gliding is just like elytra in minecraft if you get some fireworks and you set them off you can keep going

5338
03:27:32,200 --> 03:27:36,200
I I don't think I don't think I'm interested in doing any like

5339
03:27:37,240 --> 03:27:39,240
Any like extreme

5340
03:27:39,560 --> 03:27:42,760
I mean, that's not even that extreme. I mean like skydiving type stuff

5341
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:48,200
I don't think I'm interested in doing any of that shit ever again because I'm I'm very very aware of like the

5342
03:27:48,680 --> 03:27:53,960
Frailness of my human body and just how easily you're not interested in paranoid about it

5343
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:58,200
You're not interested in uh potentially putting your life at risk and dying

5344
03:27:58,920 --> 03:28:00,920
I would really know

5345
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:06,840
Because I could see Ben saying jumping out of a suicidal. Oh, yeah, I was gonna say if you have nothing to live for

5346
03:28:06,840 --> 03:28:10,040
I was like I was like maybe when I'm older all I go skydiving and I don't care if I'm fucking live

5347
03:28:10,120 --> 03:28:14,200
I have the most to live for living in some fucking base living is so fucking awesome

5348
03:28:14,440 --> 03:28:21,800
I could see Ben saying like jumping out of a yes. Yes. That's exactly right. Give that's why I'm fucking miserable and terrified

5349
03:28:22,360 --> 03:28:27,800
I'm miserable and terrified of the idea that this great life that I'm living being scared all the time will come to an end

5350
03:28:28,280 --> 03:28:30,280
unironically true

5351
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:34,360
I'm so sad that eventually this life where I spend every day every waking moment

5352
03:28:34,360 --> 03:28:38,440
Just thinking about what it would be like if my head got squished under a train. I don't want that to end

5353
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:42,280
I don't want that to go on. Yeah, please more of this, please

5354
03:28:42,760 --> 03:28:46,600
You're excited about the potential for life, but you know what a great, uh

5355
03:28:47,320 --> 03:28:49,320
Other of the reality

5356
03:28:49,800 --> 03:28:55,080
You know what a great, uh philosopher once said life is a cage and death is a key

5357
03:28:55,720 --> 03:28:59,080
I heard that I heard that once. Oh, I wonder who said that one

5358
03:29:01,720 --> 03:29:04,600
It was it was give give said that that one time

5359
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:07,400
I know you didn't have to spill it out

5360
03:29:08,600 --> 03:29:11,000
It was you actually that should be on a fucking shirt

5361
03:29:11,960 --> 03:29:17,080
You said that thing that time that should be on a shirt. Was that on the yellow episode?

5362
03:29:17,880 --> 03:29:19,880
No, that was way later than that

5363
03:29:19,880 --> 03:29:24,280
No, I don't I don't I don't actually know when it was but I

5364
03:29:25,320 --> 03:29:29,000
I remember mage being there. Would you be allowed to put that on a shirt now?

5365
03:29:31,080 --> 03:29:32,040
Uh

5366
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:33,800
There is

5367
03:29:33,800 --> 03:29:35,800
Well, somebody should somebody should put it on a fucking shirt

5368
03:29:36,120 --> 03:29:39,880
Uh next if you sell a shirt you have to mail us money

5369
03:29:40,840 --> 03:29:45,640
Viewers, uh, don't you won't get away with it. Uh, next one is a next voicemail is an image

5370
03:29:46,280 --> 03:29:48,280
thankfully

5371
03:29:49,560 --> 03:29:55,400
Uh, okay, I this is a comparison from the last I guess we were not sure who it was

5372
03:29:56,280 --> 03:30:00,360
I mean, I thought it was munchy, but I think we did settle that it was munchy

5373
03:30:02,760 --> 03:30:07,800
Well was Ben behind I kind of remember the original image. They didn't so we thought it looked like doesn't matter

5374
03:30:07,880 --> 03:30:11,640
But we weren't sure if it was super much. They're bad, but I think this image thoroughly says

5375
03:30:12,200 --> 03:30:14,440
Like I guess it's I guess it was munchy

5376
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:17,800
Whoops

5377
03:30:18,120 --> 03:30:21,640
Okay, well, uh next one is called

5378
03:30:23,640 --> 03:30:27,880
Put it in the chat right there three five four five. It is called a suggestion

5379
03:30:28,520 --> 03:30:30,520
three two one go

5380
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:34,200
Hello there PCP

5381
03:30:35,080 --> 03:30:43,080
I was wondering why you still have Nate as a member of the pro crastonators podcast

5382
03:30:43,640 --> 03:30:45,640
He does not do anything

5383
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:51,800
You cannot extract surplus value from him. He is dead

5384
03:30:52,600 --> 03:30:54,360
literally

5385
03:30:54,440 --> 03:31:01,960
Release him into the great beyond and also it would make some people very angry

5386
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:06,680
Well

5387
03:31:06,680 --> 03:31:10,280
I don't I don't know why I decided to eat this left over wait. What do they want to say?

5388
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:13,160
Kill me start eating. Yeah kill me

5389
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:17,800
Uh, I remember uh when Nate posted the gamer zone thing on twitter

5390
03:31:18,440 --> 03:31:24,600
I tweeted at him like, uh, oh you're starting your own podcast, but won't be on the pcp. I see how it is

5391
03:31:26,760 --> 03:31:28,760
Yeah, I tweet got a lot of likes

5392
03:31:29,480 --> 03:31:35,000
I uh, I'm gonna try and convince him to come on but just because I want to dab on what's his face

5393
03:31:35,080 --> 03:31:39,000
Who's always like no, Nate no watch. I want him to post that on a video that has native it

5394
03:31:39,960 --> 03:31:43,560
You could never recover from a humiliation of that would be sshc

5395
03:31:44,120 --> 03:31:47,720
How was I forget the acronym it's s like schv videos

5396
03:31:48,920 --> 03:31:52,200
Right. I remember it was complicated enough that I wasn't gonna bother remembering it

5397
03:31:52,520 --> 03:31:54,520
shcw video

5398
03:31:54,600 --> 03:31:58,520
He's he's he's doggedly continued his fucking crusade and I again

5399
03:31:59,560 --> 03:32:01,560
I don't think he's watching the videos

5400
03:32:02,040 --> 03:32:05,320
So you can get him you can just get his ass you just when Nate comes back

5401
03:32:05,320 --> 03:32:08,440
You just got to make sure you don't I know you're gonna want to put it in the thumbnail and title

5402
03:32:08,440 --> 03:32:12,680
But don't because then you can get his ass and make him say no Nate no watch on a Nate video

5403
03:32:12,760 --> 03:32:16,520
And once he does that it doesn't matter what he posts after that because it'll have lost all credibility

5404
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:23,000
The battle will have been why I mean if it's no, how does he say no Nate no watch if he doesn't watch

5405
03:32:23,080 --> 03:32:27,080
How does he know there's no I know that's the point he's it's a flaw in his system

5406
03:32:27,640 --> 03:32:33,000
His whole ideology is crumbling. It's been working on sills. It's on predictions. He'll trip up

5407
03:32:33,880 --> 03:32:38,840
We could make that happen. Okay, Nate will never come back. So maybe he'll accidentally watch it and then he'll be like no

5408
03:32:39,080 --> 03:32:40,600
I

5409
03:32:40,600 --> 03:32:44,680
Yes, I I did um because Nate hadn't been on an episode in a while

5410
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:48,040
I did take him his channel off the like sidebar

5411
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:51,880
With the expectation that like I could just put it back any time

5412
03:32:52,040 --> 03:32:58,120
And he got like kind of mad at me. He was like ben why why you'd message me sort of upset and I was like, jeez, dude

5413
03:32:58,200 --> 03:33:00,200
I don't know. I'll put it back

5414
03:33:00,280 --> 03:33:04,440
But like whatever it is kind of funny that he would care at all because yeah, I

5415
03:33:05,400 --> 03:33:09,880
Think a year I generally think he would care because like he has even at that point

5416
03:33:09,880 --> 03:33:12,520
He hadn't been on in like a year and it's just been even longer since

5417
03:33:12,600 --> 03:33:17,480
I will just agree with what you said ages ago ben which is why I agree to do game or so

5418
03:33:17,480 --> 03:33:21,640
And why I'm going to do this which is that doing a podcast is like a couple hours out of the week

5419
03:33:21,880 --> 03:33:27,560
It's not that much time to do. It's truly. It's truly a low commit. I don't understand why so many people seem to think it's like

5420
03:33:27,640 --> 03:33:31,320
I mean, Nate has the time clearly. He's doing another podcast. So

5421
03:33:32,040 --> 03:33:36,360
That's the funny part. It can't be the time thing. It's just kind of funny. He just doesn't love us anymore

5422
03:33:36,520 --> 03:33:38,600
Which really hurts. It hurts. It hurts, Nate

5423
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:46,120
Well, I'm just um, I'm waiting until uh, I'm waiting until I get invited to the gamer zone because I mean I'm

5424
03:33:46,680 --> 03:33:48,680
I'm kind of the gamer's tavern

5425
03:33:49,720 --> 03:33:52,840
The gamers tavern is the zone is in the zone

5426
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:58,600
Gamers tavern is one such zone. I was pushing we should just call the podcast gamers tavern

5427
03:33:58,600 --> 03:34:00,360
We should just steal that from you

5428
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:04,200
That's funny. Yeah, I I made that suggestion in the comments, uh somewhere

5429
03:34:05,240 --> 03:34:08,200
I don't I don't understand the mindset of people that oh, let's say like

5430
03:34:08,920 --> 03:34:14,680
Sometimes people will say like once she's not for for instance, they'll say yeah, once she's not on the pzp anymore

5431
03:34:14,920 --> 03:34:18,040
He's gone on to do bigger and better things and like

5432
03:34:18,600 --> 03:34:20,600
I like it's it's fair to say like, okay

5433
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,400
Maybe he is doing bigger and better things that might be true

5434
03:34:23,400 --> 03:34:28,600
But like the sort of implication that like he he he or or anyone you had to stop doing

5435
03:34:28,840 --> 03:34:33,000
You had to stop doing this podcast in order to do something else instead

5436
03:34:33,400 --> 03:34:39,240
As though it is not perfectly feasible to slot a three hour podcast into your weekly schedule somewhere

5437
03:34:39,320 --> 03:34:45,000
It's not usually also pursuing can do more than one podcast. Look at me for example. I'm on both of them

5438
03:34:45,640 --> 03:34:47,640
You're a slut. You're a podcast

5439
03:34:48,200 --> 03:34:53,800
You also don't have to uh, you don't have to be on every week either if you're busy on that time

5440
03:34:54,280 --> 03:34:55,400
You can just miss out

5441
03:34:55,400 --> 03:34:59,000
Yeah, that was the thing like if they just didn't want to be on every episode because that was the thing

5442
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:03,560
He was on every episode for like a very long time. So like I kind of get that if you want to take a break

5443
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:05,320
I mean he can do whatever he wants doesn't have to be on the show

5444
03:35:05,320 --> 03:35:08,840
If he doesn't want to be but I don't understand why he does he feel like he can't be on it

5445
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:10,920
It's just I'm confused why people

5446
03:35:11,480 --> 03:35:15,560
It's it's it's really not all or nothing. It really doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition

5447
03:35:15,560 --> 03:35:20,040
That's what I was thinking like just do it once a month if you aren't feeling it. It's fine or or not

5448
03:35:20,120 --> 03:35:22,600
I mean whatever you don't want to be in the show. That's fine. Yeah, that's what I was saying

5449
03:35:22,600 --> 03:35:26,280
I don't want to like bully like if he doesn't want to do it doesn't have to do it. It's just like kind of funny to me

5450
03:35:26,920 --> 03:35:27,640
it's

5451
03:35:27,640 --> 03:35:31,560
It's funny that it's it's just funny that it seems like it's it's such a

5452
03:35:32,520 --> 03:35:34,520
Never be on the show again

5453
03:35:34,600 --> 03:35:36,200
but also

5454
03:35:36,200 --> 03:35:42,200
Never say anything about why ever right like to like take a look what seems to be like a really hard line stance and then never

5455
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:48,040
Refer to it. Yeah. Yeah. If I didn't know any better. It sounds almost like a jaunt run thing

5456
03:35:48,840 --> 03:35:53,400
I genuinely don't understand why he cared that I like took his his button off the sidebar

5457
03:35:53,800 --> 03:35:57,000
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't even notice it and did you message him saying I'm doing this

5458
03:35:57,720 --> 03:36:01,320
No, yeah, I I don't know how he noticed. Honestly. Yeah, it's such a small thing

5459
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:03,160
I I was just like

5460
03:36:03,160 --> 03:36:09,160
If if you were on the show, I would just I could just put it back. I don't I am surprised that he noticed actually

5461
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:11,480
um

5462
03:36:11,480 --> 03:36:12,760
anyway

5463
03:36:12,760 --> 03:36:14,760
Next one is called

5464
03:36:14,840 --> 03:36:16,120
to

5465
03:36:16,120 --> 03:36:18,120
Angry Nate head. Oh, this is to that guy

5466
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:20,840
Who was mad at us for being for being?

5467
03:36:21,400 --> 03:36:23,400
Mean to his boy

5468
03:36:23,720 --> 03:36:25,720
Three two one go

5469
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:31,160
So in response to that one guy who was so pissed at you guys for talking Nate just give him one of these

5470
03:36:33,240 --> 03:36:35,640
Click here to skip the bad

5471
03:36:36,840 --> 03:36:38,360
Hmm

5472
03:36:38,360 --> 03:36:40,360
Click here to skip the bad

5473
03:36:41,560 --> 03:36:43,560
Uh, maybe he means a timestamp

5474
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:45,560
I

5475
03:36:45,960 --> 03:36:50,520
I take offense to this that he thinks you should even go to the trouble of time stamping any of this discussion

5476
03:36:51,720 --> 03:36:54,520
Is that what he's saying? I'm not sure. I don't know sure

5477
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:58,680
Dev alchemist, I'm a little I'm a little confused about what you're suggesting. I'm sorry

5478
03:36:58,760 --> 03:37:04,040
But I think you should uh timestamp a timestamp the voicemail probably what he's saying

5479
03:37:04,760 --> 03:37:06,760
I think is

5480
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:09,080
To the guy who got mad about the Nate

5481
03:37:09,800 --> 03:37:11,000
of uh

5482
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
bullying

5483
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:15,000
We should say hey guy

5484
03:37:15,000 --> 03:37:18,520
Here's a timestamp for when you can skip us talking about Nate

5485
03:37:19,400 --> 03:37:21,400
But I don't think but that's

5486
03:37:21,960 --> 03:37:25,560
I don't know if that would solve the problem. I uh, I don't think that's the problem

5487
03:37:25,560 --> 03:37:27,400
I don't think the problem was that he heard about it

5488
03:37:27,400 --> 03:37:30,760
I think he was indignant on Nate's behalf that how dare people

5489
03:37:31,240 --> 03:37:32,520
Discuss him on this podcast

5490
03:37:32,520 --> 03:37:36,280
Which he could easily come on and defend himself at any point if he wanted to that's what I'm saying

5491
03:37:36,760 --> 03:37:42,680
Well, he doesn't even have like not only then for permission. He can just literally just establish when we tried to remove him from the

5492
03:37:42,760 --> 03:37:43,880
podcast

5493
03:37:43,880 --> 03:37:51,320
Association he adamantly refused the thing. So like he's part of this what be brought by his own volition

5494
03:37:52,760 --> 03:37:59,320
If he ever wanted to say anything about the pcp, he has the perfect platform here on the show

5495
03:38:00,520 --> 03:38:04,280
Right like if he wanted to leave the pcp, he literally could but he doesn't want to

5496
03:38:05,080 --> 03:38:07,080
Yeah, but also doesn't ever want to be on

5497
03:38:07,960 --> 03:38:09,080
I don't get it

5498
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:13,880
I generally don't understand but I just want the credit without putting in the work

5499
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:23,800
I mean what what credit he's getting with such accolades. He's happy being the pcp accountant. I'm getting his small cut every month

5500
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,800
He still does the he still does the the paypal

5501
03:38:29,160 --> 03:38:31,160
paperwork the paypal per work

5502
03:38:31,720 --> 03:38:33,720
This is still ironically his business

5503
03:38:35,400 --> 03:38:36,440
Yeah

5504
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:39,080
Oh, yeah, I guess in a way he's your boss

5505
03:38:40,280 --> 03:38:42,120
Yeah

5506
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:47,960
Yeah, legally he worked for us legally. It's his it's his enterprise and we're all getting non-employee compensation

5507
03:38:48,280 --> 03:38:53,960
For our cuts at the work viewers ignore what ben says because he's definitely works for his brother

5508
03:38:57,480 --> 03:39:03,320
That's a sick burn. I said it's non-employee non-employee compensation. You're a contractor

5509
03:39:04,280 --> 03:39:06,760
You got no benefits. I have no benefits

5510
03:39:07,880 --> 03:39:09,880
I'm being exploited

5511
03:39:12,440 --> 03:39:16,440
Next next voicemail is called one cool dud

5512
03:39:17,160 --> 03:39:19,160
three two one go

5513
03:39:19,800 --> 03:39:21,800
I've been meaning to mention for a while now

5514
03:39:22,840 --> 03:39:28,040
That ben's uwu voice is just like top tier

5515
03:39:29,240 --> 03:39:32,280
Like not even joking it genuinely

5516
03:39:33,080 --> 03:39:35,080
Makes me feel so happy

5517
03:39:35,800 --> 03:39:37,640
and squishy

5518
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:39,640
Whenever you do it

5519
03:39:40,200 --> 03:39:43,080
I was wondering if you could possibly use it to say

5520
03:39:44,280 --> 03:39:48,200
Uh, not so fast mister. I have a master's degree

5521
03:39:50,360 --> 03:39:52,360
That would be extremely choice

5522
03:39:53,240 --> 03:39:54,680
Um

5523
03:39:54,680 --> 03:39:56,680
Yeah, well, thank you

5524
03:39:57,000 --> 03:40:01,400
Um, let me see. What is my uh, I'll try I'll try to do it naturally

5525
03:40:01,640 --> 03:40:08,200
Um, I don't know if you do this sounds like uh, not so fast. Mr. I have a master's degree

5526
03:40:09,800 --> 03:40:11,800
Well, is that is that?

5527
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:18,760
I think that's not quite it. I think it's just sort of the the high-pitched squeaky thing you do sometimes

5528
03:40:20,200 --> 03:40:22,680
When you say thank you and thank you

5529
03:40:23,960 --> 03:40:30,600
I have a master's degree. Wait, weren't you weren't you like doing an uwu voice with munchie like a while ago?

5530
03:40:31,400 --> 03:40:33,400
And you just kept doing it

5531
03:40:33,880 --> 03:40:39,640
I remember kezi talking about that like you would not stop doing the uwu voice and she got really upset or they got really upset

5532
03:40:39,720 --> 03:40:44,920
Whoops, I said it again. I fucking misgendered them some somebody somebody. Um

5533
03:40:46,120 --> 03:40:48,120
somebody uh, honestly like

5534
03:40:48,840 --> 03:40:53,400
When i'm trying to think of my uwu voice like i'm not exactly sure what voice it is like

5535
03:40:53,960 --> 03:40:56,920
I would need to hear like a clip and be like that voice when you do that

5536
03:40:57,240 --> 03:41:02,200
And then I could be like oh, I can do that you can't do it now because you're too self-conscious about trying to do it

5537
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:07,320
You know what I mean? Now i'm i'm overthinking it. I'm overthinking it. I'm like, wait, like how high do I have to go?

5538
03:41:07,400 --> 03:41:13,240
How nasally I think you're just contributing. It's just like replacing all the vowels with w's or however

5539
03:41:13,480 --> 03:41:17,560
However, you do it you do it you do it. However, you

5540
03:41:18,760 --> 03:41:22,680
I don't know. I think you're you're contributing to this person's uh, joe material

5541
03:41:24,120 --> 03:41:26,120
Charge the crystal i'm charging their crystal

5542
03:41:27,400 --> 03:41:29,400
You're definitely helping charge that crystal

5543
03:41:30,280 --> 03:41:34,680
Next oh wait, uh, don't not this latest one do the one that's three five four eight

5544
03:41:35,240 --> 03:41:37,240
This one is george the bird

5545
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:39,560
three two one go

5546
03:41:40,440 --> 03:41:42,440
Okay, so we're gonna hotel on the beach

5547
03:41:43,240 --> 03:41:45,240
And we have this little seagull

5548
03:41:45,880 --> 03:41:47,880
Who is either hurt

5549
03:41:48,280 --> 03:41:53,160
Or just a dumb baby and he cannot fly and he's been offended. I've named him george

5550
03:41:54,120 --> 03:41:57,320
Um, he doesn't like berries. He doesn't like crackers

5551
03:41:58,840 --> 03:42:05,640
But uh, I stole a piece of chilean sea bass that would have gone on a $40 plate from the restaurant

5552
03:42:06,520 --> 03:42:08,360
we have

5553
03:42:08,360 --> 03:42:10,360
and he likes that so

5554
03:42:12,120 --> 03:42:16,440
Seagulls are bougie little shits is my point. I don't know george is a cool guy though

5555
03:42:17,640 --> 03:42:20,680
I almost almost I almost just said

5556
03:42:21,640 --> 03:42:23,640
Wait seagulls eat fish

5557
03:42:23,880 --> 03:42:27,240
And I was like, what else do I think they that would have been embarrassing

5558
03:42:28,280 --> 03:42:33,560
All right, it's a good thing. You didn't say I guess they're just scavengers. I guess yeah, I guess they just eat anything

5559
03:42:33,640 --> 03:42:36,920
I thought they eat hot dogs. I thought they oh, yeah, like I think of them

5560
03:42:37,240 --> 03:42:40,520
Yeah, like trash, but like yeah, of course they eat meat

5561
03:42:40,920 --> 03:42:45,000
Like they live at the sea of course they eat fish fish are basically sea trash, so

5562
03:42:46,840 --> 03:42:48,840
Fuck fish, you know

5563
03:42:49,480 --> 03:42:56,280
Who needs it's like it's like thinking of like what pigeons actually eat if not like bread and and chips

5564
03:42:59,160 --> 03:43:01,160
Nobody knows

5565
03:43:02,040 --> 03:43:04,040
Yeah, before humans invented garbage

5566
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:08,920
Uh, they didn't pigeons only exist because we invented them to eat our garbage

5567
03:43:09,720 --> 03:43:11,720
Because we needed something to clean up after us

5568
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:15,720
And then we needed them to poop on our heads. Yeah, we definitely needed that

5569
03:43:16,040 --> 03:43:19,640
We we designed them specifically for all these purposes

5570
03:43:20,360 --> 03:43:23,080
Uh next voicemail is called breaking news

5571
03:43:23,640 --> 03:43:25,640
three two one go

5572
03:43:26,120 --> 03:43:32,120
The Taliban has assumed control of Afghanistan like a month after parking with a tour of the troops, so

5573
03:43:33,160 --> 03:43:35,160
That's pretty cool

5574
03:43:35,400 --> 03:43:36,600
Yeah

5575
03:43:36,600 --> 03:43:43,800
Did you see that picture of the Taliban recreating the Iwo Jima image with cat with captured american like

5576
03:43:44,360 --> 03:43:45,960
Uniforms and shit. It was epic

5577
03:43:45,960 --> 03:43:53,160
Uh, I saw a picture of a guy posing in front of a bunch of guns that they had gotten from like an abandoned american base

5578
03:43:54,280 --> 03:43:58,040
Just another one of those silly Taliban pranks. They're known for

5579
03:43:59,160 --> 03:44:02,520
one of their many gaffes and japes and

5580
03:44:03,720 --> 03:44:05,720
Uh, it's just classic

5581
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:07,960
Uh, yeah

5582
03:44:07,960 --> 03:44:09,960
So, you know, that's cool

5583
03:44:10,120 --> 03:44:12,760
I think the Taliban's good, right? We like them. Yeah, that's great

5584
03:44:13,080 --> 03:44:19,480
Uh, I think they're the good guys. I can't remember. I remember watching a fake sound. I fucking uh Rambo bluey where they were uh pretty cool

5585
03:44:20,360 --> 03:44:23,720
The brave muhajine jine fighters or whatever

5586
03:44:24,520 --> 03:44:25,960
The Taliban is uh

5587
03:44:25,960 --> 03:44:28,840
Taliban is when you know, I don't know if those are related to each other or not

5588
03:44:29,160 --> 03:44:31,800
The Taliban is when you get banned from a forum, right?

5589
03:44:32,520 --> 03:44:36,680
Oh, yeah, you get tallyed. No, it's when it's when it's when uh

5590
03:44:37,320 --> 03:44:42,840
You you're banned from dating tally in mass effect. No a fate worse than death

5591
03:44:43,560 --> 03:44:45,560
Therefore they suck

5592
03:44:46,920 --> 03:44:49,560
Well, shit you piss off the Koreans you get tally band

5593
03:44:49,960 --> 03:44:53,880
I was I was on the tally band side, but now I have to reconsider

5594
03:44:54,440 --> 03:44:59,800
Yeah, I was on their side until I heard their thoughts on the specific mass effect romance and now I'm against them

5595
03:45:00,280 --> 03:45:02,680
This makes me reconsider everything I used to think about them

5596
03:45:02,680 --> 03:45:07,640
I mean if you fuck up the loyalty mention of mass effect you can't get out banned from for people

5597
03:45:08,680 --> 03:45:10,680
That's true. That's also killed

5598
03:45:11,480 --> 03:45:17,400
Everybody can die in that game. It's pretty fun. Yeah, you get the watching every single every single person die on the suicide mission

5599
03:45:17,400 --> 03:45:21,960
It's actually like hilarious. I don't know why this is like it's like every single thing that can go wrong goes wrong

5600
03:45:22,120 --> 03:45:24,120
Like the worst possible way

5601
03:45:25,160 --> 03:45:28,360
There's tally band and then there's weird al qaeda

5602
03:45:32,760 --> 03:45:36,680
That's a good one. That's solid solid work

5603
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:39,560
Uh, thanks

5604
03:45:39,560 --> 03:45:41,560
Thank you

5605
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:43,560
Next voicemail is called

5606
03:45:44,120 --> 03:45:47,320
A simple request and this is sent in by

5607
03:45:47,880 --> 03:45:49,880
Fattest nuts at hotmail.com

5608
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:54,520
Son of a mention that I believe he means peanuts

5609
03:45:55,320 --> 03:46:00,200
I hope delicious keto too. Uh, three two one go

5610
03:46:01,160 --> 03:46:07,080
I'm gonna need you to do me a favor go to the gift tab of discord and search

5611
03:46:08,280 --> 03:46:12,760
Relax and take notes. I'm gonna give you a few seconds

5612
03:46:16,040 --> 03:46:18,040
Okay, so who's getting the best head

5613
03:46:18,760 --> 03:46:24,360
Oh, and also a hashtag lynch tommy j. Nobody loves him his voice sounds fucking awful. Oh

5614
03:46:25,320 --> 03:46:27,640
Come on the chipmunks

5615
03:46:27,640 --> 03:46:29,640
Um

5616
03:46:31,000 --> 03:46:33,000
Oh

5617
03:46:35,320 --> 03:46:37,320
I don't even know what the chipmunks names are

5618
03:46:37,880 --> 03:46:40,760
Alvin simon and theodore right theodore's the green one

5619
03:46:40,920 --> 03:46:44,840
Theodore is is like is like in nirvana right now

5620
03:46:45,400 --> 03:46:50,040
Yeah, it's the it's definitely theodore's eyes are closed. He's in like he's in like a zone theodore

5621
03:46:51,400 --> 03:46:53,880
Alvin is pogging alvin is just straight up

5622
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:57,000
That's just a tuesday for alvin. This is a pog moment

5623
03:46:57,480 --> 03:47:03,880
He it's poggers, but he's he but he's still like aware. He's just like yeah, this is pretty cool. He's like consciously reacting

5624
03:47:04,840 --> 03:47:09,880
Simon seems to be in discomfort. Yeah, he's like scrunching his eyes

5625
03:47:11,080 --> 03:47:13,080
God damn it

5626
03:47:13,160 --> 03:47:16,360
That reminds me of that uh video where uh, everyone was

5627
03:47:17,000 --> 03:47:21,560
Chastising tom for using the gift thing on twitter. Oh, yeah, tom oliver cringe

5628
03:47:22,280 --> 03:47:24,280
The boomer

5629
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:30,600
You you did

5630
03:47:30,600 --> 03:47:35,240
I always thought using gift tab was kind of cringe, but then I when I was

5631
03:47:35,960 --> 03:47:39,960
Watched that it made me think about can I put it into words? Why and then I was like I kind of can't honestly

5632
03:47:40,040 --> 03:47:41,960
So I guess you're uh, you're right

5633
03:47:42,120 --> 03:47:47,640
I think you won but you won the legal battle, but you lost in the court of public. I don't know the comments seem pretty

5634
03:47:48,360 --> 03:47:53,080
Heavily in my favor. I've I've grown into into enjoying the gift button

5635
03:47:53,720 --> 03:47:57,080
Recreationally not just as a meme like haha. I'm using the gift button. Just like

5636
03:47:57,720 --> 03:47:59,400
Uh, oh, there's a

5637
03:47:59,400 --> 03:48:03,160
I don't have like a folder of these sorts of things and I just want to

5638
03:48:03,720 --> 03:48:07,880
Show an image. There's probably a weirdo gift of whatever people are talking about right now

5639
03:48:08,280 --> 03:48:09,720
I just find it

5640
03:48:09,720 --> 03:48:16,600
I really like I think it's really cool that like if you type in endless war rfck. There is a there are lots of like

5641
03:48:17,320 --> 03:48:21,240
Endless war memes that's that show up in the gift tab

5642
03:48:21,720 --> 03:48:29,560
Because it just searches gifts. It's not like I yeah once I realized that it's not like a pre picked out boomer approved

5643
03:48:29,960 --> 03:48:35,000
List of memes you're allowed to share. It's just like it literally is just like it searches for gifts

5644
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:37,080
Like I can't really be that upset of it then

5645
03:48:37,480 --> 03:48:44,520
That was which was the case I was making in the video. I'm glad I've been right retroactively justified and proven correct

5646
03:48:45,480 --> 03:48:51,000
Everybody will like uh the gift button sooner or later because everyone becomes a boomer eventually

5647
03:48:51,960 --> 03:48:54,840
Exactly. We're just aging into him just ahead of the curve. I think that

5648
03:48:55,560 --> 03:48:56,920
I think that

5649
03:48:56,920 --> 03:48:59,000
I think that using a gift as a reaction

5650
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:01,400
I mean you can do it once in a while, but I think if you do it all the time

5651
03:49:01,560 --> 03:49:03,640
It's a little bit like it's a little bit like low effort

5652
03:49:03,720 --> 03:49:08,440
You do it all the time then sure but like I mean there's something inherently wrong with using as gift as a reply

5653
03:49:08,440 --> 03:49:13,000
Which is again a reason why I was inherently opposed to the gift button, but I was like well inherently wrong

5654
03:49:13,160 --> 03:49:15,960
But I think really wrong. I think it's easy to overdo it

5655
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:19,320
I think it's easy to overdo it like like I typed in cyber show and I get this

5656
03:49:19,480 --> 03:49:21,320
Yeah, that's a clip from one of my videos

5657
03:49:21,480 --> 03:49:25,960
You can like do a cycle animation where you make Sonic do all his little do all the different animations

5658
03:49:25,960 --> 03:49:28,920
He can do in the game and it looks funny. It looks funny

5659
03:49:29,800 --> 03:49:33,000
Funny and that was uh back in the early days of cyber show

5660
03:49:34,120 --> 03:49:36,120
The early back in the LP days

5661
03:49:37,560 --> 03:49:39,560
Uh

5662
03:49:39,640 --> 03:49:40,680
I um

5663
03:49:40,680 --> 03:49:47,160
Yeah, I can't I should we do it with a whole podcast. It's just boomers bitching about the you know

5664
03:49:47,880 --> 03:49:53,480
Best boomers bitching about being old. Yeah two two bad two boomers bitching about

5665
03:49:53,880 --> 03:49:56,680
Can we just complain about tick tock and how I hate it?

5666
03:49:57,880 --> 03:50:00,680
I do hate tick tock. I can I I don't even want to hate tick

5667
03:50:00,680 --> 03:50:04,120
I don't even want to be that guy who's old and hates tick tock, but it's a very little video

5668
03:50:04,200 --> 03:50:09,080
Come on. You don't even give me a choice. What blows my mind is like I just I realized literally yesterday

5669
03:50:09,560 --> 03:50:15,880
That is like, oh, I need to use tick tock. You know, I hate it. Um, wait, why my because uh

5670
03:50:16,680 --> 03:50:24,120
The reach there is ridiculous. You're ignoring a separate youtube. It's not just like a couple zoomies on there. It's a huge ecosystem

5671
03:50:24,200 --> 03:50:29,800
Let me explain this to you my my friend my friend. Okay. She started a tick tock

5672
03:50:30,440 --> 03:50:31,880
yesterday

5673
03:50:31,880 --> 03:50:38,600
And uploaded a video of her a couple videos and like three parts of her unboxing this like uh my hero academia figure in

5674
03:50:39,640 --> 03:50:45,480
15 hours her video's got 400,000 views. She gained 2,000 followers and got 50,000 likes

5675
03:50:45,800 --> 03:50:47,800
This is where people are getting famous now

5676
03:50:49,960 --> 03:50:54,520
But where's the money I'm already a later. No, we're already too late. We're already stuck on youtube

5677
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:59,480
I should do the algorithm. Um, but yeah, I mean it's not though because she just made her account like two days ago

5678
03:50:59,560 --> 03:51:03,800
And it's all and like got 2,000 followers right off the bat. Like but that's the same

5679
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:05,800
Yeah

5680
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:09,480
I don't what what could you put on there?

5681
03:51:09,560 --> 03:51:11,560
though the like anything

5682
03:51:12,200 --> 03:51:16,840
Anything it has a separate like me. I guess if there's anything then there's no no right probably

5683
03:51:16,920 --> 03:51:20,440
Have you uh, have any of you seen the youtube shorts thing?

5684
03:51:21,320 --> 03:51:24,120
Oh, yeah, the only shorts I watch are yours honestly

5685
03:51:24,680 --> 03:51:29,080
I haven't watched mine. Oh, do you do you post? Yeah, you want you post the little tips and tricks

5686
03:51:29,480 --> 03:51:35,000
Little tips and yeah, that's what I've been um, I've actually been experimenting with the youtube shorts thing because um

5687
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:39,240
A fellow lp or that I know named karma jolt

5688
03:51:40,280 --> 03:51:44,120
He was doing the the shorts like uh sometime last year

5689
03:51:44,920 --> 03:51:48,040
And uh, he just exploded in popularity all of a sudden

5690
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:53,800
Like he went from 700 subscribers to 20,000 subscribers in just a few months

5691
03:51:54,360 --> 03:52:00,120
YouTube was like pushing shorts really hard like it has like a separate virality thing like on the front page

5692
03:52:00,120 --> 03:52:04,680
There's like a tab for shorts and like if you're not making shorts, you're not even playing that part of the game

5693
03:52:04,680 --> 03:52:06,680
You know what I mean? You're missing

5694
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:13,800
It sucks to be missing on I know just when you do youtube shorts, uh, the algorithm will push your video much more aggressively

5695
03:52:14,040 --> 03:52:17,000
Regardless of what size your channel is because they want to kill tick

5696
03:52:17,960 --> 03:52:22,280
Which is why they're pushing. I mean the nice thing is that like if you start using youtube shorts

5697
03:52:22,280 --> 03:52:25,800
You might as well just post them on tiktok. It's exactly right. That's sort of what I was like

5698
03:52:25,880 --> 03:52:28,040
I was like, I just don't really see them on my channel and then I was like

5699
03:52:28,120 --> 03:52:30,680
I'm just lazy but like I see I see in theory why they're doing it

5700
03:52:30,680 --> 03:52:35,160
It doesn't make sense like it is objectively algorithmically smart to be fucking around with those shorts. Yes

5701
03:52:36,680 --> 03:52:40,920
I don't I don't like engaging in social media that I don't

5702
03:52:41,480 --> 03:52:47,800
Actively watch and engage with myself. Yeah, I don't post that's the problem is that every time I've tried to like

5703
03:52:47,960 --> 03:52:49,960
Okay, let's see what this tiktok thing is about

5704
03:52:50,680 --> 03:52:52,680
I just hate it like I just

5705
03:52:53,320 --> 03:52:58,760
It doesn't connect with me at all because like I like sitting down and watching a youtube video that has like some feet on its bones

5706
03:52:59,080 --> 03:53:00,760
tiktok is just like

5707
03:53:00,760 --> 03:53:03,240
30 seconds of like bite size by design

5708
03:53:03,880 --> 03:53:07,240
It's it's like designed for like I don't even want to get too boomery about it

5709
03:53:07,240 --> 03:53:12,680
But like it's like we've been breeding attention spans smaller and smaller and we've basically gotten about as small as we can go

5710
03:53:12,760 --> 03:53:16,680
Or like 30 15 to 30 second videos are like the what people are aiming for you know

5711
03:53:16,680 --> 03:53:19,880
I mean that used to be like abnormal on youtube like I have a meme channel

5712
03:53:19,960 --> 03:53:24,120
I'll post 15 30 second videos on but not like that's not a real youtube video, you know

5713
03:53:25,080 --> 03:53:30,440
Yeah, I think it just because I like I'm so like focused on like the youtube format in terms of like if I was going to make

5714
03:53:30,520 --> 03:53:35,160
Video content. That's what I want to do that moving over to that

5715
03:53:35,880 --> 03:53:38,360
Like I don't even like know how it changed

5716
03:53:39,560 --> 03:53:45,800
My content to suit it. I wouldn't even know what to make that's really kind of the thing that why I haven't ever messed around with shorts either

5717
03:53:45,800 --> 03:53:47,560
It's like what can I

5718
03:53:47,560 --> 03:53:48,520
do

5719
03:53:48,520 --> 03:53:51,480
Right, you need a different style of content. You can't just yeah

5720
03:53:52,120 --> 03:53:56,840
Can't just go over with any type of content like if you have no idea what you're doing

5721
03:53:57,480 --> 03:54:00,280
Or why you're doing it. It's going to suffer

5722
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:03,560
Compared to people who have like good ideas

5723
03:54:04,200 --> 03:54:08,680
Or passion behind like oh, I love tiktok and I love doing this stuff and they're gonna just

5724
03:54:09,400 --> 03:54:14,440
They're gonna have an audience that enjoys tiktok content and if you're right the kids will just be in tiktok audience

5725
03:54:14,840 --> 03:54:20,200
Yeah, you'll you'll be stuck doing those things. I mean, I guess you could do a short little like animation

5726
03:54:20,360 --> 03:54:25,640
Because I do like 3d model stuff feel a little short animation. Yeah, well that would be good for animation for sure

5727
03:54:26,040 --> 03:54:28,040
At least there's that you could have a little looping thing

5728
03:54:28,200 --> 03:54:30,920
I just try to I think of the stuff you already have would be really good

5729
03:54:31,000 --> 03:54:37,560
Actually, I try to think of the limitations of the the format and find some way to make it interesting to me and the viewers

5730
03:54:37,640 --> 03:54:40,520
So I um right that's I mean that's the best way to look at it

5731
03:54:40,520 --> 03:54:44,200
You know art comes from adversity like it's not like having a shorter amount of time

5732
03:54:44,200 --> 03:54:47,880
Doesn't necessarily mean you have to make worse videos. You just have to think harder

5733
03:54:47,960 --> 03:54:50,920
But I don't know I just have to change the what you're doing and I'm not sure

5734
03:54:51,400 --> 03:54:57,080
Exactly, right, but I totally get your point like I don't use tiktok. I'm not tuned into the things that go viral on tiktok

5735
03:54:57,160 --> 03:55:00,200
So like it's just gonna I'm gonna be at a disadvantage in either way

5736
03:55:00,200 --> 03:55:03,800
You know what I mean? I don't like start using it and I don't know if I want to go down that

5737
03:55:04,520 --> 03:55:11,080
Something about the way the site is like like so focused on like lip syncing is like abhorrent to me

5738
03:55:11,160 --> 03:55:16,520
I just hate everything about it. Basically. I think it's grown to be more because I just know the stats and like

5739
03:55:17,240 --> 03:55:19,240
It has more than twitter already

5740
03:55:19,560 --> 03:55:23,160
Right or downloads and all that. It's massive gargantuan ecosystem

5741
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:26,280
And that's why I was like, yeah, it doesn't really make sense to completely ignore it

5742
03:55:26,360 --> 03:55:29,240
But I don't know. I'm just too lazy to make a tiktok

5743
03:55:29,800 --> 03:55:35,560
I think the short thing is uh good for like scripted content because normally when you script something

5744
03:55:35,640 --> 03:55:38,040
It takes a long time if you're doing like a long

5745
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:40,840
Uh video and it takes forever to put out the video

5746
03:55:40,920 --> 03:55:44,120
But when you're just doing 30 seconds to a minute, right?

5747
03:55:44,280 --> 03:55:48,280
It allows you to script stuff and put videos out at a faster pace

5748
03:55:48,760 --> 03:55:53,240
Right and you're for your little series of like game tips and tricks and like cheats

5749
03:55:53,320 --> 03:55:56,920
Like I feel like a good like people want the videos to be short for those kinds of videos

5750
03:55:57,000 --> 03:55:59,800
You know what I mean? Like the shortness sort of works in its favor. You know what I mean?

5751
03:55:59,960 --> 03:56:02,120
Yeah, it just seems like the perfect uh combination

5752
03:56:03,240 --> 03:56:04,440
I

5753
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:08,840
On the completely opposite side of like oh intentions getting shorter and shorter

5754
03:56:09,320 --> 03:56:14,360
Um, Noah called will jevaze. Oh, yeah, his resident evil video. Did you watch his resident?

5755
03:56:14,840 --> 03:56:18,120
I watched the seven hour resident evil video. I'm very close to the end

5756
03:56:18,600 --> 03:56:25,800
I'm on resident evil seven. He's seven hours. Yeah, it's he he's his videos are really good

5757
03:56:25,880 --> 03:56:30,760
They're often very very long very thorough very in-depth like great analysis

5758
03:56:31,560 --> 03:56:36,280
Uh, that's witty and not like stupid. Yeah, he doesn't get bogged down

5759
03:56:36,360 --> 03:56:39,720
It doesn't it's like a seven hour video that is packed full

5760
03:56:40,520 --> 03:56:46,040
With like literally he literally could have just he could have just like divided it up and be like here's my video on

5761
03:56:46,040 --> 03:56:48,920
Resident Evil 1 here's my video resident evil 2 like people wouldn't have even thought it was weird

5762
03:56:49,000 --> 03:56:52,600
But like it's just like he literally just chose to do it all in one video because you know, why not?

5763
03:56:53,160 --> 03:56:55,160
I can't I can't imagine

5764
03:56:55,480 --> 03:57:01,960
Scripting out a seven hour video that would take yeah, that would take months. The thing is like somebody will hear how many pages that is

5765
03:57:02,200 --> 03:57:06,600
He um, like you'll hear him like read stuff and somebody will hear him like make a little mistake or something in the video

5766
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:10,440
And it's like whatever and pardon me was like, oh, that's kind of like unprofessional in a weird way

5767
03:57:10,440 --> 03:57:12,760
But then I was like, you know what at the end of the day

5768
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:16,040
It was like literally who gives a fuck if I can hear him do a mouse click it doesn't

5769
03:57:16,440 --> 03:57:17,960
Know it's always been like that

5770
03:57:17,960 --> 03:57:23,480
He's always just like he just leaves his like miss his like miss words and like he'll stumble and he'll just leave it

5771
03:57:23,480 --> 03:57:25,400
It's just funny because like I would never do that to me

5772
03:57:25,400 --> 03:57:28,200
I would be like, oh god, I gotta re-record that, you know, but it's like at the end of the day

5773
03:57:28,200 --> 03:57:29,880
He made me realize like I don't even need to do that

5774
03:57:29,880 --> 03:57:34,120
You know what I mean? Like he doesn't care and like the end the audience doesn't care and I don't so yeah, it doesn't matter

5775
03:57:34,120 --> 03:57:36,120
Yeah, I had the same realization

5776
03:57:37,080 --> 03:57:39,400
Well, now there's no reason to you know, try to make videos

5777
03:57:39,400 --> 03:57:44,440
I sure ever but like there's no reason to overly get obsessed with your presentation to the point where it's like a problem

5778
03:57:44,440 --> 03:57:46,760
You know what I mean? Like I appreciate that sort of minimalistic

5779
03:57:47,320 --> 03:57:52,840
I would I would rather him make twice as many videos than half as many and I actually really appreciate all the little verbal

5780
03:57:52,920 --> 03:57:56,120
That his shit's not that flashy like his video like his page run credit to him

5781
03:57:56,120 --> 03:57:58,920
Just standing in front of the camera reading off a list, you know, I mean it's so long

5782
03:57:59,000 --> 03:58:01,480
It's him say for like 15 minutes just reading names

5783
03:58:01,560 --> 03:58:03,640
It's a half an hour at the end of the video

5784
03:58:03,640 --> 03:58:08,600
I agree with you like I who sits through that who doesn't just immediately turn the video off as soon as they get to that part

5785
03:58:08,680 --> 03:58:12,840
Like it's gotten to the point that I I can't like I understand the I totally get why he does that

5786
03:58:12,840 --> 03:58:16,200
He said in his thing. I'm if you give me a certain amount of money, I'll little read your name off

5787
03:58:16,280 --> 03:58:19,480
But like it's it's become cumbersome. It's become so long and almost

5788
03:58:19,880 --> 03:58:24,920
Unlike counterproductive. I don't know. I like that aspect. It's it doesn't hurt the video because you can just turn it off

5789
03:58:24,920 --> 03:58:30,120
Exactly. It's not like oh, he better stop doing that. Like I don't care in that for a second. It's just it's a very long at this point

5790
03:58:30,280 --> 03:58:34,120
It's not a very silent. It's not sometimes I'll hear like hear my friends names. The reason I brought him up though

5791
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:36,600
um was

5792
03:58:36,600 --> 03:58:41,320
As a contrast to the tiktok stuff and it shows right because he's getting more

5793
03:58:41,640 --> 03:58:44,600
attention than he used to have like he was a lot smaller and

5794
03:58:44,920 --> 03:58:49,560
Niche and people are discovering his stuff and like it's so good and there's so much of it

5795
03:58:50,040 --> 03:58:54,840
That it's you're absolutely right. Give that like it's not just short videos. It gives me like hope that like

5796
03:58:55,400 --> 03:59:01,560
Like long form good stuff is not like going out of there's there's definitely a split here

5797
03:59:01,560 --> 03:59:07,320
There's a split here the the the shame a seven hour pokemon analysis did gangbusters. It's got like a million and a half views

5798
03:59:07,320 --> 03:59:09,960
I'm sure it's made like I'm sure it's made like $10,000

5799
03:59:11,480 --> 03:59:14,760
Becoming so long is like it becomes like the point of I have noticed that

5800
03:59:15,320 --> 03:59:17,960
A lot of uh longer form videos are getting popular

5801
03:59:18,040 --> 03:59:22,120
Which is why I thought well, what if I if I tried doing both of those

5802
03:59:22,200 --> 03:59:27,560
You know the short videos and a couple of long videos every I think the reason that they're both getting really successful

5803
03:59:27,640 --> 03:59:32,200
Is that like the short videos like shorts are just like people like actively watching a little bite-sized things

5804
03:59:32,440 --> 03:59:34,600
And then the long videos are like, oh, I gotta do something

5805
03:59:34,680 --> 03:59:36,520
I'll put this over to a new tab

5806
03:59:36,520 --> 03:59:39,000
And I'll just like do whatever I need to do play my game

5807
03:59:39,400 --> 03:59:41,960
Watch do my homework whatever while it's playing in the background

5808
03:59:42,200 --> 03:59:45,800
I would love if there was like an analytic to show how much of like like

5809
03:59:47,080 --> 03:59:53,080
Watch time is like actually looking at the video versus playing in the background because I guarantee you videos like that is like 90

5810
03:59:53,400 --> 03:59:58,520
We were talking about that like yes, so many people use youtube as like youtube videos as like podcasts

5811
03:59:58,520 --> 03:59:59,560
You know what I mean?

5812
03:59:59,560 --> 04:00:04,040
Either on a separate monitor or on a separate tab so they can't even literally can't even see it at all

5813
04:00:04,120 --> 04:00:05,720
Right, I mean like so and you're right

5814
04:00:05,720 --> 04:00:10,920
So if you could see this that's an image on the screen and then they have to tab over to check you have to look at the screen

5815
04:00:10,920 --> 04:00:13,000
You can't be this is a visual podcast now

5816
04:00:13,720 --> 04:00:16,200
But that's probably why it would be better to

5817
04:00:17,240 --> 04:00:22,440
Focus on the scripting more than everything else right that is honestly the most important part. Yeah

5818
04:00:23,400 --> 04:00:26,680
It's it's kind of weird that it is like if you if you could look at the stats

5819
04:00:26,680 --> 04:00:27,800
It would be some

5820
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:33,000
Dishearteningly huge number like 50% of the people who watch your videos don't actually physically watch your videos

5821
04:00:34,920 --> 04:00:39,400
But like yeah, why does he care? He doesn't even like I mean sometimes he'll show relevant games

5822
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:42,680
No, I was saying that's like smart for Noah Gervais to like his he does right

5823
04:00:42,680 --> 04:00:48,120
He doesn't have flash yet any he basically has relevant but not like super duper relevant videos of what's going on

5824
04:00:48,120 --> 04:00:49,800
You know, which is the smart way to do it honestly

5825
04:00:49,800 --> 04:00:52,520
But I like to you know people guys like me and you guys like Nate, you know

5826
04:00:52,840 --> 04:00:56,600
Get so obsessed with the visual editing in the visual language of it all which is like just you know

5827
04:00:57,560 --> 04:01:00,360
Not that it doesn't matter, but it's not as matter

5828
04:01:00,680 --> 04:01:06,360
It matters more for certain kinds of videos. You're right. It does depend a lot on the specific kind of video essays

5829
04:01:06,520 --> 04:01:09,240
Yeah, I feel like it mostly is about the audio

5830
04:01:10,200 --> 04:01:11,160
and

5831
04:01:11,160 --> 04:01:15,000
I mean if you're making like a 15 to 20 minute like dense video

5832
04:01:15,160 --> 04:01:16,680
You definitely want good

5833
04:01:16,680 --> 04:01:21,080
I think most people are probably or a good amount of people are going to watch that because it's short enough to like

5834
04:01:21,080 --> 04:01:22,040
I'm like

5835
04:01:22,040 --> 04:01:27,160
I know like when I was like Trixie all the time with like make food and then go downstairs and watch a YouTube video

5836
04:01:27,320 --> 04:01:31,160
Like actively engage with it while eating then be done and move on to whatever else they do

5837
04:01:31,560 --> 04:01:37,320
So like I'm sure like people find little chunks of time in their day to like watch a dense video like that

5838
04:01:37,560 --> 04:01:39,880
But I think if you're going for like an hour plus like

5839
04:01:40,760 --> 04:01:42,760
Just do the bare minimum for visuals. Yeah

5840
04:01:42,920 --> 04:01:49,000
Don't get too bogged down on every single like thing on screen being perfectly relevant to the sentence

5841
04:01:49,000 --> 04:01:54,360
You're saying especially for hour long because it takes so long to do good video visual editing on hour plus long videos

5842
04:01:54,360 --> 04:01:59,400
So it might take you to do it, but it's hard take years if you're going to do something seven hours long

5843
04:02:00,200 --> 04:02:02,760
Imagine working on one video for a couple of years

5844
04:02:03,320 --> 04:02:09,560
It's interesting like you can imagine trick people into thinking you have decent editing when you actually don't if you just cut

5845
04:02:09,640 --> 04:02:13,160
With like every like yeah, do it on the rhythm do it like so yeah

5846
04:02:13,240 --> 04:02:17,080
They're constantly seeing new things like just put be putting in new fucking images or cutting to things

5847
04:02:17,160 --> 04:02:22,520
As long as you cut with the speech rhythm it feels like there's actual editing even though you're just I had to realize that

5848
04:02:22,520 --> 04:02:25,160
Keep their neurons fired. I try not to be too cynical about it

5849
04:02:25,160 --> 04:02:30,520
But I was like, you know a lot of people watching videos are just like dumb sheep and they just want things to be flashing in front of their eyes

5850
04:02:30,600 --> 04:02:32,760
So don't let them get bored. You can't let them get bored

5851
04:02:34,440 --> 04:02:39,240
But like 100 it really is true though. Honestly like when you're thinking as an entertainer you really have to be like

5852
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:44,440
Okay, don't you can't give them any debate or got to keep them visually interested or if not visually then you know

5853
04:02:45,000 --> 04:02:45,880
It depends on the kind of video

5854
04:02:45,880 --> 04:02:48,280
I guess we said that a few times one thing that really

5855
04:02:48,840 --> 04:02:52,520
annoys me a rubs me it makes me click off immediately is if there's like

5856
04:02:52,840 --> 04:02:56,760
You know a video about some subject or whatever and it starts with like an editing

5857
04:02:57,400 --> 04:03:02,360
Slash voiceover like comedy bit that doesn't land. I'm like, okay

5858
04:03:03,640 --> 04:03:05,640
Humor is definitely a mixed bag where it's like

5859
04:03:06,120 --> 04:03:09,400
If you're being funny, it just wasn't it was like it felt like a

5860
04:03:11,240 --> 04:03:17,240
If you're gonna lead with a joke it better not be annoying. That's why it became such a meme like so many bad reviewers

5861
04:03:17,240 --> 04:03:21,720
Like like jokes that are just they have the sound and sense and like

5862
04:03:22,280 --> 04:03:24,280
structure of like what a joke is but

5863
04:03:24,840 --> 04:03:29,160
I don't feel like they found it funny when they wrote it or decided to do it and they're like

5864
04:03:29,160 --> 04:03:33,960
Oh, we need to put in a joke here because when I watch reviews they put in for a joke time for a wacky edit

5865
04:03:34,040 --> 04:03:35,240
Something I really

5866
04:03:35,240 --> 04:03:39,800
Genuinely appreciated about like know what your face is that he doesn't feel the need to needlessly insert jokes

5867
04:03:39,800 --> 04:03:43,320
I'll have like one joke an hour, but it'll actually be a funny joke. You know what I mean?

5868
04:03:43,640 --> 04:03:47,080
Yeah, probably because he actually thought the joke was good and not because it

5869
04:03:48,440 --> 04:03:54,040
Right. Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't just put them in because he wants and they help him if he thinks if something comes up

5870
04:03:54,120 --> 04:03:55,880
It's not like you have to rid them

5871
04:03:55,880 --> 04:03:59,800
You know jokes are pretty difficult to do you can't just write something and it's good

5872
04:03:59,800 --> 04:04:06,200
You have to kind of workshop it and polish it and just doing one joke can take a very large amount of time

5873
04:04:06,840 --> 04:04:11,000
Right and it's sort of mean to say but some people just aren't fucking funny and if you're not funny

5874
04:04:11,400 --> 04:04:14,520
That's fine. Just don't try to be funny. Just make your video and don't

5875
04:04:15,160 --> 04:04:17,160
Be unfunny in it. I have

5876
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:22,120
I remember many times for my own like hypocrite videos where I

5877
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:27,560
Was writing and I'm like I gotta put some joke in there and I did just put it in there

5878
04:04:27,560 --> 04:04:32,760
And I didn't find it funny at the time. I still don't that and I'm like, oh this sucks

5879
04:04:32,920 --> 04:04:36,360
Oh, I'm such a fucking loser for doing that

5880
04:04:36,680 --> 04:04:41,880
Well, I think most of your jokes were pretty good if I remember people don't know though. Yeah, sometimes

5881
04:04:42,280 --> 04:04:46,280
it's it's fine and people don't recognize that because like

5882
04:04:47,400 --> 04:04:48,520
comedy

5883
04:04:48,520 --> 04:04:51,720
Senses of humor differ some people find everything funny

5884
04:04:52,360 --> 04:04:56,280
Some people have very strict like it needs to be like very funny for me to laugh

5885
04:04:58,360 --> 04:05:00,360
Doing good comedy is hard

5886
04:05:00,520 --> 04:05:04,280
It's it's different than when you're just doing a straight analysis where you can just

5887
04:05:04,920 --> 04:05:08,840
Write stuff and you don't have to think too hard about everything you're writing

5888
04:05:08,840 --> 04:05:14,120
But when you write a joke, you have to write one line and you really have to spend a lot of time on it

5889
04:05:14,840 --> 04:05:17,400
Just going over it and thinking, you know, is this really funny?

5890
04:05:17,960 --> 04:05:21,800
Maybe you have to tell it to someone and see if they react to it

5891
04:05:22,600 --> 04:05:24,600
You know, like one line takes forever

5892
04:05:25,560 --> 04:05:29,080
With a you know, with a joke or one like skit or one sketch you're gonna do

5893
04:05:29,640 --> 04:05:34,440
You gotta get your tight five. It's easy to like just pat out like an analytical video

5894
04:05:34,520 --> 04:05:38,760
It's way harder to like pat out just insert five minutes of like jokes, you know

5895
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:41,720
I mean like I guess you can't do it, but it's harder for them to be good

5896
04:05:41,960 --> 04:05:46,360
It's harder for them to be good, you know, you can't pat out the comedy and have it still be funny

5897
04:05:47,080 --> 04:05:51,320
Right, but some people really feel like they need it like they they've watched they grew up watching videos of a certain way

5898
04:05:51,320 --> 04:05:53,480
You know like angry video game nerd nostalgia critic

5899
04:05:53,480 --> 04:05:58,600
They just they just in their mind a youtube video has of guy and standing in front of a camera making bad jokes

5900
04:05:58,600 --> 04:06:02,280
Like that's just like what it is in their mind's eye. They can't envision it without that

5901
04:06:03,240 --> 04:06:05,240
Which is not you gotta be thinking

5902
04:06:05,880 --> 04:06:09,400
The more you think about what you're doing the better it'll probably be probably

5903
04:06:11,640 --> 04:06:13,480
Nah

5904
04:06:13,480 --> 04:06:17,400
It is kind of funny that youtube and I don't know tick talking to social media in general

5905
04:06:17,400 --> 04:06:21,720
Does seem to want to like prioritize like don't be like thinking about your content

5906
04:06:21,720 --> 04:06:24,440
Just be filming everything just be pumping out vlogs, you know

5907
04:06:25,000 --> 04:06:28,360
You don't need to think about your content. You just need to make it as fast as you can

5908
04:06:29,880 --> 04:06:34,600
Right. Yeah, that's what works best for that because they make the most money. I do dislike that though

5909
04:06:35,640 --> 04:06:37,800
I I I prefer thoughtful content

5910
04:06:39,160 --> 04:06:41,160
I mean does it does it make

5911
04:06:41,400 --> 04:06:42,680
I guess it

5912
04:06:42,680 --> 04:06:44,680
Does it make more money if you're like a family

5913
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:48,520
Channel and you can be putting out videos daily that get like

5914
04:06:49,240 --> 04:06:51,640
Does it mean more ads does the shorter less

5915
04:06:53,240 --> 04:06:55,560
Most people aren't watching youtube with an ad blocker

5916
04:06:55,640 --> 04:06:59,960
So if there's like a billion bad videos and you're looking for something to watch you have to click through 10 videos

5917
04:06:59,960 --> 04:07:03,960
That's 10 ads youtube gets to make instead of you landing on right video and that's sort of

5918
04:07:04,600 --> 04:07:08,440
That's sort of why youtube is like doing this thing where it's favoring really long content

5919
04:07:08,440 --> 04:07:13,400
Which can have tons and tons of ads shoved in or just lots of short content that will chain into each other

5920
04:07:13,400 --> 04:07:17,560
You know what I mean and be like, uh, well auto plays on by default. I think they keep on so yeah

5921
04:07:17,560 --> 04:07:20,360
They just love to have shit auto play from one video to the next to the next

5922
04:07:21,080 --> 04:07:27,080
Well, here's an idea. What if you just made a really long video and then you cut it up into a bunch of short videos

5923
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:29,080
And you just upload everything

5924
04:07:29,480 --> 04:07:31,480
what

5925
04:07:32,120 --> 04:07:33,640
Couldn't if you guys were smart

5926
04:07:33,640 --> 04:07:40,440
You would be recording one podcast like this a month and then breaking up another 10 minute chunks, which are we should 10 ads

5927
04:07:41,160 --> 04:07:44,920
We should cut this podcast up into like like youtube short length

5928
04:07:47,160 --> 04:07:51,880
300 different youtube short seconds, then you're really going to be playing the algorithm

5929
04:07:53,080 --> 04:07:55,080
Do you think of all the ads?

5930
04:07:55,080 --> 04:07:56,920
Think of all the content

5931
04:07:56,920 --> 04:07:58,440
Oh my god

5932
04:07:58,440 --> 04:08:02,040
You should be ideally aiming for a one-to-one is wasted content

5933
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:05,560
Exactly you should be aiming for a one-to-one ad to content ratio

5934
04:08:05,560 --> 04:08:09,320
You're spending half your time watching ads and half your time actually getting around to watch the content

5935
04:08:10,200 --> 04:08:12,200
It's dystopian

5936
04:08:14,200 --> 04:08:16,200
Um, just uh, just just

5937
04:08:16,600 --> 04:08:22,600
But it's like and then we can release a new tick tock size clip of the podcast like every fucking

5938
04:08:23,480 --> 04:08:30,280
Five minutes for like the next week and the algorithm will be like, oh, they're all everyone is watching so many of these videos

5939
04:08:30,360 --> 04:08:32,360
Like the algorithms exploding

5940
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:37,560
It is stupid shit like that where it's like that would be an increase in like views to the channel

5941
04:08:37,960 --> 04:08:42,520
Technically probably just because of how many videos you'd be pumping out. So the algorithm would like be looking at your channel

5942
04:08:43,160 --> 04:08:46,680
Looks like it's doing good right now. The terrible thing is that that might actually work

5943
04:08:47,560 --> 04:08:52,120
Yeah, the sad part is it would work better than anything. Obviously to the degree. We're saying which was ridiculous like

5944
04:08:53,240 --> 04:08:55,400
301 minute shorts would be kind of clog people's feet up

5945
04:08:55,400 --> 04:09:00,440
But like in general just taking content and just shopping it up and cramming in as many ads

5946
04:09:01,160 --> 04:09:03,160
It is a smart thing to do frame

5947
04:09:03,400 --> 04:09:09,960
Yeah, one frame videos at a time like you can't even get any shorter than upload them every every four nanoseconds

5948
04:09:11,720 --> 04:09:16,760
I have a weird respect for these people who can just churn out content like dsp the dark side fill

5949
04:09:16,760 --> 04:09:20,440
How many videos do you have now dsp gaming has 59

5950
04:09:21,000 --> 04:09:27,400
Thousand videos on his youtube account 59. What the thousand? It's because every single day. He's doing this. He's upload

5951
04:09:27,400 --> 04:09:33,000
He's um, he's putting out segmented live streams like multiple parts every single day

5952
04:09:33,480 --> 04:09:35,480
How many minutes does he do like

5953
04:09:37,560 --> 04:09:43,400
I went to the channel uh one time and I saw that he does like five six ten videos a day or something like that

5954
04:09:43,400 --> 04:09:48,520
Yeah, he'll like stream on twitch or something. I can't remember and then he'll split them all up into one hour long videos

5955
04:09:48,520 --> 04:09:53,240
So he'll usually stream like six eight hours a day. So that's like six eight videos a day for like 10 plus years

5956
04:09:54,120 --> 04:09:58,440
So if you're a phil fan, you'll be you'll be happy for the rest of your life. You'll never

5957
04:10:03,000 --> 04:10:07,000
That is impressive. I'm right. That's what I mean. Like he's really gaming the system

5958
04:10:07,000 --> 04:10:14,040
I guess his video is only get between like 200 to 900 views, but he puts out so fucking many every single fucking day

5959
04:10:15,800 --> 04:10:19,400
I like big number. That's I like I I'm a fan now

5960
04:10:20,120 --> 04:10:24,920
He you can't help but respect it a little bit the the sheer grind of this man

5961
04:10:25,160 --> 04:10:27,160
He can't be as dumb as he looks

5962
04:10:27,560 --> 04:10:29,560
He seems to know what he's doing something right

5963
04:10:30,200 --> 04:10:32,200
Man, I sure do hate what he does

5964
04:10:32,360 --> 04:10:36,120
But I just respect the hell that he just keeps doing his content

5965
04:10:36,200 --> 04:10:39,400
But I respect to the degree to which he churns it out in a mechanical way

5966
04:10:40,040 --> 04:10:46,200
Dedication is something so dumb. I'm a I've come around and become a big a big fan. I'm a big phil guy now

5967
04:10:47,080 --> 04:10:49,080
Hmm

5968
04:10:50,280 --> 04:10:52,280
Wow, that was a long fucking tangent

5969
04:10:52,840 --> 04:10:57,000
To go on. I was a tangent upon tangents. It was something something related to a voicemail

5970
04:10:57,000 --> 04:11:03,640
But I can't even remember we've got we've got exactly one voicemail left. Oh, good. We did it. I know

5971
04:11:04,200 --> 04:11:07,240
Wait, unless wait, maybe there's an extra one. No

5972
04:11:07,800 --> 04:11:14,200
I can't believe you accept voicemails like like you refresh the page as we're doing the episode until we finish

5973
04:11:14,360 --> 04:11:18,360
Until we finish recording you can sneak them in at the last second. Don't tell them that

5974
04:11:19,000 --> 04:11:21,000
Yeah, don't tell them that it's too late.

5975
04:11:21,640 --> 04:11:25,400
Next week, we're going to get like 50 voicemails in the last 20 minutes

5976
04:11:25,880 --> 04:11:30,680
Wait until you guys are doing the episode and then just like non-stop start cranking out voicemails

5977
04:11:30,680 --> 04:11:33,160
Like you get your friends to like putting out like three or four a minute

5978
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:36,600
So you just like it's like you can't finish them. There's too many coming in at once

5979
04:11:36,600 --> 04:11:40,040
That'd be a great prank Ben is giving everyone tips on how to harass

5980
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:44,200
To pcp with voicemails. Yeah, because I'm not a coward

5981
04:11:45,320 --> 04:11:49,880
Ben takes pleasure in making the rest of us suffer through all of these give them a road map

5982
04:11:51,480 --> 04:11:56,600
A little not only do you give them tips, but you actively are like I will never screen any calls

5983
04:11:56,680 --> 04:11:59,640
You can put anything you want in these calls anything

5984
04:12:00,600 --> 04:12:05,720
That's including that's my that's my gig. That's my that's my gig

5985
04:12:06,440 --> 04:12:11,160
Uh, anyway, let's play this last one. It's called the human comedy perpetuates itself

5986
04:12:11,640 --> 04:12:13,640
three two one go

5987
04:12:14,200 --> 04:12:15,880
By 2050

5988
04:12:15,880 --> 04:12:19,640
The the new pcp pcp next generation will be composed of

5989
04:12:20,360 --> 04:12:22,360
May and neaton house, baby

5990
04:12:23,160 --> 04:12:26,440
Uh, a fully artificial intelligence version of azumi

5991
04:12:27,240 --> 04:12:29,240
Tom because tom will never die

5992
04:12:29,720 --> 04:12:32,760
Uh cyber shell and monkey jones

5993
04:12:33,560 --> 04:12:35,560
That's gonna be the next generation

5994
04:12:35,960 --> 04:12:39,800
That's quite a lineup. It's like star trek the next generation, but I

5995
04:12:40,360 --> 04:12:42,920
I think I would go with sigh instead of monkey jones

5996
04:12:43,480 --> 04:12:47,400
Did I mention that I asked sigh if he wanted to guess and he just straight up was like no no

5997
04:12:47,800 --> 04:12:52,920
Oh now now he's too good for the pcp. Yeah, now. He suddenly is too good

5998
04:12:54,040 --> 04:12:59,640
You would have done it five years ago when it was yeah, you know when it was relevant it mattered at all

5999
04:13:00,280 --> 04:13:03,640
Give it now that it's useless and there's no point suddenly. You won't do it

6000
04:13:03,960 --> 04:13:08,440
What's that about just a tricksy fan boy like and so obviously you wouldn't want to be on the show now, right?

6001
04:13:09,400 --> 04:13:11,000
uh

6002
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:15,480
sigh was also a monkey friend, I think to a degree they they fell out

6003
04:13:16,680 --> 04:13:20,440
Yeah, that sounds about but they they liked each other at the time

6004
04:13:20,840 --> 04:13:27,320
Right. I don't know if it seemed always a bit weird to me like monkey would just make fun of sigh

6005
04:13:27,560 --> 04:13:29,560
I would be like yeah

6006
04:13:29,960 --> 04:13:34,920
When you're the butt of the joke, that's just how monkey acts towards everyone. I guess only we can have them on the podcast

6007
04:13:36,760 --> 04:13:42,680
He's performatively cruel just and then like makes a joke out of it. I guess that's just his thing

6008
04:13:43,560 --> 04:13:45,000
uh

6009
04:13:45,000 --> 04:13:49,880
We he wouldn't he didn't want to talk about tricksy and like I don't want to just have him on just for no reason

6010
04:13:50,840 --> 04:13:55,640
It wouldn't be no reason. It would be assembling the next generation of avengers to assemble

6011
04:13:56,360 --> 04:14:00,040
I I like that. It's just it's just tom. It's just cyborg tom

6012
04:14:01,400 --> 04:14:03,400
And like ai Izumi

6013
04:14:03,400 --> 04:14:04,760
That exists

6014
04:14:04,760 --> 04:14:10,920
Ai Izumi did monkey refuse to talk about trick me and Ethan Ralph's child. Did they say

6015
04:14:11,640 --> 04:14:15,240
Yeah, Ethan and Ethan and may his child is the the front man

6016
04:14:17,720 --> 04:14:22,840
He didn't exactly he just I asked him if he wanted to come on and talk about tricksy on the show

6017
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:27,960
And he just said I don't want to talk about her. That's very different from do you want to be on the show at all?

6018
04:14:30,200 --> 04:14:35,160
Well, yeah, no, I asked him specifically for that reason. Okay. Well, that's a different

6019
04:14:36,280 --> 04:14:40,600
Okay. Yeah, I that that's what I said. Okay. That's what they said. I have not changed my story

6020
04:14:41,240 --> 04:14:44,840
Um, that's a pretty uh pretty unusual reaction coming from him

6021
04:14:45,880 --> 04:14:52,440
Yeah, I was surprised. I don't know if the issue was um, but uh, uh, uh, uh, anyway

6022
04:14:53,480 --> 04:14:56,600
dead dead podcast, uh, new generation

6023
04:14:59,240 --> 04:15:03,320
Ethan and Ralph's fucking cursed. Ethan and May's cursed, baby. Uh,

6024
04:15:04,440 --> 04:15:06,920
Who else? I don't know. Whatever. Yeah, mum key jams. Why not?

6025
04:15:07,720 --> 04:15:13,720
Uh, I'm disappointed that I was Nate will finally come back to to take take the reins after the new generation

6026
04:15:14,680 --> 04:15:18,840
Our assembles after the rest of us are all dust except tom. Obviously

6027
04:15:19,800 --> 04:15:23,000
Um, I'm disappointed. I wasn't mentioned in that

6028
04:15:25,160 --> 04:15:28,360
Oh, you're oh, you're getting no, you're getting the ax along with the rest of us

6029
04:15:30,200 --> 04:15:33,480
Well, that's uh, then you can just ask me a question

6030
04:15:34,600 --> 04:15:39,160
You will not be spared in the revolution my friend

6031
04:15:41,640 --> 04:15:43,640
Okay, 360 no scope revolution

6032
04:15:44,600 --> 04:15:51,240
Exactly, I uh, I guess that's it. That's all the voicemails. Uh, what what do we do and the show

6033
04:15:52,360 --> 04:15:56,600
And the podcast and the podcast is the last episode. Chill the things

6034
04:15:57,320 --> 04:16:00,760
patreon.com slash the procrastinators for bonus episodes

6035
04:16:01,240 --> 04:16:04,520
One of these days we will get a whole bunch of those bonus episodes. Oh, yeah

6036
04:16:05,400 --> 04:16:08,520
Let's chill for love web again. Just put it at the top of the description. Oh, yeah

6037
04:16:08,840 --> 04:16:10,840
Go check out love web shadow

6038
04:16:11,560 --> 04:16:12,600
YouTube

6039
04:16:12,600 --> 04:16:16,120
If you haven't seen it yet, okay. Yeah, if you are like animation love web

6040
04:16:16,120 --> 04:16:19,400
If you're a pcp fan and you like somehow have not seen love web

6041
04:16:19,960 --> 04:16:23,560
What the fuck you're basically missing out on like some of the only new real

6042
04:16:24,040 --> 04:16:28,280
It's it's got ben's voice and it's got munchies. Oh, it's so good. You should watch it if you haven't watched it

6043
04:16:28,280 --> 04:16:32,920
What the fuck is your problem like seriously like you're seriously watching pcp in 2021

6044
04:16:32,920 --> 04:16:36,680
But you're not gonna like listen to us tell you to watch another thing. What is the point?

6045
04:16:37,400 --> 04:16:41,800
You piece of shit wasted wasted four hours of your life listening to our twaddle

6046
04:16:41,960 --> 04:16:45,320
And and you you could have been spending that you could have watched our love web

6047
04:16:45,400 --> 04:16:50,360
The problem is you have to you have to watch love web in its own tab this you can just put another tab

6048
04:16:51,400 --> 04:16:55,800
Yeah, that one isn't one of the videos you're talking about earlier. That's actually worth watching with your eyeballs

6049
04:16:56,360 --> 04:17:00,440
You're making a bold assumption that if somebody sat through all four four hours of this

6050
04:17:00,840 --> 04:17:02,840
Oh, I mean if they're listening to this point odds are

6051
04:17:02,920 --> 04:17:07,080
I'd say this is some how a dead podcast yet you the listener are listening to it right now

6052
04:17:07,160 --> 04:17:11,880
I think most people they just uh, most people they just click off after the voicemails start

6053
04:17:13,080 --> 04:17:17,080
No, most people those people skip directly to the voicemails. The voice mails are the best for the show

6054
04:17:17,640 --> 04:17:22,120
One person in the comments asked me. Can we just get a time stamp for the voicemails?

6055
04:17:22,120 --> 04:17:24,840
I just want to listen to the voicemails and I was like

6056
04:17:25,400 --> 04:17:30,680
What a Chad. What an absolute Chad. I could not believe it. That is uh, that's a sigma male move

6057
04:17:31,400 --> 04:17:35,560
Yeah, absolutely. I only want to listen to the part of the show that I'm on my voicemails

6058
04:17:36,120 --> 04:17:41,960
It might be it might be that maybe they maybe they're avoid if you're a voicemailer. I understand why you would prefer that segment

6059
04:17:42,760 --> 04:17:46,120
Uh, is sigma from megaman x a sigma male?

6060
04:17:48,200 --> 04:17:50,200
Yeah

6061
04:17:50,280 --> 04:17:51,880
I think so

6062
04:17:51,880 --> 04:17:56,760
He's he's alpha. He's the boss. I think wait. No, well, he's a renegade. So

6063
04:17:57,640 --> 04:17:59,640
Ah, jeez

6064
04:18:00,200 --> 04:18:05,720
patreon.com slash the procrastinators for the bonus episodes and the minecraft server

6065
04:18:05,800 --> 04:18:08,600
Yeah, I'm still another heckles for shackles. Yeah, let's do one this week

6066
04:18:08,600 --> 04:18:12,040
I'm still waiting for the bonus episode that you guys recorded. Uh,

6067
04:18:13,080 --> 04:18:15,080
I think cybershell and

6068
04:18:15,640 --> 04:18:21,240
Yeah, it was so long ago. It's it's edited. It just needs to get released. It was a dog's age ago

6069
04:18:22,120 --> 04:18:24,120
Yeah, I know but we um

6070
04:18:25,080 --> 04:18:28,440
We need to change the the the the the the

6071
04:18:29,160 --> 04:18:34,920
The um, what's the word the playlist the playlist url. Yeah, like non patrons have we should change it because like

6072
04:18:35,480 --> 04:18:38,440
The non patrons have access to you. It's time to update it

6073
04:18:38,520 --> 04:18:41,320
We need to do a little like a little some a little something

6074
04:18:41,880 --> 04:18:47,000
To keep it like to keep it, you know for the people who are actually you should just have a post

6075
04:18:47,400 --> 04:18:49,880
A pinned post which you can do on patreon

6076
04:18:50,440 --> 04:18:56,680
Where you just have links to all the episodes and don't don't have a playlist on youtube that way if you unplug you can't get to the post

6077
04:18:56,760 --> 04:18:58,760
You can't see the episode

6078
04:18:59,000 --> 04:19:00,360
Yeah

6079
04:19:00,360 --> 04:19:02,360
Yeah, that sounds reasonable

6080
04:19:02,360 --> 04:19:04,440
Maybe we should we should set it up that way

6081
04:19:05,160 --> 04:19:11,000
Uh, yeah, okay. That sounds like a good idea. Well, we'll get those up soon and then there's a lot

6082
04:19:11,000 --> 04:19:17,000
There's like three episodes and one of them is really really long. Maybe you should uh hire riley to manage all your stuff

6083
04:19:17,960 --> 04:19:21,080
I know we could really use a marriage and we could really use some producing

6084
04:19:21,560 --> 04:19:26,200
Some production chops on this uh on this project. You need to produce those last manager

6085
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:32,680
I what I need a guest. I need guests on the podcast and I would really rather it be

6086
04:19:33,320 --> 04:19:37,240
A local rapper from elco nevada. Like who do I know?

6087
04:19:38,040 --> 04:19:40,040
Who do I know that could get me someone like that?

6088
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:42,360
No one

6089
04:19:42,360 --> 04:19:47,240
You'll never get any good guests. You'll be stuck with bottom of the barrel shit to your guests. Like uh

6090
04:19:48,200 --> 04:19:50,200
Like gamers havern over here

6091
04:19:50,600 --> 04:19:52,600
Yeah, but that guy

6092
04:19:53,720 --> 04:19:54,920
Uh

6093
04:19:54,920 --> 04:19:56,920
Gamershavern.com go to it

6094
04:19:57,800 --> 04:19:59,160
Yes

6095
04:19:59,160 --> 04:20:01,960
Uh, yeah mad pros are actually having a website by the way

6096
04:20:02,040 --> 04:20:05,400
We're like one of the last 10 people on the internet who still has a website

6097
04:20:05,880 --> 04:20:10,520
Yeah, for some reason I didn't have the good chance to stop after I started in 2002

6098
04:20:11,400 --> 04:20:18,680
I I miss the days of personal websites. I hate that. It's all that it's all been agglomerated on social media networks

6099
04:20:19,080 --> 04:20:22,440
Is that uh, is that almost 20 years old now?

6100
04:20:23,240 --> 04:20:27,640
Yep, it'll be 19. The site's uh, 20 year anniversary is coming soon

6101
04:20:28,920 --> 04:20:34,920
Holy fuck either or be square dude pretty soon the gamers tavern will be old enough to drink alcohol

6102
04:20:36,120 --> 04:20:38,120
Yeah, the brand itself

6103
04:20:38,840 --> 04:20:40,040
Hmm

6104
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:42,040
It's already old enough to vote

6105
04:20:42,760 --> 04:20:45,480
Probably devoted in the last website should be allowed to vote too

6106
04:20:46,520 --> 04:20:48,520
I think so they're they're people too

6107
04:20:49,320 --> 04:20:51,560
Uh, okay, we gotta we gotta wrap this episode up

6108
04:20:51,720 --> 04:20:56,280
Uh, anything else we have to shill shackles or hackles will stream the pcb minecraft server patreon.com

6109
04:20:56,280 --> 04:21:02,680
Slice the procrastinators minecraft server access and the bonus episodes and I guess that's at speak pipe.com slash

6110
04:21:03,000 --> 04:21:07,960
PCP voicemail did I get that right? If you want to leave a voicemail message, um

6111
04:21:08,840 --> 04:21:10,840
Is that it? Yeah

6112
04:21:11,080 --> 04:21:16,920
Okay, that's the end of the episode. Thanks for sticking with me. Goodbye and god speed

6113
04:21:18,200 --> 04:21:20,200
See ya
