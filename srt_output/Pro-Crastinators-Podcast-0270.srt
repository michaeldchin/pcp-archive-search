00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemails for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Redcon funded by you. We can be procrastinators.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Podcast.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Podcast. We need a flag.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A flag?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, we need a flag for podcasters rights.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What colors would it be? What would be the stripes?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can't even begin to think of what color podcasters are on visual. What's the color of sound?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We need it to be like a rainbow, but like better. It needs to be better than the gay pride flag because they've been taken all the good will. We need to outdo them.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, a simple, completely black skull and crossbones, but with microphones. Skull and microphones. Two skulls facing each other with a microphone in the middle, pirate flag.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are podcasters, if not modern day pirates?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Criminals.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pillaging, murdering, yeah, just fucking up everything for their own personal gain.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Just sailing the seas of the airwaves of the internet for monetary gain. It's the same.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Pirates made a living, and so do we.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why can't we?

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sometimes. Why can't we?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I say that John McAfee was like a modern day pirate, but in my opinion, I'm a lot more similar to that lofty ideal.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was complaining about the trans flag because I'm insanely transphobic and insane.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I saw that flag and I got really upset. I said, too political, take it down.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, I was asking my discord because I've been confused why there's the black and brown stripe.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because to me, if the stripes all mean a different thing, like there's the trans colors and there's the thing.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, you mean like the big, like everything flag.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, no, not even the everything flag, just the one that's the rainbow, but then there's the triangle, the chevron, and there's the trans colors and there's the black and brown stripe.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know which one that is.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's also called the progress flag?

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you just Google LGBT flag.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No, that's the everything flag, isn't it?

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That was what I meant.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, well they've been, I mean, some people have been making ones with even more stripes and even more chevrons.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sometimes as a joke, sometimes as like a, this is fucking stupid, we have too many colors or whatever.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You ever see the ones that have like 50 fucking stripes on them?

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's like the ace flag, the lesbian flag, the gay flag, the rainbow.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It really could be just the pan.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Like I don't know, like do they have a fabric shortage?

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You could just fly multiple flags together.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was thinking you could just fly multiple flags, but I was complaining because the visual implication of the black and brown stripe to me is that being non-white means you're part of LGBT.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I don't think that's true.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I mean that, that wasn't the intention.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I guess that the intent of the flag is more like marginalized groups.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The, I think, I saw a video, I saw a video by a YouTuber who, I guess, the YouTuber is JJ McCullough, who I don't even, I don't even like him, but I thought he made a pretty good video about this flag.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The, I think the intent of the stripes is not like black and brown people are also LGBT.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's like a, it's like a, it's, it's like a solidarity thing.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's like a, you know, black and brown people of queerness are also included.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think it's weird.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think it's weird that it's kind of become the main flag.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I mean, whatever.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But why did I bring this up?

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I literally, I had a point to make with this.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And now I don't remember what it was.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is it because insanely transphobic Ben Sain is coming out as insanely racist as well?

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm coming out as transgender and transracial.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So now I need, I need all the stripes I can get.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, no, it was, I thought it was interesting because in the video he mentions that, you know, they make all these different flags.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There's the trans flag and there's the MLM flag and the WLW flag and the ACE flag and the whatever.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And they're all different stripes.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And, and some people, I guess, according to the video, it's, don't like it because it's like, okay, the whole, kind of the whole point of the rainbow is that it includes everything.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So it's a little bit like, it's a little bit missing the point against the original intention to be like, we need to add more stripes.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We need more colors because it doesn't include mine.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It doesn't include my stripes.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's, it's, it's the, um, yeah, the whole rainbow thing.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, actually, I don't know why it's a rainbow.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The, the, the, the, the original flag.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It, he, I learned this in that same video.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Um, he, he just made a video about this like two days ago.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Uh, it was, it was literally an American politician like made the flag.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The rain, just the, no, no, it was, there was a guy, a politician and his friend who I guess were both involved in, in gay rights stuff.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And the, they, they designed the flag and then they sort of pushed it as sort of a part of their, this guy's political campaign.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So like it was made by a politician as sort of like a, I am running on like a pro gay rights agenda.

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're going to fly this rainbow flag and it means gay rights.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Uh, that's where it comes from.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wow.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Another factoid that I learned, another factoid that I learned is that, okay, yes, there was the rainbow flag and then not too, a little, a while ago, at some point in the last couple of decades, someone as a statement made a version of the flag that just added the brown and black stripes on top, just to the normal rainbow.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, I remember that.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then, and then someone else added, and, and then there was this, this artist decided there were too many stripes, so he redesigned it to have the, the triangle, the chevron is what that triangle is called.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Uh, but he, but that guy, and that, and this one with the trans triangle and the black and brown triangle stripes on top of the regular rainbow, that's sort of the one that has taken off recently.

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But that guy who designed it thinks that he owns it and thinks that it's his and he should like be the, the only one who can sell it.

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Good luck.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Good luck.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The whole thing was, with, with adding to a flag until everything is on the flag, because that's the ultimate conclusion of an idea like that is, oh, we've got to include everything, otherwise it's in, in like implicitly not included, even though it is kind of like to add everything in would make the flag a mess,

90
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
because you would eventually have to add like so many different things that would become, I don't know, lame looking.

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Apparently, apparently the six stripes of the original rainbow, they stand for like the elements of harmony, basically, they literally were meant to stand for like honesty, loyalty, integrity, courage, courage.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean, not literally those, but six things like that.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I googled and I found, I found the bear culture, the bear brotherhood flag, which is, it's a, you know, a subset of gay is to be like the big muscular hairy guy gay.

94
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's what I'm, that's what I'm going for.

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's what I'm going for.

96
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My squad is going up.

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I squatted to plate.

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I squatted to 25 recently.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to the moon bear bear, bear pride.

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Here I come.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it's like, would there be a twink flag?

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Would there be a twunk flag?

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Would there be like every single possible permutation of being gay?

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's like, as long as there are flags that people can come up with, there'll be a, some sort of a precedent to add it to this flag.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I just feel like it does miss the point of like waving a flag around is supposed to be like an iconic symbol that people can rally behind.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So if people are thinking, oh, my color is not included.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Even though they added these other colors, it's just going to just make people feel like they're not included.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Even though they are, they should be.

109
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it's just, it's making, making it difficult to, to rally behind as like a tool for like, for like marketing, you know, to, to put in a protest and say,

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
swing the flag around and say, this is awesome.

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We're going to kill you, other people who are evil and trying to put us down.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if they're fighting amongst themselves as to what to put on the flag, it's a bit, it's a bit, uh, dumb.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Gay?

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sorry.

116
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, you, you.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I, I think, I actually think, uh, I, I mean, yeah, obviously, obviously you can't just, you can't just add more stripes.

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
To a stripe flag to be like, we need to include more things, right?

119
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Eventually it just becomes a mess.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've seen Twitter ones that have like, let me try and find one of the, uh, I don't even want to fucking Google for it.

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But you know, you can imagine one that has like 49 fucking stripes and 15 triangles on it.

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Um, uh, uh, I think that the concept of like all like LGBT specific flags are in the form of stripes.

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And you just chain and changing the colors of the stripes changes which like variation of queerness or whatever you're, you're representing.

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think that's a cool idea.

125
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's a little bit like, that reminds me a little bit of like a, of like a, you know, like an old like coat of arms thing, how like, you know, you'd have, um, you would have like a base color and then you might, there might be design elements that like maybe two houses would share, right?

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They'd have like, they'd both have like quartered colors, but then like one would have like a different things in the quarters.

127
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And another one might have the same things, but the same design and the same elements, but like represented in different colors to represent that they're like a sister house or something.

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I think that's a cool design philosophy in general.

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think I feel like this, the one that is like taken off, as you say.

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Apparently it's called the progress flag.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Progress flag.

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like I don't think it's that terrible.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like it's, it's not like a bad looking necessarily.

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But it looks good.

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, it looks good.

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So like it's, it's just the, the, the idea that it invites to be added on with, but I feel like as long as it gets too, if it gets too ugly, people will not care about, you know, changing it.

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The black and brown stripe, the black and brown stripe, they might, they might offend me, you know, I might want that black and brown stripe to have their own water fountain, but at least white people get the whole triangle.

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So we're still winning.

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, I could see this, like if there was like a protest, there'd be like a big flag of this, the progress flag, and then three separate flags, the trans flag, the gay flag, and then like the black power fist, like a cool, like, like some, I don't know whether that's like an official, if they have like a flag for that exactly.

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But you know the thing.

141
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, yeah, there's the, yeah, there's the black lives matter flag, which is the words on the black and white bars.

142
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And there's the fist.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't know if the fist has like a name is do people do like just a black fist with the white.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's the white black flag with the white.

145
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I typed in black power flag and it was like a red, black and green, which pan African red black and green.

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, something.

147
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I mean, it seems more specific.

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That seems more specific.

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The fist seems like the most.

150
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, I mean, the fist is iconic.

151
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The fist is iconic.

152
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, fist in the shape of Africa.

153
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a cool.

154
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I like flags.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I like vexillology.

156
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Remember the, remember, not shackles for heckles, the draw cast, we did the draw cast, we all did flags.

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, yeah.

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Fucking find that in our fucking backlog.

159
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If you dare.

160
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which one did you make?

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I remember making one and I found, I thought it was like quite good.

162
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What year was that?

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It must have been like two years ago.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My art is like separated into like years that I did things.

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Was it 2018?

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We did that one.

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Could be.

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't see it.

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I remember that munchies flag just naturally had the, he just put the fist on it.

170
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In hindsight.

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
In hindsight.

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought that, I think that's funny.

174
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think his flag was like, it was like black and white and purple.

175
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I guess he's, I guess he's ace or whatever.

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that the, is the ace flag, the black and white and purple one?

177
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Your color choices determine what you are.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You have no say.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's, absolutely.

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean.

181
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a good thing I like the trans colors then.

182
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The trans colors are really nice.

183
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They're just universally lovely together.

184
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, that's true.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I like, I like the, I like the agender and like the aromantic flags.

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I think that's what the green and gray one.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wait, what's, what's, agender has the black and what, black and gray stripes with the

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
one green stripe down the middle.

189
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh my God.

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, okay.

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Look at this.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Look at this one.

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I just, I've never seen this one before, but guess what it is.

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Um, Reebok.

196
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know.

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Rubber, it's a rubber pride.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So it's a little, it's a little cheeky.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's not like a real thing, but.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh, they shouldn't.

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They should have been.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It looks crazy though.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It looks awesome.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They should have put little white bits on the, on the black, like highlights, like to

205
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
make it look like rubber.

206
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Know what I mean?

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I know what you mean, but I feel like that might make it too busy.

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I like how it's just geometric.

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Maybe just replace one of the stripes with a, with a white one.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I just got to have some white in there, you know, being white.

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Being white, being white.

212
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't feel, honestly, I see the rubber flag and I don't see my skin color and my particular

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
brand of leather kink on there and I feel excluded by it.

214
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The age, enter and a romantic both have green.

215
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I like the colors on the aromantic flag.

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Look at that.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It looks awesome.

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That.

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah.

220
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Gray is a great addition to anything.

221
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
True.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It feels like the aromantic would make a great like draw cast a, what do you call it, color

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
amount, not a lot.

224
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, the pallet, the pallet.

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Limited color pallet.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Limited pallet.

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's a good limited pallet.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Those, that limited pallet challenge was rad.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hey, I'm, I'm a genius.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I made genius works out of it.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh, no, I'm scrolling on this.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I went to the site to find.

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No.

235
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I went to the site to find the flags and I'm scrolling down and I'm seeing all those shitty

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
like sponsored ads for stuff.

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And corporations.

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah.

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The corporate and I just, I just saw one that's Caitlyn Jenner.

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No makeup photos.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Confirm the rumors.

242
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And this picture of her.

243
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This isn't real.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She looks like a fucking burn victim.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's not what she looks like.

246
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is it?

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh my God.

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That looks like it was taken in the jungle.

249
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And when she was on, I'm a celebrity.

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Get me out of here.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I mean, scary, scary stuff.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Scary.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
She looks like fuck.

254
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
She looks like fucking Ebert after his jaw got taken out.

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She's just doing one of those mouth movements.

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There's one of those.

257
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's, that's what it looks like when she pugs, you know?

258
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Jenner pugs.

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Isn't she like running for senator or some shit?

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know.

261
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Governor or something, mayor, whatever.

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She's running herself into the ground.

263
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's right.

264
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's right.

265
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's see here.

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All right.

267
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So I wanted to, we're recording this episode a little early and now it's, it's almost three

268
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
anyway.

269
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I wanted to record early because Munchy is like, apparently he's like leaving the state

270
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
for like the rest of summer.

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's going to be on the west coast for like the rest of the summer.

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't know this, but I guess we're going to hang out one last time before he goes.

273
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And I wanted to, yeah, I wanted to get there.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So I was like, hey, so last night I'm like, hey, can we do the PCP early?

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want to do it at noon.

276
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I want to do it three hours early.

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And eventually you were like, yeah, okay.

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And then I responded and I was like, uh, actually I stayed up all night playing

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Minecraft and I don't want to get up that early anymore.

280
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So let's push it back two of those three hours that I wanted to say.

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You pushed it back to one and then you said, now push back to two, just pushing it back

282
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
back to three hours.

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Um, but you know, I had a real great time playing Minecraft.

284
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I, I have, I have gotten really, I was on the PCP Minecraft server, which you can join

285
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
at the patreon.com slash the pro crassinator.

286
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh, I've gotten really into the Thaumcraft mod and I have, uh, I'm turning, I am

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
turning my slime cave into a sort of inverted wizards tower where it's a big, like black

288
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
obelisk that extends under the ground and it has like all these rooms and staircases.

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And oh no, I set it all up.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I've, I've have it all set up so that now when you put stuff into the, uh, what's it called,

291
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the smelter, you put stuff into the smelter.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And it, it extracts the Ascension and it pumps it through a pipe into a room with all these

293
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
jars and it like squirts out of the, of the, of the pipes and it like flies through the

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
air as like ghostly little beams and it goes into its little jars and all the jars are

295
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
arranged around the, um, uh, what's it called the, like the thing that like can like automatically

296
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
like make stuff for you.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And that thing has a little attachment on it that will automatically suck up Ascension

298
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
from like the jars all around it and like, and do the, do the production tasks.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Uh, uh, it's all very, it's all very, and I have a little study next to that.

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I have a little, a little study, you know, I'll get, I'll get in to Minecraft after this

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
is done and I'll take screenshots of my study and my smelter room.

302
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Uh, it's, it's a work in progress.

303
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Most of the rooms are empty, but it's, uh, also it's all, it's all made of coal.

304
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Uh, I wanted black, I wanted black walls.

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So all of my, all of my walls and hallways are made of coal.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Uh, just cause it looks nice.

307
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I was about to say you could go to the Nether and get like the basalt, but that's all new

308
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
stuff and the server's still in something.

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, there's no, no, there is basalt.

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah, there's basalt, there's basalts in, uh,

311
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
or is it one of those special too many items or not that?

312
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I use, I use basalt for the floors.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The floors and the ceilings are basalt and the walls are coal.

314
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's lots of different, um, and then in the latest Minecraft, I haven't played it,

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
but my brother was telling me, um, that there's like, I kind of remember, there's like

316
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
deep cobble, which is like black cobble that you can just find in, in veins.

317
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Deep cobble, deep cobble.

318
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's so cool.

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And, and there's like variants of like gravel and stuff, mulch, mulch is sort of weird,

320
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
gravelly, something or other.

321
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So many variations of stone things you can get that are basically just decorative as far as I know.

322
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

323
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Deep cobble looks great.

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm curious about deep cobble.

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
There is a, I've gotten into the Thaumcraft mod, but there is, there is, I want, there's a dark purple block.

326
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's basically like metamorphic fungal stone, which I would have to do the other like big magic mod, botania.

327
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I would have to do some botania to get the, uh, metamorphic fungal stone.

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But it sure would look nice in my, in my duck and dark black and purple tower.

329
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Chiseled, uh, obsidian, chiseled obsidian is, is purple and it looks great.

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I've sort of been like embedding it into various places in the walls, sort of as decoration.

331
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Uh, just for a little, just for a little, just for a little splash of color.

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And I would, I would like to have some, I would like to have some, some fuelium, some like fuelium flowing like down the walls or like through like shafts or whatever.

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because fuelium has a nice, lovely, uh, bright green color.

334
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Uh, Minecraft.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Cobble.

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Deep cobblestone.

337
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You mean cobbled deep slate?

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, maybe that's what it's called.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's cobbled deep slate.

340
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's another stone called blackstone.

341
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I typed, I typed in deep cobble and I got real life images.

342
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I didn't know, I didn't know fucking stones were real.

343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You got images from Kabul.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I got images from people like garden, like, like patios and.

345
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh yeah.

346
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh wait, are we, are you tell, wait a minute.

347
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Are you telling me that Minecraft is based on a real thing?

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I suppose I am.

349
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's a real, you think that we'd stone, I thought stone was just in a video game.

350
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh my God.

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's funny because like cobblestone, cobble is like a very, it's a word that nobody used really to describe things because cobbled streets were so, you know, antiquated.

352
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Cobblestone in Minecraft.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Cobblestone is in Minecraft is not like cobblestone in the real world.

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:42,000
In the real world, it's a very like deliberately placed and like very, very, you know, work labor intensive way of making like a very beautiful sort of rustic path.

355
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
In Minecraft, it's just you break a fucking rock and it crumbles into pieces and it becomes cobblestone.

356
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And I don't like it.

357
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't like that.

358
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Bricks.

359
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The real life cobblestone is more like is more like what in the game is bricks.

360
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So out of notch, take a fucking get off eight Chan.

361
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Take a take a breather from decoding the latest Q drop and and fix it, please.

362
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you.

363
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's rude.

364
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I showed him that'll teach him.

365
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You there.

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What's up?

367
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What happened?

368
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Internet gone.

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Internet fucking gone.

370
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Anyway, I was going to say they were cobbled together.

371
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And that was what I was going to say.

372
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Good, good joke.

373
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I had to say you're waiting for like 10 minutes.

374
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, not 10 minutes.

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's so different because there's only two of us.

376
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
If one of us gets internet troubles, that's it.

377
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Otherwise, before when I would when I would have internet troubles, I would be gone and nobody would fucking notice.

378
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And then I would come back.

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Nobody wouldn't.

380
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We would just be like, oh, we got it.

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The show must go on.

382
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Not anymore.

383
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Now we're hanging by a thread.

384
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Now the show must end.

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The show must never go on.

386
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The show must end.

387
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes.

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yes.

389
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Absolutely.

390
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Let's see.

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's see.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh, yes.

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So I guess whenever we finish here, I will immediately be catching the next bus to go over to see Munchie

394
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and Kazi and those dudes and see him fucking say bye for summer.

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I didn't even know he was leaving.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I didn't know he was going to be gone for the rest of the summer until like a few days ago.

397
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But he is.

398
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Lamal.

399
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Maybe we'll get ramen again.

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Soup Shack.

401
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think I might have mentioned last week that I started writing Road to Radcon Chapter 5, which I am sorry to say I did not get to complete it this week.

402
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I have had a very busy week.

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I've been very preoccupied with trying to avoid Tom's fate.

404
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Tom mentioned that the Massachusetts unemployment stuff fucked him over and I guess was asking him to like pay back a bunch of money.

405
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I have had to go through a lot of my old documents and like remake stuff and count up like money I made over like 2019 and 2020, like month to month to report it to the agency.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, the deadline was the other day.

407
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They were asking for like fact finding documentation.

408
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:07,000
They wanted proof that I am in fact self-employed in Massachusetts.

409
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So I spent like two days being like, oh my God, I can't find all my 1099s because when you're self-employed, right?

410
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's the documentation that you need is the 1099 is the tax form that they give you to report how much they're paying you because there is your freelancer.

411
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I couldn't find a bunch of them and I was freaking out because I couldn't find the 1099 from the Kickstarter from 2019.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Right, because I did the Vapors to Kickstarter in 2019 and I should have had a 1099, but they didn't give me one because I never reported that I moved from Georgia.

413
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They thought I was still in Georgia.

414
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So and I guess only in like Massachusetts and one or two other states do you need a 1099 unless you make some like outrageous like it's like $20,000.

415
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Like if you make if a place pays you less than $20,000, they don't even give you a 1099 and like it doesn't matter.

416
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But in Massachusetts, the threshold is 600.

417
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So because I never told them that I moved, they didn't give me the 1099.

418
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I didn't have I was like, oh my God, I'm going to get I'm going to get hit.

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm going to get Tom's.

420
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
But that's that's an unfortunate but true idiom.

421
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah, but I but I think it was okay.

422
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I joined a Facebook group that was for like people dealing with like unemployment office snafus.

423
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I asked like a lady who was in charge of it.

424
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I asked her what kind and she told me that like what they're really what they need is just to prove they're they're not even like checking like they're not even really checking like your income or like how your income change you do.

425
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I just want to see proof that you are employed the way you say you are and that you do live and are making money in Massachusetts.

426
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So even though I didn't have all my 1099s, I had some of them.

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And I think hopefully that is enough to prove what I needed to prove.

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So I haven't I haven't it hasn't fucked up yet.

429
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And hopefully it won't.

430
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Hopefully.

431
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But anyway, that took that took me like a bunch of my week.

432
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I really, really wanted to not fuck that up.

433
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So by the way, that wasn't an idiom.

434
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I am an idiot.

435
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I was just guessing on what I that thing was.

436
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But to be what thing to be tommed.

437
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, to be tommed.

438
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, if it might not be an idiom, but we can make it one.

439
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
How do you do that?

440
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I googled it already.

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't even know what it is.

442
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I can't understand it.

443
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What a group of words established by what you're a fuck.

444
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm you fucking dingus.

445
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm stupid.

446
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Tommed.

447
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm making it up.

448
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It's a neologism.

449
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's a neologism give.

450
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I I you knew what you knew what I meant through context clues.

451
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You knew you use your context clues.

452
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You said that's an unfortunate but true idiom.

453
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah, I know what you meant.

454
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And I was just trying to figure out what word I was trying to use.

455
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because idiom isn't the correct word.

456
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
No, I'm the idiom.

457
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I thought you meant that you were googling tommed as a verb.

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And we're like, that's not a real word.

459
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm the idiom in this situation.

460
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

461
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay, push your favorite idioms in the comments.

462
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Post your favorite idiots in the comments.

463
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
My favorite idiot is you, the listener, the commenter.

464
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
People trying to figure out how do I post like an image of a mirror in the comments of the YouTube?

465
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
How do I do that?

466
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I've there's been many times that I wish I could post a funny reaction image in the YouTube comments.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But all you can do is post an image or link.

468
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It sucks.

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean, you could you could ask you are you could ask you are at it.

470
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Sure.

471
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Sure.

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
If you just draw a rectangle, say it's a mirror and hate yourself.

473
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah.

474
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Draw a rectangle and put a little like stick figure smiley face in there.

475
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Well, it's like, all it has to be is a smiley face because it's like in, it's like Scott McCloud said in drawing, drawing words, writing pictures.

476
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If the face is, is general enough, cartoon enough, you see yourself in it, you project yourself onto it.

477
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So if you just draw a simple smiley face, the viewer will understand that they are looking at themselves.

478
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I thought it was like a highlander thing.

479
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Scott McCloud or the Klan McCloud?

480
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
No, do you not know Scott McCloud?

481
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No, I remember.

482
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
There's the guy who has the book.

483
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
He's got, he's got at least two books.

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He's a heavy heavy.

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What is it?

486
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's writing, writing words and the drawing words and writing pictures and understanding comics is the other one.

487
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I think I've read both of them.

488
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I should read for them.

489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But they're good.

490
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They're good.

491
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't know.

492
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Doing things that are good for me.

493
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I don't know about that.

494
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Why you should, you should, I mean, I feel like I read them long enough ago that I kind of don't even remember what's in them.

495
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And yet I feel like there's a lot to learn.

496
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If you haven't read them, you probably should.

497
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Have you ever read, you ever read the Loomis?

498
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
You ever read like the Loomis drawing books?

499
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I read through it.

500
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I didn't do the things though.

501
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I tried the first page of like, all right, now draw a circle.

502
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now draw shapes on the circles.

503
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay.

504
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Made a face.

505
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I was like, okay, well, I don't want to draw things that look like this.

506
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Stupid.

507
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Stupid.

508
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I just fell off.

509
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You should, you should, everyone should work their way through.

510
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I worked my way all the way through.

511
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I think it was definitely figure drawing for all it's worth.

512
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And

513
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Fun with a pencil was the one I was reading.

514
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I don't think, I think I did figure drawing for all it's worth.

515
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I finished figure drawing for all it's worth.

516
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I don't think I finished drawing the head and hands, but that one was good.

517
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I did some of drawing the head and hands.

518
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's good.

519
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's good.

520
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's great to learn cause knowledge is power.

521
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
No, but power corrupt span.

522
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't want to be that sort of person.

523
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, no, it's good.

524
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's good to be corrupt actually.

525
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If you just have to make sure you're the one on top.

526
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You just got to get yours.

527
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay.

528
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You, you, you learn all the, all the art techniques and then not let anyone else learn them to

529
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
maintain the hierarchy.

530
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I believe is, is the, is the way it's done.

531
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Let's see.

532
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Let's see what else, what else is going on?

533
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, I was going to say it's, it's, it's a typical American situation to give out money for

534
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
COVID relief, but then to put a lot of money into following up to make sure that people

535
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
weren't lying so that they can rob people.

536
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And get the money back.

537
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, yeah.

538
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, okay.

539
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's, it's funny.

540
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah.

541
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I, I, I hate this.

542
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I hate this.

543
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
They, they claim, and I don't know how true it is.

544
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They claim that there were like widespread unemployment fraud, wherein like organizations

545
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
would like met, would mass claim, like unclaimed social security numbers and like claim benefits

546
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:05,000
in, in the names of those people for like, I don't know, underground fucking crime organizations,

547
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
like, yeah, I don't know.

548
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Social security number, like a really insecure number or something.

549
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I think it's, it's not as secure as maybe we wish it was.

550
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah.

551
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I think so.

552
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like they just go up one at a time or something.

553
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I remember seeing a CGP gray video where the social security number in America is like

554
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
subpar when compared to other countries equivalent.

555
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Like,

556
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That sounds,

557
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Numbers,

558
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Sounds familiar.

559
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Sounds familiar.

560
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But it was not designed.

561
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It was not designed for the purpose that it is currently used for.

562
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Nice.

563
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Whoops.

564
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Fraud.

565
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Fraud everywhere.

566
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, I gotta, like, I mean, I'm a big, I'm a big believer in like non means tested, like

567
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
just, just give people stuff, like just give people free stuff.

568
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And like it'll, it'll sort itself out.

569
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I can't imagine that like a big concerted government effort to be like, ooh, we gave out

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
too much COVID relief.

571
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
We got to like send out all these paperwork to everyone and be like, hey, fill these paperwork

572
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
outs.

573
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And if you fuck it up, we're going to take you to court and make you pay it back.

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay.

575
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Thank you.

576
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Like I, that's not going, that's not going to work.

577
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's not going to be worth the time and effort.

578
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
There's no way.

579
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So stupid.

580
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
People, people living paycheck to paycheck to get all that money.

581
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
They buy food and eat it.

582
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And they got nothing to give back.

583
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
They used to pay their rent and then they're like, they, they fucking forget to dot their

584
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
eyes and cross their T's.

585
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And the government was like, we think you're part of a, we think you're part of a syndicated

586
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
unemployment insurance scam crime ring.

587
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
We're going to need a $10,000 back.

588
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Thanks.

589
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Thank you.

590
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Surely if it gets to court and the person arrives and they're like, oh, it's just an individual.

591
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Okay.

592
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Forget it.

593
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They should do that, but they won't.

594
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
They don't.

595
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They'll take that money and put that person in prison just because that's how the system

596
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
is.

597
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I don't, I don't know.

598
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm sure it depends on the person.

599
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm, I'm sure that like, I feel optimistic that probably most people can just be like

600
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
apply for a waiver and like as long as they can just prove that they are who they say

601
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
they are, they'll probably get it.

602
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Hope.

603
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know.

604
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I hope so.

605
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know.

606
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Cause all this is like still going on, but I mean, Massachusetts is a pretty good state

607
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,000
for like not fucking people on that stuff.

608
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,240
It's very much like, very like civil protections in place to protect like, you know, people

609
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,000
in court and renters and employees, right?

610
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Samp.

611
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,400
They actually just, you know, they actually just, uh, they just expanded like employee

612
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,160
leave, uh, rights in the state and my, my local representative Christine Barber posted

613
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,760
about like, here's, here's what you need to know about, about paid leave in Massachusetts

614
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,160
as of today going forward.

615
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,600
And I respond, I went on Twitter, I said, based at her, it's like, based, based Christine

616
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:30,800
Barber dab, dab, dab, um, she actually, she was the incumbent and she actually, there

617
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,600
was another lady who was running against her who I voted for.

618
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,800
I didn't vote for Christine Barber cause her opponent was a, was a Bernie, was a Bernie

619
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,400
ite, uh, and she had a rose in her name and I was like, well, that's all I need to know.

620
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,920
Uh, but I mean, whatever, even, even the shitty candidates in Massachusetts, I don't know why

621
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,320
we had a Republican, I don't know why like Mitt Romney was our like governor for a while

622
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,640
and he's like a Republican.

623
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,840
I don't know why that happened, but even, even the shitty candidates are still like

624
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,520
liberal Democrats in Massachusetts.

625
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:12,040
Like we had the Senate race was Ed Markey versus Joe Kennedy and like their, their policy

626
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,320
stances were not even that dissimilar.

627
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,200
They didn't even, they didn't even disagree on very many policy things, but that was kind

628
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,760
of the point that was kind of why everyone hated Joe Kennedy because he was clearly just

629
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,680
running because he's a Kennedy and he wanted to be a senator.

630
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,360
He wasn't going to do anything differently than Ed Markey was already doing.

631
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,800
He was just like, it should be me.

632
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
It's my fucking legacy.

633
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
I'm going to run.

634
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
It's my time.

635
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
It's my time.

636
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
It's my time.

637
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,960
He's, I think he was the first Kennedy to like ever lose a Senate race in Massachusetts.

638
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Good for him.

639
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Good for him.

640
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,640
I don't know if there's any Lincoln's about saying, um, actually, no, no, he died.

641
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,840
No, I mean, he, he, he got shot and when he got shot, all of his, all of his, uh,

642
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,560
uh, offspring like dissolved, they all just, they all just got Thanos snapped just like

643
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,080
he did.

644
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,800
He just turned a powder right there.

645
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,400
They're, they're like his minions in the boss battle.

646
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,960
You defeat the boss and then all the minions dissolve.

647
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,880
And then the star appears and you grab it.

648
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,640
Yes.

649
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,440
Yes.

650
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Yes.

651
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Yes.

652
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
The star.

653
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,520
And then John, John Wilkes Booth like jumped up, grabbed the star and did a little spin

654
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
and gave the piece.

655
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,600
It was John Wilkes Booth.

656
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:32,800
Right.

657
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm not confusing that with some other assassination, right?

658
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,000
No, that's a name of her.

659
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm pretty sure.

660
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,760
Sometimes I confuse John.

661
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm a Graham Booth.

662
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,200
Sometimes I confuse John Wilkes Booth with John Wayne Gacy, but I'm pretty sure those

663
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,560
are two very different, uh, people, um, but it's, you, you mentioned, right, you, you

664
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:00,240
said something about giving away money for COVID, which is actually the, the, the next

665
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,840
thing on my list of things I want to talk about is that, but a different kind.

666
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,960
Have you heard of, do you have anything like this in Massachusetts?

667
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,640
They're doing Vax millions.

668
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,920
You know, I've heard, I've heard you talk about it in your server.

669
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,240
Yeah.

670
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,960
I don't think there's any equivalent over here.

671
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,440
Vax millions, baby.

672
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,720
We're not, we're not even the only state doing this.

673
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,880
There was another state that was doing it first, but we're doing it too.

674
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,280
They're literally doing a, like they're, they're doing five, like lottery drawings

675
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,840
of people that are vaccinated.

676
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,160
And if you're vaccinated, you get entered in a lottery.

677
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,120
And if they draw your name, you win a million dollars.

678
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,080
I can't fucking wait.

679
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,400
I can't fucking wait for Vax millions.

680
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,160
It's so stupid, but it's a good idea.

681
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,200
Cause it, the people who want like, like, oh, a lottery or a million, there's the

682
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,520
people who kind of, who kind of sort of don't trust vaccinations for some reason.

683
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,560
They need, they need an incentive.

684
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,680
That's going to be the people who are like probably disengaged, right?

685
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,160
Like disengaged from politics or whatever fucking factors lead someone to be vaccinated.

686
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,600
But if they're a million dollar lottery, there's a mark, that's a whole new market.

687
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,880
It's so stupid to not try it.

688
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,280
I don't know how many people are going to just try and pretend they have the vaccine

689
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,240
somehow and assume that will work.

690
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,600
I don't think it would work.

691
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,800
I mean, you, you didn't have to show ID or anything to get vaccinated.

692
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,480
You just had to like, you literally just had to show up and like say what your name was.

693
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,440
And if they had like that name on their like records as scheduled for today, they let you

694
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,720
in and they, and they jabbed you.

695
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,480
Yeah.

696
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,240
Well, they keep in some sort of track of who has it.

697
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:49,440
Yeah.

698
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,120
You didn't need your driver's license or anything, which is good because my driver's

699
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,640
license was expired as of like earlier this year.

700
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,520
So I'm glad they didn't require it.

701
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,680
Although I just got my, I just got a renewal in the mail.

702
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm so excited.

703
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,320
I can buy booze again.

704
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,160
Speaking, speaking of like licenses.

705
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,040
My passport has expired this June.

706
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,320
I didn't really notice because there's no traveling I was planning on doing, but

707
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,840
there was a thing I was thinking maybe I could go see like Munchy and you and everyone

708
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,400
at some point, they wanted me to come.

709
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,760
I was like, I'll just, I'll maybe, you know, I'm scared, I'm scared about traveling.

710
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,920
Check my passport though.

711
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,360
It doesn't work and it's going to take too long for me to get another one.

712
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,920
But in the process of doing that, I, I got to this, to this, you know, this

713
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,320
unfortunate little, this little, little moment that annoyed me.

714
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,640
A snafu.

715
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,000
A little snafu.

716
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,280
I can renew it fine, but I have to keep all the information the same.

717
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I was thinking, hmm, I kind of don't like the, the, the, you know, the multiple

718
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,960
choice, are you male or female?

719
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,880
Cause I see that in forms and, you know, obviously before there was no question.

720
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,600
I just click the thing and male every time, no thought.

721
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,840
But now that there's like, you know, there's a question there.

722
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,960
It's, it's a decision I'm making.

723
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,640
I'm like, am I going to get in trouble for doing this when I'm, when like, I don't

724
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,920
know, the government doesn't think I am.

725
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,000
What do you, okay.

726
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,120
It asks you what your gender was.

727
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,400
Yeah.

728
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,600
Like cause they put the little gender in the thing and it's like M or F.

729
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,800
And I was like, I'd like F, but then they say, okay.

730
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,480
All you need to do is get a, a gender recognition certificate from the government

731
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,240
to say that you are the gender you say you are.

732
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,400
And in order to do that, you need a cover, you need a doctor's note to say, yes,

733
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,000
you are that gender.

734
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,400
And you also need to have been living as that gender for at least two years.

735
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,160
And you need to show that you will live as that gender for the rest of your life.

736
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,680
How, how are they going to prove that?

737
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,720
I don't know.

738
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,240
I think they just need you to say that you're going to do that.

739
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,720
And they need some person like just a thing that you're just supposed to say yes to.

740
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Yeah.

741
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,600
I mean, well, the thing is you say yes, because of course you're going to.

742
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,560
And then they have like a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether you're

743
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,240
actually telling the truth or something.

744
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,200
You're saying when you apply for a passport, if you say you want to change your gender,

746
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,080
they're going to make you go and see like a, like a doctor.

747
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,440
Give you like an evaluation to give me an evaluation to see whether I'm like faking it or not.

748
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,200
And only then, if I give that information with my old passport, mail that in, will they send

749
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,840
me the new one with the gender change?

750
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,240
That's weird.

751
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,000
So it's, it's really, it feels, I don't know, it's, it feels sickening.

752
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,800
It feels a little gross and it makes me upset just thinking about going through the whole process of that.

753
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,920
So I haven't, I've, I've got like the, I've paid for the renewal because I wasn't thinking,

754
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,040
I was thinking maybe I, I could just do it, right?

755
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,040
I could just say gender female, but then it, no, I could send the passport off, but they

756
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,080
will just reject the gender change and I can get my new passport and I could look at it and

757
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,920
it will say male and I'll be like, ah, it's such an infinitesimally small thing that doesn't

758
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,520
really affect my real life at all.

759
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,600
It just annoys me that I have to, it feels demeaning, you know, feels a little degrading to go through that.

760
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Do you have any idea what the, what the like examination would consist of?

761
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,600
I have no idea.

762
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,800
They say doctor's note.

763
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,920
I, I was told that you could just ask your doctor, just send them a note and then they'll do it.

764
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,720
Yeah.

765
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,280
So I'm going to try that, but I need to get in.

766
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:51,080
Like I've like sent my, my GP like an email saying, can you do that?

767
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,680
And they'll get back to me, I guess.

768
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,400
I don't know when.

769
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:04,360
So I want to try and see if it's that simple, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little worried that

770
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,240
they're going to be like, well, no, do more.

771
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,760
And I'm like, oh, no.

772
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,720
How are they, how are they going to know?

773
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:22,600
Like, oh, no, we have, we have pictures of you a year and a half ago where you were wearing a top hat.

774
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,200
And that means you weren't, you weren't a woman then.

775
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,800
So you got six more months.

776
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,720
The thing that annoys me about it is, is that I feel like it's, I mean,

777
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,680
it's obviously pointless because it comes down to the,

778
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,560
like, what's the problem with people quote unquote, faking it?

779
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,840
Anyway, like, what, what is the purpose of the gender on a passport?

780
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,200
I mean, I agree.

781
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,840
I agree.

782
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,920
Uh, the.

783
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,000
Like, like, oh, was it, oh, they're, they're female or male.

784
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,120
That means they're more or less likely to like have a bomb on the plane.

785
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:05,640
It's because they, it's big, give obviously, if you could just call up the NHS or whatever

786
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,320
and get it on, get an F on your card, then tomorrow you could go and to the Olympic

787
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,440
weightlifting tryouts and become a gold medalist in the women's power lift category.

788
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,240
Stupid.

789
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,360
I couldn't beat like a fool.

790
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,080
Don't you care about women, the integrity of women's sports?

791
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,480
No, I don't.

792
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,760
That's really misogynistic of you.

793
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,960
I don't care about sports.

794
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,160
I never have.

795
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,360
And I, and I don't care about women together.

796
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,120
We don't care about women's sport.

797
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,880
I mean, that whole argument is just sort of like, yeah, whatever.

798
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,600
Sure.

799
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:50,280
I just want to be not like, you know, I want to be treated good.

800
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,960
Can I have that, please?

801
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,240
Yeah, well, I feel like, I mean, it's pretty obvious to me that a lot of people

802
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,840
do the women's sports thing because they just find trans people icky and they have,

803
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,520
they have this as their excuse.

804
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,720
That's, that's their, because it's, because it's hard to argue.

805
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,080
Like when I think about it, I find myself being like, gee, I don't know.

806
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,800
I kind of feel like I don't even, I don't even qualify to have an opinion on like,

807
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,280
who should be allowed to compete in what sports category that kind of seems like

808
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:31,400
something that like professional athletes and like, you know, athletic biologists and like

809
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:38,520
sports scientists should, and like nutritionists and endocrinologists should be answering.

810
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:45,480
Like, so like, it's hard to even have, because that's a really technical debate is like,

811
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,440
what are the, what are the qualifying questions to determine?

812
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,280
Like who, who's in what league?

813
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,840
I mean, for what it's worth, being on HRT changes your bone density and like your

814
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,880
muscle strength anyway, as long as you've been on it for a while.

815
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,320
Yeah.

816
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,160
So like the whole like advantage of being male, it's, it's, it's,

817
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,880
it varies depending on whether they're taking hormones.

818
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:16,920
If like allowing trans women to compete in women's sports, if that led to like,

819
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,400
suddenly the league is dominated by trans women, then maybe it would be like, okay,

820
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,840
there's some advantage here that is like skewing things and it's, and it's like,

821
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,040
you know, I would say then maybe, then maybe it's worth asking the experts like,

822
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,320
maybe we need to redefine the leagues somehow.

823
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,880
Yeah.

824
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,760
Right.

825
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,280
But as far as I can tell, it isn't like that and that hasn't happened.

826
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,560
No.

827
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,160
I mean, very occasionally it's, it's an interesting question.

828
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,760
It deserves talking about, but I don't care about talking about it.

829
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,960
And I know a lot of the people talking about it don't care.

830
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,160
All also don't care, but they'll use it as a wedge issue.

831
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,360
They just don't like trans people.

832
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,320
Yes.

833
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,160
This is their, this is their W.

834
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,200
They don't give a fuck about women's sports until they can latch onto it as a like, oh,

835
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,080
well, you know, these fucking freaks want to, they want to invade women's spaces.

836
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,600
So we got to kill them.

837
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
You've never cared about women's spaces.

838
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,840
Johnny America, you piece of shit.

839
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,960
Johnny America.

840
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,160
Hey, that's my, hey, don't insult my cousin Johnny America on today.

841
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,680
The holiest night of the year, July 4th.

842
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,000
Did you know that today is American Independence Day?

843
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,640
Of course I know that you'd never, American.

844
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,280
You never shut up.

845
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,400
I never shut up about it.

846
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,920
You dang Yankees never stop talking about America.

847
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,440
Ben, every day in the discord, you're like only a week left until the 4th of July.

848
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,600
Only six days left until the 4th of July.

849
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,720
Oh, it's the 28th of June, Pogpog.

850
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,600
I do like the 4th of July because traditionally they do a, you know,

851
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,720
in Boston, they do fireworks shows like all over the dang place.

852
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,440
And usually I would go up to the, to Tufts.

853
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,440
I would go to Tufts campus to this one, like Pagoda they have.

854
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,960
And you can kind of see over the Boston skyline and you can see like fireworks in the over the city.

855
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,960
Like pretty far away, but you can still see them.

856
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,080
And that's, that's where I would, I would watch them.

857
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,520
Generally.

858
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,320
Maybe I'll, I don't know.

859
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,440
I'm going to go see, I'm going to go see Munching Casulator.

860
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,520
So maybe there'll be like some different place or maybe we just won't even fucking bother.

861
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,640
I don't even care that much.

862
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,760
It's fine.

863
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,720
It's all good.

864
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,400
I make sure to drink a cup of tea on the 4th of July.

865
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,080
Criminal.

866
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,640
Like I do every day.

867
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,160
We should, we should fucking, oh, I saw,

868
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,200
I saw a really funny tweet.

869
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,320
It was a video of people tearing down a statue, you know, like they do.

870
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:01,960
Nice.

871
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,640
As has become, as has become popular today among the youth,

872
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:11,320
but it was people in Canada tearing down a statue of the queen, right, of England.

873
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,280
Ben.

874
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,480
And the tweet was like, the tweet was like,

875
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,840
guy with seven with tattoos of 1776 and the don't tread on me snake.

876
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
Why are you tearing down history?

877
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,240
You know, do you get it?

878
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,960
Cause like America.

879
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,040
The tweet was saying that the kind of guy who would have be like,

880
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,160
Oh, America.

881
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,880
Yeah.

882
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,640
Don't tear down Confederate statues because that's American history.

883
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,200
America.

884
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,800
Don't tread on me.

885
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,720
A Gadsden flag.

886
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,440
He doesn't, that kind of guy wouldn't like tearing down statues,

887
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,840
but what if it's a statue of the queen of England who his country famously rebelled again?

888
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,960
So it's like, oh, he's so, so conflicted on the one hand.

889
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,160
I hate, I hate, I love that we fucking did the war for independence.

890
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,600
But on the other hand, I love statues so much.

891
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,760
Oh, think of the property damage.

892
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,560
No, put it back.

893
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,800
Put it back, please.

894
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,640
Imagine being crushed under a statue.

895
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,000
Like your head, like you, like a, like a train's coming.

896
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,960
Like a train's coming.

897
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,520
Yeah.

898
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,160
That's what I thought.

899
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,440
I saw that statue come down and, and crash on the ground and I was like,

900
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,160
I'm imagining what it would feel like to be under it and just, and just obliterated.

901
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,240
This is my, my bones just crunched and all my fucking soft tissues eviscerated.

902
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,920
If you become like a full-time game dev, that'll be your first original games,

903
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,800
like, um, getting headcrushed simulator.

904
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,720
Headcrushed simulator.

905
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,240
Oh, God.

906
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,400
Jesus.

907
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:53,640
No.

908
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,880
Press A to rise.

909
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,280
I'm, I'm, I don't know what it is.

910
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,560
I don't want to like, like every night, like every night,

911
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,760
well, before I go to bed, I like think about like, what if my head was crushed and I'll like,

912
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,280
have a little fucking spasm?

913
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,800
I'll be like, no, no.

914
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,840
Ah, I can't sleep.

915
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,960
Oh, I want to scream.

916
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,320
I have to empty my mind.

917
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,840
I have to use my, I have to use Isaac Sunsenghe's,

918
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,880
a kumdo meditation techniques to empty my mind.

919
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,520
Like a still, like the, like the service of a still pond.

920
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,760
You, you put your, you put your ear to the train tracks and you listen and you listen hard and then

921
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,600
an airplane lands straight under your other ear.

922
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,840
What would you do?

923
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,320
Huh?

924
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,440
What would you do then?

925
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:42,920
Huh?

926
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,160
Huh?

927
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,520
You'd be fucking dead, probably.

928
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,120
You'd be dead, bro.

929
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,000
Yeah.

930
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,040
Not so tough now.

931
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,240
Hmm.

932
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,080
But Vax Millions though, I'm legit.

933
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,080
I'm so excited for Vax Millions.

934
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,040
I'm literally going to like, mark my calendar and like,

935
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,600
I'm not kidding.

936
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,040
I'm going to make this a thing.

937
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,160
It's going to be, it's going to be just like Psycholonials,

938
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,000
just like how I was waiting for every new chapter of Psycholonials every,

939
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,800
every week on Thursday from July 29th through August 26th.

940
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,560
I'm going to be at my computer and be like, oh,

941
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,480
they're going to announce the new Vax Millions.

942
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,920
Cause like, apparently you have to respond within 24 hours to claim your prize.

943
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,280
So like, imagine if like, I missed it and they picked me.

944
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,400
And then I just like, didn't notice until the next day.

945
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,720
You just do a live stream the entire day.

946
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,960
Live the entire day?

947
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,280
Yeah.

948
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,480
Uh, imagine if I won Vax Millions on the stream.

949
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,440
They're doing, um, yeah.

950
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:56,280
Once a week they do, they pick, they pick an 18 plus person and a 12 to 17 person.

951
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,960
And, um, I guess the 12 to 17 gets a third 300,000 scholarship grant

952
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,440
and the 18 plus gets, just gets a million dollars.

953
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,160
Um, the, well, I thought, I thought they weren't the vaccinating 12 year olds yet.

954
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,640
Are they vaccinating 12 to 17 year olds?

955
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,240
That's, I guess.

956
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,040
I hope they are.

957
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,560
I like, I like vaccinations.

958
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,000
I trust the science.

959
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,240
Soy, soy, oh, soy face.

960
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,560
Oh, lower transmission rates.

961
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,400
Oh, reduced symptoms.

962
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,520
Oh, the, the, the death, death rate is plummeting.

963
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,880
Oh, Delta variant.

964
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,600
Oh, stupid.

965
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,560
How embarrassing.

966
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,920
It's so embarrassing to do good things.

967
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,200
It's so cringe to win a million.

968
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,040
I can't fucking wait.

969
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,880
I'm calling it now.

970
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,480
I'm going to win all five.

971
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,240
I'm going to win all effects.

972
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:05,080
Uh, Pogg, what would you even do with five sets of one million dollars?

973
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
What would I do with five million dollars?

974
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,640
Um, I would move to a nicer apartment.

975
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,040
Uh, actually by then I'll, by then I'll have to be moved into some, somewhere.

976
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,920
Still haven't found a new apartment.

977
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,600
I have to move at the end of this month.

978
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,760
Wouldn't you want to buy like a, a whole building so you don't have to pay rent forever?

979
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:27,800
You know what?

980
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,520
Yeah, you're right.

981
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,600
If I had five million, yeah, I would just buy a, I would just buy a building out right.

982
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:32,840
Yeah.

983
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,880
There's no question.

984
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,760
Absolutely right.

985
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,000
I guess the only downside is that you can't move easily.

986
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,880
You'd have to sell it.

987
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,160
But like rent sucks.

988
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,120
I mean, you know, not, not to, not to be landlord-pilled or anything,

989
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,440
but I mean, if you owned a building, you could just move out, rent another building,

990
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,840
and just rent the place you own.

991
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,520
True.

992
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
You don't, you don't have to live in the building you own.

993
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,840
Although, I mean, you probably, it's probably the most cost-effective, uh, if you do.

994
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,280
Just buy all the buildings and then pay security guards to kill people who try to sleep in them.

995
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,240
Just buy, just, why hasn't anyone thought of this before?

996
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,280
No, you don't even have, you don't even have to pay.

997
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,720
You don't even have to pay, uh, uh, security guards to protect your property.

998
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,760
The fucking, the fucking civilian, the fucking, uh, municipal police will do it for you.

999
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,480
That's what they do.

1000
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,120
They're there to protect you, the landlord.

1001
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,960
They're there to, for free.

1002
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:44,040
Literally the state pays them to protect your private investments of multiple, like, housing complexes.

1003
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,640
They are there to respond to crackdown on people who offend your property.

1004
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,800
How fucked up is that?

1005
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,760
Uh, pretty fucked up.

1006
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,840
Literally, literally.

1007
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,680
I'm trying very hard to find, like, a positive spin on that.

1008
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:03,640
I don't know.

1009
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:10,280
Literally the, I, I, I think I was reading Kropotkin when I had this, I had this realization.

1010
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:18,600
It was like, literally the police exist to protect property and rich people, landowners,

1011
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,520
homeowners, like the more homes you own, the more stuff you own,

1012
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,200
the more the police protect you.

1013
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,040
They literally were, they work, they work for you.

1014
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,920
They work, you know, in theory, they work for everyone to protect everyone's property.

1015
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,640
But the more you own, the more of their free protection you are provided,

1016
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:47,960
the more they will fucking crack down on your enemies for trespassing on your stuff.

1017
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,000
And you don't have to do anything.

1018
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,000
You can literally, you can own a property, not even, not, like, defend it, not maintain it in any way.

1019
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,600
But if someone is trespassing on it, if you happen to own it, you can call the cops and

1020
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,920
some fucking burly guy will come and crack their skull with a fucking butt of his pistol.

1021
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,440
Just because you want him to.

1022
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:05,800
Yeah.

1023
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,920
I guess the phone call costs nothing.

1024
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,720
The phone call costs nothing.

1025
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,760
Just like all the best things in life.

1026
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,480
The best things in life are free, like calling the cops to brutalize a homeless person.

1027
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,880
So yeah, Vax Millions, Vax Millions, I'm hype, you can bet, you can bet

1028
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:38,440
that through July and August, through August, I will be reporting every episode of the PCP.

1029
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:45,480
I will be on the show to be like, yes, this week, once again, I have won Vax Millions.

1030
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,400
I'd be excited to see the Vax Millions corner.

1031
01:02:52,200 --> 01:03:04,520
If I win Vax Millions, I will personally give everyone who likes the video.

1032
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:11,480
I will personally give everyone who likes the episode that I announced that I won Vax

1033
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:18,920
Millions, one dollar like the video screenshot, your screenshot that you gave the video alike.

1034
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,040
DM me the screenshot of the the like button that you hit.

1035
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:31,720
And then such a small and then give me your PayPal and I will PayPal you one dollar

1036
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,840
out of my Vax Millions.

1037
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,920
See, I'm spreading it around.

1038
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,960
That episode just happens to get one million likes.

1039
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,440
For a million likes on a PCP episode, worth it, totally worth it.

1040
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,880
Me millions as two millions, as the Espanol would say.

1041
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:03,080
Well, look, look forward to that, everybody.

1042
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,880
Yes, update, update on the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter.

1043
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,800
It's been going well.

1044
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,080
It's been going good.

1045
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,520
It's very, very, very close.

1046
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:19,160
Now it's 40 pounds, only 40 pounds away as of recording to the Red Man Zine stretch goal.

1047
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,640
90 backers, 16 days to go.

1048
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,440
By the time you're listening to this, it'll be like 10 days to go.

1049
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,720
There's not much time left.

1050
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,000
You have to do it.

1051
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,200
You just have to do it.

1052
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,360
I literally went on Facebook.

1053
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,640
I know, cringe.

1054
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,760
I literally went on my Facebook that I never use.

1055
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,640
And I posted a link to the Kickstarter and I said my friend is kickstarting a comic.

1056
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,720
And I went to the Boston Comics Roundtable Facebook group and I said,

1057
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,400
my friend, he's kickstarting a comic.

1058
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:49,720
Wow.

1059
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,880
You said it in a different voice.

1060
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,080
I did.

1061
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,280
I did.

1062
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,040
In my personal one, I was just kind of like, hey, I know someone who's doing the thing.

1063
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,560
And on the Boston Comics Roundtable, I was like,

1064
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,560
You're pitching it.

1065
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,520
She's doing a thing.

1066
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,880
If there's merch and everything.

1067
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,200
Whoa.

1068
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,560
I really appreciate that.

1069
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,280
It was very nice.

1070
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,200
I hope that one, maybe one of the like two people that have pledged since then might have

1071
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,640
come from there or maybe not.

1072
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,040
I don't know.

1073
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,400
Who knows?

1074
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,280
You might know, but or maybe you don't.

1075
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,640
Who knows?

1076
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,400
So I can, I can check.

1077
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,120
I can check.

1078
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,680
You know what?

1079
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,000
Yeah.

1080
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,200
All right.

1081
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,600
Check and tell me if they, if they're complete strangers' names that you don't recognize,

1082
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,160
I'm going to assume that I got them on Facebook.

1083
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,800
Well, there's Super 2D, Jonathan Kirkwood,

1084
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:50,280
Rhomboid Goat Cabin, and Sick Normal are the four most, when did you do this?

1085
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,600
This is just a day ago, right?

1086
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,560
Three days ago?

1087
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,360
Or three days ago.

1088
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,120
Or two or two or three days.

1089
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,400
It was, it was at 88.

1090
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,040
It was at 88 when I posted and now it's at 90.

1091
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,360
Oh, I can't think about what that means.

1092
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:05,400
Yeah.

1093
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,800
I think those four I mentioned are the ones.

1094
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,480
I don't recognize a lot of these names.

1095
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:17,480
I think they're different from like names they have on other social medias, but yeah.

1096
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:23,880
I would say viewers, listeners, maybe if you, if you're listening, if maybe you're already

1097
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,560
supporting the Kickstarter or maybe you can't support the Kickstarter.

1098
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,520
You don't have any money right now.

1099
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,320
That's okay.

1100
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,080
It really makes a difference.

1101
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,160
This is how, I mean, running mine.

1102
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,640
I really appreciate it whenever anyone shared it.

1103
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,120
And like you can fucking, you know what?

1104
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,560
Just fucking spam it in like discords that you're in.

1105
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,360
You know what?

1106
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,400
Honestly, I'm in a bunch of like shitty discords that I don't even use.

1107
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,520
Maybe later today, I already, I already put it on the Facebook.

1108
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:51,960
Maybe later today, I will just go and put it in a whole bunch of these

1109
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,640
discords that I haven't looked at in a year.

1110
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,040
And maybe I'll get banned for spamming.

1111
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,840
Who gives a fuck?

1112
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,400
Yeah, I don't know why I haven't mentioned that.

1113
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,400
Like I say, hey, check out my Kickstarter and pledge if you like.

1114
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,760
I haven't said share it around.

1115
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,160
Share it around is good.

1116
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,600
Because a lot of some people, some people will not be in a position

1117
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,760
where they want to pledge, but they can share and they'll do that.

1118
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,720
And that's good.

1119
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,040
Share that shit, everybody.

1120
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,320
If you want to help get that fucking plush.

1121
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,400
If you want to get that fucking plush and then I'll increase my pledge.

1122
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,840
So I get that plush.

1123
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:38,360
Yes, looking at the curve, the, what is it, line graph?

1124
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,880
Show me, show me the line.

1125
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,040
It's, it's, there was a bit where it was very slow and then it increased for a second.

1126
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,440
Yeah, but it's slowing down again.

1127
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,240
I think just because it's halfway through or a little before halfway through,

1128
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:58,280
that it's like, I'll get around to it like people who would pledge are going to pledge later.

1129
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,160
This looks.

1130
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,280
I had, I had great graphs from mine.

1131
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,160
They kind of, they look pretty similar to, yeah, it shoots up at the beginning and then

1132
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,080
it tapers off and then every, there's every, like, like bumps every, every here and there.

1133
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,040
As like people who maybe wanted to pledge, but couldn't like get around to it or get

1134
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,280
some money and are like, oh, okay, we'll go back and play.

1135
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,160
Oh, you know what?

1136
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:24,760
I haven't checked, but today as we're recording the, that comic podcast that I sent my voicemail

1137
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,760
into is going to go live.

1138
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,280
I should go listen to that and hear myself and go, oh, what?

1139
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,880
I sound so bad.

1140
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,480
And then I'll know that people have heard me talk about Lord of Ghosts.

1141
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,280
Did I mention that the day is all blur together.

1142
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,760
I don't know what's happening.

1143
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,440
Did I mention last week about the Animorphs podcast?

1144
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,640
What about it?

1145
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,680
I think you did mention it.

1146
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,080
Did I say that I was going to be on it or that I had been on it?

1147
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,080
Let me, hold on, let me see, let me see.

1148
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,640
I made a tweet about it.

1149
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:10,600
So, yeah, I was on, I was on Animorphin time that was on, yeah, that was on June 29th.

1150
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,400
Okay, okay, no.

1151
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah, last week I said I was going to be.

1152
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,880
So yes, this week I was on the Animorphin time podcast, the leftist Animorphs podcast,

1153
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:26,120
Animorphs podcast, All Cops Are Year, STAB with Nate and Tyler.

1154
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,440
That will be out in on Apple podcasts.

1155
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:40,200
I think Tyler's told me that it would be out on the 20th.

1156
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,680
I think it'll be out on July 20th.

1157
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,080
He said three weeks from the day we recorded it.

1158
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:45,560
Damn.

1159
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,320
We read, oh yeah, so if you want to prepare,

1160
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:56,200
if you just want to listen to my episode, if you, we read book 31.

1161
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,440
It was number 31, The Conspiracy.

1162
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:09,960
It's a Jake book and this, if you, oh my God, it's, I want to talk about it,

1163
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,920
but I don't want to spoil it too much, I guess.

1164
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,880
They Animorph.

1165
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,600
They do, they do Animorph.

1166
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,440
It is, okay, if you want to prepare for that episode,

1167
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,880
to prepare for my Animorph time appearance, you can go and find,

1168
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:31,000
if you just Google like Animorphs PDFs, there's, it's really easy.

1169
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,520
Someone has uploaded just like PDFs of every single book.

1170
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,040
You can find the entire thing and read it online really easily.

1171
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,440
Also, I was like kind of dreading my book.

1172
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,320
I thought it might take like, I forgot how short they are.

1173
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,280
I literally read the entire book in like two and a half hours.

1174
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,160
They're so short.

1175
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,200
I'm not, I don't want to talk about the, the details of the book,

1176
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:57,800
because like, you know, we, we go into it, we go through the whole plot in, on the, the pod,

1177
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,360
but it's so bad.

1178
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,960
It's such a bad fucking book.

1179
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:11,000
It's, it's kind of hilarious how fucking dumb everything is.

1180
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,760
In like, when I read them as a kid, I think I got up to maybe book like

1181
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,920
20 late 20s.

1182
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,160
So I had never read this one.

1183
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,040
This is 31.

1184
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,320
I think there's like 50 of them.

1185
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,640
And this is definitely into the part where like,

1186
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,800
the series is basically done and it's ready to conclude,

1187
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,560
but they want to make more books.

1188
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,520
So they're just going to have a bunch of like stupid filler happen

1189
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,200
until they finally are ready to end it.

1190
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,960
It is a, it is a, it is basically a pointless filler episode.

1191
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,120
But the really infuriating thing about it is that there are

1192
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,160
like the things that the premise of the episode, like could have been a big deal.

1193
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:59,720
Like it could have been like a huge turning point, except that for no reason,

1194
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:02,920
they all decide, no, we can't do anything.

1195
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,400
We have to make sure that nothing happens.

1196
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,840
We have to make a stupid, the dumbest plan in the world that guarantees that no progress will be made

1197
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,920
in our quest to protect the world from this alien invasion.

1198
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,960
I won't, they, they literally could have fucking gotten shit done,

1199
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,840
but they like deliberately sabotage themselves and it's infuriating.

1200
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,000
But it was a fun podcast.

1201
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,480
Cool. Go check that out.

1202
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,480
But you, would you find podcast?

1203
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,040
Weird, weird coincidence.

1204
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,120
Yeah, check that out in like two weeks when, when that,

1205
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,920
it'll be about two weeks after this, this episode comes out.

1206
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,720
Weird coincidence.

1207
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:51,240
There was a guy, a guy who I used to know from my old Discord server

1208
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,040
before the current one that I, that I have, the old one.

1209
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,920
His name is DivineSoupcan.

1210
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,840
Hello DivineSoupcan, if you're listening.

1211
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:06,520
He randomly started sending, they started shouting him out on the AnimorphinTime podcast

1212
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,520
because he would send them in like really bizarre animal facts.

1213
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:16,280
Um, about like, yeah, this is like really bizarre animal facts.

1214
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,160
And I was just like, I was like, I, like, I know that guy.

1215
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,920
I literally know that guy.

1216
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,000
What are, what are the odds?

1217
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,920
What are the odds that a person would listen to a podcast?

1218
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,400
Would listen to another podcast that I also listened to?

1219
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:31,960
You know what?

1220
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,600
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

1221
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,400
It was a distant.

1222
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,400
Have you seen that guy, that there's no such thing as a coincidence guy?

1223
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:47,320
Oh, the, is he the, the guy who the lady screamed in the video, but he just kept going?

1224
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,400
Yeah, why did she scream?

1225
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,600
I feel like, I can't, I don't know.

1226
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:00,680
I feel like it's a strange scream to say if, like I first, I assume she looked back at him

1227
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:05,640
and he had a very piercing gaze and she was like screaming at, but like that's a weird thing to do.

1228
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,080
So I think she probably just tripped.

1229
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,200
She walked by him.

1230
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,760
She walked by him and like knew he was there.

1231
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,280
Yeah, she walked by him.

1232
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,160
Well, she didn't see his face.

1233
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:13,880
That's why I thought that.

1234
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,920
But I think it's more likely she just tripped and fell.

1235
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,120
His face isn't that scary.

1236
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,520
No, it's sort of like intense.

1237
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:21,800
Yeah.

1238
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,400
He looks like an anime villain.

1239
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,360
I, yeah, I saw that clip with the scream.

1240
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,720
I thought the scream was added.

1241
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:31,240
Like I thought it was an edit because it's so weird that it's there.

1242
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,640
And then he had like a follow-up.

1243
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:38,040
Like a lot of you are wondering why I didn't react to the scream.

1244
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,600
Yeah.

1245
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,480
It was like, who, I mean, what is this guy?

1246
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,800
Just re-record your fucking take.

1247
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,640
Re-record the fucking take with someone screams when you're trying to record your

1248
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,960
fucking there's no such thing as a coincidence TikTok.

1249
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,160
Simple.

1250
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,960
I wonder what, like, with that, what, I don't understand.

1251
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,160
I didn't really look into it.

1252
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,800
But it seems fascinating.

1253
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,160
It must have been pre-planned if there's no such thing as a coincidence.

1254
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,720
Maybe she was an extra that he had to scream.

1255
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,800
There's no, that's, that's, well, maybe that's it.

1256
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,160
The scream wasn't a coincidence.

1257
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,960
He was like, that scream must be here for a reason.

1258
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,240
You know.

1259
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,520
I knew exactly what to do.

1260
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,760
I must have manifested this scream somehow from the energies of the universe.

1261
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:34,200
So that I would get like, you know, comedy views and then skyrocket into relevance.

1262
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,320
So it would go viral.

1263
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,320
Well, and it worked.

1264
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:37,880
And it worked.

1265
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,480
Now I know who that, now I know who that guy is.

1266
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,480
It's all true.

1267
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,200
He's so smart.

1268
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,720
It's all fucking true.

1269
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,200
I'm actually kind of mad because, yeah, it completely worked.

1270
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:54,840
Jesus.

1271
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,320
We should invite him on the podcast and he can have a webcam and do that.

1272
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,000
We don't even know what his name is.

1273
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,520
Yeah, we can have him on like, Mary, like Mary as a VTuber.

1274
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,840
But instead it's just him like, in the park.

1275
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,040
Against the green screen.

1276
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,960
Just staring, staring directly into the camera.

1277
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,280
Yeah.

1278
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,360
Has it been, has it been hot for you?

1279
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,640
A little bit.

1280
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,680
Hot and then cold.

1281
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,280
Oh, it's not cold.

1282
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,480
I guess hot and then wet.

1283
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,080
But, you know, temperate, I guess.

1284
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:35,080
It hasn't been like heat wavy as I've heard it's been.

1285
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,440
Yeah.

1286
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,720
On the west coast, it's been like 120 degrees.

1287
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,280
It's been like record breaking.

1288
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,640
Like we're all going to die levels of, you know, hot.

1289
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,680
On the east coast, it's been a heat wave here too.

1290
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,880
It hasn't been quite as bad.

1291
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,960
But it's recently broken because it started raining a lot.

1292
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,360
So the last couple of days have not been that bad.

1293
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,160
It's been rainy.

1294
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,560
But it was really hot.

1295
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,080
It was really hot for a minute there.

1296
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,680
I have, my room is pretty small and I have an air conditioner in my window.

1297
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,800
And I've been, I was keeping the air conditioner going like full blast all day.

1298
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,960
And it wasn't enough.

1299
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,800
I was still sweating in my room.

1300
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,080
My room is very badly ventilated.

1301
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,400
It gets really hot in the summer because it's up.

1302
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,960
One, heat rises and I'm on the third floor.

1303
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,600
And two, I think the sun on the roof.

1304
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,600
I think the sun heats the roof and the heat seeps in through my roof.

1305
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,040
So my room gets really, really hot, even in the best of times.

1306
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,800
So yeah, even the full blown air conditioner was like,

1307
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,160
it was like kind of handling it, but it was still like uncomfortable.

1308
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:53,000
So it's really like oppressive when it's so hot because it's like, where do you go?

1309
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,880
When you're already in the shade and you have access to water and you still feel like you're

1310
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,000
going to die, it's like, there's nowhere to escape.

1311
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,080
There's not, there's nothing that can improve this.

1312
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,680
You just have to like dig down a hole into the ground and live underground.

1313
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,600
You don't have a hole, but you can't, you don't have a shovel.

1314
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,600
You don't have a diamond pick.

1315
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,480
You can't dig that well.

1316
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,720
No, you don't have a diamond pick.

1317
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,920
You don't have a void metal, you don't have a void metal pick with silk touch called

1318
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,600
big softy like I do.

1319
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:30,200
You can't, you can't, you can't dig down a big, a big shaft and make your fucking

1320
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:35,720
thaumaturge logical wizards tower underground, if only.

1321
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:41,800
It's just that sort of despair you feel when like, you know, you're sitting by an open fridge

1322
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,560
and you're like, I'm going to die.

1323
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,680
It's still too hot.

1324
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,120
I'm sitting by an open fridge.

1325
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,320
Like that one episode of The Simpsons where they like open their fridge and like set up

1326
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,520
a little tent in front of it.

1327
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,720
Yeah, I remember.

1328
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,120
Hot Simpsons, they predicted heat.

1329
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,280
They predicted the climate change.

1330
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,280
Oh, they predicted it would be hot in the summer.

1331
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,160
A bog, yeah.

1332
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,640
Yes, yes.

1333
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:16,840
Yeah, lucky, lucky for me, I suppose that it hasn't been devastating, but it'll happen.

1334
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:20,520
I mean, it happened last year, August was very, very hot over here.

1335
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,800
Yeah, I guess it might, I guess it might still get hotter.

1336
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,280
Huh?

1337
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,000
That's a bummer.

1338
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,120
I guess it's doing like a heat dome.

1339
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,440
I keep hearing people say that there's a heat dome.

1340
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,240
I don't know what that is.

1341
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,520
I can, I can picture it.

1342
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:39,320
I can sort of understand from context clues what a heat dome might be.

1343
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:44,120
Like a, like a Dragon Ball Z, like seen from space explosion blast.

1344
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,400
Exactly.

1345
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,280
But with heat.

1346
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:55,160
Oh, funny thing happened yesterday.

1347
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,600
I mentioned, I mentioned that I'm super strong now.

1348
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,560
I mentioned that I'm bet that I squat two plate like a god.

1349
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,920
But it's not that impressive because I'm fat too, so it all evens out.

1350
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:14,040
I went to the basement to lift yesterday and I put my phone down on like a little like,

1351
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:20,600
it's like a thing, like a table, like a folded up table that's leaning against the wall.

1352
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,880
And I went to squat and I went and I picked up my phone and I see something on the screen

1353
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,160
of the phone and it's, well, I didn't know what they were.

1354
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:35,640
I was afraid they might be lice or bedbugs, but I'm pretty sure they were actually dust mites.

1355
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,760
They were really, really small, like the smallest bug I've ever seen.

1356
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:45,400
They were so tiny, but I could see them moving around on my phone and I looked at my hand

1357
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,480
and there were some on my hand too.

1358
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,200
And I was like, oh my god, because I thought they, I didn't,

1359
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I thought they might be parasites of some kind, lice, bedbugs, whatever.

1360
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,160
I was like, oh my god, I'm infested.

1361
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,120
Oh my god, they're gonna get on me.

1362
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,080
They're gonna live in my hair.

1363
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,520
They're gonna live in my body.

1364
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,120
They're gonna live in my asshole.

1365
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,240
I'm fucking done.

1366
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:12,200
And I got scared and the fear and the terror gave me an adrenaline rush that

1367
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,080
I think it made me better at lifting.

1368
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,160
I think it helped me power through my last set on the bench press.

1369
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,600
150 baby, that's a recent PB.

1370
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,320
Wait, so you didn't rush to the shower to get rid of them?

1371
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,080
You rushed to the bench?

1372
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,320
I had to finish my lifts.

1373
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,720
Oh, I missed the beginning of the convo of the use.

1374
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,800
I'm sorry, I'm out of it today.

1375
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,240
I'm fairly listening to anything.

1376
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,360
No, I mean, it's fair.

1377
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:45,720
Well, I mean, I rushed to finish my lift so that I could go and get in the shower

1378
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,400
as quickly as possible.

1379
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,800
I did spend a little while standing there very intently, looking at my hands,

1380
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,400
trying to see if I could spot any more and try and flick them off.

1381
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:01,080
But at the same time, I knew that they're so small that there's a little,

1382
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,640
even no matter how closely I looked, I could very easily have missed some.

1383
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:12,760
So I finished my lifts and then I did go and I took a shower as hot as I could stand.

1384
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,920
It's one of the most unsettling things is like the slow realization that that thing

1385
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,400
actually is a bug.

1386
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,360
Oh my God.

1387
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,080
Oh no.

1388
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,280
Oh my God.

1389
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,280
Like you look at a thing and you're like, is that just like a piece of plastic?

1390
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,800
Or like, what is that?

1391
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,040
Oh no.

1392
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,120
I mean, it's like a spider and you jumps into your face and die.

1393
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,920
Yeah.

1394
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,720
Dust mites.

1395
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,480
I mean, they're so small.

1396
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,320
It's almost like they don't even exist.

1397
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,920
So they're not that gross and they're not like harmful.

1398
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,320
Like they don't really bite or anything.

1399
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,360
They're not parasites.

1400
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,440
They don't suck your blood or eat your skin or whatever.

1401
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,200
So like, I don't even think it's bad that I got some on my hands.

1402
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,840
Wait, they don't eat skin or they even do then.

1403
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,120
Well, dust mites just, I don't know.

1404
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,720
I guess they eat dust or whatever.

1405
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,000
They just live on the floor.

1406
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,080
Isn't that like mostly dead skin cells?

1407
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,120
Or at least a large amount.

1408
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,920
I heard that like there's things like that that live on people's pillows because of

1409
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,960
like fatty oils from skin or whatever.

1410
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,160
I think they're like, oh, fucking feeding frenzy.

1411
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,360
It's disgusting.

1412
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:23,720
Okay.

1413
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,880
I mean, they do eat skin.

1414
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,200
They do eat skin flakes from humans.

1415
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,080
It's like, yeah, they might eat some of your dead skin, but like they're so small.

1416
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,560
I mean, what I'm saying is they don't like nest on human bodies, right?

1417
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,920
Like lice live in your hair.

1418
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,520
Dust mites don't like live on you.

1419
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,920
They might get on you and they might eat some of your dead skin.

1420
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,520
But like, again, they're so small they don't even exist.

1421
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,880
They're literally microscopic even though you can technically see them.

1422
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,360
Uh, you can see them if you look real hard.

1423
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,280
If you squint real good.

1424
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,840
They put your eyeball right next to them and they jump onto your eyes.

1425
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,000
I don't think they can jump.

1426
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,640
They literally, they look exactly like headcrabs.

1427
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,920
They're tiny, tiny, tiny.

1428
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,720
But if you look really close, they literally look like headcrabs.

1429
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,880
From Half Life?

1430
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,120
Yeah.

1431
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,160
No, from real life.

1432
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:20,680
Well, I don't know.

1433
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,280
Maybe there is a thing called a headcrab.

1434
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,560
There is not.

1435
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:24,920
There is not.

1436
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,920
There is no, oh, look at Cassie.

1437
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,760
Look at Cassie being fucking cheeky.

1438
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,360
Cassie is in the server.

1439
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Do voicemails so Ben can come over.

1440
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,880
Yeah, Cassie's waiting for you, Ben.

1441
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,320
She's just going to have to fucking, she's going to have to wait until I'm done

1442
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:47,080
going through my funny little list of topics to bring up on the episode, which

1443
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,800
actually I'm basically done with.

1444
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,440
I think that was, that was the last one.

1445
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,720
I guess we can start voicemails.

1446
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:01,640
The one last thing that I wanted to mention was last episode I talked about hanging out

1447
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,320
with those guys and playing Smash and playing Inkling and not knowing how to refill my ink

1448
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:12,360
and a couple of people messaged me to be like, actually, you can refill your rink anytime if

1449
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,720
you shield and hit down B.

1450
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:19,960
So thanks, thanks to everyone, thanks to everyone who hit me up with the

1451
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,400
with the pro tips on Inkling.

1452
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:27,320
I will, I will, I'm sure we'll play Smash today and I will try to use that.

1453
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,480
But Munchie is so much better at Smash than me.

1454
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:37,000
I can barely take a stock off him, like when he's just fucking around and basically letting

1455
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,400
me win.

1456
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:43,640
So, you know, I was a while, this wasn't the last episode.

1457
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,120
Last time, but like, like several weeks ago, I was over there.

1458
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,080
We were playing Smash.

1459
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,520
I decided to just play Sephiroth just to see what he was like.

1460
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:57,720
I think Munchie was playing Kirby and like I managed to take like two stocks off him.

1461
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,560
And I was like, oh, wow, I actually kind of won.

1462
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,080
And the next time I saw him, I was like, hey, last time we played Smash,

1463
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,680
you just let me take those stocks off you, right?

1464
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,640
And he was like, yes.

1465
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:10,200
And I was like, okay, just, just making, he didn't even pretend.

1466
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,960
Uh, but that, that's just how it is.

1467
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:15,960
That's just how it be sometimes.

1468
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,520
Completely forgot Sephiroth was in Smash.

1469
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,080
So many, so many funny reveals.

1470
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:22,760
He's kind of cool.

1471
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,880
I like playing with him.

1472
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,040
He's got, he's got reach.

1473
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,560
He's got big swings.

1474
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,920
He's got big reach with his sword.

1475
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,880
And he makes big explosions with his hands.

1476
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,400
And that's pretty cool.

1477
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:34,840
I like that.

1478
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:36,520
Yeah.

1479
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,040
Yeah.

1480
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,200
Um, I guess that's it.

1481
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,040
I guess that's all I had to say about all that bullshit.

1482
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,200
Boy smells.

1483
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:49,960
Boy smells.

1484
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:51,960
Boy smells.

1485
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:52,760
We got a lot.

1486
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,960
So let's fucking.

1487
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,240
Oh, fuck.

1488
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:55,960
Yeah.

1489
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,360
Yeah.

1490
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:56,840
Fuck.

1491
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,160
Okay.

1492
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,400
Oh, they all look short.

1493
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:01,640
I'm looking at the first page and they're all under a minute.

1494
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,400
Oh, except this one, except one, but it's okay.

1495
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,040
They're all under a minute.

1496
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,080
Okay, good.

1497
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,200
All right, uh, send us a message at speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.

1498
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:18,520
If you want us to fucking hear what you have to say about literally anything,

1499
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,560
unless we really don't like it and then we'll tell LA czar to cut it.

1500
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,960
But that doesn't usually happen.

1501
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,800
Most of you are pretty good.

1502
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,680
Thanks for the voicemails.

1503
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:29,800
Okay.

1504
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,880
First one is John Lennon is a hack.

1505
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,440
You see that?

1506
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:33,400
Yes.

1507
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:34,680
Okay.

1508
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,600
And three, two, one, go.

1509
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,720
Who's your favorite beetle?

1510
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,480
I don't fucking know.

1511
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,120
All George or Ringo.

1512
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,080
My favorite is Yoko.

1513
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,840
What about you?

1514
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,480
I, I know.

1515
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,200
What do I even know?

1516
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,680
I know that Ringo is the one that everyone says was untalented and he was on,

1517
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,840
not reading Rainbow.

1518
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,320
He was on the Thomas the Tank Engine show.

1519
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,320
Shining time station.

1520
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,120
Is that what it was called?

1521
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,880
Um, did you know that Ringo star was, yeah, he was the conductor?

1522
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,800
I know he was, he was the, he was the narrator.

1523
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:14,760
Shining time station.

1524
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,680
What do you mean shining?

1525
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:20,040
I thought it was just for the show for like a bunch of seasons.

1526
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:20,760
He was the voice.

1527
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:25,160
Well, the, well, the show is, I think the show is called Shining Time Station.

1528
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,320
It's not, the show was not called Thomas the Tank Engine.

1529
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,640
Is it?

1530
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,000
Wait, I don't, wow, I'd never heard of that.

1531
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,840
I thought it was Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.

1532
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,200
No, this, this, this is like a Warriors versus Warrior.

1533
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,520
Everyone calls it Thomas the Tank Engine, but no.

1534
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:46,600
The series, wait, wait, is this a different show?

1535
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,080
Yeah, he was Mr.

1536
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,720
conductor on Shining Time Station, as was George Carlin.

1537
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,600
Element, wait a minute, elements of the show were incorporated into the

1538
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,600
two, into the 2000, no, Thomas and Friends film.

1539
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,360
Okay, no, that's later.

1540
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,480
That's like a remake.

1541
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:16,040
It incorporated sequences from the British.

1542
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:19,240
Oh my God, this is amazing.

1543
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,560
Holy shit, they fucking, they power-rangered it.

1544
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,720
Huh?

1545
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:25,000
This is blowing my mind.

1546
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,600
This is blowing my fucking mind.

1547
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:31,640
Okay, I guess Thomas, Thomas the Tank Engine, I guess was a British show.

1548
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,040
They showed it in America.

1549
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,320
I didn't know any of this.

1550
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:40,760
They showed it in America, but they showed it as part of a program called Shining Time Station,

1551
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:46,760
and the Thomas the Tank Engine were just segments in the Shining Time Station show.

1552
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,400
Did you watch that as Shining Time Station?

1553
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,240
Yes, yes, I did.

1554
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,200
I watched Shining Time Station as a kid.

1555
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:01,240
I just knew it as, we had a VHS, I think, of Thomas the Tank Engine and Ringo Starr said

1556
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:04,200
stuff, and it was just it, that was it.

1557
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,200
But Ringo Starr was on Shining Time Station.

1558
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,640
He wasn't in Thomas the Tank Engine.

1559
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,720
No, he was the voice of the narrator for Thomas, yeah, first two series of Thomas and Friends.

1560
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,920
Well, that's confusing, because he was, I guess he did both.

1561
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,600
I guess maybe, I guess his hit, I mean, he's a big name in America as well.

1562
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,960
Him doing the Thomas the Tank Engine narration, and then they get him over for the American

1563
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,400
something or other.

1564
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:41,640
I'm confused why they felt the need to remake it and add new non-train segments.

1565
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,120
I'm confused why they felt they had to do that, considering the original is in English.

1566
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:58,120
Wow, this is very, very, very weird, very strange.

1567
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,880
So because of that, Ringo's the best.

1568
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,480
What do I know?

1569
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,960
I know that John Lennon was a fucking hippie.

1570
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,240
I know that Paul, I know that Paul died.

1571
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,200
I know.

1572
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,760
And that you just make survive, that's all.

1573
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:23,640
Yeah, I've seen that quite a review video about the conspiracy that Paul is dead, yeah.

1574
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,280
My favorite has been George, just because I liked his solo work more.

1575
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,800
Actually, I don't know about that.

1576
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,800
Nah, my favorite is Paul, because I like his solo work more.

1577
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,640
George is the one that I know the least about.

1578
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:43,000
George is the guy who got the Indian, like the sitar influence,

1579
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,880
musical stuff into the Beatles for those two albums.

1580
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,640
I thought that was John Lennon.

1581
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,200
No, no, no.

1582
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,440
John wishes he was that fucking hippiness.

1583
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:58,360
I think John was actually jealous of George for having like a weird, interesting passion,

1584
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,080
and he was like, fuck.

1585
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,720
So I'm going to marry an Asian lady.

1586
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,480
Yeah, I'll show him.

1587
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,200
I'll show him.

1588
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,360
That's funny.

1589
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:12,200
If you had asked me who were in the Beatles, I would have said Paul, Ringo, John.

1590
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,520
I think I might have forgotten that there even was a George.

1591
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,120
Like, I know there's four of them, but I don't think I would have remembered that his name was George.

1592
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,480
So that's-

1593
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,480
My favorite is George Allison.

1594
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:25,560
I don't know.

1595
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,440
I don't really have a favorite.

1596
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,040
I don't know.

1597
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,480
Sorry.

1598
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,360
Okay.

1599
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,480
You've got a good answer, though.

1600
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,440
And now I know about Shining Time Station.

1601
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,120
Next, the next voicemail is called Henlo Corgo, cool and new webcomic.

1602
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,960
Three, two, one, go.

1603
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,040
Hey, then.

1604
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:50,520
So I was wondering if you have heard of, or perhaps even read, cool and new webcomic,

1605
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:57,640
the Homestuck fancomic, where they're rewriting Homestuck in the style of Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff.

1606
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:58,600
Yeah.

1607
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,680
It's actually pretty good, pretty funny.

1608
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,400
If you haven't read it, I would totally check it out.

1609
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:09,000
I have seen it, and I kind of made a mental note that like I want to read this,

1610
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,280
but it was still going on.

1611
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,560
So I think I said like, I'll come back and read this later,

1612
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,960
and I haven't ever gotten around to actually reading it.

1613
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,280
But yeah, I've seen it, and I think it looks cool.

1614
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:20,040
I read some of it.

1615
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,960
I got to a point where there was like-

1616
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:27,320
It was a funny joke, where it's like the midnight crew.

1617
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,240
They're all like dumb, except for Jack.

1618
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:38,040
And they're like, you know, like the things they say,

1619
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:44,280
sleep with the fishes, but put them in a good, I don't know.

1620
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,400
I can't think of the joke.

1621
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,520
It's the things they say that you could interpret as like a thing that's not killing them,

1622
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,120
but it's obviously supposed to be like murder them, please.

1623
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:57,400
But because he's not clear and uses like the gangster lingo,

1624
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,920
they just take it literally, like put him to bed.

1625
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,880
Put him to bed means literally like tuck him in, give him warm milk.

1626
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,880
I remember that being pretty funny.

1627
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,880
Gotcha, gotcha.

1628
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,640
But there was a point where they were doing like a walk around,

1629
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:13,000
or like a really long video.

1630
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,800
It just got a little too long.

1631
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,320
I did like it though.

1632
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:27,720
I, yeah, I think it looks cool, and I want to read it, but I have not.

1633
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,480
So I don't have much to say about it.

1634
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,640
Other than it looks, I think it looks pretty funny.

1635
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,760
Maybe I'll check it out soon.

1636
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:41,640
Next voicemail is called Dear Ben Fat Fuck Saint.

1637
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,320
Three, two, one, go.

1638
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,600
Yo Ben, the reason you're putting on a fuckload of weight

1639
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,520
is because you're not fucking running.

1640
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:53,720
Lifting it ain't shit if you can't actually get any goddamn cardio in.

1641
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:56,280
That's where all of your calories are supposed to fucking go.

1642
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:56,760
So cringe.

1643
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,560
Fucking fat, so.

1644
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:58,680
So cringe.

1645
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,400
Man, that's weird, man.

1646
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,480
But it's also funny.

1647
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,240
Uh, the reason why anyone ever gains weight

1648
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:11,160
is because they eat more calories than they expend.

1649
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,960
You think I don't understand this?

1650
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,320
I understand this.

1651
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:19,080
You can, you can reduce that number by increasing your calorie output

1652
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,520
by doing, for example, cardio, or you can reduce it by eating fewer calories.

1653
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,320
They both work.

1654
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:30,200
Uh, running is, I hate it.

1655
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,480
I know I probably should do it.

1656
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,480
I know it has health benefits.

1657
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,840
Quote unquote, good thing.

1658
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,480
Quote unquote, good for you.

1659
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,440
Um, lame.

1660
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,960
Next, what, what, I, what does he say?

1661
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,760
Like what good is lifting if you can't run?

1662
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,280
What do you, you get fucking strong?

1663
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,760
That's what you get strong and you get muscles.

1664
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,640
That's what good it is.

1665
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,760
What are you talking about?

1666
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,000
What do you think people lift so that they can run?

1667
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,280
No, anyone can run.

1668
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,720
Any idiot can run.

1669
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:04,360
Oh my god.

1670
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,280
Fucking perverts out there.

1671
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,800
Am I right?

1672
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,480
Uh, sure.

1673
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,560
Next voicemail is called Racky the Robot Guy.

1674
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,920
Three, two, one, go.

1675
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:20,760
Remember when people used to come to the show and ask for dating advice?

1676
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,240
Yeah, they don't do that anymore.

1677
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:24,520
You know why?

1678
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Because pussies layer, vagina, wetter, panty dropper,

1679
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:34,280
chick seducer, boner, giver, backbreaker, women, bedder.

1680
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:34,840
Who's it going to be?

1681
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,440
Nate best guy ever isn't here right now.

1682
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,920
What do you say in your defense?

1683
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,240
Of course.

1684
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,800
I'm sure everyone was like.

1685
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,920
There's nothing to defend.

1686
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,920
We're thoroughly destroyed.

1687
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,120
That everyone was like, that guy's got it figured out.

1688
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:01,400
I want to know how can I slay, how can I slay,

1689
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:04,280
how can I eviscerate vagina?

1690
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,720
Like that guy.

1691
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,400
How can I critical hit that puss?

1692
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,920
How can I fucking vorpal slash decapitate?

1693
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:17,320
How can I put the pussy in a sarcophagus like him?

1694
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,120
How can I mummify it?

1695
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:25,560
And I have nothing to say in my defense.

1696
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,320
I'm guilty, your honor.

1697
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,360
I'm a beta.

1698
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,680
Next voicemail is called It's Not About SF2 This Time.

1699
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:35,880
Three, two, one, go.

1700
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:40,520
Okay, Ben, I really hate to meme on you like this,

1701
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,800
but you have to watch Odd Taxi, dude.

1702
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,440
It just finished up and the ending just turned everything on its head.

1703
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,240
I mean, let's be real now.

1704
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,600
Invincible, fucking, I sleep.

1705
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:56,520
Odd Taxi, though.

1706
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,360
I also had me fucking shook.

1707
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,280
You just have to watch it.

1708
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:04,200
I mean, I won't blame you if you don't want to, but it's really good.

1709
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,160
I'm sure it's good.

1710
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,120
I'm sure it's great.

1711
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:06,920
I don't care.

1712
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,360
I don't care about shows.

1713
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:09,560
I don't care about anything.

1714
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,720
Thanks for the recommendation, idiot.

1715
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,320
You got anything to say about that, Gib?

1716
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:18,760
How, why?

1717
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,760
I wasn't listening because they were talking about you.

1718
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,880
Okay, do you see an Odd Taxi?

1719
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,600
What do you think about Odd Taxi?

1720
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,960
I've seen Crazy Taxi.

1721
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,760
No, no, not the same, not the same.

1722
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,440
Okay, next one.

1723
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:34,280
It's an MP3 link.

1724
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:34,920
You got it up?

1725
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,200
Yes.

1726
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:41,560
It's one of these ones a guy can't fucking figure out how Speakpipe works.

1727
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,040
Okay, this one is called Munchy Shortly After He Hacks the Universe.

1728
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,280
Three, two, one, go.

1729
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:51,240
I might have to rewrite your history in a second here.

1730
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,560
It sounds keyboard-clacking.

1731
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,600
And done.

1732
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,200
You have.

1733
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,440
I hope you enjoy being trans.

1734
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:05,080
Got me.

1735
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,280
Did you remember when that was from?

1736
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:10,040
I don't.

1737
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:17,480
I feel like it was, it must have been a like a fucking something or other.

1738
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,160
Radcon?

1739
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,520
PCP or maybe a ChibiBuckers.

1740
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,880
I feel it's like low energy.

1741
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,080
Maybe it was a stream.

1742
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:25,720
No idea.

1743
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,240
But I do remember that happening.

1744
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,240
If anyone remembers when that was, leave a comment because I...

1745
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,040
I don't watch this show.

1746
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,320
I don't watch this garbage.

1747
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,320
You seen that, you seen that Trump tweet, my favorite Trump tweet?

1748
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:44,360
Isn't he gum?

1749
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,320
Or is it an old one?

1750
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:47,720
He's always in our hearts.

1751
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,760
He's forever in our hearts.

1752
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:51,000
The old Trump tweet about Coca-Cola.

1753
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,600
If I've mentioned it before, I'll say it again.

1754
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:59,400
The best Trump tweet was, it was like paraphrasing.

1755
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,080
Coca-Cola company is not happy with me.

1756
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,120
That's okay.

1757
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,720
I'll still drink that garbage.

1758
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,960
I remember that.

1759
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,600
So good.

1760
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,560
That's my favorite one.

1761
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:15,080
He's had some real bangers, but that one was an all-time classic.

1762
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,200
That's like almost equivalent to a drill.

1763
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:19,960
It is.

1764
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:20,520
A little tweet.

1765
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:21,960
It really is.

1766
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:28,040
All the, literally all the best tweets are just remind you of drill tweets.

1767
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,280
Every, it's like, you know how evolution, right?

1768
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:36,920
You know how like in nature, evolution, like everything eventually becomes a crab?

1769
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:41,640
Like the crab is the perfect form and every creature eventually approaches crab hood.

1770
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,120
I didn't know that.

1771
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,440
Surely you're familiar with carcinization.

1772
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:48,520
I am not a crab.

1773
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:55,400
It is, it is, it is true that in nature many, even things that are not like related,

1774
01:40:55,400 --> 01:41:00,200
like genetically, a lot of like evolutionary lines have sort of

1775
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:07,160
gravitated towards a similar form that resembles a crab, like among multiple different.

1776
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,600
The crab is just a very efficient shape.

1777
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,560
It's just a very successful shape in nature.

1778
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:17,720
Well, on Twitter and the ecosystem of Twitter, it's the same.

1779
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:24,120
And like people's posting habits all strive towards a single, like perfect template,

1780
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:28,360
a single perfect platonic ideal.

1781
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,040
And that ideal is the drill tweet.

1782
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,520
It's the ultimate realization of the medium.

1783
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,840
They don't strive towards it.

1784
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,040
They randomly throw things out there and the drill tweets are like, they naturally select.

1785
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,200
Yes, the more like drill your tweet is,

1786
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,800
the more successful it will be and the more its genes will be passed on.

1787
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,480
Yeah, it's true.

1788
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,320
I think I think I'm literally correct.

1789
01:41:55,880 --> 01:42:00,680
Next voicemail is called anti-capitalist except for my cheeky tendies.

1790
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,480
Three, two, one, go.

1791
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:08,360
I don't understand why so many people are so willing to go to bat for industrialized

1792
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,240
animal farming.

1793
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,840
These are massive corporations.

1794
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,120
They are not your friend.

1795
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,800
Their business model is to produce as much as efficiently as possible.

1796
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:20,760
And then obscure from the public the horrifying scale and depravity of what it takes to do so.

1797
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,680
Like if you feel a little bad about chickens being kept in cages, you can buy free range.

1798
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:29,320
But no matter what eggs you buy, you're still supporting chick-calling, which is the process

1799
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:34,360
of tossing all the male chicks into industrial grinders because keeping them alive would be

1800
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,160
a waste of money.

1801
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:41,320
Like we have laws around animal abuse, but these companies are just completely exempt from them

1802
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:45,640
except for the most threadbare of regulations, which they oftentimes do not even follow.

1803
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:50,360
It just seems like the most quintessential capitalist nightmare and the fact that so

1804
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:55,960
many people, especially leftists, are so apathetic or even actively supporting of it

1805
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,080
is baffling to me.

1806
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,280
Yeah, sounds right.

1807
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,840
I mean, people like their tendies.

1808
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,480
Your title said it all.

1809
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,560
If getting rid of it would cost people their tendies, like I understand,

1810
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,080
but I don't want to lose my tendies.

1811
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:16,440
I like my tendies.

1812
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,280
I literally ate tendies today.

1813
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:23,160
I, Ben St, cooked tendies and ate them before this episode.

1814
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,440
So I am part of the problem, probably.

1815
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,440
There's an addendum, so let's listen to that.

1816
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,280
Three, two, one, go.

1817
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,880
Also, if there's the response of, oh, well, that's a problem of the system.

1818
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:39,480
We need to work for better regulation instead of pinning the blame on the individual.

1819
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:43,720
The thing is that these are problems inherent to the practice of industrialized animal farming.

1820
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:47,640
There is no sustainable way to produce as many animal products as we do

1821
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,160
without running into these issues, no matter what system we're working under

1822
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:54,440
or whatever regulations we have, unless it is just total abolition.

1823
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,600
I feel like the goalposts move there.

1824
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:04,440
Is the problem that the practice is immoral or is the problem that it's unsustainable?

1825
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:12,200
I think the first one was more like, I can't believe people don't care enough.

1826
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,040
But without mentioning why that was a bad thing.

1827
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,000
I see.

1828
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,680
I mean, I don't know.

1829
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,240
I guess he's right.

1830
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:30,920
Yeah.

1831
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:34,440
I also like my tendies, but I acknowledge it is true.

1832
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,080
I mean, what is the world?

1833
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:42,440
Okay, question, serious question.

1834
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,320
What is the perfect world?

1835
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:54,040
Is it a world where nobody eats meat or is it a world where there is meat, but it's ethically

1836
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,120
farmed?

1837
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:02,520
The whole conversation around this has always been a little weird for me.

1838
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:10,120
And I think a while ago, I settled on, okay, I don't care about animals rights then.

1839
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:15,400
I'd rather just eat and not pick and choose what things I care about.

1840
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,280
Like, oh, but what about cats and dogs?

1841
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:24,120
Well, some people do eat those, but I eat chicken, so I eat fish.

1842
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,080
I participate in all this stuff by eating the things.

1843
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,200
Yeah.

1844
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:30,520
I don't know.

1845
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,720
Maybe that's lazy and stupid of me, but I don't know.

1846
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,760
I can't help it.

1847
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:39,960
If I'm going to own it, then I'll own it, but I don't know.

1848
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,800
Doing something, it takes a lot.

1849
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:52,120
It takes a lot, not just to advocate and eat vegetables, because that's possible.

1850
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:56,920
It's the, I don't know.

1851
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:01,240
I hate this conversation.

1852
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:05,720
I need a lot more brain power right now to argue about it.

1853
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:10,520
I'll just accept that I'm a bad person and that I will eat and kill animals,

1854
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,920
because it's easier for me to accept that about myself than it is to try and

1855
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:21,320
change my entire world, change everything about the way I consume food,

1856
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,960
because no matter what I do about food specifically, there's always going to be

1857
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:31,480
some industry that I'm supporting by participating in purchasing anything.

1858
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:32,440
Sure.

1859
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:37,080
So I'm like, at some point, I'm like, yeah, fine.

1860
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:39,480
I'll just, I'll be, I'm a murderer.

1861
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:39,960
Fuck it.

1862
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,040
Yeah.

1863
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,160
I agree.

1864
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,160
I agree.

1865
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,120
It's intractable.

1866
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:56,520
I want to be better about it, but like I just, it's too hard to do all that and also work on

1867
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,360
myself and everything I'm trying to do.

1868
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,240
Like, I don't think about what I put in my mouth too much.

1869
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,240
I'm like, oh God, I got to eat today.

1870
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,200
Oh shit, I haven't eaten.

1871
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,880
And I have to think, oh wait, I've been meaning to like change my diet so that it's different.

1872
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,880
And now I got to buy all this other stuff.

1873
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:20,920
Maybe there's like, you know, it's worth, it's worth like doing that for the,

1874
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,840
it's just not easy and I don't like it.

1875
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,680
We can talk about this all day.

1876
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,880
My, my, my, I have no defense.

1877
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,400
That's, that's my position.

1878
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:34,360
I have no defense.

1879
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,480
I'm a murderer.

1880
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,840
I'll eat a horse.

1881
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,640
I'll eat a cat.

1882
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:39,720
I like eating.

1883
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,720
I don't give a fuck, but I do, but I don't, but I do, but I won't, but I

1884
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:47,640
don't, I just want to break down, just punch the ground.

1885
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:48,760
I don't know what to do about it.

1886
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:53,640
We do eat, we do eat too much meat.

1887
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,160
I think, I think it's just true that like America and probably the UK just eat like

1888
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,920
more meat than is necessary.

1889
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,960
And probably our, even aside from like, you know, killing animals is bad and cruel.

1890
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,080
That might be true.

1891
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:11,960
But I think like just like reducing our meat intake would probably mean that our

1892
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,800
impact on the environment would be better.

1893
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,320
Yeah, I've heard that.

1894
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:16,680
Yeah.

1895
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,880
That's definitely a better reason than, don't feel bad about it.

1896
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,400
Because I don't, I don't believe, I mean, I don't believe that, I don't believe that

1897
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:30,200
consumer choices are going to drive change in that area.

1898
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,120
Like the best, the best it'll do is create a new market for like fucking hippy vegan

1899
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,440
equally consumer.

1900
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,880
Ooh, ethical capitalism bullshit.

1901
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,040
Yeah, that's kind of how I feel.

1902
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:46,200
Okay, let's-

1903
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,520
It's, it's, yeah, I thought I could shut up.

1904
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:50,760
Yeah, keep digging my hole.

1905
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:55,320
Next voicemail is Janess, three, two, one, go.

1906
01:48:56,040 --> 01:49:01,720
How do you talk for so long on podcasts and streams without having to gasp for breath?

1907
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,640
I know, it's so annoying.

1908
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,000
I'm so obnoxious.

1909
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,280
I never, shut up.

1910
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,240
You just gasped for breath right then.

1911
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,840
I literally, I do, I mean, do you think I don't, I mean, I do breathe.

1912
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:20,920
I don't know what they mean, because obviously we take breath while we're speaking.

1913
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,840
I don't, I don't have any tips and tricks.

1914
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:28,200
I just may, I think that maybe you just don't notice the breathing.

1915
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,560
I think maybe it's like-

1916
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,480
Now you're noticing it, because I'm noticing it.

1917
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1918
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:43,880
Sometimes I'll hear a YouTuber say like, oh, I think like maybe Mr. Beetong made a comment

1919
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:47,880
or someone, sometimes I'll make a comment like, oh yeah, that video sounds really bad.

1920
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,760
You know, you, you can hear my lip smacking.

1921
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,600
You can hear my, my, get my breathing.

1922
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,880
You can hear my, my smacks and pops or whatever.

1923
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,720
And I'll have never noticed it at all.

1924
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:01,000
Right, but they, but they noticed it.

1925
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,360
So maybe you just don't, maybe your brain is just filtering out.

1926
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:06,200
Like you don't pay attention, because that's just noise.

1927
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:08,760
And you don't pay attention to it.

1928
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,920
It's, it's, maybe it's similar to like-

1929
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,800
Because I definitely do gasp for breath all the time.

1930
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:20,760
Because like, I shave my arms, right, to get rid of the arm hair.

1931
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:21,880
That's the dysphoria thing.

1932
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:27,400
But I never really pay attention to the fact that women have arm hair.

1933
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,560
It's not, it's just a little less noticeable.

1934
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:33,320
But like having completely smooth arms is not a feminine thing.

1935
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:36,680
It is a, is a, you know, it's a different thing.

1936
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,520
Yeah.

1937
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,760
So like in real life, people breathe.

1938
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,720
You just don't notice it.

1939
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:43,560
Sad, but true.

1940
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,200
Sad, but true.

1941
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,000
They really do.

1942
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,560
They do, they do be breathing though.

1943
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,600
We do a little breathing.

1944
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,040
Just a little.

1945
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,480
Next voicemail is called ravioli.

1946
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,920
Three, two, one, go.

1947
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,360
It has made some really good ravioli.

1948
01:50:59,160 --> 01:50:59,640
Nice.

1949
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:02,040
My rat is eating something and she really likes it.

1950
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,600
You just wanted to say that to somebody.

1951
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,000
Based.

1952
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,160
Cool.

1953
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:10,440
You should have made a rat tattoo.

1954
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:17,640
I made, I made one time I made, I think it was like sweet potato ravioli.

1955
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:21,320
Like it had like a spice, like sweet potato interior.

1956
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,200
Potato inside of a fucking pasta.

1957
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,160
I know.

1958
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:26,920
It's more of a pierogi at that point.

1959
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,440
But I made, I made, that was the only time that I made the pasta from scratch.

1960
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:36,920
Like I made the pasta dough and I like flattened it and I cut it into squares.

1961
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,200
And I made the little pouches.

1962
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,680
That was the only time in my life that I've like made pasta.

1963
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:43,160
It's really freaking hard.

1964
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:48,200
Maybe you just have to practice a lot and get efficient at it.

1965
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:50,040
I would like to do that.

1966
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:50,760
That sounds fun.

1967
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,200
I'd never tried it for some reason.

1968
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,680
Have you ever had, have you ever had pierogies?

1969
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,760
I don't think so.

1970
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,240
They are a Polish thing.

1971
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:04,200
It's basically, it's basically like a dumpling or a ravioli.

1972
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,840
But it's got, it's got mashed potatoes inside.

1973
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:07,880
It's good.

1974
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,840
No, no thoughts, no thoughts on that.

1975
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,320
Oh, sorry.

1976
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:16,200
I just blacked out.

1977
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,840
No, no thoughts head empty.

1978
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:19,800
Ravioli.

1979
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,200
Ravioli.

1980
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,160
Hey, I make it up.

1981
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,760
Hey, I make of the pierogi.

1982
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,400
Hey, I make of the borsche.

1983
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,200
I cook it up.

1984
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:28,680
What's on it?

1985
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,960
I make it a kilbasa.

1986
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,600
Mamma mia, cześć.

1987
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:33,800
What's on it?

1988
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,400
What's a, what's a Polish thing?

1989
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,320
Uh, hey, hey, minnowie, minnowie popolsku.

1990
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,280
Uh, pasta brazu.

1991
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:47,800
That was the one, that was the one phrase that I remember off the top of my head

1992
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,160
that I could say in Polish.

1993
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:50,600
Minnowie popolsku.

1994
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,800
I don't speak Polish.

1995
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,040
Minnowie, minnowie popolsku.

1996
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,760
Next, and cześć, which is a, no, cześć is high.

1997
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:03,560
Oh, and of course, nazdrowie, which is cheers.

1998
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,360
Oh, and stola.

1999
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,560
Obviously.

2000
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:11,160
Next.

2001
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:16,440
Next voicemail is called ravioli two.

2002
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:17,160
Okay.

2003
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:18,760
Three, two, one, go.

2004
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,040
Wait, my other rat, I gave her ravioli.

2005
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,800
She did not like the ravioli.

2006
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:24,840
Damn.

2007
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:25,400
That's it.

2008
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:29,000
One of, there are, there are two rats inside of you.

2009
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:30,760
Uh, uh.

2010
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:32,760
Only one of them likes ravioli.

2011
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,840
There's, there's two rats inside of you.

2012
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:37,240
The one that wins is the one that you feed.

2013
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:40,280
And the one that you feed will be the one that likes ravioli

2014
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,720
because the other one won't eat it.

2015
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:43,640
What?

2016
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:45,160
Yeah.

2017
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,480
You know the, say, you know the saying about the, there's two.

2018
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,960
Yeah, I know the saying about the two rats and the ravioli.

2019
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,160
It's a classic phrase.

2020
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:56,200
Oh, the rats and the ravioli and the silver spoon.

2021
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:02,520
Yeah.

2022
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:05,480
Yeah.

2023
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:05,880
Okay.

2024
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:10,200
Next voicemail is called out three, two, one, go.

2025
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,280
God damn it, Ben.

2026
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:15,720
You laid the seat like two or three weeks ago or something.

2027
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:21,560
And it's, it's just been there in the subconscious, the voice, the voice telling me,

2028
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:25,240
just, just try to open your mouth as far as you fucking can.

2029
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:25,880
I'm sorry.

2030
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,760
Ben was right.

2031
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:27,640
See if it'll hurt.

2032
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,680
See if it'll keep hurting after you close it again.

2033
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,960
You can, you can make it hurt if you want to.

2034
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,680
Fuck you, Ben.

2035
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,240
I'm sorry.

2036
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,560
I had not thought about that.

2037
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,840
But now, now that he's brought it up or they brought it up,

2038
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,360
I should not do the gender thing.

2039
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:47,160
But now that they brought it up, everyone who listens to this podcast will now think about it.

2040
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:53,080
That is the, that is the kind of thing that, I mean, yeah, that's the kind of thing that,

2041
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,760
like, I would get that idea in my head.

2042
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:58,840
I would hear someone say, what happens if you open your mouth as wide as you can?

2043
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:03,880
And then I would consider, this is what I'm, this is the same thing with me thinking about

2044
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,880
what if I got my head crushed by a train?

2045
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,040
It's like, now I just think about it all the time.

2046
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,720
What if, what if, what if you were trying to open your mouth as wide as it could?

2047
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:15,400
But before you got to the maximum amount, you got hit by a train

2048
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,520
and you could never find out.

2049
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:25,000
At least then I wouldn't have to feel weird of my jaw unhinged and fucked up.

2050
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,440
Yeah, be in many pieces.

2051
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:31,720
Many, many pieces, little tiny pieces, all down the train track.

2052
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:35,160
I hate it.

2053
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:37,240
I fucking hate it.

2054
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:38,680
I hate having a physical body.

2055
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,040
Shit, I can't wait to be dead.

2056
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:46,520
I should go put my head on a fucking train track so I don't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.

2057
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,400
In Minecraft.

2058
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,800
I should go put my head on a mine cart track.

2059
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:53,000
You just got to do, you just got to have like the catharsis-

2060
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,160
Made a void, made a void metal, Thaumaturge.

2061
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:59,960
You got to have the catharsis of the train crush head simulator game to get,

2062
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,720
answer all these questions.

2063
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:08,360
You're, I, I don't want to think about it.

2064
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,720
Okay, next voicemail is called Uwu,

2065
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:15,640
UwuLillia recommends a documentary.

2066
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,720
This is from kukmichael at comeonmytits.com.

2067
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:21,720
Three, two, one, go.

2068
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:27,000
Hi guys, so I saw this really good documentary.

2069
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,800
It's about how coves are bad actually.

2070
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,280
What's bad?

2071
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:33,640
They're kind of alien and they're being used to place us.

2072
01:56:34,280 --> 01:56:37,640
And not gonna lie, once I finished watching it,

2073
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,200
I decided I'm never wearing coves again.

2074
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,600
It also makes it way easier for me to come up with titties.

2075
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:48,360
So, uh, you're talking about, are you talking about Kill-a-Kill?

2076
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,560
It's on Netflix.

2077
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:50,680
It's called Kill-a-Kill.

2078
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,160
I knew it.

2079
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:52,840
I think you should really check it out.

2080
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:57,480
Come on Michelle, take that tittie away.

2081
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:01,160
You want a taste of the name, don't you?

2082
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:01,560
Gross.

2083
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:05,240
This is the only place you're going to kill it.

2084
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:17,640
Well, um, Michelle, response, they just want to fuck me.

2085
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:19,080
Why would they do this?

2086
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,400
Well, the same reason they do anything is they really want to fuck me.

2087
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,920
It's the animating force behind.

2088
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,760
Why do they have to do this and also have a terrible microphone?

2089
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,560
That's what I want to know.

2090
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:31,960
You know fair, yeah.

2091
01:57:32,680 --> 01:57:41,320
I like relatively high effort, uh, sound modulation effects combined with a terrible audio quality.

2092
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:42,520
Lamal.

2093
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:49,080
Uh, next voicemail is called XXX Hardcore Brutal Painful...

2094
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:53,000
What?

2095
01:57:53,640 --> 01:58:01,800
Wait, um, fucking, fucking, um, fucking munchie at Al are calling me.

2096
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:05,240
I'm in the middle of a fucking podcast, you freaks.

2097
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:06,920
Uh-oh.

2098
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,640
You're going to miss your last chance to say hello to munchie.

2099
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,400
My god, I hope so.

2100
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:14,920
Uh, okay.

2101
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,440
Jesus.

2102
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,440
All right, uh, where was I?

2103
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:26,520
Hardcore Brutal Painful Sad Heartbreaking Dirty Anal XXX321.

2104
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:27,160
Let's jam.

2105
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,000
What's up, fellas?

2106
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,320
I want to know if you guys saw the new, um, Sara Z, I believe it's her name.

2107
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:34,280
Sara Z.

2108
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:40,360
Video about she, she's getting legal threat from, from Homestuck.

2109
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:44,280
Homestuck, it's a legal threat, threat, threat, threat.

2110
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:45,640
I've stopped listening.

2111
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:47,080
Yeah, I've seen that.

2112
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,800
Threatening her, uh, it was a big one.

2113
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:50,360
Okay.

2114
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,160
End of voicemail.

2115
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:51,560
That's it.

2116
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:52,200
I've heard enough.

2117
01:58:52,440 --> 01:59:01,080
Um, I didn't watch that video because I'm annoyed by its premise and I don't like her

2118
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,280
face in the thumbnail.

2119
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,440
Those are the two reasons why I haven't watched it.

2120
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:10,040
I didn't watch it for a while, for the similar, for a similar like, oh,

2121
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:11,800
it's a drama video or something.

2122
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:12,600
I don't care.

2123
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:13,880
Like Homestuck, whatever.

2124
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:17,080
But people assured me that it was a wild ride.

2125
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:21,640
So I just, you know, I wanted to see and it is kind of wild,

2126
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,760
but it is ultimately kind of like a whatever.

2127
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:26,360
What annoys me.

2128
01:59:26,360 --> 01:59:28,200
It's like a Lindsay Ellis drama video.

2129
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,600
There's something that annoys me about it and it's, I think it's that like,

2130
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:39,240
there's a little bit of, I feel a little duplicitousness about it because I know

2131
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,720
that Sara Z.

2132
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,160
Like I'm imagining myself in her position, I would be thrilled to receive a spurious

2133
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:55,960
legal threat from whatpumpkin.com and then to make this video because this is the kind

2134
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:01,160
of thing that would get a lot of views and it also, it's, it's, it's the, it's the,

2135
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:07,880
it's the jackpot because not it's, it's like current, it's drama and it's about something

2136
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,600
that's popular, but it's also about you.

2137
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:16,280
And the fact that this content is now it, it's an excuse to talk about yourself and

2138
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:21,160
profile yourself and make yourself kind of the, the center of attention.

2139
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:29,960
And that's like exactly what a YouTuber thrives on is getting the audience to invest in them.

2140
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,680
So I know that she must love this.

2141
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:37,880
And yet I see her on the thumbnail and she's making a face like she's sad and worried.

2142
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:39,400
And I think you're a liar.

2143
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,800
That face is lying to me and it pisses me off.

2144
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:44,200
I mean, I guess you could call it a lie.

2145
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,760
That's how I feel.

2146
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,440
That's how I feel when I see it.

2147
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,600
The video is like self-contained.

2148
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:56,680
Like the story begins and ends with the video because she goes through all of the emails

2149
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,880
and by the end of the video, she says they've dropped the claim.

2150
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:03,560
So the video was not necessary in like clearing her name or anything.

2151
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,400
She just wanted to tell the story about it.

2152
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,240
Just like, let's look at this wacky like emails from Andrew himself.

2153
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:15,400
He starts, he starts his first email saying, hey, I made homestuck.

2154
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,000
And that was Andrew's kind of funny.

2155
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,560
Like, like unintentionally.

2156
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:24,760
And I suppose it's interesting to see, but I don't really, I didn't watch this and then

2157
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,960
say, wow, what a great YouTuber Sarah's is that is.

2158
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:29,640
I will now subscribe.

2159
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,520
Like that's, I was just mostly interested in seeing Andrew.

2160
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:35,080
How's he read, write strange emails.

2161
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:42,440
I'm just trying to explain the kind of like, the kind of like immediate like sort of gut

2162
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:45,400
level, like I'm a little bit repulsed when I see this.

2163
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:47,800
I felt the same.

2164
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:53,160
It's the same reason why I didn't watch, I didn't watch Lindsay Ellis's like video about

2165
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:54,840
how she got canceled on Twitter.

2166
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:58,200
And I didn't watch the new one that she just put, I used to watch every Lindsay Ellis video,

2167
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,960
but I didn't want to watch her, I got canceled on Twitter video.

2168
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:05,800
And because of that, I was, I also was like, you know what, I won't watch this other new

2169
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:07,400
Lindsay Ellis video either.

2170
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,840
I don't know if I care what she has to say.

2171
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,360
Maybe you should unsubscribe.

2172
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:15,480
Maybe I should unsubscribe from a YouTube channel, Lindsay, just for no real clear

2173
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:16,680
reason that I can articulate.

2174
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,800
But that's my right as a, as an American.

2175
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:22,280
And no one can tell me otherwise.

2176
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:25,000
Fourth of July, baby fireworks.

2177
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:25,320
Yeah.

2178
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:30,200
Uh, next voicemail is called AV.

2179
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,880
Three, two, one, go.

2180
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,760
Hey y'all, it's AVE.

2181
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,160
Long time listener, first time parasocial bastard.

2182
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,600
Just wanted to call in to say happy birthday to Gib.

2183
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:45,880
I got into the PCP from finding fighters are people too in like 2016.

2184
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,480
And I don't know if you even remember it, but the video real talk you should vote

2185
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:52,440
and here's why it's like the funniest thing in the entire world.

2186
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,720
If people listening haven't seen it, go watch it right now.

2187
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:56,840
It's very, very good.

2188
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:02,120
Um, I've been starting to transition in the last year.

2189
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,640
They them right now.

2190
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:08,840
And hearing your perspective and journey has really let me feel like I'm not just

2191
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:10,040
making stuff up in my head.

2192
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:13,880
You're one of the creators that has inspired me the most.

2193
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,600
And seeing you grow has made me feel like maybe I can too.

2194
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,600
Thanks for everything.

2195
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:20,120
Happy birthday.

2196
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:20,920
That's great.

2197
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:22,520
Anyways, PCP forever.

2198
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:23,400
Some will never die.

2199
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,800
Everybody go pledge to Lord of Ghosts right fucking now.

2200
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,020
Yeah.

2201
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:28,920
True.

2202
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:33,080
Well, I have no, I have no objections to any of that.

2203
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:33,480
Yeah.

2204
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,120
Thanks.

2205
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,160
Also interesting.

2206
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:40,280
You say you got into the PCP from spiders are people too.

2207
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:44,120
Spiders are people too is the animation you did, right?

2208
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,440
Yeah.

2209
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,320
It's like, I mean, it's on my give and take channel.

2210
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:48,600
And I guess.

2211
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,880
How many views does that have?

2212
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,520
It's not that many, I don't think.

2213
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,320
I'm very surprised.

2214
02:03:55,320 --> 02:04:00,920
I'm very surprised that that would be the first PCP media that someone would find.

2215
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,280
Yeah, 6.7 thousand views.

2216
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:09,560
It's just statistically, statistically.

2217
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:15,000
You would like, it's so much more likely that someone would have gotten into us through

2218
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,040
the Brony stuff or like the Chris Chan lecture or maybe one of the other lectures or like.

2219
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:23,240
Yeah, I'm very curious million view videos or something.

2220
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:28,600
I'm very curious where they saw spiders of people too, whether it was just recommended

2221
02:04:28,600 --> 02:04:29,560
or whether they were like.

2222
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,560
Yeah, where were they find it?

2223
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,080
Well, that's great.

2224
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:43,880
That's really nice to hear that I've inspired you and you're trying out new stuff.

2225
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,960
And that's a very wholesome voicemail.

2226
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,400
I call some voicemail.

2227
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:49,880
Thank you.

2228
02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:50,760
Thank you.

2229
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:51,800
AVE?

2230
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:53,000
Did they say their name was AVE?

2231
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,240
And AVE for AVE.

2232
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:57,320
I think they said AVE.

2233
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:57,800
What?

2234
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,760
Thanks for the voicemail.

2235
02:04:59,640 --> 02:04:59,960
I love you.

2236
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,040
Next, next voicemail is Hussie Suss.

2237
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,040
Is that the next one?

2238
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:08,760
Yes.

2239
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:09,960
Hussie Suss.

2240
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:11,480
Three, two, one, go.

2241
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:13,720
It's AVE again.

2242
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:16,360
I forgot to mention, have y'all seen this?

2243
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:20,280
There is the Zed Homestuck follow-up video that just came out.

2244
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:22,760
It seems right up your alley and I'd love to hear you talk about it.

2245
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:23,240
We just did.

2246
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,640
Sorry if my last voicemail was too long and gay.

2247
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:27,720
I'm trying my fucking bad.

2248
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:28,840
See y'all.

2249
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:30,120
It's fine.

2250
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:31,480
No, we already talked about it.

2251
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:35,720
Okay, next voicemail is a message for the ladies.

2252
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:37,720
Three, two, one, go.

2253
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:42,440
Men do not derive sexual pleasure from blowjobs.

2254
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:45,000
We just think they're really funny.

2255
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,440
Ladies, if you're listening to this, stop giving out blowjobs.

2256
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,520
But they're funny.

2257
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,760
It's been a prank this entire time.

2258
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,600
We're just messing with you.

2259
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,760
Stop falling for it.

2260
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:57,960
I can't stand the secondhand embarrassment anymore.

2261
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:00,600
I don't care if this is breaking man code telling you this.

2262
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,560
It's too much for me.

2263
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,680
I can't take it anymore.

2264
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:04,200
Blowjobs are not real.

2265
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,000
Stop doing them.

2266
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,600
We got, shut them up, shut them up.

2267
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,400
And the voicemail.

2268
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,400
No, we can't, Eleazar, cut that out.

2269
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:13,560
We can't let, we can't let the message, we can't let the message spread.

2270
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,400
Okay, a few.

2271
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,560
I'm glad Eleazar will.

2272
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:22,920
Do that and prevent, prevent, keep the secret.

2273
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:23,560
It's too funny.

2274
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,360
It's just a big prank.

2275
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:27,160
It's a big prank.

2276
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:28,200
We're all in on it.

2277
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:31,000
I'm sending a fucking, I'm sending a formal complaint

2278
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:35,640
about berserk chip for this one to the bro headquarters.

2279
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:40,040
I like the idea that it's, it's, it's like, it's a joke,

2280
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,360
but maybe even also not even pleasurable.

2281
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:48,120
It's, like the coming is just like, oh, just learn how to do that on command.

2282
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:50,600
Just so we can make it like look real.

2283
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,360
We have to, we have to take one for the team.

2284
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:52,920
It's work.

2285
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,000
We have to put in the work and take one for the team,

2286
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,400
just so we can tell everyone like, she did it again.

2287
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:58,120
Oh my God.

2288
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:58,680
LeMau.

2289
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:00,760
What an idiot.

2290
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:02,040
I can't believe it.

2291
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:04,280
I can't believe they fell for it again.

2292
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,720
Um, why, I mean, why is it a message for the ladies?

2293
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:11,160
Guys can give blowjobs.

2294
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:15,320
Wait, if two, if two guys, if a guy gives another guy a blowjob,

2295
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:20,360
then since they're both guys, they must both know that it's just a joke.

2296
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:21,640
Well, all right.

2297
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:23,880
Then if it's, if it's two guys doing it,

2298
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,000
then they must just both be doing it because they both think it's funny.

2299
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,960
No, no, no, no.

2300
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:33,400
They, no, they, they, they, they think that like when they're giving one,

2301
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:34,600
that it's doing something.

2302
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:37,320
And then therefore when they're getting one, they're like,

2303
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:40,440
Oh, I thought maybe, maybe something's wrong with me.

2304
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:42,280
I thought this was going to feel good,

2305
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:44,680
but instead I'm just laughing inside.

2306
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,360
But I got to pretend I like it.

2307
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,040
And so the lie continues.

2308
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:53,240
This is why, this is why people turn gay.

2309
02:07:53,960 --> 02:07:59,720
This is why, this is how cultural Bolshevism has made America gay.

2310
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:04,600
By just tricking men into thinking the, the natural order of things is men

2311
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:07,000
knowing that blowjobs are just a big prank and a joke.

2312
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:13,640
But they've, culture, media, media has convinced us that miscegenation is okay.

2313
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:17,640
And that blowjobs are serious and not just a fucking meme.

2314
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,880
And now look at us.

2315
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:26,680
Weak men rule the country, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

2316
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:27,560
Okay.

2317
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:31,320
Next voicemail, your name optional.

2318
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,880
Three, two, one, go.

2319
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:40,360
Girls and pals, I will think about like getting some sort of segment

2320
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,040
structure into the podcast.

2321
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:46,360
You can still do your like depressed, my life sucks, free talk,

2322
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,600
but like as a segment and like do other stuff because I feel like currently the podcast is sort

2323
02:08:52,600 --> 02:09:00,120
of just a, how do you say it, a cacophon of just hymning and highing about until you like go

2324
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:04,840
to voicemails and then get angry at people for doing shitty voicemail.

2325
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:11,720
So maybe, maybe I know that I know that you just want to, you just wanted to pee on the voicemail.

2326
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:16,440
So you thought of some paper thin excuse to be like, let me just frame this as the,

2327
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,800
in the form of giving advice.

2328
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:24,200
Some people, I think some people think they can have advice to give to be like,

2329
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:28,520
what if you guys did this with it instead of the podcast, the podcast needs to change.

2330
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,280
And here's my idea for how to change it.

2331
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:36,600
Well, they don't understand that the podcast is perfect now, as it always has been and always will

2332
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:44,360
be. There's no, there's no improvements to be made. I would say you say that it's a cacophon,

2333
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:50,440
I'm sure you deliberately pronounce mispronounced cacophony, but I still wouldn't use cacophony

2334
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:57,320
there. Cacophony is like loud, like a like a loud sort of like a din, like a chaotic

2335
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:01,800
layered of many mismatched noises.

2336
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:07,960
Some of the voicemails are a cacophony. I think the word you're looking for would probably be like,

2337
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:17,800
a, what's the word for just not like a loud explosion of chaos, but like a, like a disorganized

2338
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:24,600
labyrinth, no, like a, like a, like a rabble.

2339
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,440
A rabble is like a group of people.

2340
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:39,000
What's the word that me, a lasagna, you're speaking of a chaotic lasagna.

2341
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:45,320
An onion, a chaotic cacophonous onion lasagna. So many layers.

2342
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:51,960
There's definitely a word, a word that is like a, a, a strew, like strewn.

2343
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:56,680
Ah, fuck. I've sort of lost the thread of what you're trying to describe.

2344
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:02,760
Word that means something that is just kind of strewn all over the place randomly,

2345
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:15,880
structurally, chaotic mess, messy, unkempt, synonyms and ansonyms,

2346
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:24,840
uh, uh, just hither and thither, rats, a rats nest, a taxia,

2347
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:33,000
opel mel, opel mel is a great fucking, yes, here we go, synonym, a taxia, synonyms,

2348
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,920
I've never heard that, hold on, a taxia, definition, that's gotta have a Greek root, right?

2349
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:45,160
Uh, oh, a taxia, noun, the loss of full control of bodily movements.

2350
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:49,080
Oh, okay. Uh, that's not exactly what I'm looking for.

2351
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:58,280
Hurly burly, hurly burly, now there would be a great word, uh, uh, pal mel.

2352
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:02,760
So like you would say these hurly, pearly voicemails, what do you, what is the object?

2353
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:08,440
He, he's not talking about the whole, he's talking about the whole, uh,

2354
02:12:08,440 --> 02:12:12,600
the show, not just the voicemails. Also, pal mel noun, a state of affairs or

2355
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:18,280
collection of things characterized by haste or confusion. The pal mel is actually

2356
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:28,920
pandemonium, helter skelter, uh, pal, I'm on synonym, I love thesaurus.com,

2357
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:36,600
uh, noun, just sort of pandemonium, a snarl, a tumult, ooh, a tumult, yes, the whole podcast

2358
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:44,920
is just a tumult, that's good. Um, a ferment, tumultuous, stupid. Some of these are like bad.

2359
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:50,360
Actually, thesaurus kind of sucks sometimes. I don't know if these, I mean, tumults feels

2360
02:12:50,360 --> 02:13:01,960
like it's like a, a large crowd. And that's how I feel. Yeah. Two people just being disorderly is

2361
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:08,360
like hullabaloo. No, hullabaloo is noisy. Hullabaloo is raucous. This isn't like a big,

2362
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:16,120
like, like pandemonium is not the type of word. Cacophony implies noise, but most of the podcast

2363
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:23,720
is not noisy. It's just disordered. So not bedlam. Bedlam also implies noise. Uh,

2364
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:31,160
a, a spaghetti. I'm imagining like a, like a spaghetti, just like, like tubes.

2365
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:38,920
A series of spaghetti. There's a, there's a better word. There's gotta be a better word for not something

2366
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:45,880
that is noisy, but something that is, something that is randomly arranged, disordered, an arrangement

2367
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:53,560
of things that are, that are in disorder. Comment, if you, if you have a word, suggest a word in the

2368
02:13:53,560 --> 02:14:00,600
comments and I will, I will, I will like, I will favorite the best one. I feel like, like chaos,

2369
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:08,840
chaos is like some sort of a chaos, like a quiet chaos, something like that. I'm looking for one

2370
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:15,480
word though. I'm looking for one word. Deliberate chaos. That's two words. It's too many. You cut,

2371
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:19,880
sometimes you need two words. Sometimes there isn't one word to describe a very specific thing.

2372
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:23,320
It's always better to use one word instead of two.

2373
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:30,120
Anyway, I can't think of what I'm thinking of. So I'm just going to go with, you can't

2374
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:34,360
fucking think of the word. I'm going to go with palmel until someone suggests a better one in the

2375
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:44,840
comments. Next voicemail, cross. Am I the only one? Three, two, one, go. Am I the only one who,

2376
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:51,080
in Minecraft, enjoys breaking chicken eggs on a block that is sitting over top of lava, that way

2377
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:56,600
on the off chance that a baby chicken spawns, its first moments in this world will be consumed with

2378
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:03,400
fire, pain, molten lead, and the delicious smell of its own flesh cooking. Just me?

2379
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:11,880
Yes, just you. I mean, on my on a PCP server, there are no mobs, there are no chickens, so nobody

2380
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:16,840
lays any eggs. I mean, why would you throw eggs? Why would you collect eggs just so that you could

2381
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:21,160
throw them? Why would you throw it wouldn't like make profit from making more chickens that you

2382
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:26,440
can make more eggs? Why would you break eggs in a specific way? What is that? What do you think

2383
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:34,520
this is? Noida? Oh, that reminds me. I almost forgot to say this week I did it. I did the ultimate

2384
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:41,400
Noida thing. I got all 33 orbs. And now, um, wow, I got all three. No, I got to show you

2385
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:47,560
my character. I have a, I have a pendant. I have a magic pendant now. It's a miracle.

2386
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:53,480
There he is. There's my guy. He's got the pendant.

2387
02:15:53,480 --> 02:16:02,280
Oh, got the gold pendant because he got all he got 11 orbs from the main new game plus world.

2388
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:07,160
And he got 11 orbs from the East parallel world and he got 11 orbs from the West parallel world.

2389
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:12,840
Now the other the next thing I got to do is I got to do the Sunseed quest and I got to create

2390
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:22,600
the sun and the dark sun. But I will do that eventually probably not that soon. The this was

2391
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:29,400
this was a big this was a big I for a long time I didn't play Noida and it was because I had

2392
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:33,880
started a God run and then I kind of quit it in the middle at like at the point that I was like

2393
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:39,880
I'm I'm basically a God. Now I just have to do the work of actually going around and finding

2394
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:47,560
all 33 orbs. And it was so that was such like a busy work like I don't want that like I just

2395
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:52,840
didn't play Noida for like a month because I didn't have that usual urge of like I want to

2396
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:58,680
boot up Noida and just have that rush of like going from being a weakling to getting a chainsaw

2397
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:05,560
one coming and going and killing everything that that that feeling of progression was not there.

2398
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:10,920
And that's what usually enticed me. So I was just like, I just fuck it. But I was like,

2399
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:15,560
I think I think I've been I've been working on the game for like a long time this month.

2400
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:19,080
And I think I got burnt out. And I was like, I got to do something else. You know what?

2401
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:24,680
I'll finish that Noida game. And then I did. And I did my job. Wow. Wow.

2402
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:30,200
But I got the pendant. That's what's important. Next voicemail.

2403
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:39,320
Next voice is just an image. I guess I'll post the image. It's Sarah said is that it doesn't

2404
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:44,760
really look like her other than that it has blowing up. She's blowing up what pumpkin head

2405
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:51,800
quarters with a bomb. This is annoying. I'm an I feel like I don't I'm annoyed by this.

2406
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:58,200
Maybe that's not fair. But that's how I feel. That's my truth. I mean, I feel it's just sort of

2407
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:04,360
it's making her look so great when the only thing that really happened was that

2408
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:09,240
they had no case and she said no. And then they were like, yeah, sorry.

2409
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:17,240
Like she didn't do anything. She just didn't get destroyed by them for but they had no way

2410
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:21,560
to do it anyway. They would just I think the lady who initially gave the lawsuit

2411
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:28,760
admitted that she was mad. It's like an emotional thing. And it was very unprofessional, obviously.

2412
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:33,880
But like, obviously, there's just she's just like she's a YouTuber. It's yeah.

2413
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,920
Like sure, it's it's a little bit of an embarrassing snafu for what pumpkin and

2414
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:47,000
hussy by proxy. Absolutely the case. Nevertheless, Sarah Zed is just some YouTuber

2415
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,280
who doesn't even write her own scripts all by herself. She just sits on a couch and reads a script.

2416
02:18:53,160 --> 02:19:00,280
And she has never contributed anything of value to culture. I really feel this way.

2417
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:04,440
I'm sorry if this is cringe. I don't think Sarah Zed has contributed anything of value.

2418
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:09,480
Hussy, for all his faults, has made great contributions to culture. And for that,

2419
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:14,920
I just have to be like, who do you think you are? Am I being a simp? I feel like maybe I'm simping

2420
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:20,040
a little but I kind of feel like who do you Sarah Zed think you are to clown on Andrew Hussy?

2421
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:25,000
What have you ever done? You got a spurious lawsuit? Great. Congratulations.

2422
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:31,320
Yeah, I feel like a lot of the reason people are like all backing Sarah is is because

2423
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:37,160
like Hive Swap has been handled terribly. There's been various controversies and they're just like,

2424
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:43,640
you know, everything they they have against what pumpkin and the way Homestucko and Hive Swap

2425
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:47,960
and all of that has been handled. They're just like, yeah, now this is a person we can ascribe

2426
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:57,560
all of this like to like we're mad about this. Even aside from this whole thing and the whole

2427
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:04,920
Sarah Zed situation, I feel like Homestuck has been kind of like a low hanging fruit easy target

2428
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:09,800
for people to shit on for a while now. And I feel like this is just kind of another,

2429
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:15,400
this is just kind of she's she plucked, she did it. She plucked the low hanging fruit

2430
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:20,840
and made it and she she she went into the medium. And you know what good and you know what good

2431
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,000
for her God bless her I can't begrudge her for it but the lands of likes and subscribes.

2432
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:31,800
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'm so that's what I have to say about this image.

2433
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:43,880
Thanks for the voicemail. Next next one is called get and large prime numbers three two one go.

2434
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:50,200
Then use get for source control on your game project. We'll keep a history of all your code

2435
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:55,240
and asset changes. So if your PC dies or catastrophically fuck something, you can go back a day

2436
02:20:55,240 --> 02:21:01,800
or two. I use GitHub. There's also Git labs and a bunch of other ones. All you got to do is download

2437
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:07,480
an app like SourceTree or GitHub desktop, make a repository on the website, you clone it from the

2438
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:13,320
app, you move your project into it, you push it, and then each day you commit your work.

2439
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:19,880
Also, one of Tim Rogers' band was called large prime numbers and they put out some bangers.

2440
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:25,720
You can find songs on YouTube and Bandcamp song right now playing. It's called for those about

2441
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:32,520
to go. I don't think. Also, also, I don't think musical voicemail sound the same and suck for it.

2442
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:43,960
I don't think you know what a game maker file looks like. I don't think I can just copy paste a

2443
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:52,040
I can't. No, I don't think I don't think I can just paste my game maker file into GitHub.

2444
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:59,960
Have you ever made a game make? Have you ever made it use if you were done a game and game maker

2445
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:09,400
with GML? No, but is there a folder that it's in? Well, I mean, yeah, there's the folder. Well,

2446
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:16,840
I guess, but if I was so that if you have like if you make an update and you it's all logged there

2447
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:22,200
and it's like because I've used GitHub a little bit and basically it's like I use GitHub for endless

2448
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:28,600
war. Yeah, it's like a save state for the contents of a folder. It doesn't have to be anything specific.

2449
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:37,400
Hmm. Hmm. You know, you have you have the folder that your game maker stuff is inside.

2450
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:44,280
You save it on GitHub and then you accidentally destroyed everything and you delete it out of

2451
02:22:44,280 --> 02:22:50,200
the recycle bin. You just roll back to GitHub and then that folder which is synced up to Git will

2452
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:57,800
literally become the same as it was. So how is that? How is that any different from just like

2453
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:02,680
saving backup versions of the file and like Google Drive or something?

2454
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:12,440
I guess it's no different. It's just a somewhat simple. I guess if you know if you know how to

2455
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:17,000
do it, it's somewhat simple. If you don't, it's hard to learn. I got taught taught by my brother

2456
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:25,240
who is a code master. When I would use GitHub, I would like go into the text files in the Git

2457
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:30,680
folder and like directly edit the text. It wasn't I didn't use like syncing with my computers.

2458
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:35,720
Well, honestly, when you say it like that and it's like, oh, Git will just like directly copy

2459
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:40,280
the contents of a folder and create backup like, okay, actually, that does sound really convenient

2460
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:47,960
if I knew how to do it. So maybe I should look into it actually. I do have some I have some backup

2461
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:52,760
save but they're on my computer. So I honestly should be saving backup versions like to some

2462
02:23:52,760 --> 02:24:02,200
place secure in the in the cloud or something. That much is true. Okay, I have to I have to

2463
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:09,240
take a shit. I want to finish this. Next one is called clearing up terms three, two, one, go.

2464
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:43,160
Um, that doesn't but the if the communist is doing it from inside parliamentary politics,

2465
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:48,520
isn't there still a state then? Are they still engaging in statecraft?

2466
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:58,200
I don't know. The distinction between like, government and state is a little it's a little

2467
02:24:59,480 --> 02:25:04,440
academic and I get a little tripped up there about where exactly one ends and the other begins.

2468
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:12,040
But okay, I yeah, that's a reasonable distinction between communists and anarchists that makes

2469
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:19,000
that makes sense. Okay, next voicemail is a glimpse into the future best guys forever three, two, one, go.

2470
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:28,120
The year is 20 xx. At one point, Nate Bestman was a staunch capitalist ready to pull himself up

2471
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:35,160
by his bootstraps. Things have changed. In the early 21st century, a certain league came together

2472
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:41,400
to capitalize on these succulent ass in a multitude of ways. One way it was in cloning

2473
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:48,200
and enslaving them. Virginia once again found use in slave labor as millions of Nates were created.

2474
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:55,800
He could be found in every home, every business, hard at work. A month following Ben's ascension

2475
02:25:55,800 --> 02:26:01,560
to Godhood and bestowed gifts, Ben appeared to one of the millions of Nates and said unto him,

2476
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:09,160
Gurren Lagen, more like gay in Lagen, the Nate was dumbfounded, but slowly a smile crept across

2477
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:16,360
his face. He knew what he had to do. In covert, this Nate created a network of other Nates,

2478
02:26:16,360 --> 02:26:22,360
and soon the preparations were made abolition and the Nate Wars began. The wars were bloody.

2479
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:28,120
Millions died on both sides. But in the end, the Nates were victorious. Oh, shit. Two migrations

2480
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:34,600
followed the war. The surviving Nate fuckers fled their concubines in tow. But to Virginia,

2481
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:40,600
came all the Nate heads, eager to help rebuild. Virginia from then forth would be known as Best

2482
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:46,280
Virginia. This is a future before you. Even now, the hands of feet move ever closer to this

2483
02:26:46,280 --> 02:26:53,880
eventuality. This thoroughly based future. So I'm a little confused. So it sounds like the

2484
02:26:53,880 --> 02:27:01,080
Nate fuckers control the Nates and the Nates are allied with the Nate fuckers. But the Nate heads

2485
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:07,960
are against the Nate fuckers and therefore also against the Nates? No, no, no. I think that the

2486
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:17,240
Nate heads are there to liberate the Nates from the Nate fuckers. Yeah. Okay. They are slaves,

2487
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:26,120
as I said. I see. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I guess that makes sense. Dark. Timeline is dark.

2488
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:34,040
Curse time one. MLN, everybody. Multi-level marketing. No, NLN, Nate lives matter.

2489
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:40,360
Yes. Yeah. No, Nate would never say that. It's too political.

2490
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:52,600
Next voicemail is called Clearing Up Terms Two, plus Minor Cycloneal Spoilers Two. Three, two, one, go.

2491
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:57,960
If not participating in electoral politics sounds absurd, it is because anarchists believe in

2492
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:02,360
something called the theory of means and ends. This theory details how when people are put into

2493
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:07,000
the chain of politics their goals and motives change. For instance, a full-fledged communist

2494
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:11,400
can run for office, and if they win they might, instead of removing power from the state, secure

2495
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:16,280
more power for themselves. As they see themselves as the arbiter of socialism, so removing that

2496
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:20,600
power would be contrary to the goal. You can see this happen with Lenin and particularly Stalin in

2497
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:25,320
their actions as heads of the USSR. There's an anarchist quote that goes socialist leaders who

2498
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:29,400
find themselves caught up in the electoral machine, end up being gradually nothing more than bourgeois

2499
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:33,800
with liberal ideas. They have placed themselves in determinate conditions that in turn determine

2500
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:37,960
them. To an anarchist going into government to change it from the inside is as ridiculous as

2501
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:42,200
going into the police force to change it from the inside. The system will break you before you

2502
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:47,160
break the system. The praxis we use must be congruent with socialism. Through joining and

2503
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:51,240
participating in anarchist groups members learn how to engage with ideas like direct democracy

2504
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:56,200
and non-hierarchical organized groups. A hierarchy-led revolution is inherently susceptible to the

2505
02:28:56,200 --> 02:29:00,440
same corruption as any hierarchical system and is contrary to the goal of a non-hierarchical world.

2506
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:05,880
Anyways, this is the message of Psycholonials. Zed tried to create socialism through authoritarianism

2507
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:19,640
I don't know if that's the message of Psycholonial. I don't know. I think you're giving a little too

2508
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:27,560
much credit. I think it's an idea in Psycholonials rather than the message. Me and Cheesy talked

2509
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:32,520
about this a couple weeks ago, how we don't think that was like really, that theme was really

2510
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:49,480
followed through on... I mean, her like political, honestly, throughout Psycholonials,

2511
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:57,400
Zed's like political goals are basically just, she kind of says she's like it's a left-wing

2512
02:29:57,400 --> 02:30:03,800
revolution, but all she really does is just maintain power and not get destroyed by the

2513
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:10,360
United States military. That's all she actually does. It's a little bit toothless as far as

2514
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:19,160
like a political commentary. I can't remember exactly, but she inspires mostly violent takeovers

2515
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:28,120
of police buildings and government things by clowns. More so than instilling, because yeah,

2516
02:30:28,120 --> 02:30:32,600
I think I talked about this before, that the her manifesto doesn't really go into much

2517
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:39,000
specific like policy stuff. The only, yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, it talks about gender stuff

2518
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:47,320
and that it makes it a big funny clown joke, which is cool. Yeah,

2519
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:57,720
but I mean, I like this was, I mean, the thing about the system changes you and you get inside,

2520
02:30:57,720 --> 02:31:01,880
you become bourgeois with liberal ideas, that sounds, that seems true to life,

2521
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:08,600
that lines up with my experience of reality. Anyway, good voicemail, thank you.

2522
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:12,600
Next one is called Anamorphing Time. Three, two, one, go.

2523
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:19,080
Ben, did you invite Tyler back to be on the PCP? You fucked back?

2524
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,320
No.

2525
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:23,080
What do you want to come?

2526
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:28,760
I guess like, I guess I could have. I guess I could have, but I didn't.

2527
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:37,000
If he wants, if he wanted to be on the podcast, he could be on the podcast if he wants to, honestly.

2528
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:45,080
I'll fucking do, I'll, I'm down for anything. Next voicemail is called Anamorphing Time two,

2529
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:50,360
three, two, one, go. Ben, did you get drunk on the Anamorphing Time podcast too?

2530
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:54,360
I bought special booze because I'm going to be on it.

2531
02:31:56,280 --> 02:32:05,000
Based. Who is this? No, they told me that the episode before the one that I was on,

2532
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,920
which I don't think that one is out yet. It's not one that's out yet, but they told me the one

2533
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:15,160
before I'm on, they got really drunk and it ran really long. They weren't drinking on the episode

2534
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:20,520
I was on. I wasn't either. And our episode ran short. It's like less than two hours because

2535
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:27,720
our book is really bad and there's like nothing to say about it. So no, we didn't get drunk, I'm

2536
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:33,800
sorry. And I blew my shot too because they only, they said they only have one, they said they're

2537
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:37,720
only going to have one guest per episode or they're only going to have guests come one time.

2538
02:32:37,720 --> 02:32:41,960
They've had like one repeat guest, but I think they said they were going to do like one person,

2539
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:51,400
one appearance from now on. So I'm out. I'm out forever. Next voicemail is called The Vavitch,

2540
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:58,120
three, two, one, go. Ben, you mentioned you'd seen The Witch. Yep. What do you think about it?

2541
02:32:58,200 --> 02:33:06,280
That was pretty good. Bye. Okay. Next voicemail. It was good. It was

2542
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:20,040
a tense, it was thrilling as a thriller should be. I liked it. It made me feel dread and anticipation

2543
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:31,960
and the part where the spoilers, the part where the boy dies at the beginning and he cries out

2544
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:38,440
to God and he's all happy and he's smiling creepily and he's saying all this weird

2545
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:47,960
God shit, he's like, what does he say? Jesus, invite me to thy lap, let me lay in thy lap,

2546
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:52,840
oh Christ my lord. And he's like ecstasy and then his eyes roll back and he dies.

2547
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:57,720
And then his mom starts like screaming and his mom's like, oh, the devil speaks scripture too,

2548
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:02,680
the devil speaks scripture too, our son is in hell, our boy is in hell. That part was really

2549
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:06,120
disturbing and stuck with, not in like a horror movie way, just in like a,

2550
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:14,440
I guess no that is, it's just in a, it's not, it wasn't scary, but it's like a situation that

2551
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:21,720
was very distressing and it was memorable because I'm like, boy, what a horrible scene,

2552
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:27,960
that one's gonna stick with me and it did. And I thought the ending was kind of cool.

2553
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:32,680
The ending's kind of just unironically cool. Have you seen it, Gib?

2554
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:43,480
Nope. It's scary probably. It's not that scary. It's, I don't think there's any jump scares.

2555
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:55,480
It's, yeah, it's not, no, no, there's one, when the witch is like in the cabin with them,

2556
02:34:55,480 --> 02:35:06,120
drinking the goat's milk, that one's kind of spooky. The ending is just, the ending's kind of like

2557
02:35:06,200 --> 02:35:15,320
badass. So it's good. I kind of like, I kind of like that it ended on a, on like a note like that,

2558
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:19,000
like that sort of left me with like a good feeling about it. Instead of like,

2559
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:31,400
what is it, not hereditary, Midsommar ends in a, in a really horrible way. It's like

2560
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:39,080
the downfall, everything bad that could have happened has happened, the ruination is utter,

2561
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:44,680
the downfall is complete. And it's like, that's a well-made movie, but it left me with a very like,

2562
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:48,600
you know, it left me with a very negative feeling, as I think it was supposed to,

2563
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:52,920
because the events of the movie are very negative. Whereas the the witch, it's like,

2564
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:58,360
all this bad things happen and it's kind of horrible. But in the end, the main character

2565
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:03,880
kind of gets the, she kind of wins in the end, and it's kind of awesome. And that left me sort of

2566
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:14,360
like, that was kind of cool, actually. Yeah, that's it. That's what I have to say. Next voicemail

2567
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:19,560
is called PCP Bad Comments Award Show 268. Three, two, one, go.

2568
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:27,000
You unlock this door with the key of procrastination, beyond it is another dimension,

2569
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:32,280
a dimension of entitlement, a dimension of arrogance, a dimension of lip tarts.

2570
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:38,760
You're moving into a land of both the social and parasocial of memes and dreams. I love this.

2571
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:47,240
You've just crossed over into the PCP Bad Comments Award Show. Here is a person named Just Lexi.

2572
02:36:47,240 --> 02:36:53,160
Lexi is listening to the Procrastinators podcast. In the episode, somebody makes fun of Trixie,

2573
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:59,240
and Lexi has an amusing thought. In fact, it is perhaps the funniest thing Lexi has ever thought

2574
02:36:59,240 --> 02:37:04,840
of. Oh no. Such an incredible joke that Lexi must share it with everyone else. Let's see. They type

2575
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:14,360
out their comment and hit send. It reads, Trixie identifies as society. And that is the worst

2576
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:22,680
comment on episode 268. So the next time while listening to the PCP, if you have some stunning

2577
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:30,600
observation, some humorous remark, some biting criticism, think before you post, or you might

2578
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:42,280
find yourself on the PCP Bad Comments Award Show. I gotta admit, I gotta say, I don't know what that

2579
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:52,200
comment means. No. It's sort of an attack helicopter joke, but like, it's not really even that.

2580
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:59,480
It's, yeah, it's a bad comment, not because it's like insulting, or because it's like

2581
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:08,600
annoying, but just because it's confusing and it's definitely trying to do something,

2582
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:13,320
but I don't know what it was trying to say, so it definitely failed at its intentions there. So I

2583
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:24,520
would say, yeah, pretty solid choice for the zone. Another banger of an episode of the PCP

2584
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:31,320
Bad Comments Award Show. Thank you. Thank you for the voicemail. Next one is called Majora's Mask.

2585
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:37,240
Three, two, one, go. If you played Ocarina of Time and you want to play Majora's Mask, but the assets

2586
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:42,520
look too similar, just play Majora's Mask 3D instead, because those are different assets.

2587
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:49,640
And if you played Ocarina of Time 3D, then play original Majora's Mask. There, problem solved.

2588
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:56,040
It's not, it's not that I was like, the assets look too similar, and that puts me off. It's that

2589
02:38:56,040 --> 02:39:02,840
instinctually, I sort of had the feeling that it was like the same game, just because it looks the

2590
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:09,720
same, even though I know it's not. You know, I watched the, I've seen two videos, one of them

2591
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:15,800
saying that the Majora's Mask remake is a bad remake. And I had that thought, I think you must

2592
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:21,960
have seen it, the thumbnail with like the big lips from George Lucas. Narrow, the narrow video.

2593
02:39:21,960 --> 02:39:27,080
Yeah, something, I remember seeing that and being like, okay, I guess I shouldn't play the remake.

2594
02:39:27,160 --> 02:39:36,200
But I also watched the AVGN episode about playing Majora's Mask. And he found, because, you know,

2595
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:41,880
AVGN, he screams at all the really frustrating bits. Nobody talks about the things that suck.

2596
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:46,760
And I'm like, God, I don't want to play that. It looks really annoying. And I'm sure that's like a

2597
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:54,040
misrepresentation of the game. But still, I don't like old games when they, they be annoying.

2598
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:59,080
Yo, Gib, I got a great attention to the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter,

2599
02:39:59,640 --> 02:40:08,920
where you are at 91 backers, and you are five pounds away from Redman. This happened just

2600
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:18,360
within the last hour or two. Holy shit, 2,995 pounds. Hell yeah. We're so close. It's happening,

2601
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:25,240
it's happening, base. I think as soon as it ticks over, I'm going to get around to,

2602
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:33,000
I'm going to start like making the PDF of that so that I can figure out exactly how the layout is

2603
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:38,920
going to be. I don't think there's going to be a contents page. There's a lot of Redman comics.

2604
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:45,960
You should get on writing the ghost stories because you're almost halfway through the

2605
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:50,680
campaign. And the day is coming soon. You should, you should try and get those out to the guest

2606
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:56,840
artists like before the campaign ends. I've got two more to write. I've sent you yours. I don't

2607
02:40:56,840 --> 02:41:00,920
know whether you noticed. Oh God, that's right. I did notice, but I told myself like, okay, I'll

2608
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:04,600
look at this later. Yeah, I didn't actually, I didn't read through it. So hopefully that has

2609
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:09,800
all the information you need. I sent Kazi, her one. I got another one ready. And then two more to

2610
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:15,960
write. I should, yeah, I should do that first. I should do that soon as possible. Yeah. Yeah. I

2611
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:21,960
mean, it's all, it's all work that's got to get done. I just wanted to draw your attention to that.

2612
02:41:21,960 --> 02:41:29,400
Next voicemail is called shoplifting strats. Three, two, one, go. All right. I got some shoplifting

2613
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:35,080
strats for you all. You go to this channel. It's called gas station encounters. It is just this guy

2614
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:41,160
who thinks he's really cool, catching people shoplifting from his gas station. So watch these

2615
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:46,440
videos and you do opposition research. This is what not to do because they all get caught.

2616
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:52,920
And then a big man gets really angry at them. So I hope he at least works at the fucking gas

2617
02:41:52,920 --> 02:42:01,800
station to be better, I guess. I don't know. Yeah. Know thy enemy. Next voicemail is called

2618
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:08,200
question three, two, one, go. Do you guys prefer people asking questions

2619
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:14,920
in the voicemails? Are you guys like it better whenever people kind of use it as a way to leave

2620
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:23,240
comment or tell a story? Sorry, if you don't like people even questions, because that was

2621
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:28,760
indeed a question. I guess I would say generally questions because it's then it's easy for us

2622
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:36,440
to know how to respond to it. I suppose. I mean, most things end up being questions

2623
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:43,160
in some way. Even if there's no question mark, it sort of prompts a discussion on a topic.

2624
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:48,600
Just depends on how good the topic is. Some questions are stupid and we skip past them

2625
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:54,760
immediately. Absolutely. Next voicemail is called comment three, two, one, go.

2626
02:42:55,080 --> 02:43:01,720
Also, some of the voicemails you guys get are weird and I don't go by the voicemails.

2627
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:09,800
They seem more like they should be like Twitter DMs or emails. Like that person who was saying,

2628
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:15,560
oh, can you guys check the subreddit? Like, do message them on Twitter? Or you know them?

2629
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:21,560
Yeah. I'll leave a voicemail that you won't hear back from for like a week and a half.

2630
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:29,000
You're right. You're not wrong. I understand the appeal of leaving a voicemail, but yeah,

2631
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,080
I would say if you just want to like ask us something that you just want like some info about,

2632
02:43:35,880 --> 02:43:38,920
yeah, DMing on Twitter is probably an easier way to do it.

2633
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:44,680
Yeah, Twitter. I don't get a lot of messages, so it's like guaranteed you'll be able to get

2634
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:51,560
through to me. I'll see it. If you DM me on Twitter or Discord, I respond to almost every

2635
02:43:51,560 --> 02:43:57,240
message I get. Sometimes I miss one, but usually I'm pretty good about them. Next voicemail is called

2636
02:43:57,240 --> 02:44:02,520
Ben, Communists Want the Government to Do Stuff Saint, three, two, one, go.

2637
02:44:14,840 --> 02:44:18,040
A society in which workers own the means of production, thus abolishing social classes,

2638
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:21,880
and a society which abandoned the commodity form. Anarchism, a political ideology which seeks to

2639
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:25,400
establish an unhierarchical society in form of government. Anarchist or libertarian communism

2640
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:28,200
could, for example, be achieved by seeking democratization of the workplace and subsequent

2641
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:31,160
reduction or complete abolishment of the profit motive, abolishment of the state in favor of

2642
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:34,040
democratic non-hierarchical modes of government, victory against all forms of bigotry and

2643
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:37,480
decommodification of essential, most are all products produced in said society. Depending

2644
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:40,760
on who you're talking to, markets can still play a role in such a society, albeit in highly

2645
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:47,720
regulated forms. Alright, thanks for the Wikipedia article, buddy. Next voicemail is called Me Taking

2646
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:54,840
a Shit Week One, three, two, one, go. God, I wish this were me. I still need to take one. Gross.

2647
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:05,160
Oh, god. Oh, I'm not listening to that. This can't be real. This isn't real.

2648
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:15,320
It's like I'm there. I can smell it.

2649
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:19,240
I've stopped listening.

2650
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:30,120
This reminds me of that scene in King of the Hill when Bobby is listening to a CD of Fart

2651
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:38,440
Sounds and Hank takes any listens to it and he goes, oh, it says, Bobby, this isn't funny.

2652
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:49,400
What that man has is a serious medical condition. That was explosive. You should see a doctor.

2653
02:45:50,680 --> 02:45:57,000
I don't think it's fake. I feel like it's easier to just put a phone near the toilet while you're

2654
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:04,360
shitting. Maybe. I mean, maybe he just could tell that a bout of particularly explosive diarrhea

2655
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:09,560
was coming and he was like, this is the one. I've been waiting for my opportunity.

2656
02:46:09,560 --> 02:46:13,640
I feel like this is sort of like you would need like a sensor bleeps on it.

2657
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:18,840
You know, it's just like, gross. Nobody will need to listen to that.

2658
02:46:19,720 --> 02:46:27,080
I should be censored. I don't know. We didn't censor the guy peeing, but we've never censored

2659
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:32,520
people peeing. In fact, it's a tradition. Peeing is like it doesn't sound grotesque,

2660
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:36,760
and also peeing isn't as bad as shitting in terms of like hygiene.

2661
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:44,920
Well, it's too late now. It's too late now. It made it in and there's nothing we can do.

2662
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:50,840
Comments complain to Ben saying for not choosing to censor that.

2663
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:54,760
There's simply no way that we could censor it. We would have to, I mean,

2664
02:46:55,560 --> 02:47:01,160
you know, every part connects to every other part of the pocket. We can't just cut one part.

2665
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:05,640
It'll affect the pacing of the whole thing. We'll have to rewrite and restructure the whole

2666
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:10,360
thing from the bottom up. It's impossible. We can't do it. This is like my impression of George

2667
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:18,200
Lucas about the first prequel, by the way. Okay, next voicemail. This is the last voicemail.

2668
02:47:18,200 --> 02:47:25,800
It's called Happy Fourth of Gaeli. Three, two, one, go. Ben, were you bullied much in school? Because

2669
02:47:27,400 --> 02:47:37,160
you should be. No, not really. I thought of myself as a nerd, but

2670
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:49,320
I mean, there were some, there were kind of jocks, I guess. There were like kids who were kind of

2671
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:54,760
like badasses. There were kids who like, you know, liked rugged stuff, like ATVs and whatever,

2672
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:59,720
and motorcycles. There was that kind of thing. And there were kids that played sports. I got

2673
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:05,720
sometimes one or two kids. Sometimes I would get teased by someone or other, but like, I wasn't like

2674
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:12,200
anyone's target or anything. I didn't have like a guy who regularly bullied me or anything. I was,

2675
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:19,080
it was no, no, I was pretty fine. I was pretty A-okay. I was so popular.

2676
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:28,280
Then you have really long hair. Got laid so often. Yeah, I could have, yeah, I had really long,

2677
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:33,400
in high school, I had like hair down to my waist. Like, I was pretty weird and I probably should

2678
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:39,720
have been bullied. I definitely was asking for it. Yeah, I had hair, I had fucking really,

2679
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:45,720
really long hair. Did you wear a trench coat? Were you like the whole package? I didn't wear

2680
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:51,640
like a black, like fucking, you know, school shooter trench coat, but I did, I did wear weird

2681
02:48:51,640 --> 02:48:57,640
coats a lot. I had a leather, I had like a red leather coat that was very, made a very squeaky

2682
02:48:57,720 --> 02:49:03,160
leather that I would wear sometimes. I loved that thing. It was so heavy. And then in senior

2683
02:49:03,160 --> 02:49:08,200
year of high school, I cut my long hair and I wore a suit to school every day.

2684
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:16,600
What? Yeah, I don't know why I did that, but I did. I had a bunch of suits and I would wear

2685
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:23,400
a different suit and tie every day. Did people say anything about that? Surely no one else was doing

2686
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:29,560
that. No, nobody was doing that. Yeah, it was just my quirky thing. It's your new quirk. That was

2687
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:36,200
my, it's pretty bizarre in hindsight knowing what I'm like, but yeah, believe it or not,

2688
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:41,560
through most of senior year in high school, I wore like a suit, like a suit and tie and a button

2689
02:49:41,560 --> 02:49:47,240
down shirt and dress shoes and a belt and all the cuff links. I'm imagining like the way you look

2690
02:49:47,240 --> 02:49:53,160
is like super pristine, like a perfect vision of like the stereotypical American man on his

2691
02:49:53,160 --> 02:50:00,600
way to work. And then like fast forward, like, oh, what went wrong? It's been St. Now with the

2692
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:11,080
peanut shells all over the place. I won best dressed in my high school yearbook. Even though I

2693
02:50:11,080 --> 02:50:17,320
wasn't really even a good dresser, like other kids dressed better than me, I just, because I

2694
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:22,120
like made a thing out of it, I made like a gimmick out of it. And so people knew like, oh.

2695
02:50:22,200 --> 02:50:23,560
Is that guy wears the suit?

2696
02:50:23,560 --> 02:50:25,800
It probably should be that guy who wears a suit every day.

2697
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:32,520
If I can report of the weak ass Ben St.

2698
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:40,200
Fucking young Republican ass. Yeah, Ben St. in high school, Ben St. Cringe. That's your daily,

2699
02:50:40,200 --> 02:50:44,760
but and yet, and yet, no, I wasn't bullied that hard. No, people just thought it was funny.

2700
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:49,720
I got away with too much. They were too easy on me.

2701
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:58,520
Shit, that's the last voicemail. Thank God. That's it. That's it. Do we have any more

2702
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:05,560
bullshit to spew before we sign off? I'm just going to check that Lord goes again.

2703
02:51:06,360 --> 02:51:10,920
It would have been so Pog if it hit 3k, but not yet. That'd be pretty Pog.

2704
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:15,400
That'd be pretty Pog. I'm sure it will have hit 3k by the time this goes live. Yeah.

2705
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:20,680
2995. Oh, for me, it looks like 4139 dollars.

2706
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:27,880
But if I hover over the little dollar next to it, it shows the conversion so I can see.

2707
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:33,640
Pledge to the Lord of Ghost Kickstarter. Everyone, link in the description.

2708
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:38,360
Share it around. Share it on Facebook. Share it on TikTok. Share it on Discord. Share it on

2709
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:46,840
Getter. Share it on Getter. Go at the president, 45th president of the United States, Donald J.

2710
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:51,720
Trump on Getter and have him retweet the Lord of Ghost comic, please. Thank you.

2711
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:55,080
The hell is Getter? Getter done?

2712
02:51:56,040 --> 02:52:01,240
I'm pretty sure it's a new Twitter alternative that is literally created just so that Donald

2713
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:15,080
Trump can use it. I've been seeing some funny leftoids that I follow have been opening Getter

2714
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:22,920
accounts under the names of people they hate, like Eve Barlow and who was the other one.

2715
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:31,560
Spurt Magoo has been opening a bunch of funny tweets from that guy from that

2716
02:52:33,400 --> 02:52:38,360
band that quit because he got harassed because he supported it. It wasn't co-eating Cambria, no.

2717
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:45,480
It was another name, a band with an and in it and the guy was like pro Andy No and everyone

2718
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:56,120
hated him for it and so we quit the band. Band. Quit. Andy. No. Mumford and Sons. The guy from

2719
02:52:56,120 --> 02:53:04,200
Mumford and Sons. Winston Marshall from Mumford and Sons. Oh, he's 33. He's the same age as me.

2720
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:12,600
Oh, wow. Yeah. Guess he's the son. He sucks. Fuck that guy. Mumford and Sons was all over the place

2721
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:18,120
for like a year. They were like, oh, they're so big. And I was like, it's sort of all right.

2722
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:22,440
I'm sure I've heard it from them again. I'm sure I've heard it, but I couldn't I couldn't name you

2723
02:53:22,440 --> 02:53:32,280
a Mumford and Sons song. No, they're just sort of like quirky to be acoustic core,

2724
02:53:33,240 --> 02:53:41,800
like foot stomping, folky sort of songs. I want to be the lead singer of a folk band.

2725
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:47,320
I really want to do that, but I don't want to actually make any music because I'm not good at

2726
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:53,000
it. I just want to sing. I just want to be a singer. If anyone wants to start a folk band and just

2727
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:59,960
let me be lead singer and not make me do anything else for it, then hit me up, please. Someone else

2728
02:53:59,960 --> 02:54:09,480
writes the lyrics. The lyrics are I stinky. My diaper. No, you have to sing it. I signed a contract.

2729
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:19,080
I signed a conservatorship. I have to do it. My life is not my own anymore. Fuck. Yeah, I'll do it.

2730
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:24,440
Fuck it. Yeah, I'll go up on stage and just sing and just croon out a song about how I pooped in my

2731
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:31,800
pants. The ladies will appreciate the confidence. It's not like a blue song. It's like I pooped

2732
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:40,120
in my pants and I stank so bad. It made me cry. It stank so bad that my dog died.

2733
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:44,040
Yeah, so it's a perfect blue song concept.

2734
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:51,320
Okay, well, that's all I got. That's all I got for today.

2735
02:54:51,880 --> 02:55:03,800
Okay, I guess that's it. Patreon.com slash the procrastinators to get bonus episodes,

2736
02:55:03,800 --> 02:55:09,080
many, many bonus episodes, and you can get on the Minecraft. You can get on the Minecraft,

2737
02:55:09,080 --> 02:55:13,400
you can come in and see my cool wizards tower. It's a work in progress, but it looks really cool.

2738
02:55:13,400 --> 02:55:20,360
I really like it. I have a lot of fun building. Okay, that's it. Thank you and good night.

2739
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:24,520
Good night.
