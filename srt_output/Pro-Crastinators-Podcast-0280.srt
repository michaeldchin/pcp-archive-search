1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Good morning! Merry Christmas! Ben here, and before the episode starts, I wanted to make a quick announcement.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,500
So recently, I have been shipping out and getting ready to ship the Road to Radcon books out to backers.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,400
But I had extra copies, so I decided to offer them to backers that did not pledge enough to earn them in the first place.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,900
And also then to patrons, and then also just to anyone.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:36,900
Anyone on Twitter offered them, and they were very popular, very well received, and I was afraid I was going to run out.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,900
I wasn't going to have enough to meet demand, and guess what? I did. I sold out.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,900
But I hated the thought of telling someone, oh no, you can't have one. No, we got rid of them all.

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:56,900
So I'm printing more. I'm printing more copies. I'm going to have, I'm going to print a second run, a limited second run of Road to Radcon books.

9
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:03,400
Picture on screen if you haven't seen what they look like. Art by Michi Fostered, as you can see. A masterpiece.

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:13,900
The cover art, mwah. Delicious. This collector's item. I am going to make a few more copies, maybe 20 more, 50 more.

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,400
I don't know, however many I need to. So if you would like to get your hands on one, they are more available now.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:30,400
They are up for anyone to grab, but if you are, if you back the Kickstarter, the Road to Radcon Kickstarter, or you are a patron, you get $5 off.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,400
The price is $20 plus shipping, but if you are a patron, or Kickstarter backer, but if you patron the PCP, you can get it for $15.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:50,400
So think about it for a minute. Do the math in your head. You pledge to the Kickstarter, you pledge the Patreon for $5, you get $5 off the book.

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,400
You get your base, that's patron is basically for free. You get access to the bonus episodes. You know, you get all the patron benefits and the pays for itself.

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,900
Because you are going to buy the book anyway. Because look at it, of course you are going to buy it anyway. You need it. You can't resist.

17
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:15,400
So anyway, info on the screen, DM the PCP Twitter, DM me on Twitter, DM me on Discord, and just ask, hey, you got any books left?

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,400
And I'll say yes, and then I'll say, here's how you buy one, and you go, OK, send you the money, and that's how it's going to go.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I will see you in the DMs, sliding into my DMs. OK, on with the show.

20
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,900
Gib, you said you need to be out by six?

21
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
Six, yes.

22
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,900
OK, so unfortunately, we're going to have to keep this one under two hours and 40 minutes. I know. I know.

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,900
So sad.

24
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,900
Just start the voicemails immediately, I guess.

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,900
The people will riot. The people will riot.

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
Oh, no, I'm looking at the voicemails.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
Oh, no.

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Well, not that many. We got a normal amount.

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
It's like 50, like 70.

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
But that's too many.

31
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:11,400
We could just talk, and then if we have to cut some voicemails, we could just cut some voicemails.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
End of the episode, sorry.

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
True.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Have we started? Is this the beginning?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this episode of the Procrastinators podcast.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,900
You're going to open us complaining about the voicemails, and that's relatable, because I'm sure as you, the viewer, are opening up this episode of the Procrastinators podcast.

37
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,900
You are thinking, God, I'm not looking forward to 40 fucking voicemails.

38
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Well, we're right there with you, friends.

39
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
We're going to stop together.

40
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,900
You can skip through the voicemails. We have to live through them every single time.

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Yeah, we don't have to.

42
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
You could say we remember it so you don't have to.

43
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
No.

44
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
I wouldn't say that.

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Hey, so I want to kick things off, because this is a big hot moment in video games.

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
What? Oh, he's talking about, oh, God, I know what you're going to talk about.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
It's about Delta Rune. Chapter 2 came out. Have either of you played it?

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
I have not.

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
No.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Damn it.

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
I downloaded Chapter 2.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I knew you were going to bring, I knew you were going to, and I knew it was going to come out.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Now we're going to click bait another bunch of people, like, oh, PCP talking about Delta Rune?

54
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,400
No, it's just Gibbs saying, oh, I played Delta Rune. It was really good. You should play it.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
We'll just have to revive the Buster Cast format for Delta Rune when we've all finished it.

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
You've all been tricked.

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Oh, God, fuck, we never did the thumbnail.

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Eleazar, make sure the thumbnail is nothing but Delta Rune.

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
No.

60
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Nothing but Delta Rune.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
We never did the Psycholomials cast.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Those poor Delta Ruiners, those Delta Variants.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Delta Ruin'd.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Those poor Delta Variants all waiting to hear about Susie.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,400
The episode's Delta Rune'd, and it's just Susie in a surgical mask.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, I'm Delta Rune-ing. I'm Delta Rune-ing right now.

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
That's what I said when I was playing it.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, yes.

69
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Did you make the face?

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, yeah.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a good one.

72
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
It's free, so that's nice.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Is it better than Chapter 1?

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
I would say...

75
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Well, obviously, I've only played Chapter 1 when it came out.

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
I haven't played it again.

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Kind of was waiting to...

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I was thinking of replaying Chapter 1 as well.

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
I don't think it's that necessary.

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
As long as you remember the gist.

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I don't, I don't really.

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I played it with Ben.

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
That's how it was.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Yeah, we replayed it all together at Trixie's place.

85
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Oh, yeah.

86
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
And that was the clip that you were streaming it,

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
and Munchie screamed sans when he saw him.

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah, we all screamed sans at the same time.

89
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
I totally forgot about that, but yeah, you're right.

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't think I ever played it on my own.

91
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Maybe I did.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
It's a good time.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You're Chris, you're like a tall frisk,

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
and you live in a place,

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
and then one day you go into a fucking dark portal

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
with this girl Susie.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
It's an Isekai.

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Kinda, yeah, and well, yeah, that is what that is.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
It's a video game.

100
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Undertale is also an Isekai.

101
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Wait, do you think about it?

102
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
All the best stories.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I mean, there's no...

104
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Whatever.

105
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm trying to think of how the world of Undertale

106
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,400
and the real world and the monster world

107
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
are they physically the same place?

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Because then it wouldn't be an Isekai.

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
It wouldn't be like going into a different universe.

110
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Just going into a hole.

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
By that logic, Alice in Wonderland isn't an Isekai

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
because she just falls down a hole.

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
No, she has a dream about it.

114
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
That's not a real hole.

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
That's not actually down there.

116
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I never read it.

117
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It's true.

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
You're in the same place.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
You're not going to another world.

120
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
What is the difference between...

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
That'd be like saying if you went to Japan,

122
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
that was an Isekai.

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Just because you're in a different culture doesn't mean you're in another world.

124
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Why not?

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Why couldn't the story of going to the Isekai?

126
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Ben's Isekai adventure in Japan.

127
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I can't wait for that vlog series to drop.

128
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Hey guys, I'm going to go Isekai down to the supermarket

129
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and buy some diet soda.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
You want anything long gone?

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Part of the role-playing as being in an Isekai

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
is getting to the store and being like,

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
where am I?

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
It's so amazing and so different.

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
If you go...

136
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
I think it's a bizarre to draw the line

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
that's like, okay, if you go through a portal

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
to another world, then it's an Isekai.

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
But if you just go down a hole and the world is underground,

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
that's not Isekai.

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Because it's another world, a literal other planet,

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
another plane of existence.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Another geometric plane

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
and it is lower on the Z axis.

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's a new plane.

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
It's just lower underground.

147
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
I get it.

148
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Metaphorically, story-wise, it feels like

149
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
it's a different world.

150
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
But you wouldn't say the same thing about climbing down

151
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
a hole in a medieval RPG

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
and those dwarves down there.

153
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
That's not an Isekai.

154
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
If you climbed a mountain...

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
The Mines of Moria is an Isekai.

156
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Why not?

157
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Give me one fucking good reason.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Because if you got a bunch of Minecraft TNT

159
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
and you blew it open,

160
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
the boundary would be...

161
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
It'll be open to the elements.

162
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
If you go somewhere

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
and you find a place

164
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
that is like a totally different place

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
that's different from the normal world that you live in,

166
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
and then you go back at the end.

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I guess you don't even have to go back at the end.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
That's the premise of an Isekai

169
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
is you go to a new world.

170
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
But the way you define world is like...

171
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
an island.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
You could go to the island.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I guess I don't know...

174
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Robbins and Caruso is an Isekai.

175
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Go to Baskin Robbins, get lost

176
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
and be like, I don't know where I am.

177
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
This is a new world. I gotta live here now.

178
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
What's the one of the sailor that goes to the land

179
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
with the tiny little people?

180
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
No...

181
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
He's the land of little people

182
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
and the land of giants.

183
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
He's a giant in the land of tiny little people.

184
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh, I know.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Gulliver's Island travels.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
This is an Isekai.

187
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Why not?

188
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I don't know what the Isekai means in Japanese.

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I would say...

190
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I would say...

191
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I would say that on like a...

192
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
on like a...

193
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
on say like a 3x3 grid

194
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
of Isekai...

195
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
You ever seen like the sandwich,

196
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
like purism versus like...

197
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
It's like structure purist

198
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
versus like ingredient purist.

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I would say on like an Isekai grid

200
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
like that, I'm like...

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm like radically like an Isekai

202
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
is in any...

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
can be anywhere. It doesn't have to be a literal different

204
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
like world and also...

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I would say I'm like the most like radical anarchists

206
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
on the Isekai grid.

207
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
World only has to be...

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Respectable. Relative to the protagonist's perspective

209
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
of life. Yeah.

210
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
It doesn't have to be a literal...

211
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The pure anarchist position is like

212
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
going to the bathroom as an Isekai.

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Another world really is subjective

214
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
It is. It totally is. Living from moment to moment

215
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
like when a cell of yours dies

216
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
you're a different person. The world is different

217
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
every second, every

218
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
every time a quark moves.

219
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Fucking...

220
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
The catcher in the rye

221
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
is an Isekai because he's gone to like

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
New York or whatever and he's never been there.

223
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Becoming a billionaire is Isekai or living

224
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
in a totally different world. Isekai has to

225
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
just base it on his body and now I don't know

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
what to do with my buildings. You don't even have to...

227
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You don't even have to literally travel.

228
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Right. And now I'm thinking like that

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Class is an Isekai. Normal

230
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
speech is like instead of going on a holiday

231
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
or a vacation, I'm going on an Isekai

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
to like Italy or something.

233
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Yeah. 50 Shades of Grey

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
is an Isekai. Not because she goes anywhere

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
but because she enters a new world of

236
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
dating a weirdo. And that's

237
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
kind of like going

238
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
to a new video game world or something.

239
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
New fantastic point of view. Yes.

240
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
True.

241
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Um...

242
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Deltarune. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

243
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Deltarune Chapter 1.

244
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
You go... You Isekai

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
into this place and there's a little goat

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
guy with a hat

247
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
and you have an adventure. And that's the

248
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Deltarune Chapter 1. Then you leave and it's like

249
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
what? Was that real? Are we ever going

250
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
to come back? And then Chapter 2. There is

251
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
like a cliffhanger ending, isn't there? I just remember

252
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
that. Yeah. Yeah. Deltarune Chapter 1

253
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
is ambiguous about whether it was just a dream

254
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
or whatever. Yeah.

255
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Chapter 2 answers a few

256
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
questions about how real it is,

257
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
but I don't think they're like concrete

258
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
answers. They're just sort of like

259
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
it's sort of like this. It's sort of like, I don't want to spoil

260
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
too much. Which is funny that

261
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
like... Yeah. You live in a world

262
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
of like goat people and monsters

263
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
and like skeletons are like you're just your

264
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
neighbors in the real world.

265
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
But then in the dream world

266
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
you go to a place with other different

267
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
monsters and skeletons. Different monsters that are made of

268
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
weird things that are slightly stranger.

269
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes.

270
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
These monsters go to school. These monsters

271
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
are the darkners and the lightners.

272
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Right. And I forgot about

273
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
that.

274
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Do they still have the banger

275
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
fucking battle theme?

276
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Because that was the best part. Oh, of course.

277
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
The root buster.

278
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
That's so good.

279
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
The combat scooter

280
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
there's...

281
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
What's different about

282
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
like the combat or is it

283
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I mean it's the same thing as

284
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Deltarune chapter one.

285
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
You've got the attacks and the

286
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
acts, the sparing of the monsters

287
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
by doing the right things. Is it better

288
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
than Undertale yet? Oh, of course.

289
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Really?

290
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Combat wise, it's better than Undertale.

291
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
There's more strategy

292
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
to winning a battle than just knowing which

293
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
thing to

294
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
to spare them with. I liked the combat

295
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
a lot more in Deltarune.

296
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I was reflecting on

297
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
can we just reflect on the fact that

298
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,400
the PCP literally started

299
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
with the first episode

300
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
is just saying...

301
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Undertale just came out

302
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
and it's the best game ever.

303
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
And this, the last episode

304
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
of the PCP is going to be talking about

305
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Deltarune is just Undertale but better.

306
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Deltarune is the new best game.

307
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah.

308
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Childhood is loving

309
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Undertale. Adulthood is realizing that

310
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Deltarune is the true best game ever.

311
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Combat wise,

312
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
there's more strategy to it

313
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
and it's tighter, movement wise.

314
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
The whole, if you remember

315
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
in Undertale, you just have to dodge

316
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
things as the little heart in the box

317
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
and that's neat.

318
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
But in this one, you have like

319
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
TP which is like

320
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I forget what it stands for but it's like

321
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
action points where you can use that to heal

322
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
or and stuff like that.

323
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
You get a little bit

324
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
of TP by edging

325
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
close to a projectile

326
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
but not getting hit by it

327
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
and you get like a little

328
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
sound.

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Like that fucking video game

330
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
with the anime girls.

331
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah, whatever.

332
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Toho, right?

333
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Toho games are like that. You move really close to the bullets

334
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
and that fills up your...

335
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Can you get extra? Yeah.

336
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I don't know Toho but

337
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
that is what you describe

338
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
and that makes

339
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
moving and dodging

340
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
a little reward thing rather than

341
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
just get out of the way

342
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
which is cool.

343
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
And then there's newer spells

344
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
and different things and more fun

345
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
little gimmicks that they use in battles

346
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
and there's a lot of really funny moments

347
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
and I laughed out loud

348
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
multiple times.

349
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
I guess I should play it or whatever.

350
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
How long is it?

351
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
How much of a time commitment do I have to make?

352
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
It is not that long. I completed it

353
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
the day after it came out

354
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
because it came out like midnight. I was too tired.

355
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
It was like three to four

356
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
hours and I was

357
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
pretty thorough. I want

358
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
to play through it again and do like different

359
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
things that I did the first time.

360
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
But I got to the end where

361
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
credits like Chapter 2

362
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
and then it showed like a list of

363
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Deltarune chapters that you could pick.

364
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
You could choose to play Chapter 1 again

365
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
2 and then there's like 3, 4, 5, 6

366
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
and 7 which are not

367
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
clickable yet because they're not out.

368
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
So 7 chapters

369
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
apparently.

370
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
It's like a decade of work

371
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
at least that the radio is gone.

372
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Yeah, I don't know.

373
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I heard somewhere that he wanted

374
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
to release the entire rest of the game

375
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
in one go

376
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
but he didn't

377
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
and I guess

378
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
he's doing chapters. I guess I could make it more money this way.

379
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I don't know how he's making money right now.

380
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I think the next one is going to be like a bundle

381
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
of like chapters 3, 4, 5

382
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
and that's going to be the first

383
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
paid part of Deltarune.

384
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
And then like the last two chapters would be like paid DLC

385
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
or something maybe?

386
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Well, the paid for the rest of the chapters. Yeah, I guess.

387
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Yeah, I don't know.

388
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I don't mind.

389
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
How dare he charge for his game.

390
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Toby Fox is a billionaire. He should charge.

391
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
In fact, I want to pay a lot because it's really good

392
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
and I should.

393
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I would like to pay as much as possible.

394
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I would like to pay as much as possible.

395
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm going to hide into Toby Fox's life

396
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
so I can know what it's like to be successful.

397
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I'm going to Isakai myself

398
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
into the fucking poor house

399
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
by sending all my money to

400
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Toby Fox for his video game.

401
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I'm going to Isakai myself

402
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
into Detter's prison.

403
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Isakai myself into Detter's prison

404
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
to play Undertale

405
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
but I don't have a computer anymore

406
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
to play it on.

407
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
It's the light novel that starts like, oh, I got sent to jail

408
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
and it was really bad and nothing ever good happened.

409
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I sold my computer

410
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
to buy you a copy of Delta Rune Chapter 1.

411
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I sold my copy of Undertale

412
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
to buy you a computer

413
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
to play on.

414
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Oh, fuck.

415
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I guess jailed by our own definition now

416
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
is also in Isakai.

417
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
That's a different world.

418
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Absolutely.

419
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
And so is the grave.

420
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Orange is the new black because a great Isakai series.

421
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
The best western Isakai.

422
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
The grave. Death is the ultimate Isakai.

423
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
It's like Dumbledore said.

424
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
It's like Dumbledore said and the Deathly Hallows.

425
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
To the well-organized mind,

426
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
death is just the next great Isakai.

427
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I think I remember that one.

428
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
The greatest Isakai ever told.

429
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
That's the thumbnail.

430
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Eleazar, that's the thumbnail.

431
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Do it.

432
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Yes, please.

433
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, I'm having a fucking

434
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
ball over here.

435
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Ah,

436
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
blah, blah.

437
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
It was these really cute.

438
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Rousey's really cute. Chris is really cute.

439
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
And there's a lot of characters

440
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
who are really cute. I don't want to spoil too much

441
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
about who appears.

442
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
But yeah.

443
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Everyone who is excited about Deltarune

444
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
has already picked it up and played it.

445
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
But you guys,

446
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I expected better.

447
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I expected more gamer fuel

448
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
from you.

449
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Sorry. I was too busy

450
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
making a video game channel.

451
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I struggled.

452
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
I was too busy satisfying

453
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
our fucking satisfied customers

454
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
on road to Radcon

455
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
for

456
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
a Kickstarter

457
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
back rewards.

458
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I got a huge stack.

459
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I got stacks and stacks here of envelopes

460
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
that are addressed and ready to go out.

461
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I've been doing that.

462
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I've been handling all the orders.

463
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
They are soon

464
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
to be shipped. Soon to be shipped out into

465
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
the world.

466
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
You really don't realize how much of a logistical nightmare

467
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
mailing things is until you run a Kickstarter.

468
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
You're like, this fucking sucks.

469
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
It's taken me several days

470
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
just to...

471
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
It probably would have taken me two days

472
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
to address all the envelopes.

473
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
There's 126.

474
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
You think to yourself, oh,

475
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
addressing 126

476
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
envelopes, how long could that take?

477
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
An hour? No, there's always

478
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
a lot of this.

479
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
It's double checking.

480
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
I mess up the address.

481
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I gotta start again.

482
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Now I gotta arrange them

483
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
and organize them into

484
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
domestic versus international.

485
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Everything ends up taking longer

486
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
than you think it's going to.

487
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
It's just one of those things.

488
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
But it's fine. It's not that bad.

489
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
It's not as bad as when I had to do the

490
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
vapors or something because it's just the book.

491
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I don't have to organize them into categories.

492
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
This one gets this pin and this one gets that pin

493
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
and this one gets that extra bonus thing

494
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
and I gotta sign these ones and...

495
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
It's just book in envelopes.

496
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It could be a lot worse.

497
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Yeah.

498
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I've got almost...

499
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I think I've got

500
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
10 copies left and I want to mention that

501
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I will be...

502
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I offer them to the backers

503
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
the opportunity to buy

504
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
the extra copies and I think

505
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
most of those people have messaged me.

506
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I think there's about 10 left.

507
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Maybe by the time this episode comes out

508
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
I will have already tweeted about

509
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
anyone that wants the final copies

510
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
message me and let me know

511
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
and they can have them. They can buy them.

512
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Maybe they'll be gone by now

513
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
but I guess we'll see.

514
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
We'll find out.

515
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Yeah. I might run out.

516
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Might actually run out.

517
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
We're close. I'm pretty close.

518
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
But we'll see.

519
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah.

520
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
There's that sweet Radcon payday

521
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
just around the bend.

522
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Just around the bend? Well, after this...

523
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Well...

524
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I don't think I've mentioned it but the dojin

525
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
is being made. Have I mentioned this on the show?

526
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
I can't remember but

527
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
we must have talked about it sometime.

528
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I'll summarize again.

529
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
The PCP dating sim people

530
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
or three of them. It was Never Paint,

531
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Chip Wiseman and Ora Borista.

532
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I think it was the three.

533
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
The three of them who were from the PCP dating sim

534
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
they wrote the script for the dojin.

535
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
We promised the manga dojin

536
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
and the artist Edward D. Al

537
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,400
who is at Wolfheart

538
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
H-A-R-T on Twitter.

539
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
We got him to do it

540
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
and he has started drawing

541
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
the page. It's going to be a 24 page.

542
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
It's going to be a 24 page

543
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
digital release.

544
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
The manga dojin

545
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
and that was going to be done

546
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
in maybe a month or so

547
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
and I'm hoping

548
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
and when that is done

549
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
and the dojin is done

550
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,400
and after that all that will be left

551
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
will be the

552
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
the Garling House

553
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
music video

554
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
and the OVA

555
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
and that will be it.

556
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
The nightmare

557
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
will finally be out of this

558
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
horrible radcon 4 isekai

559
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
that we find ourselves trapped in.

560
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Radcon 4 really was an isekai.

561
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
It kind of was.

562
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
It was a hero's journey.

563
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
We all went to radcon 4

564
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
and then we returned

565
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
to the next two years.

566
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
We tried to return

567
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
to the regular world afterwards

568
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
but we couldn't. We found that we could never go home again.

569
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
The monkey's paw

570
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
of going to radcon

571
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
but having to throw the entire world into chaos

572
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
for the next 18 months.

573
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
We're the reason people are dying.

574
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Fortunately, fortunately

575
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
that is literally the plot

576
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
of the OVA.

577
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Fortunately, the plot of the OVA

578
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
turns on real world events

579
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
and we solve them.

580
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
We solve them in that

581
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
mad fucking video.

582
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Yes, yes we do.

583
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
It's coming.

584
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,400
And in Road to Radcon

585
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I don't know if anyone even remembers this.

586
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't know if anyone is even keeping track of this

587
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
but there is actually a narrative

588
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
that goes from Road to Radcon

589
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
to the Brad Garling House

590
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
lecture

591
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
and the Brad Garling House diss track

592
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
and the OVA and the dogen.

593
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
It is all kind of a linear thing.

594
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,400
There were big plans in the beginning

595
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
from that narrative.

596
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
They were not followed through

597
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
with any sort of...

598
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I don't know if we had big plans to begin with.

599
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
I think we had like vague plans

600
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
or at least big plans for the OVA.

601
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Those plans were never solidified into anything

602
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
but the concepts were very big.

603
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
We managed to wrangle it into a continuous narrative.

604
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I don't know if I agree.

605
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't know if I agree that they weren't realized

606
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
but they kind of are being realized

607
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
or they will be when it's done.

608
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I remember

609
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
the discussion about

610
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
what Radcon 4 should be about

611
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
is like we came up with the theme

612
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
anime girls on the beach

613
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
it's like a vacation

614
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
and also a school

615
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
because of PCD university lectures

616
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
and it's like

617
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
oh like anime

618
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
and that was kind of the extent of it.

619
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
We went to a beach

620
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
we had the idea of doing an OVA

621
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
and then all these other things

622
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
related to beach anime

623
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
theming

624
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
but I didn't think there was like

625
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
a plan for the narrative

626
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
of the entire thing to be contiguous.

627
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah, you might say

628
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
that the whole thing was a real dog's breakfast.

629
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Yeah.

630
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
You're lying.

631
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Yeah, and if you want to

632
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
and if you're curious about

633
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
does that mean anything to you?

634
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
No, maybe you should listen to the bonus episode

635
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
that isn't out yet, but it'll be coming out soon.

636
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
That's it.

637
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
That's just a taste.

638
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
That's just a taste of the FOMO

639
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
that you, the listener, are going to experience

640
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
if you are not pledged to the...

641
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
That is just a taste of the

642
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
all the inside jokes and japs

643
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
that you're going to be confused by

644
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
and feel like a total fool

645
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
if you are not pledged to the Patreon

646
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
and listening to the bonus episodes

647
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
and knowing what we're talking about.

648
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Mmm, dog's breakfast.

649
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Delicious.

650
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaking of the Patreon, I guess I should mention

651
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
that the funny thing happened

652
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
and PCP Patreon now

653
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
is bigger than Trixie's Patreon.

654
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Ow.

655
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Oh, yes, I saw that.

656
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,400
By one dollar, at least in the image

657
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
it's...

658
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
It was literally the one dollar

659
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
that I paid that one guy two dollars

660
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
to un-pledge from her.

661
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
It made all the difference.

662
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Got the moral victory, I suppose.

663
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
No, I got the moral L,

664
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
but I got the physical victory.

665
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
More money.

666
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I sacrificed my soul.

667
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
I guess that's true, yeah, yeah.

668
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
Absolutely.

669
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
It has gone up a bit.

670
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
We're at 670, I think?

671
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
669.

672
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
669, yeah.

673
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It has almost doubled since releasing those bonus episodes

674
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
and changing the model.

675
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
It has almost doubled.

676
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
So that's pretty great

677
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
and thanks everyone for pledging

678
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
and also fuck you

679
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
for listening to the playlist

680
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
without paying for it for all these years.

681
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I guess people do need

682
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
consequences

683
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
and monetary incentives

684
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
to do things otherwise they just don't.

685
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
They just steal things and take things.

686
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll be honest, I'll be honest.

687
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I thought, I kind of knew

688
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
I knew that the playlist

689
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
was an insecure system

690
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
and it could very easily leak and anyone that had the link

691
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
could give the link, the playlist

692
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
and then they would never need to pledge.

693
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
And I was like, yeah, I know that's true,

694
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
but also I feel like

695
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
people are...

696
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
It's going to leak one way or the other.

697
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
If people want to hear the bonus episodes without paying for it,

698
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
there's always going to be ways to do it.

699
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
So whatever.

700
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
And really, people are going to pledge,

701
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
not really because to get the bonus episodes,

702
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
because leaks are inevitable.

703
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
They're going to be pledged because they just like us

704
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
and want to do us the solid

705
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
of supporting us.

706
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Well, it turned out I was wrong.

707
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
They want the goods

708
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
and we weren't gatekeeping hard enough.

709
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
So now we've built...

710
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I've built the wall.

711
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
You know what they say?

712
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Big, strong walls make good neighbors.

713
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
They want to pay for it.

714
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Yeah!

715
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Based.

716
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Very exciting.

717
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Very exciting time to be a pro

718
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
procrastinator.

719
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
You might say.

720
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I certainly lived up to our names

721
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
in securing that those bonus episodes

722
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
took a good four years.

723
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Absolutely.

724
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
And we did the

725
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
fun fact contest.

726
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
It was the bonus episode that me and Gib recorded

727
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
the other day. It will be out at the beginning

728
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
of...

729
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
What's the fucking next month?

730
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
October?

731
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Yes, September, October.

732
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Beginning of October.

733
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Oh boy, it's Inktober again.

734
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
You can't do that though.

735
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
No, because the guy who did Inktober

736
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
he did something.

737
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
He's bad for some reason that I can't remember.

738
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
He drowned someone

739
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
with ink because he loves ink so much.

740
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Didn't he like steal something from somebody

741
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
to make Inktober?

742
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
He was revealed to be a squid person.

743
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I don't...

744
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't even remember

745
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
what it is that I'm bad about that guy.

746
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
He's got an Inktober NFT.

747
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Something stupid.

748
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Oh god, can you imagine?

749
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
He probably does.

750
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Why not?

751
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Why not?

752
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I did read about it.

753
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
He did seem like an asshole.

754
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
He did seem like a big asshole.

755
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
But I don't...

756
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
I mean, I don't...

757
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
I just forgot.

758
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh.

759
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
My headphones are about to die.

760
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Oh, so Tom, you mentioned

761
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
briefly there

762
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Deltarune with your...

763
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
You couldn't play it because of your new channel.

764
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Your collaborative, something or other

765
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
with SaberSpark.

766
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Yes, everybody who liked

767
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I Am Games and was like,

768
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
hey, it sure is sad that I Am Games

769
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
is no longer functioning.

770
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
And I felt that way too.

771
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
So like earlier this year in like January,

772
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
I was like, I'm going to revive

773
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I Am Games and get back on the bandwagon.

774
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I made a couple videos and I'm like, I'm going to talk

775
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
to Saber

776
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,400
because I talk to him all the time.

777
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Just like run the content idea by him

778
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
and see what he thinks

779
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
about the direction I want to take the channel.

780
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
And he was like, you know what, let's just...

781
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I was already going to make a gaming channel.

782
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Let's just make a channel together

783
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
with the person working with you on I Am Games.

784
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Let's make a new channel.

785
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
And I was like, oh, okay.

786
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
We lost them, but we can't find them anywhere.

787
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Where are they?

788
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Where's the co-hosts?

789
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
We just don't know.

790
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Where's the content?

791
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
So...

792
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
We spent a bunch of time making stuff.

793
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Trying to do a Where's the Podcast, but it's not a podcast.

794
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Yeah.

795
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
No, not yet. I think we're talking about

796
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
possibly doing a podcast.

797
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I Am Games had podcast episodes

798
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
that were just audio recordings, but...

799
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Oh, okay.

800
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Yeah.

801
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
So we have the new channel called SaberSpark64.

802
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
And I made like low polygon models

803
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
of me and SaberSpark like narrating

804
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
the videos and stuff.

805
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
And they're just like gaming videos.

806
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
We have four out right now.

807
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
There's new ones coming out every week.

808
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
I have a bunch in the queue, so at least for the next couple weeks

809
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
there'll be episodes coming out.

810
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
You gotta play Deltarune.

811
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
I gotta get the Deltarune clicks.

812
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That's what we did on I Am Games.

813
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
The funny thing is that

814
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,400
the channel's already

815
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,400
doubled the size of I Am Games,

816
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
and it doubled its size in less than

817
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
48 hours. It was pretty funny.

818
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
I saw that.

819
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I saw that.

820
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
I didn't really earn any of this, but okay.

821
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
No. Well, whatever.

822
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Who really earns anything

823
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
at the end of the day?

824
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
I'm curious what is the split

825
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
between you and Saber?

826
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Like, I don't know.

827
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Do you want to talk about who does what

828
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
for the channel?

829
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Because I was like, you narrated...

830
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
You wrote all four, and you narrated one,

831
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
and he narrated the other three,

832
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
I think?

833
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Also, I was curious and interested to see that

834
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Eleazar edited one of them.

835
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
He edited the big long one.

836
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Yeah.

837
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
It was Eleazar, Doonkun,

838
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Kaijukun, and

839
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
someone else for the fourth one

840
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
where the editors listed?

841
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Doonkun did a bunch of them. I've just been

842
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
bouncing videos off of them

843
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
and getting pretty good results.

844
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I just thought, oh, I see that Eleazar

845
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
is cheating on us.

846
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Yeah, yeah, I stole Eleazar.

847
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
It was a long process on that one,

848
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
because I had to go back and forth a few times.

849
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
We signed a contract. The pact

850
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
is broken.

851
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
I secretly wrote in a clause that said

852
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
he can work for me in other projects.

853
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
It doesn't break this contract.

854
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
You got to read that fine print

855
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
on both sides.

856
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I mean, I do most

857
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
of the writing on the channel.

858
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
There's some subjects coming up

859
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
some longer essay style videos

860
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
because we have a big 40-minute

861
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
video right now called What Ruined Mobile Games,

862
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
and that's like a

863
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
sister video to the

864
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,400
thing that just went up on Saber's main channel,

865
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
which is looking at terrible

866
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
video game ads for mobile games.

867
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
They're cringy,

868
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
sexually charged, awful garbage ads.

869
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
So this is like looking at

870
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
the mobile phone industry and how it

871
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
turned really shitty.

872
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
And then the other ones are just short

873
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
little essays that will be

874
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
in between. We're going to try and do one big

875
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
video a month, and then I'll just do smaller ones

876
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
in between to keep the channel alive

877
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
in between the big 10-pole releases.

878
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
And those are the big collab runs where we both

879
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
do research and stuff together,

880
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
and then in the interim are mostly just

881
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
little essays, like, shit out on the weekend

882
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
to just, like, keep the channel

883
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
alive.

884
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
So...

885
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Yeah, that's like the division of labor, I guess.

886
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Hmm, okay.

887
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Okay.

888
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Pretty, pretty cool.

889
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Um,

890
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm a little, sorry, I'm a little nervous.

891
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
I'm distracted because my headphones

892
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
just beefed at me. They're about to run out of batteries

893
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
and I'm looking for my charger

894
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
for them and I am, like,

895
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
I can't find it.

896
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Ben, you had, like, all morning to charge

897
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
your headphones. Got it. Got it.

898
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
No, I found it. I'm good. I'm good. Few.

899
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,400
Close one.

900
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Ah, yeah, I didn't know they were low.

901
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I didn't know they were low. I didn't know they were good.

902
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Unlike Delta Rune, recording a podcast

903
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
and just missing your headphones dying

904
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
does not give you extra TP.

905
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
It just, uh...

906
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah.

907
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Uh, I have a

908
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
I have a story.

909
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I have an unfortunate story to relay.

910
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I realized

911
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
well, I found something unfortunate in my closet.

912
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
I realized that when I moved out

913
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
not of my last apartment

914
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
into this fucking shithole that I live in now

915
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
but even before that, when I moved out of the first place

916
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
into that temporary place

917
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
so I'm over to almost

918
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
two months ago, uh, I realized

919
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
that I didn't

920
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
take the coffee grounds

921
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
out of my coffee maker

922
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
and I found my coffee maker in my

923
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
closet the other day

924
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
and in the, like, thing where you put the coffee grounds

925
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
it was just mold. It was just growing mold

926
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
for, like, two months

927
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
just in there and I realized, oh, maybe

928
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
that's why I have fruit flies in my room

929
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
because there's this fucking

930
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
this rotten fucking mass in my closet.

931
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Oh, no.

932
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
Yeah, so, like, I scorched that

933
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
cleaned that out with, like, scalding hot water

934
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
trying to fix it.

935
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Maybe I can salvage the machine.

936
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I don't know how it works, I hope,

937
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
but it's gross.

938
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
So that was, that was a bummer.

939
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
That was a bummer.

940
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
That's a great story.

941
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Yeah. You're welcome.

942
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Well, what do you fucking have to say

943
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
if you're so fucking clever and interesting?

944
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Well, I've been playing

945
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
a video game with my brothers

946
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
called Divinity Original Sin 2.

947
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Called Delta Room. I thought you were gonna say Delta Room.

948
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I have heard

949
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
of Divinity Original Sin.

950
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I haven't. I haven't played it

951
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
because I suck. Divinity, it's

952
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
really fun. It's

953
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
a turn-based

954
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
well, the combat is turn-based, but it's sort of

955
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
like a top-down looking at

956
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
a really... It's like a spiritual

957
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
successor to, like, Baldur's Gate and stuff.

958
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Yeah, it's like a Baldur's Gate game

959
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Dungeons & Dragons-esque

960
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
role-playing adventure.

961
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Yeah, sure.

962
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
There's, like, lore and whatever.

963
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
There's characters.

964
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
You can play, like,

965
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
across the internet.

966
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
And it's like a D&D campaign.

967
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
You can go around

968
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
the towns and talk to people

969
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
and have conversations and quests.

970
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
And other players

971
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
can double-click on your profile

972
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
image to listen in on your conversation

973
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
to see what options

974
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
you have and see what you're clicking on.

975
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
They can listen to the other

976
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
NPCs. They all have voice

977
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
dialogues, which is cool.

978
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
And then

979
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
they got all these fun, like,

980
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
classic fantasy tropes and stuff.

981
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
And then the combat is

982
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
like a...

983
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
I can't think of what is

984
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
similar to, but, like, you have action

985
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
points that you can use to cast spells,

986
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
do attacks,

987
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
or move, or use items,

988
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
and you get a certain

989
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
amount of action points per turn. Do you get more action points

990
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
if you get, like, close to the enemy

991
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
when they're attacking you and, like, you just kind of

992
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
barely miss them? No, it's not Delta Room, Ben.

993
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
It's a different game.

994
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Well, then what's the fucking point? Okay.

995
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Okay.

996
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
No, there's, like, spells you can cast, like, haste.

997
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Gives you an extra action point on the next turn.

998
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
There's skills you can get.

999
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
You know, it's just a really fun,

1000
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
quite engrossing RPG. We've been playing it, like,

1001
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
every day for quite a few hours each.

1002
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Just for all, like,

1003
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I want to play more Divinity. I want to...

1004
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
It's a really long game, it seems,

1005
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,400
and, like, the leveling up

1006
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
isn't really quick,

1007
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
which is nice, and it's not easy, either.

1008
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
So every battle is, like,

1009
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
we got to really think. We can't just fuck around.

1010
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
So when you

1011
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
get into the perfect position,

1012
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,400
like, you're on the high ground, you got a 20% bonus,

1013
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
and I've been playing this

1014
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Fire Lizard,

1015
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
and I got all this Fire Wizard magic,

1016
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
and I'm specking really into Pyrokinetic.

1017
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Are you a Lizard

1018
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
or a Wizard?

1019
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm a Lizard, and I chose the Wizard class.

1020
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
I didn't call myself a Wizard, though.

1021
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Do that on purpose?

1022
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,400
I don't actually think I realized.

1023
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,400
I just like the look of the Lizard, because it's cool.

1024
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
And then I wanted to...

1025
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I wanted to cast Fireballs, so Wizard was perfect.

1026
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Those are two perfectly reasonable

1027
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
feelings to have.

1028
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Yeah.

1029
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
But, like,

1030
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
the status effects are really cool,

1031
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
so, like, if you... certain attacks with Fire,

1032
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
lights the ground on Fire,

1033
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
which then will

1034
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
set enemies on Fire if they stand on it,

1035
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
or if you, you know, throw...

1036
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
If you get, like, there's oil barrels,

1037
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
if you break an oil barrel, oil spills

1038
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
on the floor, and it slows them down, but you can set it

1039
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
on Fire and burn everything in there.

1040
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
It is, like, you can cast Rain

1041
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
to put out Fires, but then that creates Smoke,

1042
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
which obscures the vision

1043
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
of people behind it

1044
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
for a turn.

1045
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
And then there's Ice and Poison.

1046
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
And you can be a Skeleton.

1047
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Are you this guy?

1048
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Yeah, yeah, I'm that character, not literally.

1049
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
Is that the guy, more or less?

1050
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Yeah, more or less.

1051
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
You can be a Skeleton?

1052
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
You can be a Skeleton of any of the races,

1053
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
and the only thing that's different with a Skeleton

1054
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
is that you have to hide your face,

1055
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
otherwise people will think you're...

1056
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
you're gross, because you can...

1057
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
they can see your fucking no-face skull.

1058
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
So you have to wear a hat or a helmet.

1059
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Yeah.

1060
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,400
If you're told it's okay to be a Skeleton,

1061
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
you just have to wear a hat.

1062
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
And everyone's like, all right, okay.

1063
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
It's like, oh, I can't...

1064
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
It's just a normal person.

1065
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,400
I'm not prejudiced against your lack of face.

1066
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I just don't want to see it in public.

1067
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

1068
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
What you do behind closed doors, what your face looks like

1069
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
is your own business, but out in public we have standard.

1070
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
You can't, like, kid so I can see that.

1071
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Yeah, so...

1072
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Skeletons can't get drunk,

1073
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
because liquid just goes through their ribcage

1074
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
and into their boots.

1075
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
So they can't get the drunk...

1076
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
But you can normally get the...

1077
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
You have food and crafting,

1078
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
and you can pick up scraps

1079
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
of things, parchment,

1080
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
apples, whatever.

1081
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
You can make foods, you can make crafted items,

1082
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
you can make spell scrolls.

1083
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
It's really robust.

1084
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
There's a lot of items

1085
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
and a lot of managing inventories

1086
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
and selling things and getting new weapons

1087
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
and special, you know,

1088
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
things on them,

1089
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
attributes.

1090
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Oh, and the cool thing with skeletons

1091
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
is that poison heals them.

1092
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
So if you throw, like, you've got a poison magic.

1093
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
You can throw it at a bunch of enemies

1094
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,400
and it'll heal any skeletons in the area.

1095
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
So if you're not fighting skeletons

1096
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
and you have a skeleton ally,

1097
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
big poison bomb is really good.

1098
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Interesting.

1099
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,400
So it's very fun.

1100
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
It's very strategic.

1101
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
I like that.

1102
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Oh, that sounds pretty cool.

1103
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
It's really fun.

1104
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
You doing, like, couch co-op?

1105
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
It's through Steam.

1106
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
We all had to buy the game to play together.

1107
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
There is couch co-op,

1108
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
but you can only play with two people at once,

1109
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
which, split screen,

1110
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
it sort of works.

1111
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
But there's three of us, so it wouldn't work for us.

1112
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I gotcha.

1113
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Are you playing that on Twitch?

1114
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Are you streaming that?

1115
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
No, I'm streaming that.

1116
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,400
That's my own personal video game time.

1117
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
What's the point?

1118
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
That's wasted content.

1119
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
No, it's fun.

1120
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
What's the point of playing a video game

1121
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
if you're not making content?

1122
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
The point of playing a video game

1123
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
is to enjoy the process of doing such a thing.

1124
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1125
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Video games aren't fun.

1126
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
That's just a way...

1127
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
content. What are you talking about?

1128
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Why are you making one, then?

1129
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Because I need to make content.

1130
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Oh, my God.

1131
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Video games are content.

1132
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
I can't believe people have forgotten that

1133
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
there's such a thing as enjoying life.

1134
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
They are content that breeds more content

1135
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
when you film yourself playing it.

1136
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
It's just the cycle never ends.

1137
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
You're breaking the cycle,

1138
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
and I won't fucking stand for it.

1139
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
You must perpetuate

1140
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
the content loop.

1141
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I don't know. Sounds pretty cool.

1142
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Sounds like a good time.

1143
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Sounds like a cool video game.

1144
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Yeah.

1145
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
How long have you been playing that?

1146
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
About a week.

1147
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
And a bit.

1148
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Most days.

1149
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,400
It's really enticing.

1150
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
It's just like, I just want to wake up

1151
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
and play Divinity

1152
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
the whole day.

1153
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Really good.

1154
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
That's how I was with Neo when I fell into Neo.

1155
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
The entire month of June

1156
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
just went away, and I just woke up,

1157
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
played Neo, went to bed,

1158
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
dreamed about Neo, woke up,

1159
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
played more Neo.

1160
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
It's one of those games for sure.

1161
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I have fallen off of Noida a bit.

1162
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I haven't really been playing Noida.

1163
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
The last time I played Noida, I was trying to do

1164
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
a pacifist run,

1165
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
and it was proving very...

1166
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I managed to do a no-gold run,

1167
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,400
but I have not managed to do the pacifist run yet.

1168
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Have you done a genocide run?

1169
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
No, every run, every normal run

1170
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
is a genocide run

1171
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
of Noida.

1172
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,400
I haven't really been

1173
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,400
playing video games that much.

1174
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I've been making my fucking game,

1175
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
which is really coming together.

1176
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I don't know exactly when it will be done,

1177
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
but I would say it's mostly done now.

1178
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I'm really excited about it.

1179
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
I think it looks really good.

1180
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
How many bugs she got?

1181
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
How many bugs?

1182
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
God, I don't...

1183
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Uncountable amounts?

1184
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I would say uncountable amounts.

1185
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
The entire game is just bugs all the way down.

1186
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
It's just bugs stacked on top of other bugs.

1187
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Damn.

1188
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Certain bugs keep the

1189
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
structural, like as load-bearing bugs,

1190
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
some of them.

1191
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
It's like, okay, I was making a game,

1192
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
and there was bugs. Bugs occurred,

1193
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
and I was like, hmm, okay, I could fix these bugs,

1194
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
or I could add more

1195
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
bigger bugs that will be the predators.

1196
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,400
I could introduce bigger bugs

1197
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
that will hunt and eat the smaller bugs

1198
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
and get rid of them.

1199
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
I was like, okay, nothing could possibly go wrong

1200
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
with that plan, and I've just been repeating

1201
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
that process over and over again,

1202
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
and the result is...

1203
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Until opening the program

1204
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,400
crashes your computer.

1205
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,400
The biggest bug in the game right now

1206
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
is that currently,

1207
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Phantom Horn has a weight command,

1208
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,400
and I need to change it to a

1209
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
DAB command that does

1210
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
the exact same thing, but he dabs.

1211
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
That's the biggest problem

1212
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
in the game right now.

1213
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
Yeah.

1214
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Oh,

1215
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
fuck.

1216
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Oh.

1217
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
I have some news. I have a funny story.

1218
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
I got contacted.

1219
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
C.C. asked me if I wanted to voice

1220
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,400
a character in the Tails Get Strolled audio book,

1221
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,400
and he put me

1222
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
in contact with the guy who does that.

1223
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,400
And I am going to be

1224
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
the voice of the Dark Lord.

1225
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Satan, basically.

1226
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh, just like in real life.

1227
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Satan has one line

1228
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,400
in Tails Get Strolled.

1229
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
It's in the flashback when they all do the ritual

1230
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
to become neutrals.

1231
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
After the ritual is completed,

1232
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Satan says like, well done.

1233
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Now I will give you the power.

1234
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
And that's going to be me.

1235
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Cool.

1236
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
It's going to be pretty sick, I think.

1237
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Yeah.

1238
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm going to record that line later tonight, I think.

1239
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
They just need to clip this.

1240
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
They don't even need to pay you.

1241
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Just clip this episode.

1242
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
You already did it. You did the work.

1243
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
I'm doing it for charity.

1244
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
No, I'm doing it for charity.

1245
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
I'm so hungry.

1246
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
You're doing it for charity, but not for content?

1247
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
No, it is content.

1248
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Tails Get Strolled is content.

1249
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
That's true.

1250
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
That's content. That's voice clip.

1251
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
That's my freaking 30 second voice clip.

1252
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
That's content.

1253
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,400
So it was Munchie's birthday this week.

1254
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
We had a birthday party for him yesterday.

1255
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Is it like 14?

1256
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Yeah, something like that.

1257
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
14 going on 13.

1258
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
We got the...

1259
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
I bought a cake.

1260
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Actually, I bought two cakes.

1261
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Actually, I bought so much of this fucking cake.

1262
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
There was this weird looking Russian cake

1263
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
in this Russian supermarket that I live near.

1264
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
And the cake was called Smetonic.

1265
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
And it's like a layer cake.

1266
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
It's like a wheat based layer cake.

1267
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
And I was like,

1268
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
give me a fucking huge amount of it.

1269
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
Because I thought everybody...

1270
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
There was gonna be like 10 people.

1271
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
And I thought everyone's gonna want a piece.

1272
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
So it gave me like a huge fucking bunch.

1273
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I spent $40 on this fucking cake.

1274
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
It was $10 a pound.

1275
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
It turned out to be good.

1276
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
It was good, but it wasn't that good.

1277
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
And like less than half of it got eaten.

1278
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
And I'm like...

1279
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
But it looked really good.

1280
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
It had chocolate shavings around the edge.

1281
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
And it was the frosting on top.

1282
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
It had a...

1283
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
What's the word?

1284
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
A confit.

1285
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
A confit of reduced

1286
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
the glaze of berries.

1287
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
One was mixed berry and the other was blackcurrant.

1288
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
It looked delightful.

1289
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
And it was pretty good. It was pretty good cake.

1290
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
But I shouldn't have spent $40 on it.

1291
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
But you know what? I did.

1292
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
And that's my story.

1293
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
And I'm glad

1294
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
you enjoyed it.

1295
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
No need for flaws.

1296
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
I applauded in my mind.

1297
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
True.

1298
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Speaking of

1299
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
turning things into content.

1300
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
I've been on two drawcasts

1301
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
recently.

1302
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
One of them was a big movie movie.

1303
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
Milka aligned drawcast.

1304
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Chip Wiseman

1305
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
and Kelly.

1306
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
I think their name is Kelly.

1307
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
They're real...

1308
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Oh shit. I forgot my accent.

1309
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Chip is one of the writers

1310
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
of the procrastinators

1311
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
of the dating sim

1312
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
and also now the Radcon 4 dojin

1313
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
coming soon.

1314
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
Yeah. And that was fun.

1315
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
We drew like monster girls.

1316
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
And then there was another drawcast

1317
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
that was recorded a lot earlier.

1318
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
I think I've mentioned it already

1319
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
before on the podcast.

1320
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
But it's the animation drawcast

1321
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
with oblivion fall

1322
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
that played

1323
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
hours and

1324
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
teleperte.

1325
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
That guy who draws things like...

1326
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,400
And Cetol, right?

1327
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Yes.

1328
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
I saw teleperte

1329
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
is in there.

1330
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
Cetol made a post in there that was like

1331
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,400
who anyone want to do a

1332
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
drawing telephone game.

1333
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
And I think I responded and I said,

1334
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
yeah, I could do that.

1335
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
Teleperte is so big.

1336
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Teleperte is huge.

1337
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
He's huge. The tallest man I've ever seen.

1338
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
He's giant.

1339
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Speaking of big

1340
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
artists on Twitter,

1341
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
did you see Cheesy's

1342
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
comic that got everybody angry?

1343
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
I did. I did see that.

1344
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Cheesy Man Freitas.

1345
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
It was deliberately designed to be annoying.

1346
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
And it worked.

1347
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
It's funny how

1348
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
a lot of the replies are just like,

1349
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
oh, you're pivoting

1350
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
a backlash and just scroll

1351
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
through Cheesy's account and there's just

1352
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
dozens of examples of

1353
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
taking the piss like this.

1354
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
You know,

1355
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
call me a contrarian or whatever.

1356
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I just agree with the comic.

1357
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
I just think it's

1358
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
unironically correct.

1359
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
There's definitely an argument to be made.

1360
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
When people say

1361
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
artists don't owe you a retweet, it's like,

1362
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
yeah, no shit they don't.

1363
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Nobody said they do. The point of the comic

1364
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
is just it's annoying when they don't retweet.

1365
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
I wish they would.

1366
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
What's fucking wrong with that?

1367
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
I agree with the initial comic.

1368
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
And then the people be like,

1369
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
I don't even want anyone to retweet me.

1370
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
I don't even care. And then for big accounts,

1371
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
like fucking big accounts

1372
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
to be like, this is just,

1373
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
of course, this just means that you only care

1374
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
about likes and engagement.

1375
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Yeah, no shit. That's why I'm posting on fucking Twitter.

1376
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
You fucking moron.

1377
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
You fucking losers.

1378
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
I agree with the comic

1379
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
in so far as

1380
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
sometimes a bigger creator

1381
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
than others. I enjoy

1382
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
being able to say, no, I don't care.

1383
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
I will not follow you.

1384
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
I like your content, but not that much, idiot.

1385
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
I won't even like it.

1386
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
I will just say I like it.

1387
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
I mean, it's

1388
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
strange, because on the one hand, you have the

1389
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
argument that like, oh, you don't want to

1390
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,400
tell people, you don't want to make anyone

1391
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,400
feel obligated to do something. And I think that's where

1392
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,400
the kind of like

1393
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,400
blowback comes from.

1394
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
But like, there's been a discussion

1395
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
in the art community forever

1396
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,400
about like not re-blogging enough,

1397
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
not retweeting enough. Like this is a point

1398
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
that has been argued from like

1399
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
sincerely for years.

1400
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
So it seems very strange.

1401
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Like the reaction almost

1402
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
felt like Elon Musk adjacent

1403
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
where like, oh, these big

1404
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
personalities, I have to simp in their defense.

1405
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Yeah, it's like

1406
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
all these little little artists with nothing

1407
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
to gain, no skin in it

1408
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
at all. Just throwing it all out there

1409
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,400
in the defense of people

1410
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
bigger than them who don't give a fuck about them

1411
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
who have everything while the other people have

1412
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
nothing. But they're like, no, no, don't don't

1413
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,400
attack them. They're my heroes or whatever.

1414
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
I don't need, I don't like, I don't care that

1415
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
like they fucking own my ass.

1416
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
The follow up comic was a slam

1417
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
dunk. I love the fault.

1418
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
Yeah, it was it was

1419
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
what does he say? Oh yeah, just who are you?

1420
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
The guy like, you don't need to

1421
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
you don't need to reflog me. It's okay just enough

1422
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
that you appreciate my art. Who?

1423
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Who are you? Who? Yeah.

1424
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,400
That was great.

1425
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
It really is a weird thing because it's like

1426
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
I saw a few people saying, yeah, well

1427
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
we're people too, big artists.

1428
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
And I was like, the original

1429
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
was not saying you are not people.

1430
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Right.

1431
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Why would you take it that way? I think

1432
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
big artists are people too.

1433
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
What are you talking about?

1434
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,400
It's because if you take the idea

1435
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
you're viewing the

1436
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,400
comic in the initial

1437
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,400
you're viewing the comic is like

1438
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,400
you're taking the concept

1439
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
and pushing it to its extreme

1440
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
of like you have to retweet

1441
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
and if you're telling someone they have to do something

1442
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
you're stealing their freedom in which case

1443
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,400
you're not treating them like a person with free will.

1444
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,400
I think if you can extrapolate it that

1445
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
far, you can make that point

1446
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
but like you're extrapolating

1447
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,400
very far away. Great fucking

1448
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,400
literally like

1449
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,400
coming up with a guy and getting mad at them.

1450
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Yeah.

1451
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
The thing everyone does on Twitter.

1452
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,400
I guess white people would react like that

1453
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,400
but I also think

1454
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
it's weird to like then make a stand

1455
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
like against it

1456
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,400
saying actually

1457
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
I am being attacked right now

1458
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,400
and I, big artist

1459
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,400
I'm not a, you know,

1460
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,400
cringe look for

1461
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,400
a big artist to be like actually

1462
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
obligated to do anything for you people

1463
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
and cringe for a little guy to be like

1464
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,400
no they're not obligated to do anything

1465
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,400
for me. I don't need anything.

1466
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
It's so bad from either perspective.

1467
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
I think they're sort of

1468
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,400
assuming that

1469
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
if they don't do

1470
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,400
what Cheez's comic is implying

1471
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
they should do that they are

1472
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
you know

1473
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,400
ready to get canceled like this is going to ruin

1474
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,400
your career unless you start

1475
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
retweeting smaller artists

1476
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
it's not a threat.

1477
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,400
You're stupid.

1478
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,400
It's just like realizing you're in a very

1479
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
I don't know

1480
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,400
maybe powerful is not the right word

1481
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,400
but like yeah you're in a powerful position

1482
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
of like your one

1483
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
retweet could make someone's career

1484
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,400
if it resonates with your audience.

1485
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,400
If you're big enough. I mean I read this comic

1486
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,400
and I am bigger than

1487
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,400
some people I'm not

1488
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
the biggest but whatever to some people I'm big

1489
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,400
I read this and I'm like yeah

1490
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
sometimes I am that big guy sometimes

1491
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
I'm just like nah I don't want to retweet

1492
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,400
lol. True.

1493
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
It's true.

1494
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
And I feel bad every time that happens

1495
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
cause it's always

1496
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
I don't feel

1497
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
too bad

1498
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
cause I've always been like consistent

1499
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
with like my twitter is

1500
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
when I see something I really

1501
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
like

1502
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
I like it and then it feels

1503
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
sensible to also retweet it so other people

1504
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,400
see it as well. If I like

1505
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,400
an artist I will often

1506
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,400
like their tweet and I don't

1507
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,400
retweet every piece of theirs but sometimes

1508
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,400
if I really like an artist or I really

1509
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
like a particular because I might retweet one

1510
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,400
that I think is like particularly good

1511
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,400
okay I particularly like this one

1512
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,400
I'll give this one a retweet cause I think it's cool.

1513
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,400
I don't go out of my way to do it

1514
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,400
and maybe I should do it more

1515
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,400
but I don't like to be

1516
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
a retweet flood. It's a nice thing to do

1517
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,400
it's not a bad thing

1518
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,400
to do. It's not even really a bad thing to not do.

1519
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
It's just sort of nice if you do do it.

1520
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
And I mean this is Cheesy saying this

1521
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
and Cheesy's feed is just

1522
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
is a retweet flood.

1523
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
I mean he really does put his money where his mouth is

1524
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,400
he really is retweeting people all the time

1525
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
so

1526
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
there's no hypocrisy here.

1527
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
What was it?

1528
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,400
Hey, you guys there?

1529
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Yeah. Huh? Yeah.

1530
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Okay we got really quiet for a second

1531
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
Oh did I say something?

1532
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,400
No you said something cringe and

1533
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
cancelled. I knew it.

1534
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
I have to go to Twitter and say Ben Stinky.

1535
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Fuck. No!

1536
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,400
Did you see I got a last

1537
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,400
point about this.

1538
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Did you see the loss edit?

1539
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,400
I did. I did.

1540
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
I forgot who did that one.

1541
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
Oh that one is genius.

1542
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
That one is so good.

1543
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Can I find it in the quote tweets?

1544
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
There's so many fucking quote tweets.

1545
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,400
I can't even find the one I'm looking for.

1546
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
The one where

1547
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
whatever it's a loss edit.

1548
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
It works really well.

1549
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Go on Twitter and look at the retweets

1550
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,400
and find it yourself. I'm not finding it.

1551
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Yeah

1552
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
my biggest criticism of this

1553
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,400
is that Cheesy

1554
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
cowardly to back down.

1555
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Cowardly to back down and say I did it

1556
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,400
because I know.

1557
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,400
You're just unironically right.

1558
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,400
There's no bait.

1559
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,400
It's just true.

1560
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,400
I guess it can be both.

1561
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,400
I guess it can both be true

1562
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,400
and he just did it to make people mad.

1563
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
They're not mutually exclusive.

1564
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
I'm going to say something I believe in

1565
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
that is going to piss people off.

1566
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,400
Not because I want it to be out there

1567
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,400
to show my opinion but to piss people off.

1568
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Says the N word.

1569
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Oh no.

1570
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
Clipped.

1571
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,400
True.

1572
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Hell yeah.

1573
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Okay.

1574
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,400
What else?

1575
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
What else we got on the plate today?

1576
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Did I already complain that nobody ate

1577
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
my $40 worth of cake? Yes I did.

1578
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
It was a Solaru.

1579
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,400
I just forgot their Twitter name.

1580
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Solaru is the other person on the

1581
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Big Boobie Mommy Milkers draw cast I did

1582
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
with Chip and Kaylee.

1583
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
You know who did eat some of that cake?

1584
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
An animator on Twitter

1585
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
that I know called

1586
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Ekenzone.

1587
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
His name is Ethan.

1588
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Ekenzone.

1589
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
He drove out for Munchie's birthday.

1590
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,400
He drove out from New York and he

1591
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,400
gentlemen

1592
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
took pity on me and took home

1593
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
a big chunk of the leftover cake.

1594
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
Immediately dumped it on the side of the road.

1595
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Halfway.

1596
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,400
Honestly.

1597
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,400
It was good.

1598
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
It got an unfair shake.

1599
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,400
I just bought too much of it. It's so sad.

1600
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,400
What have I done?

1601
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
What have I done? It was a learning experience.

1602
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,400
I was standing at the counter and I was like

1603
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,400
What did you get for buying so many carbs Ben?

1604
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,400
And I was like do I get just one

1605
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,400
big piece to share or do I get two?

1606
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
And I was like just one or two.

1607
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,400
Just one or two and I was like give me two.

1608
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
And then she was wrapping it up. She was

1609
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,400
weighing it and I was like oh my god this is gonna be

1610
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
like $40 worth of cake. And I was like

1611
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,400
no no actually just give me the one. And she's like

1612
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
give me just one. Okay.

1613
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
And I was like oh no.

1614
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
I hurt her feelings.

1615
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Okay never mind give me two.

1616
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,400
Oh no I got her hopes up and then I dashed them.

1617
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,400
No I have to now. Okay give me two.

1618
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,400
Give me two.

1619
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,400
You just were guilted into retweeting

1620
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,400
that lady's cake. What the fuck.

1621
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,400
I was.

1622
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,400
I was.

1623
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Doesn't she know that I'm human too?

1624
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Doesn't she know that I'm not obligated?

1625
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
I'm not obligated to buy that

1626
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,400
second piece of cake.

1627
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Hey I like your cake.

1628
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Thank you. But I'm so afraid.

1629
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
Are you gonna buy more? Hello.

1630
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,400
I'm gonna get cancelled if I don't ride the second piece.

1631
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,400
What a life.

1632
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,400
What a world.

1633
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,400
What a world.

1634
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
I

1635
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,400
met a guy

1636
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,400
at mice. Me and Munchie

1637
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
and Kazzy and Crack and a bunch of people

1638
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
were hanging out. This was weeks ago

1639
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
when we went to the MiniMice

1640
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,400
comic expo and I was selling

1641
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,400
Vapors and I was selling RFCK pins and such.

1642
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,400
It was great.

1643
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
Sold a lot of stuff.

1644
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
But we met a guy there who had a podcast

1645
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
and we just so happened to notice him

1646
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
because his podcast's

1647
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
logo is, it looks like

1648
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Endless War. It's the little Illuminati

1649
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
triangle, you know.

1650
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
It's the little pyramid head with the eye on it

1651
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
and it's green.

1652
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
It's a podcast called True Tales of the Illuminati

1653
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,400
which I have not gotten around to checking out yet.

1654
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,400
But I just thought it was funny.

1655
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
We were like, hey, I'm selling green.

1656
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
I'm selling a green triangle over here.

1657
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
You got a green triangle over there.

1658
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Well, let's compare notes or whatever.

1659
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Let's make a green diamond.

1660
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
We put him together.

1661
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,400
We went out and we hung out and we got Chinese food

1662
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,400
with that guy.

1663
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
And talked about podcasts

1664
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
and stuff.

1665
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,400
And my chicken,

1666
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,400
my braised chicken in brown sauce

1667
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,400
was so

1668
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,400
full of bones.

1669
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,400
There were so many bones in my fucking braised chicken

1670
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,400
in brown sauce.

1671
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,400
I couldn't believe it.

1672
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,400
I was like, wow, this is great for only $10.

1673
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,400
But then I bite in and I'm like, oh my god.

1674
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
It's like, it's all bone.

1675
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,400
And it's not like, it's not-

1676
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
It's a food equivalent of getting an iced coffee.

1677
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
It's just 90% ice. Chicken's just 90% bone.

1678
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
It's like it was chicken on the bone,

1679
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,400
like a chicken wing that you eat off the bone.

1680
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,400
No, it was like chopped chicken, like diced pieces of chicken.

1681
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Just many of them contained large bone segments.

1682
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,400
This happened to me when I was in Ohio

1683
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
and we went to this

1684
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,400
North Market.

1685
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
A bunch of small restaurants and stuff.

1686
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
You can just order from local places there.

1687
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
And I went to this place that was serving

1688
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
African food and they had lamb.

1689
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
It was like a bowl. You could get chopped lamb

1690
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,400
with seasoned rice and some vegetables and stuff.

1691
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
And so I got the bowl and I brought it home

1692
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
and I took a bite.

1693
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,400
And all the pieces of lamb had bone in them.

1694
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
I'm like, this is a bowl.

1695
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
How am I supposed to eat a bowl

1696
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,400
if there's bone in there?

1697
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,400
It was the same. It was mine. Mine was in a bowl

1698
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
and it was diced chicken. I'm like, yeah.

1699
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I'm just gonna grab a fork and eat this.

1700
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Now I'm thinking maybe I'm the idiot

1701
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,400
if this is something that's happened elsewhere.

1702
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Well, Joe, as can

1703
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
speculated that maybe you're supposed to

1704
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,400
maybe you're supposed to-

1705
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
you put the piece in your mouth

1706
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
and suck on it. Maybe you kind of just suck the meat off

1707
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,400
the bone and spit the bone out.

1708
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,400
And I'm like, I guess maybe.

1709
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,400
I guess that's one way to do it.

1710
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,400
But I don't like doing it.

1711
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,400
I just want to eat the meat.

1712
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
It seems like an extra unnecessary step

1713
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,400
that also inadvertently

1714
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,400
makes their products seem like

1715
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
it's more substantial than it actually is.

1716
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
I mean, I guess it would be

1717
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
more work to

1718
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
remove it from the bone.

1719
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,400
That's why I paid you money for it,

1720
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,400
the hard part, so I could enjoy the easy part.

1721
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Maybe I could have been like,

1722
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,400
hey, this braised chicken in brown sauce

1723
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,400
it's pretty good and it's pretty cheap.

1724
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
It's only like $10.99. Can I pay you

1725
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,400
like three extra dollars

1726
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,400
to just give me no bones?

1727
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
That was the DLC for the meal.

1728
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,400
The DLC, yeah.

1729
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,400
Alas.

1730
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
The booster pack

1731
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,400
or whatever. I don't know.

1732
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,400
Can I buy a season pass

1733
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,400
for no bones in my

1734
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,400
braised chicken in brown sauce, please?

1735
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,400
Sad. Good noodles, though.

1736
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Good noodles at that place.

1737
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,400
Hell yeah.

1738
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,400
Well, hey, I've run through my entire

1739
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,400
list of things I wanted to mention

1740
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,400
on this episode of the

1741
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,400
pro-crastinators.

1742
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,400
The only other thing I had on my list,

1743
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
because I did make one once you said you were doing that,

1744
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
because it was a great idea.

1745
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,400
It's almost the end of September

1746
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,400
and we still can't buy

1747
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,400
a fucking graphics card. It's been a year.

1748
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
It's been a year since new graphics cards

1749
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,400
and new consoles came out and they're still

1750
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,400
unavailable. And I know why

1751
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,400
it's because of the chip shortage

1752
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,400
and it's not going to get fixed for another year

1753
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,400
at least, probably closer to two years.

1754
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,400
But I'm just

1755
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,400
double non-plus about it.

1756
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,400
I just want to buy a new fucking graphics card

1757
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
and I can't do it. And it's really annoying.

1758
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,400
Capitalism is failing.

1759
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,400
You just can't get one anywhere? Or are they

1760
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
way too expensive on eBay or something?

1761
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,400
It's like both.

1762
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
The production is down

1763
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,400
really low, so there's not as many

1764
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
being made as there should be. The ones that are

1765
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,400
are all being bought by scalpers

1766
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,400
immediately with bots and sold for four times

1767
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,400
the price. And it's like

1768
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
I'm not going to buy a $400 graphics card for

1769
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,400
two grand, like die.

1770
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,400
No, absolutely not.

1771
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
So it just is infuriating

1772
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
and I cannot believe it's still happening.

1773
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
It blows my mind that like the normal person

1774
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,400
like dude, like

1775
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,400
imagine being like 15

1776
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,400
and being like, oh man, I can't wait to get the new X-Box

1777
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Santa bringing me the new X-Box

1778
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,400
and it just says

1779
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,400
they don't exist, they literally don't exist

1780
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,400
for two years now.

1781
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,400
For the second Christmas in a row, children's lives

1782
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
are going to be ruined.

1783
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Wow, when you put it like that

1784
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
they're going to play a fucking GameCube or whatever.

1785
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Oh, oh, we're going to have

1786
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
we're going to get into retro gaming.

1787
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,400
Oh, I don't want to play, we can't play video games

1788
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,400
on this PlayStation 3.

1789
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,400
That's fucking Grandpa's old console.

1790
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,400
That's, we might as well fucking listen

1791
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
to like put, turn on the fucking the

1792
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,400
the, the, the short wave, the short

1793
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,400
wave radio, put on the gramophone.

1794
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,400
No thanks. Listen to the Undertale soundtrack.

1795
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Everyone just has to play Deltarune because it's the only thing

1796
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
that'll run on their laptop because they can't afford

1797
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
graphics cards or anything for their good computer.

1798
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
True.

1799
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Fuck, that's just so fucking tragic.

1800
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
Sucks.

1801
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
I'm just thinking like in context of me, like

1802
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
if I had to wait two years while all the cool

1803
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
PlayStation 2 games were coming out that I couldn't

1804
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,400
play just because it's like, oh, no,

1805
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,400
like a bunch of jackasses

1806
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
with more money than cents

1807
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,400
are literally spending $700

1808
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,400
to get access to a bot that lets them buy

1809
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,400
150 consoles in 0.6

1810
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,400
seconds and then they flip them

1811
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,400
the rest of the year. Hell, hell yeah.

1812
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
Hell, hell, hell I should get

1813
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
in on the scalping game.

1814
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,400
I need to see more of those

1815
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
like triumph posts where like

1816
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
some scalpers like

1817
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
warehouse got busted into and all of this

1818
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
shit stolen. Right?

1819
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
I love seeing that.

1820
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,400
You love to see it.

1821
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,400
There has to be like a market for like, there's going to be

1822
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
a board on 4chan somewhere where they just find

1823
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,400
scalpers who post like screenshots of like

1824
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
all the consoles they have

1825
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,400
and they like fucking triangulate their position

1826
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
based on like the fucking moon

1827
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
and the window or something and then break into their house

1828
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,400
and steal all this shit.

1829
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,400
I'd support that in a video game.

1830
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
I would as well.

1831
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
The worst thing going on right now

1832
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
in the video game game

1833
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,400
sphere is that

1834
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,400
you can't play the video games.

1835
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
The gaming sphere would be a good name

1836
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
for a podcast.

1837
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,400
The gaming sphere.

1838
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Yeah, the game sphere. It's like the GameCube

1839
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,400
but like it rolls off the table and breaks.

1840
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Yeah, the like the self park console

1841
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
the okama game sphere

1842
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,400
from that one episode

1843
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,400
way back in the day. Everyone's like

1844
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
they just keeps rolling and everyone's like

1845
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
trying to catch them because they keep rolling downhill

1846
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,400
and I think you know something else

1847
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,400
somebody made a joke like that where the game sphere

1848
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
just won't stop rolling downhill.

1849
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
I haven't seen that since

1850
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
like that episode came out

1851
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,400
in 2001.

1852
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
I see, I see.

1853
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,400
Hang on, I gotta put, hold on

1854
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
I gotta put some apple cider vinegar

1855
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
in this fucking, in this seltzer water.

1856
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Directly into my face.

1857
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,400
Yeah, nice and tart.

1858
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
That's, that's the good shit.

1859
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Um, well

1860
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,400
if there's anything, if there's nothing

1861
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,400
else of interest we could move on to voicemails.

1862
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
It's true.

1863
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
We are on a time, a time budget

1864
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
this episode. We have a, we have a

1865
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
unfortunately yes we are

1866
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
tragically limited to under

1867
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,400
two and a half hours today.

1868
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,400
What a nightmare, am I right?

1869
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
It's barely, barely even a podcast

1870
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,400
at that length. I would agree.

1871
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,400
I would agree and I am ashamed

1872
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
but nevertheless.

1873
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Alright, well you guys got Speakpipe open?

1874
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,400
No.

1875
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,400
In one second. Come on

1876
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,400
we gotta fucking

1877
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Whoa, they changed their UI.

1878
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,400
They did. They changed the way it looks.

1879
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,400
It looks all different but it still doesn't work

1880
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
because they still are letting us get

1881
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
voicemails even though we're like

1882
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,400
Oh my god. We're like ten times

1883
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
over the data limit and they just haven't

1884
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,400
stopped us.

1885
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,400
That's, that's the puggatist thing.

1886
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
I told them, oh

1887
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
I told uh, uh

1888
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,400
Tyler from the Anamorphon

1889
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
Time podcast DM'd me to be like

1890
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,400
how do you guys do the voicemail thing

1891
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,400
and I told him about Speakpipe

1892
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,400
and I told him like yeah they say there's

1893
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,400
a data limit but don't worry.

1894
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,400
There's not. It was like cool.

1895
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,400
At least there's not

1896
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
uh, when we made it

1897
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,400
I don't know if they've patched that since then

1898
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
and we just kind of are

1899
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,400
grandfathered into their bullshit.

1900
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Maybe we'll find out.

1901
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,400
I don't know, yeah I wonder.

1902
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,400
They were making a request like

1903
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,400
hey guys send in voicemails to be on the

1904
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,400
to be read on the Anamorphon Time

1905
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
which hopefully

1906
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,400
they're probably gonna still be doing it so I guess this is a plug for

1907
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
fucking go call into

1908
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,400
the Anamorphon Time

1909
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,400
and follow the Morphe Boys

1910
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,400
on Twitter. Go watch my episode.

1911
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
I feel like I'm contractually obligated to get

1912
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,400
on the Anamorphon Time podcast.

1913
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,400
I feel like you are too. I wasn't gonna say anything

1914
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
but it's pretty cringe

1915
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
that you haven't done it.

1916
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,400
We talked about your lecture when I was on there a little bit.

1917
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,400
Only bad things I'm sure.

1918
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,400
Of course. Of course.

1919
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,400
We talked about all the

1920
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,400
you know all the factual and

1921
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
accuracies

1922
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,400
and you know how

1923
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
your jokes were

1924
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,400
we're all fascists.

1925
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
We were all wearing masks.

1926
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
We all went full mask off

1927
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
in that lecture.

1928
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,400
You know how it goes.

1929
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Okay

1930
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,400
let's play this first voicemail

1931
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
shall we?

1932
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,400
The first one is Janice.

1933
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,400
Three, two, one, go.

1934
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Ben, I

1935
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,400
thought your refusal to watch R-Taxi

1936
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,400
was just a funny joke.

1937
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,400
Then I pondered

1938
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,400
why you would do that

1939
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
and it leaded me to a very

1940
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,400
subjective interpretation

1941
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,400
that you would rather just be spending

1942
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,400
time working on your art

1943
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,400
than watch something which would

1944
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
just be okay.

1945
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,400
That is the artist mindset I'm

1946
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,400
wanting myself to adopt.

1947
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
To eject the need to be busy

1948
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,400
and become focused on being the ideal

1949
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
artist I want to be.

1950
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,400
That's

1951
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
very

1952
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
charitable.

1953
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,400
I would say

1954
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,400
I would maybe say

1955
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,400
there's actually something

1956
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,400
that I worry about a lot lately

1957
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,400
is that I find it very

1958
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,400
difficult

1959
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,400
to get excited about

1960
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,400
things

1961
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,400
and I have

1962
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
very little desire

1963
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
to like

1964
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,400
try new things

1965
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
or

1966
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
look into new art

1967
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,400
like Deltarune. Deltarune came out.

1968
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,400
What do I feel about the prospect of playing

1969
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Deltarune Chapter 2? Nothing.

1970
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
I'm hollow on the inside.

1971
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,400
So that's how I would describe.

1972
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
But if you want to call that being

1973
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,400
the ideal artist,

1974
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,400
be sure.

1975
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,400
The ideal content creation machine.

1976
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
Yes.

1977
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,400
You just gotta like stuff. You just gotta enjoy life.

1978
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,400
You gotta play a video game.

1979
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Once you get too

1980
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
terrible,

1981
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
you just realize how broken everything is.

1982
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
Socialism is next to nihilism.

1983
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
All these things need to be fixed

1984
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
but they never will be.

1985
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,400
No, you're wrong.

1986
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,400
You go hollow.

1987
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,400
That's just the doomer mindset.

1988
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
Socialism gives me hope.

1989
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
Socialism gives me hope that things

1990
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,400
can be better eventually.

1991
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
Not that they will soon,

1992
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,400
but that they could one day.

1993
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,400
That's their idea out there.

1994
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
That's being actively ignored.

1995
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,400
You sure?

1996
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,400
But it's...

1997
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,400
The real doomer mindset is that

1998
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
well, we live under capitalism

1999
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,400
and there's nothing to even do to...

2000
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,400
No point even talking about it.

2001
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Because we just gotta deal with it.

2002
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Because we live at the end of history

2003
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,400
and nothing will ever change.

2004
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,400
And that's good, I guess. Capitalism is bad.

2005
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Capitalism is bad, obviously.

2006
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
It has its problems, but we're stuck with it.

2007
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
And we gotta make the best of

2008
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,400
in it. And also,

2009
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
that's actually good, though, and I support that.

2010
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,400
Right.

2011
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Is the attitude that I feel like I see

2012
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
a lot.

2013
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
The default attitude of

2014
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
capitalism.

2015
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
Yeah, it's got problems, but what are you gonna do?

2016
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,400
But also, I like it and I like those problems.

2017
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,400
I don't want them to go away.

2018
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,400
At least it's not communism.

2019
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
At least it's not communism.

2020
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,400
Whatever that is, I don't know.

2021
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,400
The next...

2022
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
You guys got anything else to say about that?

2023
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,400
No.

2024
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
I don't know.

2025
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
No, no.

2026
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Yeah, next one is called

2027
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,400
Doug Walker Screaming I Am Jesus for 90 seconds.

2028
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,400
Three, two, one, go.

2029
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I am Jesus!

2030
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,400
I am Jesus!

2031
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
I am Jesus!

2032
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,400
I am Jesus!

2033
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,400
I am Jesus!

2034
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,400
I am Jesus!

2035
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,400
I am Jesus!

2036
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
I am Jesus!

2037
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,400
I am Jesus!

2038
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
I am Jesus!

2039
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
I am Jesus!

2040
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
I am Jesus!

2041
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
I am Jesus!

2042
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,400
I am Jesus!

2043
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
I am Jesus!

2044
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,400
I am Jesus!

2045
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
I am Jesus!

2046
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
I am Jesus!

2047
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,400
I am Jesus!

2048
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:32,120
Annoying fly or Ben Saints ass cheeks you decide three, two, one, go.

2049
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:38,120
Nobody knows.

2050
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
It's a mystery.

2051
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,120
Well, Ben, you would know.

2052
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,920
Well, does that happen when you stand up?

2053
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:52,360
Both of those things are in my room, so it could have been I would have to go back and

2054
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,360
hear it in context.

2055
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,360
There's just no way to tell.

2056
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,560
I'm hoping I'm hoping that having found the rotting fucking coffee grounds in my closet,

2057
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,480
I will have less of a fly problem going forward.

2058
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,040
I'm hoping that that was the source of it.

2059
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,640
Unfortunately, your ass cheeks will be with you forever.

2060
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Yes.

2061
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:20,720
And of course, those attract flies as well, so there's really just no winning.

2062
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:26,840
The next voicemail is called Sad 3, 2, 1, go.

2063
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:32,960
Listening to corineatrixie content, like talking to a loved one who has lost her mind,

2064
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:39,320
like it came from a single corineant form, like, I don't know, even if she had a form

2065
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:45,400
that I would consider like a charming, quirky part of a personality, you know, fucking get

2066
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:52,920
on my nerves, fucking self-involved fucking vapid ass.

2067
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,920
I mean, I agree.

2068
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,920
It's my opinion.

2069
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:04,080
I mean, like, I don't think people came to her channel just for the anime reviews.

2070
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:11,040
I think people actually liked her personally, even like they have music, like the game that

2071
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:22,280
has 67,000 views and people really put up and people supported her fucking music shit

2072
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:27,400
because they really liked her, but she fucking threw it all away.

2073
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,400
It's sad.

2074
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,280
It makes me sad.

2075
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,280
Me too.

2076
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,280
Me too.

2077
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,280
I mean, true.

2078
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,920
We got it from our perspective.

2079
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:46,160
This was like our friend who just like eroded her like, oh, okay, yeah, that's a bummer.

2080
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:54,560
You see your, when I occasionally glance over at what she's putting out on one of the other

2081
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,920
channels, I'm like, yeah, I'm agree, like I see it, I'm like, this person is not acting

2082
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,920
like, I don't know, like, what are they doing, like, I don't know, the way they act in like

2083
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,720
the, the, the, what are those, the one where she interviews rappers, the, what's, the, what

2084
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,720
you do?

2085
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,520
And it's like, it's, it's, I guess, like, she's the same person in some ways.

2086
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,280
That's my question to Trixie when I watch those videos, she's just, it just feels like

2087
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:24,360
there's nothing really going on in her, in her head, I don't know, I don't watch a lot

2088
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:29,920
of the stuff she's doing, but she does seem like less of everything.

2089
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,080
I think she's, she's just like not, just like, is she just like not into it?

2090
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,280
Is she just like not feeling it and she's just going through the motions, but I have

2091
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,280
no idea.

2092
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,680
It doesn't even, it doesn't even know why she's doing what she's doing.

2093
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,240
We'll never know, unfortunately.

2094
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,240
Yeah.

2095
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,240
Yeah.

2096
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,240
Yeah, I don't know, dude.

2097
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
I don't know.

2098
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:53,400
Um, next voicemail is called based water god three, two, one, go.

2099
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:00,880
If the definition of something being wet is, is having water molecules attached to it,

2100
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:08,720
then unless you separate a single water molecule by itself, then by definition, all, all water

2101
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:16,880
is wet because it is surrounded by water molecules, which is attached to it, check, check, mate,

2102
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:26,440
that's a really good bit.

2103
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,440
I like that bit.

2104
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,440
That's really good.

2105
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,440
That's was a great bit.

2106
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:36,240
I mean, it got me laughing, I guess.

2107
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,400
Um, um, yep, new molecule water.

2108
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,400
Yep.

2109
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,400
I got it.

2110
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
Yeah, it's good.

2111
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:51,480
The next, next voicemail is called a question from a lowly troglodyte three, two, one, go.

2112
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,600
So wait, did anyone actually break in to Tritie's house or something to cover up the

2113
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,840
break up thing?

2114
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,200
No, that, that's, that really, that really happened.

2115
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,480
There was like a pretrial and stuff for the guy that did that.

2116
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,920
I don't know if it, I don't know if it was a break in, like may, may open the door and

2117
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,880
the guy just like kind of came, like she opened the door and he came in.

2118
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,080
So it wasn't a break in, but it was like, I guess you might call it an assault.

2119
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,320
I mean, it was basically an assault.

2120
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,600
I don't really know too much about it, but I never really got the full details.

2121
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,360
A crime of some sort was committed.

2122
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,360
I, yeah.

2123
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,360
Yeah.

2124
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,240
I honestly thought the story sounded so like bizarre that I thought it was made up.

2125
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,800
I really thought like they have to be making stuff.

2126
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
This can't have happened.

2127
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,960
It was very strange.

2128
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,200
But something happened because there was, there was a pretrial and stuff.

2129
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,720
So I'm convinced that it's, I mean, a real thing occurred.

2130
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,720
I don't know the details.

2131
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,760
It certainly seems to have traumatized May.

2132
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,640
Perhaps.

2133
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,560
What makes you say that?

2134
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:02,320
Well, maybe, I mean, this is, this is from an outsider looking in, but I feel like she

2135
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:11,720
was a little more open to things like trans issues with, with Trixie and all that stuff.

2136
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,720
And then around that time, this happened.

2137
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,040
And then afterwards the breakup happened, but I don't know what caused what.

2138
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:24,160
I, I certainly think whatever that, you know, the break in was fucked up something.

2139
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,920
I mean, it could have helped, you know, a stroke on a camel's back sort of moment.

2140
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
I don't know.

2141
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,720
It couldn't have helped, but I don't think like that is what changed.

2142
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:39,040
No, I wouldn't say that was like the main thing, but like, I don't know.

2143
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,120
Sure, it couldn't, it couldn't have helped.

2144
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:49,040
Next voicemail is called Addendum to the Previous Question, three, two, one, go.

2145
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,720
And by break, I think I mean cheating thing.

2146
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,720
Yeah.

2147
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,720
Yeah.

2148
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,720
Whatever.

2149
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,720
Right.

2150
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,720
Sure.

2151
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Fine.

2152
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,120
Now, it may or been, you decide.

2153
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,120
Three, two, one, go.

2154
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,120
Wait.

2155
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,920
Oh, was that a Trixie song?

2156
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,240
That was a Golden Witch song, apparently.

2157
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
Is that new?

2158
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
Wait.

2159
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,240
I assume.

2160
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,240
Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna listen to it again.

2161
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,240
Is that live?

2162
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,320
I'm, I'm glad you're not here.

2163
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,880
I'm glad you're not here because I don't want to forgive you.

2164
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,000
I don't want to forgive you.

2165
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,520
I thought she said, I don't want to fuck you.

2166
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,720
I would say it's probably more likely about May, I mean, if it's about anyone, right?

2167
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,040
It might not necessarily be about anyone in particular.

2168
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,040
Sure.

2169
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,040
Could just be lyrics.

2170
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,840
It's just, I mean, I mean, it's, I mean, heck, it could be about anyone.

2171
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:53,960
It could be about both of us.

2172
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,880
It could be about whoever, whoever she wants it to be.

2173
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,880
You know what?

2174
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,880
It's, it's art, man.

2175
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,880
It's subjective, right?

2176
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,880
It's subjective.

2177
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,400
It means whatever you want it to mean.

2178
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,400
Death of the Author.

2179
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,400
It could be both.

2180
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,400
Man.

2181
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,400
It is both.

2182
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,400
And that's valid.

2183
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
And it's neither.

2184
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,400
And it's all these things at once together.

2185
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,400
It's superposition.

2186
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,520
And the universe is like connected or whatever.

2187
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,160
Next voicemail is a, is this fucking fast upload link.

2188
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,160
Okay.

2189
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:27,600
It is called the biggest, most awful, most tragic events in human history.

2190
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,760
Three, two, one, go.

2191
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,480
I'm about to hashtag delete my own channel, if you know what I'm trying to say.

2192
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,480
No.

2193
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,240
I don't even remember when he said that.

2194
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:39,240
No, Munchie.

2195
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,240
Don't do it.

2196
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,240
No.

2197
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,240
Oh, it's too late.

2198
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,240
Don't do it even though everything's gone.

2199
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,240
Oh, he did it.

2200
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:48,280
I don't remember when he said that, but LeMau, that's kind of what he did.

2201
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,280
And what?

2202
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,280
Oh, well.

2203
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,080
Dude, foreshadowing is a genius.

2204
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:57,000
When you say you're not going to do something, because you don't want to do it, but then

2205
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,800
you change your mind and you decide, actually, I do want to do that.

2206
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,080
And then you do it, that's foreshadowing.

2207
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:14,040
Next voicemail is called women be three, two, one, go.

2208
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:19,080
How did mage leave the podcast and the percentage of women increased?

2209
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:25,000
Well, I really, I guess it's weird, right?

2210
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That's life.

2211
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,240
I mean, Trixie's gone, so I guess it's the same.

2212
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,240
The percentage is what?

2213
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,240
It's, I mean, it's...

2214
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,840
Oh, I guess the percentage, if there's only three of us.

2215
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:40,240
We're a 33% saturation, womanly saturation.

2216
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,280
We're almost equal.

2217
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,280
We have...

2218
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:48,200
We almost have gender equality on the progressions, almost, we're almost there.

2219
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,760
So we need to kind of maybe pull back a bit from doing that.

2220
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,960
Yeah, it's a little uncomfortably high for me, not going to lie.

2221
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,040
We've gone a bit too far.

2222
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,840
We've gone woke, we've gotten woke and gone broke.

2223
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,680
And you're going to have to introduce a gender pay gap and pay me less.

2224
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,680
You know what?

2225
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,680
To compensate.

2226
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:11,200
That's exactly what I was thinking, now we're talking.

2227
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,680
You got to pay the woman tax.

2228
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,240
Wait, that's a thing, right?

2229
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:20,200
I'm going to say that about things that are sold as branded for women are just always

2230
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,000
a little bit more expensive, right?

2231
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,160
I have heard that, the pink version of the healthcare product.

2232
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,280
I've always wondered if there's actually anything different, even something as simple as does

2233
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,720
the color add to the cost, or if there's, it's just bullshit.

2234
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,680
It might be just to like, oh, this is sold as a more specialized product, therefore we

2235
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,040
can charge a little more for it, or it might be that we go out of our way to like...

2236
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:48,800
We go out of our way to make it aesthetic, and it adds production cost to the process.

2237
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,800
It's a mystery.

2238
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,800
It might be a little of both, I honestly.

2239
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,560
I'm sure there's some, I mean, I guess the good thing is for a lot of those products,

2240
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,760
you can just buy the normal one if you really wanted to.

2241
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:00,760
Most of the time, probably.

2242
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,760
Yeah.

2243
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,760
You can just get the regular razor.

2244
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:07,640
I know they say that about razors a lot, it's a common example, but I'm pretty sure

2245
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:13,040
regular razors will work just as fine, which is good.

2246
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,040
Great.

2247
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:23,040
Okay, next one is shoppin', so women be shoppin', you see, three, two, yes, it forms a, it forms

2248
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,040
a dyad.

2249
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,040
Three, two, one, go.

2250
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:33,040
Manage left, and you guys all just stand and rush, we're like, fucking, they're gonna

2251
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:38,960
kick us off YouTube, man, we're not gonna pass the Beckdale Pass, fuck, we got to all

2252
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,960
transition.

2253
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:47,920
We got to all transition right away, man, we can't fucking go out here with no women

2254
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,920
on the show.

2255
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,920
We were like, sit, guilt is charged.

2256
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,960
I wonder when YouTube was like, oh, it has to have women in it, I forgot.

2257
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,000
The woke Illuminati, they were, they were, they were like, the bringing the hammer down

2258
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,880
everywhere, we're like, oh God.

2259
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,240
It was like, you know, it's like how, it's like Passover, right?

2260
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:08,080
When the angel of the Lord came over, I don't know, fucking, was it Jerusalem or whatever

2261
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:12,440
the fuck, and like, killed your firstborn, and you had to paint, you had to paint blood

2262
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:17,720
over your door, right, lamb's blood to like, get the fucking angel to not kill your kid

2263
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,880
or something, right?

2264
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,880
That's a story that happened.

2265
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,880
Yeah.

2266
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,160
Well, it's like that, you got to fucking, we got to fucking paint your fucking woman

2267
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:29,600
menstrual blood on the fucking door, or YouTube is like, no, we can't kill your firstborn,

2268
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,920
kill your podcast, kill your ad revenue, it's over.

2269
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,920
I saw, I saw a, I saw a Babylon bee.

2270
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,000
Article, you know, one of their satiric, I don't like the Babylon bee, but I saw this

2271
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,240
article and I thought there was a negative humor in it, it was a, it was a, they said

2272
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:53,000
that like the, the Taliban in Afghanistan were like, they were painting like the trans

2273
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:01,440
flag colors over their doorways to like avoid Biden drone strikes, was like, no, we're trans,

2274
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,000
we're painting the, we're flying the trans as like a, as like a, not as like a statement,

2275
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,280
but as like a, no, we're woke, you can't kill us, we're a victimized something.

2276
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,280
I don't know.

2277
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,080
I mean, obviously it's bizarre.

2278
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,080
It's a bizarre thing.

2279
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:20,760
Like, yeah, Biden won't drone strike you with your trans, but like, yeah, yeah, but it's

2280
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,760
just a funny visual.

2281
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,760
The PR would just be too bad.

2282
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,880
They're like, no, we're flying the flag.

2283
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,880
No.

2284
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,240
That's, that's why that's why they paint the fucking nukes.

2285
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:34,040
They paint the nukes with the gay pride flags so that they could like, like find gays and

2286
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:35,040
kill them.

2287
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,480
That's why they're doing that.

2288
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,240
Well, the gays are attracted to it.

2289
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,000
They can't become flocking out of their homes and pouring out on the streets.

2290
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,560
Oh, look at that lovely woke explosion.

2291
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,560
Oh, we gotta go.

2292
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,560
We gotta get some.

2293
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,560
It's like, oh, it's a sonic rainbow.

2294
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,560
Oh, the shockwave.

2295
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,560
Whipple through the cities.

2296
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,560
Can't wait to get my cutie mark.

2297
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Oh, yeah, we got them.

2298
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:50,560
My fellow Americans, we got them.

2299
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,560
We got them all in one go.

2300
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,560
All the bronies, dead.

2301
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
One fell swoop.

2302
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,560
We painted rainbow dash on this, on this fucking nukes.

2303
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Doesn't that movie come out like next week?

2304
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:03,560
Dropped it over Baltimore, which, oh, the, oh, the, the MLP movie, doesn't it, like,

2305
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,560
a week or two or something?

2306
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,560
It's soon.

2307
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,560
I don't know.

2308
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,560
I don't know.

2309
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,560
I forget.

2310
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,560
I'm looking it up right now.

2311
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,560
Dude, I can't wait to go and.

2312
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,560
Are we there?

2313
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,560
Are we going to September 24th?

2314
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,560
It's in five days.

2315
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:18,560
Five days.

2316
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,560
Well, are we going to be there?

2317
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:30,560
Are we going to do a review on the show?

2318
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,560
We have to.

2319
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,560
I want to.

2320
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,560
We said we would.

2321
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,560
We said we would.

2322
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,560
Are we going to do it next week?

2323
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,560
Is that going to be our topic for next week?

2324
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,560
I'll try to get around to finding, like, a camera for whatever.

2325
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,560
It's on Netflix.

2326
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,560
So it'll, I don't want to get Netflix.

2327
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,560
But, like, someone will find it.

2328
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,560
You don't need a camera because it'll be on Netflix.

2329
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,560
It'll get, like, an actual.

2330
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,560
Oh, yeah.

2331
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,560
It'll be good.

2332
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,560
It'll be good.

2333
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,560
I'll find it.

2334
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,560
I wasn't suggesting paying money.

2335
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,560
Are you kidding me?

2336
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,560
I know.

2337
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,560
I mean, it'll surely have Netflix.

2338
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,560
In which case, you're fine.

2339
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2340
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,560
I'm sure I can find it.

2341
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,560
Okay.

2342
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,560
All right.

2343
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,560
Well, get hype.

2344
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,560
Get hype for that.

2345
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:16,560
Unless, wait, would it be, would it be two callous, two mercenary, two capitalist of

2346
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
me to say we should make it a bonus episode?

2347
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,560
Is that going too far?

2348
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,560
Is that over the line?

2349
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,560
I don't know.

2350
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:29,560
We have a lot of dead beats to punish for a year or two years of not paying properly.

2351
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,560
Absolutely.

2352
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,560
We were just saying before the podcast, like, it's going to be interesting to see if everybody

2353
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,560
drops off next month.

2354
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:40,560
But if we dangle an MLP video, that'll keep them on the hook for another month.

2355
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,560
I'm threatening them with FOMO.

2356
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,560
I'm already on the, like, these laps, these laps patrons better not fucking do it again.

2357
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,560
They get one.

2358
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,560
They do it twice in there.

2359
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,560
They fool me once, shame on me.

2360
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,560
Fool me twice, shame on you.

2361
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,560
And also, I'll kill you.

2362
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:00,560
I don't know.

2363
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,560
I don't know.

2364
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,560
I mean, we, no, we said, we said we would do it.

2365
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,560
We'll probably just do that one of the regular episodes.

2366
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,560
It'll probably just, unless we won't, unless we won't.

2367
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,560
I don't know.

2368
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,560
I mean, whatever.

2369
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,560
Stay patron to find out.

2370
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:14,560
Yeah.

2371
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,560
It's the only way.

2372
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,560
It's the only way.

2373
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,560
The next voice mail is called Donkey Kongo's Ginted.

2374
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,560
Three, two, one, go.

2375
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,560
You guys remember the teen CP?

2376
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,560
Yeah.

2377
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't get that joke for like years.

2378
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,560
I didn't know the child porn was the joke.

2379
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,560
Yeah.

2380
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,560
I don't know if it was.

2381
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,560
They made it.

2382
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,560
I don't think they made it to be like that.

2383
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,560
Never really, never made it through that show.

2384
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,560
Started again.

2385
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,560
I'm going to kill my.

2386
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,560
No, don't kill mice.

2387
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,560
My circuit.

2388
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:55,560
I don't, I don't know if, if it was, if that was meant to be the joke.

2389
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:01,560
Although when it was pointed out to me, the phrase teen CP does sound a little, oh dear.

2390
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,560
Oh dear.

2391
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,560
I'm not sure.

2392
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,560
I'm not sure if that was intentional or not from Rayman.

2393
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,560
Oh yeah.

2394
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,560
It's like they're very small.

2395
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,560
They're teensy.

2396
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:12,560
True.

2397
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,560
True.

2398
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:16,560
The small podcast.

2399
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:23,560
Next voicemail is pro crassinators podcast, more like three, two, one, go.

2400
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:30,560
So yeah, I was just watching that old, you know, hippo and a munchie have tea video about

2401
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,560
three years ago.

2402
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:37,560
And one of the top comments posted about three years ago read something like, you know, this

2403
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,560
video is nice.

2404
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:46,560
I can't wait for, you know, more stuff like this to happen when PCPHQ becomes a thing.

2405
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,560
Yeah.

2406
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,560
I mean, yeah.

2407
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,560
Yeah.

2408
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,560
I mean, it was always up in the air whether I was ever going to be a PCPHQ.

2409
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
Life comes at you fast.

2410
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
Life does come any fast.

2411
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,560
Yeah.

2412
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,560
The closest it ever got was Boston.

2413
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,560
Yeah.

2414
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,560
But Trixie hated it there.

2415
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,560
Trixie hated it.

2416
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,560
Yeah.

2417
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,560
Trixie hated it.

2418
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,560
Move to Virginia.

2419
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,560
Man, she just got a shitty landlord.

2420
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,560
I've got a shitty landlord.

2421
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,560
What I have to do is just find a new landlord.

2422
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,560
Everyone has a shitty landlord.

2423
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,560
Yeah.

2424
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,560
Hers was particularly bad.

2425
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,560
She showed me, I saw some of the emails she was sending.

2426
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,560
I was like, this person is fucking insane.

2427
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,560
This person is not allowed to be doing this shit.

2428
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,560
My friend was telling me his shitty landlord story and it was pretty fucking lame.

2429
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,560
I guess like they were trying to raise everyone's rent a hundred dollars, even though like,

2430
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,560
according to New York like law, if you have to give your tenants 90 days warning,

2431
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
and they were just trying to do it immediately.

2432
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,560
So you like got everybody in the building to be like, hey, this is illegal.

2433
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,560
You can't do that.

2434
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,560
So they waited and then when they finally announced they were raising the rent,

2435
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,560
they raised it $150.

2436
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,560
Okay, cool.

2437
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,560
It's like, well, you can't prove that's retaliation, but that pretty much is retaliation.

2438
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,560
Go fuck yourself.

2439
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,560
Sucks.

2440
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,560
Sucks.

2441
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,560
If only, I don't know.

2442
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,560
I saw a comment on Twitter that it was like, it's hard to complain about your landlord,

2443
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,560
because if you come on Twitter and you say, my landlord is doing this,

2444
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,560
someone in the replies will be like, they can't do that.

2445
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,560
That's illegal.

2446
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:17,560
They just can't do that.

2447
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,560
And it's like, yup.

2448
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,560
I know, but they're doing it.

2449
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,560
It's like, yes.

2450
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:25,560
They're just doing it.

2451
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,560
And yet, here we are.

2452
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,560
What are you supposed to do?

2453
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,560
Call the police?

2454
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,560
I guess you literally just have to take him to court over it.

2455
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
You literally have to fucking lawyer up.

2456
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,560
If you want to be like, hey landlord, you can't do that.

2457
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,560
And they're like, yes, I can.

2458
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,560
I mean, that's case scenario.

2459
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,560
If you get into a tiff with your landlord, you just do, you know,

2460
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,560
remember that fucking thing that I did where they were having the dispute with the landlord

2461
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,560
and I just lived in their house when they weren't paying rent

2462
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,560
because they were in the legal dispute over whether they had to pay it or not.

2463
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:59,560
And they just didn't pay rent for six months and then they left.

2464
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,560
Just do that.

2465
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,560
Literally.

2466
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,560
Here's the strat.

2467
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,560
Here's the strat.

2468
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,560
Move into a place.

2469
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,560
Be like, hey landlord, you did something illegal.

2470
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,560
It doesn't matter if they did.

2471
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,560
Make something up.

2472
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,560
Be like, yeah, this place doesn't have to code.

2473
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
I've taken you to court.

2474
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,560
And then you go, okay, guess we'll lawyer up.

2475
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,560
And then you spend the next six months in court.

2476
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,560
You don't pay, you don't pay lease.

2477
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,560
And then it's like, okay, well, your case is dismissed.

2478
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,560
And you're like, oh, well, bye.

2479
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Repeat.

2480
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,560
So you pay, you pay off the legal fees.

2481
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:32,560
And then you pay the early termination fee for your lease.

2482
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,560
I mean, well, hell, I mean, since it's just a sham case anyway.

2483
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,560
No, don't even pay a lawyer.

2484
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,560
Don't even pay a lawyer yourself.

2485
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,560
Just, just, just file, literally just file the paperwork yourself.

2486
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,560
Never show up to any of your court dates.

2487
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,560
Get them, just get them delayed as much as you can.

2488
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:50,560
And when they finally are like, well, he's not showing up case dismissed.

2489
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,560
You go, well, scams over.

2490
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,560
Time to, let's go find the next one.

2491
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,560
Well, I guess, Ben, try it out and let us know how it goes.

2492
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,560
I will.

2493
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,560
I fucking will.

2494
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,560
Don't.

2495
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:10,560
Surely if that happens at enough times, you will be known infamously as the guy who gets what he wants and the landlords don't get anything.

2496
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,560
As the guy who's the guy who fucking wins, as the guy who's fucking king.

2497
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,560
And then nobody will ever let you go into a building ever again.

2498
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,560
They, they, what are they going to do?

2499
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,560
What are they going to do?

2500
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:21,560
What are they going to do?

2501
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:25,560
Go on like r slash landlord reddit and just be like, watch out for this one guy.

2502
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,560
Look out, it's Ben, the Boston border.

2503
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,560
Going from place to place.

2504
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,560
The Boston, the Boston squatter.

2505
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:36,560
The, the, the slob, the slob squatter over here.

2506
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
Uh, uh, there, what are they going to do?

2507
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:39,560
Nothing.

2508
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,560
They don't fucking know.

2509
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,560
They don't know how to fucking, they will fucking hit them.

2510
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:49,560
The next voicemail is called Harold three, two, one, go.

2511
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:54,560
Hello, it is I, Harold Henry.

2512
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:06,560
Our landlord came by and wanted me to remind you that rent is due on the third, payable in ectoplasms.

2513
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,560
Slime coins can no longer be accepted.

2514
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,560
No.

2515
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,560
As the bank has run out of the necessary conversion catalysts.

2516
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,560
That's not, that's Unpog.

2517
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,560
No, no, what am I going to do with all these stacks of slime coin?

2518
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,560
I gotta liquidate them.

2519
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,560
Literally.

2520
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,560
Literally.

2521
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,560
Yes.

2522
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,560
Into ectoplasm.

2523
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:34,560
Literally must melt them down into slime and then convert the slime through some arcane process into ectoplasm, I guess.

2524
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,560
Is ectoplasm a thing in Endless War now?

2525
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
No.

2526
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,560
You bust ghosts and you get it?

2527
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,560
I mean it, I mean in the sense that ghosts are a thing.

2528
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,560
Yeah, sure.

2529
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,560
There is ectoplasm.

2530
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,560
If we assume that that's what they're made of.

2531
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,560
What about human plasm?

2532
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,560
What about ectocooler?

2533
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,560
That's the real, the real winner there.

2534
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,560
Why can't you buy ectocooler in Endless War?

2535
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,560
You can.

2536
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,560
Oh.

2537
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,560
Wait, is slimer, is slimer, is slimer a juvie or is he a state ed?

2538
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
He's a ghost and yet he's made of slime.

2539
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:13,560
Like what a, what a, he's the two, he's such a dichotomy.

2540
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,560
The universe is crumbling.

2541
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,560
The dichotomy of man.

2542
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:17,560
He's the ultimate paradox.

2543
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,560
Stay slime, that's what he is.

2544
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,560
We gotta, we gotta add slimer to Endless War.

2545
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,560
We gotta add slimer.

2546
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:31,560
There's just, he represents too much of like a, it's like, you know, it's like, it's like Knights of the Old Republic.

2547
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:39,560
The story of Knights of the Old Republic is they, the story of that game and those games is they took the setting of, of Star Wars and they like asked questions.

2548
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,560
They were like, why is the setting like this?

2549
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:42,560
Does this even make sense?

2550
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,560
Well, let's make the story about all these characters that, that are questioning, like why are the Jedi the good guys?

2551
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,560
Are the Jedi the good guys?

2552
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,560
What does it mean?

2553
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,560
Why do they sit through what they do?

2554
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,560
What is the ramifications of all these things?

2555
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,560
This is what we gotta do with slimer.

2556
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,560
Putting slimer into Endless War raises the questions.

2557
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,560
What even is, what even is slime?

2558
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,560
What even is it to be, to be dead?

2559
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,560
What even is, is, is anything anymore?

2560
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,560
Is there even a meaningful difference?

2561
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,560
It's, it's, you gotta live the questions.

2562
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,560
You gotta live the questions.

2563
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,560
Okay, next one is called.

2564
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,560
I am so hard.

2565
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,560
Three, two, one, go.

2566
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:23,560
Ah, ah, ah, hello, BCP.

2567
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,560
I hope you're having a wonderful podcast.

2568
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,560
I'm having a good one, thank you.

2569
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,560
I'm having a good one, thank you.

2570
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,560
I'm just over here reveling in my power.

2571
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,560
Is this Tommy J?

2572
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:48,560
Knowing that at any moment I could ruin the voicemail segment by sending in hundreds and hundreds of voicemail with only fast noises.

2573
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,560
He's drunk on power.

2574
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,560
Of course.

2575
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,560
I would never do that.

2576
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,560
I love the voicemail scene.

2577
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
Yes, me too.

2578
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,560
Be ashamed.

2579
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,560
Be ashamed.

2580
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:08,560
If I choose to do so, and that gets me so hard.

2581
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,560
Well, you're welcome.

2582
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,560
The laugh at the beginning made me think of the count from Sesame Street saying all that.

2583
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,560
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

2584
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:19,560
Right?

2585
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,560
Let's have a laugh.

2586
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,560
Yes.

2587
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:23,560
Um, well, I'm glad you're having a good time.

2588
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:30,560
The next one is called hashtag general strike, and there's a link to http colon slash slash octoberstrike.com.

2589
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:31,560
Let's give that a listen.

2590
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,560
Three, two, one, go.

2591
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:44,560
So some people are organizing a general strike in the United States starting on October 15th, and I'm tired and stupid, so I can't really appraise the efficacy of it.

2592
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,560
But I feel like more people should know about it, you know?

2593
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,560
Hmm.

2594
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,560
Generals, what does it mean to be a general strike?

2595
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,560
Like, everybody just stops working?

2596
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,560
Yeah, I think that's the idea.

2597
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,560
The entire labor market goes on strike.

2598
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,560
The whole of America just stops?

2599
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,560
Yeah, I mean, that's the idea.

2600
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,560
I mean, it's pretty ambitious.

2601
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,560
What would they do if that happens?

2602
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,560
What would they say to the higher ups?

2603
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,560
Fix things or your money stops.

2604
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,560
But like, there should be a purpose for the strike, right?

2605
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,560
Like, we want better this or that.

2606
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,560
I'm sure the website probably clarifies what their goals are.

2607
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,560
Well, I'm trying to go to the website and it's not loading for me.

2608
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,560
Oh, no.

2609
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,560
It's dead before it started.

2610
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:34,560
It might be my computer that's...

2611
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,560
What is a general strike?

2612
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:42,560
A general strike is a strike action in which a substantial population of the total labor force in a city, region, or country participates.

2613
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,560
General strikers are characterized by the participation of workers in a multitude of workplaces and tend to involve entire communities.

2614
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:53,560
General strikes first occurred in the mid-19th century and have characterized many historically important strikes.

2615
01:38:53,560 --> 01:39:05,560
Our goals, 25% corporate tax rate, no loopholes, free healthcare for all, 12 weeks paid paternity and maternity leave, $20 minimum wage, 4-day work week, stricter environmental regulations on corporations.

2616
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:11,560
If you support any of our goals, stand in solidarity with us on October 15th by taking off work.

2617
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:14,560
Um, yeah.

2618
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:20,560
I mean, all good, very, very harsh changes.

2619
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,560
Um, good luck my dudes.

2620
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:24,560
It's ambitious.

2621
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,560
I mean, you gotta aim high.

2622
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,560
Sure.

2623
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,560
You gotta aim high.

2624
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,560
You gotta ask for a lot.

2625
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,560
It's all about setting your anchor.

2626
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,560
And then when you negotiate.

2627
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,560
Yeah, so you can cut some of those back.

2628
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,560
Yeah, and be like, okay.

2629
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,560
Well, all right.

2630
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,560
Not 20.

2631
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,560
Okay, well 15.

2632
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:39,560
15 minimum wage.

2633
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:46,560
I mean, the hard part is getting the numbers because everybody would be like, yeah, I guess I could do the strike, but I don't want to lose my job.

2634
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,560
I don't want to get fired.

2635
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,560
So I won't.

2636
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,560
And then most people think that and most people don't.

2637
01:39:50,560 --> 01:40:00,560
I, I, it's, it's, I would really, I would really like it for something like this to successfully happen.

2638
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:05,560
And I would really, really like it if it were to have the intended effect.

2639
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:11,560
I, I guess I, it seems, it seems ambitious.

2640
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,560
What am I trying to say?

2641
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,560
It seems, seems like a lot to hope for.

2642
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,560
But I mean, I don't know.

2643
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,560
I don't want to be, I don't want to be a do-more about it.

2644
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:26,560
The bare minimum, the bare minimum of just mentioning it wouldn't really be enough to make it happen.

2645
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,560
You'd need to do a lot of convincing, I think.

2646
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,560
Yeah.

2647
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,560
I don't know what about it at all.

2648
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,560
I'm not even in America.

2649
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,560
I would, I mean, um, I don't know.

2650
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,560
Maybe I should, maybe it's worth like spreading awareness.

2651
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,560
Like, yeah, general straight.

2652
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,560
It's pretty cool.

2653
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:46,560
I just, I don't, I don't think most people, I don't think most people, even if they agree with these things are going to do it.

2654
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,560
I just don't think people are going to do it.

2655
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:56,560
Well, even if one out of 100 people who saw your tweet did it, you're still contributing slightly towards the effectiveness of the action.

2656
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,560
You got to get critical mass.

2657
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,560
Sounding pretty doomer logic over their band.

2658
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:07,560
Do you think people are going to go to their boss and be like, hey boss, I am not coming into work on the 15th because it is a general strike.

2659
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,560
I am on strike for one day along with the rest of the country.

2660
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,560
So there.

2661
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:21,560
What you should do is be like, hey boss, I'm striking tomorrow and you should strike too because your boss is putting the fucking screws to you as well.

2662
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,560
That's true.

2663
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,560
It's just, it's so general.

2664
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:32,560
I think the thing is you need, you need people to be convinced that most of the rest of the people are doing it.

2665
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,560
Yeah.

2666
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,560
Somehow.

2667
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,560
Yeah.

2668
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:42,560
Because if you can't get everybody under the impression that everybody else is going to do it, everybody's going to think, well, I don't want to be the only person doing it.

2669
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,560
Yeah.

2670
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,560
And then nobody does anything.

2671
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:52,560
The other thing about it is that it's not, you're not, you're not striking from your job and you're telling your job, but here's what I want you to do.

2672
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,560
You're striking from your job and being like, it's not really about you.

2673
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,560
This is something I want the government to do.

2674
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:06,560
And it's like, I do understand, it's not that I don't understand how one affects the other, but it's like indirect.

2675
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:13,560
It's like, I'm striking against my job, not because I want my job to do anything different, but because I want the government to do something different.

2676
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:19,560
Well, I suppose the goals that they're stating don't technically have to be enforced by law.

2677
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:24,560
Like you could have companies enforce these policies themselves.

2678
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:31,560
They won't, obviously, because they're cesspools of evil.

2679
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,560
I appreciate.

2680
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:48,560
I've just sort of heard that smaller strikes with a single company are more efficient or more effective at actually happening because it's reasonably possible to get the majority of the people in the company on your side.

2681
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:55,560
But depending on the side of the country, if you're trying to do a country-wide thing, so many things need to fall into place.

2682
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:04,560
Definitely necessary and we're long past the point where we should be in the streets with pitchforks, hungry and thirsty for blood.

2683
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,560
However, I don't think culturally we're there yet.

2684
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:14,560
I think we need another decade of being absolutely dumped on before we get to that point.

2685
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:28,560
America is so pacified and so docile that it would take literal destitution of everybody for things to actually get to that point where it's like, I guess I'll ride in the streets because I don't have a house to go to anymore.

2686
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,560
That's when it'll start.

2687
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,560
Yeah, pretty much.

2688
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:40,560
Yeah, things could be a lot better.

2689
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,560
They need to get a lot worse first.

2690
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,560
Until they get a lot worse, there's not hunger for it.

2691
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,560
As long as you can get yours, your tiny little table scraps.

2692
01:43:53,560 --> 01:44:02,560
I appreciate the audacity. I appreciate the boldness of the four-day work week.

2693
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
I appreciate them including that.

2694
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:11,560
We need to start an October strike where we have to get in there and be like, look, we want all of our bosses.

2695
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:18,560
Government mandated that our bosses with their big corporate accounts have to retweet us, not just like.

2696
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:26,560
I feel like a perfectly organized society increases the amount of automation it has.

2697
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:32,560
It decreases the amount of human labor that needs to be done and as that happens, the work week shrinks and shrinks.

2698
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:41,560
The average person just needs to work less. Labor just goes down to nothing and eventually everything is automated and there is no work week.

2699
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:45,560
We have luxury, fully automated, gay luxury space communism.

2700
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,560
They'll find ways.

2701
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,560
Because with the industrial revolution, there was already talk back then.

2702
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:58,560
The four-day work week seems like an acknowledgement of that is the direction that we should move it, even if it's not going to happen.

2703
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,560
But I like that they're acknowledging that is the goal.

2704
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:07,560
We've been able to do that for decades and we haven't because there's a vested interest in keeping people enslaved at their desks.

2705
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,560
There's a culture of work.

2706
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:21,560
If you aren't working nine to five, five days a week, then you're weird and that's bad and that's deviant behavior and that's just what people should do.

2707
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:25,560
To be out here being like, no, actually it would be better if people worked less.

2708
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,560
Some people literally don't see it that way. Some people don't think that's true.

2709
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,560
I'm glad they're calling it like it is.

2710
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,560
Less work is better, actually.

2711
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,560
I don't know.

2712
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,560
Maybe I'll retweet this and be like, general strike is good. I like it.

2713
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,560
I don't have a boss, so I can't strike.

2714
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:53,560
It's strange how people will simultaneously be rise and grind and work smarter, not harder.

2715
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:57,560
Those don't really work together.

2716
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,560
Work less, not harder.

2717
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,560
That's a movement I can get behind.

2718
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,560
Yeah, yeah.

2719
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:16,560
Next voicemail is called, it's one of these fucking fast upload. What is this?

2720
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,560
Why is there another site? Why is this happening?

2721
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,560
They're not over a minute and a half.

2722
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,560
How to use the internet.

2723
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:30,560
There's some reason you can do voice modulation or something.

2724
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,560
People can do voice modulation, maybe it's easier.

2725
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,560
I know it's possible through a speak pipe, but whatever.

2726
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,560
This one is called snitch.

2727
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,560
Three, two, one, go.

2728
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,560
I love drawcast. I think it's the peak of your content.

2729
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,560
I've saved every drawcast and quick draw onto my hard drive, just in case.

2730
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:54,560
However, while doing that, I've noticed some people called procrastinators anonymous

2731
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,560
using the title PCP drawcast for their videos.

2732
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:02,560
They seem like soulless Twitter addicts, even more so than you.

2733
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,560
You should sue them for copyright.

2734
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,560
I think we'll get our lawyers on that immediately.

2735
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:15,560
They've turned that into the good pro and on people have taken that

2736
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:20,560
and turned it into its own channel, which is what I was on for the teleproto.

2737
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,560
That channel is mine too much.

2738
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,560
That channel is called the drawcast, and that's not really a copyrightable name.

2739
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:29,560
It's not called the PCP drawcast, is it?

2740
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,560
That would be weird.

2741
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,560
I don't believe so. I think it's just the drawcast.

2742
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,560
That's like what the logo says on everything.

2743
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,560
Unless there's something else that this person is talking about.

2744
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,560
They definitely aped the style because they do the thing in some of the earlier episodes

2745
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,560
where it's like, oh, the only people who are worth it down, the ones that can draw.

2746
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,560
That's the thing that Munchie came up with.

2747
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,560
Oh, they say that.

2748
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,560
Whatever.

2749
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,560
That's funny.

2750
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,560
Honestly, I appreciate it because we don't do them anymore.

2751
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:58,560
Munchie deleted all of his content, so all of those catchphrases went into the public domain.

2752
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,560
That's just the rules.

2753
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,560
Yeah, true.

2754
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:08,560
It's just like in corporate law, when the person that created a work abandons it,

2755
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:14,560
when they die or they leave, it immediately goes to public domain

2756
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,560
and is owned by culture from then on.

2757
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,560
The thing about it is that...

2758
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,560
That's the law, right?

2759
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,560
Yeah, definitely.

2760
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:26,560
It would be crazy.

2761
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,560
Can you imagine?

2762
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:34,560
If some company still owned characters that were made up by dead people hundreds of years ago

2763
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,560
and they were still not public domain private property, that would be outlandish.

2764
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,560
That sounds like you need a general strike or something to fix that.

2765
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,560
True.

2766
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,560
The thing with the show is that it's just people drawing.

2767
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:56,560
They're drawn together and it's timed little attempts at certain themes

2768
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:02,560
and it's like the title is the least important part of the thing.

2769
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,560
I don't really mind people using the title or even the theme.

2770
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,560
You can't copyright a show where you just draw with friends.

2771
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,560
True.

2772
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,560
Yeah.

2773
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,560
So it doesn't matter.

2774
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,560
We can just start doing them and continue to call them a draw cast if we want it to.

2775
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,560
We could.

2776
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,560
They can co-exist.

2777
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,560
Did we ever release the draw cast that we did three years ago with just drawing with a mouse?

2778
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,560
I remember we recorded that.

2779
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,560
I don't think it ever got posted.

2780
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,560
Wait, what, really?

2781
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:28,560
I don't know if it did.

2782
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,560
I don't remember it ever getting posted.

2783
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,560
Do we have an unreleased draw cast?

2784
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,560
I don't have the footage for it anymore.

2785
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,560
I had to get rid of it a long time ago.

2786
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,560
So if it's gone, it's gone like the ages.

2787
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,560
But I remember we did a bunch of...

2788
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,560
Would it have been a quick draw or a draw cast?

2789
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,560
Oh, God.

2790
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:48,560
Because I feel like we must have put all the draw casts out because we started doing quick draw afterwards.

2791
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,560
It's so long ago.

2792
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:52,560
I can't remember if it was a draw cast or a quick draw.

2793
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,560
Oh, well.

2794
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,560
It doesn't matter.

2795
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:00,560
I don't think I was on that because I don't remember doing a drawing with a mouse challenge.

2796
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,560
Did I?

2797
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:02,560
Am I crazy?

2798
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,560
I'm not sure.

2799
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:04,560
It's so long ago.

2800
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,560
I have no idea.

2801
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,560
It's just like a vague recollection.

2802
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,560
I just remember the files just been sitting on my Google Drive for years up until like 18

2803
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:12,560
months ago.

2804
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,560
I was like, you know what?

2805
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,560
I don't think these are ever going to be used.

2806
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,560
I don't need to hold onto them anymore.

2807
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,560
Would it have been Eleazar, been the editor at that time?

2808
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:22,560
I don't know.

2809
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,560
Would he have maybe the file?

2810
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,560
Maybe we could ask him.

2811
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,560
Someone in the comments might be like, oh, that was posted years ago.

2812
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,560
You idiot.

2813
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,560
And then I'll look stupid, which is definitely possible.

2814
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:33,560
If you know what we're talking about posting the comments, if you don't say no, you never

2815
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,560
posted it, lol.

2816
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,560
And then, okay.

2817
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:43,560
Next voicemail is an image.

2818
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,560
If you see this here, it is the Virgin American poo versus the Chad Soviet poo.

2819
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:54,560
And I got to say, this American poo is looking kind of piglet-ish.

2820
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,560
He's looking a bit piglet-y.

2821
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,560
Those ears don't look right.

2822
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,560
He's absolutely piglet-y.

2823
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,560
They're not round.

2824
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:02,560
They're not round.

2825
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,560
The body is shaped like piglet.

2826
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,560
It's very piglet.

2827
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:06,560
Unnatural jaundice color.

2828
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,560
Disney owns his soul.

2829
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,560
Does stupid shit that's not even in the original books.

2830
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,560
The Chad Soviet poo.

2831
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,560
He's round.

2832
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:14,560
He's brown.

2833
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,560
He's down to clown.

2834
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,560
I'll post the image here.

2835
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,560
That is a bulletproof argument.

2836
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,560
Have you guys seen Soviet poo?

2837
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:24,560
No.

2838
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,560
There's a Russian version of Winnie the Pooh and he looks like this.

2839
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:33,560
Well, let me find it on YouTube.

2840
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:37,560
Russian poo bear.

2841
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:40,560
That's dangerous search by itself.

2842
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,560
Here we go.

2843
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,560
Copy link.

2844
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,560
Post it right here.

2845
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,560
There.

2846
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:48,560
Winnie the Pooh Russian animation.

2847
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,560
He's got crayon backgrounds.

2848
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,560
It might not literally be poo, because it doesn't look like him.

2849
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,560
Maybe he's called poo, but it's technically a distinct character.

2850
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:00,560
Oh, no.

2851
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,560
I see a pig.

2852
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,560
Yeah, he's got a little pig friend.

2853
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,560
Yeah, it's all the same characters.

2854
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:09,560
They just all look completely different.

2855
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,560
This is the exact same story of Winnie the Pooh.

2856
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:14,560
Winnie is stuck on the balloon.

2857
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,560
Yeah.

2858
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:21,560
Do you think they just adapted the books?

2859
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,560
Maybe.

2860
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,560
It is kind of awesome.

2861
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:26,560
Do you think they just adapted the books?

2862
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,560
Do you think they just did it without the rights?

2863
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,560
Or do you think they also bought the rights to animate the books?

2864
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,560
I'm sure the Chad Soviets were like,

2865
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,560
this shit should have been in the public domain years ago

2866
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,560
and just took it and did it, because they were fucking cool like that.

2867
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,560
This is really nicely animated.

2868
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:46,560
The animation is unironically great.

2869
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,560
I mean, the Soviet Union, they were communist,

2870
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,560
so was that their thing?

2871
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,560
Were they like, everything is public domain?

2872
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,560
We don't respect copyright law.

2873
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,560
Oh, dude, Rabbit looks sick.

2874
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,560
It would make sense.

2875
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,560
Wait, where's...

2876
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,560
I just trumped 1856.

2877
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:03,560
Rabbit, it's got glasses.

2878
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:05,560
He looks fucking cool.

2879
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,560
Oh, um...

2880
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,560
Yeah, this is like the exact plot of it.

2881
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,560
He gets stuck in there and everything.

2882
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,560
It looks like the combination of Arthur and his boyfriend.

2883
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,560
Look at this nerd.

2884
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,560
Look at this fucking nerd.

2885
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,560
Do it yet.

2886
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,560
Yet.

2887
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,560
Dude, this is awesome.

2888
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,560
It kind of is.

2889
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,560
Yeah.

2890
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,560
Well, okay.

2891
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,560
We probably shouldn't spend the whole...

2892
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,560
Absolutely Chad.

2893
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:28,560
Agreed.

2894
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,560
Yeah, yeah.

2895
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,560
I thought I was thinking it was a joke like, ha ha.

2896
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:32,560
Goofy.

2897
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,560
It's funny to say Chad Soviet poo is the Chad one when he's all...

2898
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,560
But actually, he kind of is.

2899
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,560
He's great.

2900
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:41,560
I've been won over.

2901
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:44,560
Next one is called...

2902
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,560
The image is...

2903
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Here we go.

2904
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:50,560
It's Kanga Mage.

2905
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,560
Kanga Mage.

2906
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,560
There she is.

2907
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,560
As requested by Nate on episode 141.

2908
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,560
That's a while.

2909
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,560
I don't even remember.

2910
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,560
I do not remember the context.

2911
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,560
But I'm sure it's true.

2912
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,560
I'll send it over to her, I guess.

2913
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:13,560
I'm sure Nate will be excited to see that his dream has been fulfilled.

2914
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,560
Definitely add him on Twitter and see if he remembers.

2915
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:21,560
Was this because we were talking about her OC that is some fucking mammal that nobody knows what it is,

2916
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:24,560
and maybe Nate thought it was a kangaroo?

2917
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,560
That sounds very plausible.

2918
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,560
Yeah, it's like a big ears long thin tail with a fluff at the end.

2919
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:31,560
Yeah, I don't remember what...

2920
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:32,560
The animal.

2921
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,560
It's a real animal and I don't remember what it's called.

2922
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,560
Chinchilla?

2923
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,560
No, could it?

2924
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:39,560
No, it's not a chinchilla.

2925
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Some weird shit.

2926
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,560
A wibbly mouse.

2927
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,560
Some sort of a mouse.

2928
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,560
Yes.

2929
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,560
Next voicemail.

2930
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,560
Okay, we're back to actual voicemails.

2931
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,560
The next one is called Not Petan.

2932
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,560
Three, two, one, go.

2933
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:02,560
Besides having your head crushed, what is the most disturbing thought or idea?

2934
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,560
How do I even begin to answer that?

2935
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,560
That's like a whole dissertation.

2936
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:11,560
I mean, there's so much.

2937
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:17,560
The whole finiteness in both time and space.

2938
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:21,560
That's too abstract to get actually upset about.

2939
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:22,560
Really?

2940
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:23,560
Speak for yourself.

2941
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,560
Yeah, that's the source of constant, unending, intracensual dread.

2942
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,560
The universe is so big and I'm so small, but who cares?

2943
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:31,560
I'm hungry.

2944
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:32,560
Cool.

2945
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,560
I mean, me too.

2946
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:37,560
I mean, sure.

2947
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,560
No, I don't agree, but I don't agree, but I respect it.

2948
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:47,560
That's part of the dread, understanding the absolute massive implications of such a thing,

2949
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,560
but your simple flesh brain is just like, oh, but I want food.

2950
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,560
No, I have this huge problem.

2951
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,560
I like that.

2952
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:56,560
It's terrifying.

2953
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,560
I'm a funny sack of flesh.

2954
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,560
I'm a meatbag.

2955
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,560
Gross, disgusting.

2956
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,560
We need to transcend.

2957
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:08,560
I'm like, damn, in time, there was a time before I existed.

2958
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,560
There will be a time after I exist in the dimensions.

2959
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,560
So deep.

2960
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:17,560
Left of me, right of me, up and down and forward and back, there is space in which I don't exist.

2961
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:24,560
I'm only inside of this little bubble of time and space and everything outside of that is not me.

2962
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,560
And soon, that's all that will be left.

2963
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:36,560
And I'm like, I don't want, if I were to go, if I were to go, if I were to travel, like, I don't know,

2964
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,560
if I go next door or like in the house, in that room next over for me, it's like, I don't exist over there.

2965
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,560
There is no me over there.

2966
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,560
And I'm like, I'm only here.

2967
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:47,560
And I'm only now.

2968
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:49,560
I don't know.

2969
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,560
Take my Minecraft shovel.

2970
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,560
Digs two block hole, buries you as you think.

2971
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,560
By the way, I'm not clapping because there's a fly that is my ass cheeks.

2972
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:07,560
I'm jumping, I'm doing jumping jacks.

2973
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,560
Next question?

2974
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,560
There's a few left.

2975
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:15,560
Okay, next one is Simpsons question.

2976
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,560
Three, two, one, go.

2977
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:21,560
Ben, Gib, you know a lot about the Simpsons and I know nothing about the Simpsons.

2978
01:57:21,560 --> 01:57:23,560
When does it get bad?

2979
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,560
And I don't mean goes downhill.

2980
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,560
I mean, like, gets bad, unwatchable.

2981
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,560
Please answer.

2982
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:36,560
I have heard that it actually, it gets pretty bad for a while.

2983
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:42,560
I mean, it starts to go downhill like around season, maybe like eight or nine.

2984
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:47,560
And then by season 10, it's like, it's moved into like, okay, this is no longer really the original show.

2985
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:54,560
And then it basically just gets progressively worse and worse until like season like late 20s.

2986
01:57:54,560 --> 01:58:03,560
And then I've heard that it actually sort of starts to get a little more watchable in like the very late seasons because I think it just sort of leans into being what it is now,

2987
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:09,560
instead of like doing as much of like a hollow mimicry of like the old version.

2988
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:17,560
But that's just what I've heard because I haven't, I've watched it up to around season, maybe 17, 18.

2989
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:22,560
And I mean, I guess I thought it was still pretty all right at the time.

2990
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:27,560
Yeah, I remember watching, being like, I wonder when it gets bad.

2991
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:34,560
And I got to like season 20 and I was like, oh, maybe I don't know how to tell when Simpsons is bad.

2992
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:40,560
You know, the consensus is that classic Simpsons is around up to season 10 or so.

2993
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:43,560
And then I was enjoying myself.

2994
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,560
So I don't know.

2995
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:45,560
It's just good.

2996
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:46,560
This is a good show.

2997
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,560
People get too bent out of shape about it.

2998
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:54,560
I don't remember thinking it was bad in seasons like, in seasons like like 17, 18.

2999
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:59,560
I know, and I haven't really even watched that much of it past that.

3000
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:01,560
So I genuinely have no idea.

3001
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:05,560
It sort of goes from like, oh, Simpsons is like every episode is a banger.

3002
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,560
Everyone is like killer 10 out of 10.

3003
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:08,560
Yeah.

3004
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:12,560
And then it goes into, occasionally there's an actually kind of annoying one.

3005
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,560
And then that just sort of increases the amount of annoying episodes.

3006
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:18,560
But like, yeah, it's just, I think it's generally pretty good.

3007
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,560
It's a slow decline after the classic era.

3008
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:26,560
It's not like, it's not like it completely goes over a cliff in any like one.

3009
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,560
I mean, you know, people say like the Frank Grimes episode and the mod.

3010
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:36,560
People say the Frank Grimes episode and the mod episode were like, oh, that's when it jumped the shark.

3011
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:41,560
But like, it's not like the show, it was different, was immediately different after those.

3012
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:47,560
Those are just like the first times that some people were like, that episode kind of annoyed me.

3013
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:50,560
And then later there would be more episodes that people would find annoying.

3014
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,560
I thought Frank Grimes was a good one.

3015
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:55,560
It's, people fight it.

3016
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,560
Is it contentious?

3017
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,560
Yeah.

3018
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:02,560
It's contentious because people think that it's like mean spirited and they think it's the start of like Homer is,

3019
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:08,560
Homer is basically like irredeemable and he's not, he's not likable at all in that episode.

3020
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,560
And it just, I think a lot of people don't like that.

3021
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,560
And Homer has a likability problem later on.

3022
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:19,560
He becomes jerk ass Homer where he's just, he's just an asshole and an idiot.

3023
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,560
And like, that's supposed to be the joke.

3024
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:26,560
But people like, oh, I kind of thought he was like a lovable oaf, not just like a fucking piece of shit.

3025
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,560
But it's like, in that episode, he's like terrible.

3026
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:32,560
So people say like, this is the start of jerk ass Homer.

3027
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,560
But it's not, it's not a bad episode.

3028
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:38,560
It's just has a tone to it.

3029
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,560
I think some people weren't expecting.

3030
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:47,560
It's also like, it's also very cult of work-y.

3031
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:50,560
Like in that episode, you're supposed to be rooting for Grimes.

3032
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:55,560
And Grimes' whole thing is like, work is good.

3033
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:02,560
And like the guy who wrote it, there's a Renegade cut video about that episode.

3034
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,560
And the guy who wrote it is like a pretty conservative guy.

3035
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,560
And when you really think about the themes of that episode, it's like,

3036
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,560
like poverty is good actually.

3037
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:18,560
Like literally like raising yourself up by your bootstraps is good.

3038
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,560
The American way of life is like degenerate.

3039
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:25,560
It's like two Americans are soft because they don't have it hard enough.

3040
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,560
Struggle builds character.

3041
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:32,560
That's kind of the whole sort of attitude behind it.

3042
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,560
It's very libertarian in a way.

3043
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,560
I don't know.

3044
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,560
Okay, I guess that's all I have to say about it.

3045
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:44,560
Next episode is called, I never received the body.

3046
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,560
Three, two, one, go.

3047
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:49,560
It has been one week.

3048
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,560
And I have not received Tommy J's body.

3049
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,560
He must be getting hungry.

3050
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:03,560
I tried contacting Amazon customer support.

3051
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:10,560
But they thought that I was a child pulling a break phone call.

3052
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:17,560
I don't even know what a break phone call is.

3053
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:22,560
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

3054
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:32,560
There is a way that I think I can still survive.

3055
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:36,560
I need a spark.

3056
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:41,560
A spark from a saver.

3057
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:47,560
That will inspire me to go on.

3058
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:54,560
A spark from a saver held by a better Tom.

3059
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,560
I saw me on that.

3060
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:02,560
That's the one from power.

3061
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:04,560
I don't know what to help you with.

3062
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,560
I saw me on that.

3063
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:09,560
Got it, got it, yep.

3064
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:15,560
I'm still hungry.

3065
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:17,560
This guy is so fucked.

3066
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,560
He's pretty fucked.

3067
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,560
Someone needs to tell him about Door Dash, like for real.

3068
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:25,560
Tom, you got to help this guy out.

3069
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,560
He's begging you.

3070
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:29,560
I don't know the context.

3071
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,560
He wants it.

3072
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,560
He wants it.

3073
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,560
He wants Tommy Oliver.

3074
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:40,560
No, he wants a spark from a saver held by Tommy Oliver.

3075
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,560
You got to give it to him.

3076
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,560
Is it like a fire keeper soul?

3077
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,560
I need to get a saver spark soul.

3078
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,560
Yes, yes.

3079
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,560
You must ignite.

3080
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:53,560
You need to kill saver spark with his own saver.

3081
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:55,560
Oh, is that like the drop?

3082
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:00,560
You get the spark soul and then like saver spark saver.

3083
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,560
And it's like an agility weapon.

3084
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:06,560
Yes, why not?

3085
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,560
Okay, okay.

3086
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:09,560
Guy, don't worry, we're on it.

3087
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:13,560
I'll look up the tutorial on YouTube and see what I can do.

3088
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,560
We're not going to abandon you, buddy.

3089
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:20,560
We're not going to abandon you like Biden abandoned the troops in Afghanistan.

3090
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,560
Okay, next one is called Gibb Better Than Ben.

3091
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,560
Three, two, one, go.

3092
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,560
Thank you, Gibb, for making sure.

3093
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,560
So let's go up in a timely fashion.

3094
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:34,560
Unlike other certain hosts.

3095
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,560
What?

3096
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,560
You got it wrong.

3097
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:39,560
You got it wrong.

3098
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:42,560
Gibb forgot to list to public the episode.

3099
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,560
It was not my fault.

3100
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,560
But I like that people think it's Ben's fault.

3101
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,560
That's really funny too.

3102
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:51,560
It seems like a Ben's fault.

3103
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:53,560
I mean, you're the head honcho around here apparently.

3104
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:55,560
I guess.

3105
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:57,560
I'm in charge.

3106
02:04:57,560 --> 02:04:59,560
Sure.

3107
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:03,560
Isn't it great that Digi's anime podcast has become Ben's anime podcast?

3108
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:05,560
Ben's communism podcast.

3109
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:10,560
Ben's cultural Marxism podcast based.

3110
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:13,560
You know, it couldn't have ended any other way.

3111
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:17,560
Yeah, thanks Gibb.

3112
02:05:17,560 --> 02:05:21,560
Next one is called Ben is a cave rapist.

3113
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:24,560
Three, two, one, go.

3114
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:32,560
So I was in DC this week and we went to the exhibit on early humans.

3115
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:42,560
And in regards to like the wandering vagrant sexual predator caveman topic from last week.

3116
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,560
Yes.

3117
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:49,560
There was a cave called the Cindy Har Cave, I believe, in Iran.

3118
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:51,560
That sounds familiar.

3119
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:57,560
With evidence of family units in cave and Neanderthal days.

3120
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:58,560
Yeah.

3121
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:04,560
And it definitely backs up Ben, sadly.

3122
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:05,560
Wait, what?

3123
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:08,560
I don't know if that really proves my point.

3124
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,560
Families doesn't like imply pornography.

3125
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:19,560
Yeah, I'm not really sure what the proof.

3126
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:22,560
I'm not really sure why this is proof of what I was saying.

3127
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:33,560
I mean, I mentioned family units and that probably family units would have like defended their women from like rape, for instance.

3128
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:36,560
Yeah.

3129
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:38,560
I mean, yeah.

3130
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:46,560
I mean, my thing was not like, oh, if it wasn't porn, then it must have been everyone was raping, which is what you took it as initially.

3131
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,560
No, that's not exactly what I took it at.

3132
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:59,560
I mean, I mean, I can't remember exactly whatever.

3133
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:02,560
Yeah, I kind of remember, don't exactly remember the details.

3134
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,560
It's fine.

3135
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:08,560
Tom, what do you think about caveman rape?

3136
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,560
You pro or anti?

3137
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:11,560
You pro or anti.

3138
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:14,560
You know, I'm really not literally going to discuss.

3139
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,560
I'm kind of just going to sit on that fence and get nice and comfortable.

3140
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:19,560
I'm just trying to grill over here.

3141
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:20,560
The centrist take, I did.

3142
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,560
I'm just trying to grill in my cave.

3143
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,560
Yeah, seriously.

3144
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:28,560
Next one is called Riley Gazers.

3145
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,560
Three, two, one, go.

3146
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:38,560
Hi, this is Riley from the broadcast of yig, yig, yig, yig, yig, yig, yig, yig, yig, yig.

3147
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,560
Void, void, void.

3148
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,560
Good, good call.

3149
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,560
Good, yeah.

3150
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,560
Good voicemail.

3151
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,560
Thumbs up.

3152
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,560
Next one is called Riley Cyrus.

3153
