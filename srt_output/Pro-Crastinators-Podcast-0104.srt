00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:25,540
guy ever. And today we're joined by Digilomatic Ben Saint. There he is. The slime I can hear

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:42,900
bubbling up deep within my veins. Munchy. Oh wow. What's now? You know. Oh wow. We've got

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:54,180
Tom. Tom Oliver. I'm here. Good. We've got. Oh, okay. We've got Letharora Mage. There's

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,460
a cat on my table, so excuse any cat noises. No furries allowed. The pussy is present. Yeah.

6
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,940
And begin the pussy jokes. And the digital booboo boy. There he is. Hey, I'm here. I'm

7
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,820
trying to recover my mind after a really intense 420 celebration slash Evangelion viewing party.

8
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:24,060
Oh God. It was 420 yesterday. Yeah. Indeed it was. Indeed it was. Did you see that thing

9
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,780
that I tweed you? A clip from Armored Shoebaccon 3 with a filter over a digi? Yes, I saw that.

10
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:35,300
I saw that. Very nice. It was looking good. But nothing about that. Oh shit. Where are they?

11
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,180
Where can we find animals? What are their culture? What can we learn from them? You can find

12
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:51,860
typical animal over on Dictionary Urban Dictionary.com. Dictionary Urban was my favorite

13
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,340
child detective novel as it's set on the mean streets of New York where Dictionary Urban. You

14
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,540
guys know what I'm fucking talking about? There was a cryptic, I remember that, yeah,

15
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,220
from that ancient children's book story. There was lots of mysterious clues left about dipping to

16
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,180
the whip and I had to open up my dictionary urban and find out what the fuck was going on in there.

17
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,340
Listen, this is terrible. Let's get down to our real shit. Is Nate breaking up or do my headphones

18
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,620
just suck dick? Your headphones suck dick. I bet you've got like a $5 one you'd be like oh this

19
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,260
will work. No, they were like 30 bucks and they're garbage. Anyway, I'm derailing. Let's fucking get

20
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,860
in that urban dictionary. The interest for the audience is Ben has been doing the PCP just by

21
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,420
turning his speakers real low this entire time. I've just been turning my speakers really low so

22
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,140
that my mic doesn't pick us up as an echo and it's worked brilliantly. None of you knew. None of

23
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,220
you knew. I fooled you all. You're not wrong. All right, here we go. UrbanDictionary.com. It's

24
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,860
furries, guys. Furries. So here is the top definition of furry. All right, here we go. This is a

25
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:09,100
fucking literary piece on this. Furry. There is no piece for you. There is no one single definition

26
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,220
of what a furry is. Even within the furry fandom, people cannot always agree on just what makes a

27
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,780
person a furry or not. Okay, so this guy's breaking it down. Some would argue that to be a furry,

28
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,900
you must think and talk like one, i.e. use furry specific words and phrases. Even if you go to

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,700
conventions, wear a food fursuit, draw the art, write the stories, etc., but don't talk using furry

30
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,020
lingo. This is one of those things where only within that community would they even... Would there even

31
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,700
be a question? Yeah, for any outsider, it's just like, do you have any interest whatsoever in

32
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:52,620
watching animalized stuff? It's like my old standby. It's like I always say, I may be attracted to

33
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,660
robots, you know, have had sex with a robot, fucked a robot in its tailpipe, you know, be married

34
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,180
to a robot and be exclusively interested in robots sexually, but at least I'm not a goddamn robo-file.

35
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:12,060
Unlike some people. I scroll down and like so many of these definitions of furry are like

36
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,060
incredibly extensive on Urban Dictionary. Because they're all in there trying to do PR damage

37
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:30,500
control. A constant state, a decades long state of society-wide damage control. There's a simpler

38
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,140
one here. I just skipped, some of these are short. Listen, furry, simply one who has interest, small

39
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,500
or large of anthropomorphic animals, animals who have animal colonies, be it simply talking or

40
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,660
having a human-like body. The next one, in the same one it says, one who has interest in

41
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,940
anthropomorphic animals, does not mean wanting to have sex with them. What do you mean it doesn't,

42
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,660
they don't want to have sex with them? That's wrong. This is just incorrect. It's like saying that

43
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,140
bronies don't want to fuck show people. It's the exact same correlation, the exact same thing is

44
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:16,180
like, bronies don't clop, it's not sexual. As hard as it is to believe- As hard as it is to believe,

45
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,300
this is an extremely poorly worded entry on UrbanDictionary.com. To say that it does not mean

46
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,500
wanting to have sex with them, it implies that it means inherently a furry does not want to have

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,340
sex when the fact is you can or cannot. It doesn't define whether or not you're- Is that true?

48
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,100
Is that true? Is what true? They're furries who don't want to have sex with animals.

49
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,540
Do furries exist who go to conventions where fursuits but have no desire to-

50
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,380
Yes, absolutely. Of course there is. Is that true? Yes. Okay. I bet the proportion of

51
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,460
asexuals in the furry community is astronomical. I don't believe in asexuals, but okay, go on.

52
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,020
Okay, okay, let's say our stances, let's say our stances, because this is-

53
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:07,220
You heard me. You may think- What if you just- Nate, that doesn't make any sense, but okay.

54
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,300
I think everyone who says they're asexual is fooling themselves. That's what I-

55
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,300
What about- What if you don't have sex, then what? What's your counter-argument to that?

56
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,900
Are we describing it as a thing that you do or like a state of mind, like a personality trait?

57
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,660
Are we talking about- Oh, fucking hell.

58
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,900
People who don't want to have sex don't exist? Are we talking about that?

59
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,140
Are we talking about literally munchy? Okay, we'll get back to this. We'll get back to the

60
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,060
asexuality question. I hope we don't.

61
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,460
All right, munchy, you have some experience with furries in the world. I do.

62
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,300
Tell us your tale. Tell us your stories. And mind your words.

63
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,260
Oh, I will. My stance, my angle that will be integral to this entire episode, here's my position.

64
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,100
Furries were a joke. They were just a fucking meme that you would punctuate friendly conversation

65
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,500
with your friends with. It would be like, oh, you know, I'm getting a sick frag. I'm killing a

66
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,900
zombie right through his goddamn head. Oh, this is just like what I would do to a furry if I were

67
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:17,060
to see him on the streets. And it was a great time. It was an excellent time. And then due to

68
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,380
circumstances too unlawful and sinful to recreate or reproduce with my words, I was thrusts into

69
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,700
situations where I would be able to not be able to. I was forced to examine furry culture

70
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,740
and lifestyles on like a every other day basis. And it made me realize,

71
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,580
wait a second, furries are real and not like a fictional construct made to make other people

72
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:52,340
laugh at what furries are. And so I had to like examine the furry culture for a while on Twitter.

73
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,380
On Twitter, I made a tweet about how I was going to try and become a furry. And by that I just meant

74
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,860
join furry discords and see what they do. Not to bully, not to bully, but to understand, you know,

75
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,660
like, like, what's this all about? What's going on here? And I have come back with the data. The

76
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:15,620
data is that I am a fucking genius and that furries are all terrible except for the furries that are

77
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,900
great, which are all of them because all furries are great. And I'm a fucking faggot except for

78
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,540
the ones that are shit. And I'm so conflicted and nuanced. I'm so nuanced. Kill me. I want to,

79
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,420
I just want to go back to furries being jokes. I wish they were jokes again. I don't want to think

80
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,620
about them. Dude, this guy got, this guy got nuanced out the ass. This guy got achieved maximum over

81
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,020
nuance. I got strapped. I can't even, I begged my fucking daddy not let me walk and then he

82
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,460
lowered me up with his nuanced knowledge. That's what fucking happened right now.

83
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,500
So yeah, needless to say, like, there's things going on. There's things going on these days as

84
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,140
society progresses and more degenerate elements of society are able to survive on the backs of

85
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,900
people who can actually do things with their lives. Like, like all this kind of shit is just

86
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,460
getting more and more prevalent. You know, what's, what's the deal? How do we, how do we end them

87
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,820
once and for all? Let's go through all our stances. I mean, do you, do you guys all have the lay

88
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:25,860
queries are bad? No, I, but a little bit. I'm pretty, no, but kind of ambivalent. My position

89
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,180
is pure ambivalence. I don't, I don't care for it too much. And in fact, I find a lot of the

90
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:39,780
aesthetic to be pretty, pretty unappealing. Like, like I've, I've seen, I know people who are furry,

91
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,620
so I've seen lots of art and like, how can you not see furry art when you're on the internet?

92
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,780
And like, I'm definitely much more and like, not into it sexually at all, obviously, but, but in

93
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,660
terms of like the aesthetic of like anthropomorphized animals, I definitely swing more towards like,

94
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,060
I like the like Disney sort of thing where it's like, like the classic Disney movies where they

95
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,420
add like humanoid features to animals, but like the weird like furry art where it's like a human

96
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,020
with like paws, that like creeps me out when like it's uncanny valley. Yeah, I'm talking about like,

97
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,860
so, so you prefer that, that like Lion King moment where Nala looks at Simba. Oh, so sexually.

98
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,260
Those aren't even fun. Lion King's not even a furry movie. They're just animals. Yeah. Well,

99
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,700
where's the, that's a good question. Where is the little anthropomorphized? I mean,

100
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,060
I mean, literally your movie sucks. Like that's his third favorite movie on the basis of he wants

101
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,860
to fuck Scar. So like, I would say it's a furry movie on some of them. Wait, wait, why? No, it might

102
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,300
be a movie with furry appeal. It might be a movie with furry appeal, but those characters are, I was

103
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:52,500
saying the Lion King, the YMS considers that his third favorite movie out of his desire to fuck

104
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,980
Scar. Well, you know, unlike YMS, why? Because he's getting the furry before he is a before, you

105
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,020
know, Hitler liked painting. That doesn't mean that painting is a Nazi thing. You know what I'm

106
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,140
saying? Yeah, just because YMS likes to fuck Scar doesn't mean I can also want to fuck Scar. Yeah,

107
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,540
you know, yeah, he could not be labeled a damn dirty furry, you know what I'm saying. Get ready

108
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,220
for this hot JoJo reference. It's like just because Kira from part four of JoJo finds the Mona

109
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,420
Lisa's hands incredibly sexual. Well, I mean, no, not really. It's just that like the bad guy does

110
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,020
find Mona Lisa's hands like overtly sexual and arousing. But that doesn't mean that like it's

111
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,300
an erotic image inherently, like this is him bringing that to the table. Sure, you can convert

112
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,700
anything to any degree if you try hard enough. People have people up there, you know, sexual

113
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,540
all right, guys, indeed, we're kind of getting we're getting off. When are we going to get

114
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,420
poly procrastinators? When are you gonna get like, like, like, like, like polygrams? No,

115
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:00,660
you mean shipping subreddit? That's what I mean. Oh, you mean like between us? Yeah. Oh,

116
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,580
that's why I'm not surprised it hasn't happened right now. Yeah, I'm sure it hasn't happened.

117
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,980
You have set it in motion. We're not. We're not sexy. We're we're losers, you guys.

118
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:23,940
I don't know what you're talking about. You know, gay. Yeah. Okay, okay. Here's some facts. 99%

119
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:30,820
of all procrastinators fans are transsexual. Another one percent are gay. There are no other

120
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,620
do the graphics. That is all basis. That is truer, like, like you say that as a joke, but yeah,

121
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,180
it's true. No, that's actually the truth. Yeah, I know, I know. I mean, I mean, I'm sure there's

122
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,860
there's a lot of trans people. No, no, no, 99% and 1% those are the only those are the only

123
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,500
percentage, you know, there are rounds, which is strange why why we would choose to be you know,

124
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,900
you know, I'm so glad that the privileged class of trans of trans women have, you know,

125
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,940
have thrown their lot in as allies of the, you know, of the downtrodden PCP, you know,

126
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,940
we need the famous alt-right comedy. You know, it shows a lot of magnanimity.

127
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,420
Well, we're having a great time. Stop that. We got to talk about.

128
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,540
All right. Yeah, let's continue this expressing our general thoughts on furry. So here's my thing,

129
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,700
and this will not surprise anybody, but I, everyone, anyone who's like judgmental of what

130
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,900
somebody is into sexually can just fuck off and die. I actually am probably way more,

131
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,580
I wouldn't say that I'm pro furry, but I'm 100% pro freedom to do whatever the hell you want.

132
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:54,660
I'm pro bestiality. I'm ironically, there's, there is an argument to make there, I suppose,

133
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:01,140
but I am like, I'm a pro bee ball. I'm a pro bee ball. I know you guys on several,

134
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,060
some people here, I don't remember exactly who have argued with me. I've debated that like,

135
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,140
yeah, if you're like a furry, and you go to conventions, dress up in a fur suit, like,

136
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,460
okay, like that's a little strange to me, like it's not something I would do. But as long as you

137
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,780
continue to be a productive human being, and it's like something that you do just out of fun,

138
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,140
then I don't see a problem. But if you stop being productive, if you put that pick down and stop

139
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,140
mining for slime, then you're going, you're done. If you, if you start to become like, if you start

140
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,260
to be like a dependent, and you start to like be like, Oh no, I need to spend all my money to like

141
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,900
make myself feel okay about the fact that I'm a furry by getting like increasingly elaborate

142
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,900
fur suits, or buying all this porn supporting these artists. So of course, mom and dad, I need

143
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,380
you to pay my rent for me so I can like, I'm not saying that furries do this, but like if somebody

144
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,860
has that attitude about anything, that's a problem. That's not a furry problem. That's being a broken,

145
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,420
irresponsible human being. Okay, okay. This is the thing. All of my complaints with furries are all

146
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,380
in character for me and not relate to like the core of what a furry is. Nothing has to do with

147
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,260
like the animal side of it. It all is in character complaints that I've complained about in other

148
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,460
situations before that all culminate in this fandom. It's not inherent to all members of the

149
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,460
fandom, but, but why should we ignore? Why should we ignore outliers? Why should we ignore the face

150
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,180
of the fandom? Why should we know? That's an excellent point. And like, you know, for example,

151
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:32,740
bronies as a group, as a movement, get lambasted because many of them, maybe not even a majority,

152
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,380
but many of them are obnoxious and annoying. So like in the same way, like, have you seen

153
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,700
Foam Adventure? That famous- Yes, of course. Of course, I've seen Foam Adventure. That's a legendary

154
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,940
video. I wish I liked anything. I wish I liked anything as much as they liked their foam.

155
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,540
I was a little judge, honestly. I like Foam Adventure as much as they liked their foam.

156
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,660
It's just, it's just the tale, if you haven't seen it, it would probably be in the show notes,

157
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,580
but like it's just the, it's a day adventure of two furries going out to get foam in order to make

158
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,940
fursuits when they, when they come back home. Is that what it was for? Yes. Yeah, I thought they

159
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,100
just wanted to like roll around on it. No, no, no, it's for fursuit. That was just a side benefit.

160
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,140
Okay. So they needed it for something. Well, all right. And like, they don't like do,

161
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,420
they don't hurt anybody. They're not really that annoying. It's just when you just,

162
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,100
when you witness this little slice of their lives and you imagine being like,

163
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,140
within three feet of them, it's just like, oh no. Imagine living like this or adjacent to this.

164
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,700
But the thing is though, with me, I'm not trying to land best furries or anything. It's just that like,

165
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,700
a lot of it just seems childish to me. It seems very like whimsical. Like, yeah, we're going to do

166
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,980
this crazy thing. Oh, okay. I completely agree. Does anyone else want to give their stance? Does

167
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,220
anyone fucking, does anyone care? I can go. Okay. Yeah. What do you think, did you?

168
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,820
Well, as, as we were all in the Brony community, obviously there's plenty of overlap between that

169
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,740
and the furry community. Yes. And, you know, I know a whole bunch of people from that community

170
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,100
who are furries, especially from being on the pub crawl, because like pub crawl has always been

171
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,580
like a, on some, on some level, somehow it's always been a furry show, I feel like.

172
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,540
I didn't know that. Okay. I mean, like Cider is heavily affiliated with the furry community,

173
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,780
and a lot of the guests we had on there would be into that stuff. And because like,

174
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,660
the nature of the show early on was we got shitfaced and talked about like weird,

175
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,740
like laws and stuff. Like we were always talking about things like what animals are surprisingly

176
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,500
legal to fucking what states.

177
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Gee, that's not a red flag that it's a furry show. I don't know what it is.

178
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,140
And I mean, obviously we, well, I mean, during the pub crawl, we would have somebody in the chat

179
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:03,540
who just would routinely every show, which is constantly post pony porn, you know,

180
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,020
and like, we were all okay with that because we saw it as like, this is a real outsider program

181
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,820
here. Like this is not, you know, we're not expecting anybody who can't handle pony porn

182
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,180
to be listening to the fucking pub crawl, which was like a 2am show on an obscure pony network,

183
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,020
you know, but like, as a result, I ended up talking to, you know, just like hearing

184
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,420
second hand. And it's amazing how much of it is just like furry to me, furriness,

185
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,900
there's like a whole culture is next to godliness, you know, it really is. There's definitely like,

186
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,860
I think to them they are almost another, well, another species in a way, but like,

187
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:48,660
more like another race of people, like they like furries act the way that like, you know,

188
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,860
when you go to like a rest, like an Asian restaurant or something, and like the family

189
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,940
who runs the place are all like talking in Chinese and making fun of you, because you

190
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,820
can't speak Chinese, that's how I feel around furries. It's like, they've devised their own

191
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,740
language, and they're kind of like, making fun of every like, you know, there's like, whatever,

192
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,540
we're over here, like, we're using our language so you guys can't understand us, or we're like,

193
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,860
in our own other world, you know, but like, it's mostly a sex thing.

194
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,260
So what you're telling me, Digi, is that, so these people are not exactly human, and my

195
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,300
loyalties are intense, but extend only to human. So, and since they're furries, and they identify

196
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,700
outside the normal human spectrum, they're more bestial, they wouldn't mind, they wouldn't object

197
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,860
if I put them down like a dog, is what you're telling me. That's, that's my, ends on the kink,

198
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:44,100
I guess. I certainly wouldn't mind. So, but there is a distinction to be, or, I mean, I'm asking,

199
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,540
I guess, because I'm not really an expert. So like, furry, yeah. Furry is not equal to otherkin,

200
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,820
is not equal to like, someone who's intubitial. If we, if we're, if otherkin, if otherkin's

201
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,260
part of this, that just, I mean, so many memories, so many memories of trolling otherkin. It was a

202
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,700
great time in my life. That's like, I mean, I, I mean, I don't, I mean, I imagine that the otherkin

203
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,740
percentage number is higher in the furry fandom, though it's not an integral part to it. There was

204
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,940
the time, there was the time I pretended to be the meta, the metatron, like reincarnated and talked

205
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,340
about and gaining literal superpowers and was like, hey guys, I'm gaining literal superpowers

206
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,380
because my angelic power is manifesting. There was the time I was a mind flayer. There was the time

207
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,380
I was a mind flayer. There was the time that I was the spirit of my own fat and I was also a feeder

208
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,900
who was determined to become as fat as possible because I identified so strongly with the, no,

209
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,060
it was on likeotherkinforums.com or whatever it was back in like 2010.

210
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,580
Okay, okay. Damn.

211
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,260
Unnerve me, I don't particularly like them, especially like fictional other people where,

212
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,700
and like, there's like the subculture of people who take other people's OCs and kin with them

213
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,940
and it's super uncomfortable. Oh my god. There's, there's copyright issues there,

214
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,140
guys. Jay, I just got to pay to play. Like that guy who was kin to like that one Digimon character

215
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,780
from season two, like the blue haired guy. That's not even, that's not even like, that's like

216
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,060
kinning with a show, but like, I mean, like taking people like such as like, let's say me or like

217
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,780
any other creator that they don't have anything published or whatever. They're just one person

218
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,020
on the internet. They take their character and they kin with them. Well, now, Maj, is your,

219
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,580
is your complaint there on more of a, I don't know, I'm not trying to dig into it, but like, is it,

220
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,380
is it more of like a, like a, this is your character. What right does this person have to like,

221
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,980
define themselves by a character that, frankly, they don't even know, because it's not their

222
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,820
character? Like, why would they do that? Or does anyone ever really know anyone?

223
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,460
It's kind of like that, but also like, my characters are in a way also a small extension

224
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,020
of myself. Like they don't necessarily represent myself. They might not have anything in common

225
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,900
with me, but they are a part of me. Like I put a little bit of myself in them, you know, and like

226
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,540
then someone takes my character and then assumes them and then like,

227
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,420
So if someone, if someone kins to a character of yours that is an extension of you, that's

228
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,820
basically rape at that point. So we got to, we got to tap down on this across the board.

229
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,380
Literally, literally, literally. Yeah, you're right.

230
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,060
It just makes me really uncomfortable. Like it hasn't happened to me, but it has happened to

231
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,620
a few artists I follow. And it's just like the thought idea is just, is just really uncomfortable

232
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,300
to me. I mean, that's a fair point. But aren't there people who other kin as like, not even like

233
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,820
dead people, but living people, like I personally am a Kanye West kin. I feel, I feel, you know,

234
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,820
a con kin for sure. If I, if I bought into the whole kin thing, I don't understand people who

235
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,940
kin with people who are still alive because I thought the whole idea is like reincarnation or

236
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,660
whatever. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe these people don't believe in the linear progression of time.

237
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,300
So that being said, they could be a reincarnation. Just like how there's theories that every electron

238
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,260
in the universe is the same electron. No, they must, they must be adherence to my,

239
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,460
to my famous church of transubstantiation, wherein a single spirit is reborn throughout

240
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,660
time and space as every individual living thing that ever existed. Time means nothing to a

241
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,100
transubstantialist like myself. You know, major's right. If that's true, then we're all just kin

242
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,060
of everybody. And that's, oh my God. Yes, it's true. It's true. Yes, we're all kin. We're all kin.

243
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,500
It's not, Ben, Ben. So it's, at that point, Ben, it's not other kin. It's every kin. We are the,

244
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,020
we are the Omni-kin. Oh, yeah. This is the word for this, but you're not, that's the name. That's

245
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,260
the name for this one universal spirit that reincarnates. It is the Omni-kin because it is

246
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,620
kin to all fictional and non-fictional alike. Wait, wait, wait, stop, but you crossed the line.

247
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,260
No, no, we're going right in this train all the way to the station. Well, I guess, I guess if we

248
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,500
include the multiverse theory as a part of that, then it is literally every character. And of course

249
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,980
we do. Of course we do. But then technically nothing is fictional. So the problem's off.

250
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,340
In the nation, you can be kin with anyone that you want. That's ever existed.

251
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:04,020
Yeah. And so you shall, and so it shall be. Amen. Well, okay, all right. Let's focus back on

252
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,820
furries. Now, I want to ask, like, so we said before, there is a distinction between a furry

253
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,500
and like an other kin, but like, what is going on with a furry who dresses up in a fur suit?

254
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,260
Like, what is, what's going on there? What's the deal? What do you mean?

255
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:28,260
They would like to have sex in the suit made of fur. Is that because they feel like they

256
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,340
are that creature or is it that they just like to pretend? I mean, there is a difference there.

257
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,820
Like, I know a few people and like, from them personal experience, nothing all furries, but

258
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,300
from them is just, it's kind of like cosplay in a way. They just like to dress up and,

259
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,900
you know, go to conventions and have a good time. Well, that makes sense to me.

260
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,100
I scoffed at this as you should scoff at this because I, I have a small sample source and I

261
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,980
don't even believe what I'm about to say. But I have been told that it is a sort of performance

262
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:06,740
art in the sense that they assume a character with a costume and then they portray this character

263
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,140
at conventions. It's not inherently sex thing. There are actually different types of fur suits

264
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:19,700
that are, it's like, if you were to watch the footage of like YMS will go to furry conventions

265
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,700
and like just take a bunch of footage and post it on his side channel. And yeah, like the fur

266
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,500
suitors always seem to be putting on like a cool cat-esque like character of like over the top,

267
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:40,020
you know, like kids show, hey, I'm a big fur suit man. Like we're going to run this convention

268
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,460
and it's going to be a great, uh, convention into the ground. Are you saying that YMS is

269
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,620
attracted to cool cat? That's not impossible. That is like, it does not look too different from

270
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,060
your normal fur suits. Well, I know that YMS identifies as a horse, but he is interested in

271
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:04,420
big cats. This is some deep lore that I'm not aware of. Well, that's fine. I mean, this is all

272
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,020
very strange, but like, I just want to, like, all the weird porn I watch is pretty strange too.

273
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,980
So I, I don't know, in no way am I trying to disrespect Adam or like anybody who's a furry

274
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,380
out there. It just, you know, it's interesting and funny. I only know all these things because I,

275
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,460
like, part of why I got into YMS was that I was really fascinated that he was an openly gay furry

276
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,860
and willing to talk about it like very matter of factly. Like, yeah, why the fuck do I care?

277
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,820
And I was just like, yeah. Are there any other big name furries out there? Who else is a

278
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,340
representative of a community? I can't, I can't think of any like, respectables. I can't think

279
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,820
of any of the people. I know. I mean, yeah, I have lots of friends who are in the furry community

280
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:50,020
and people who are like, I know, but nobody who's like giant, nobody who's as big as, as YMS.

281
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,540
Yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess all the big, all the big furries are just big in their little

282
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,980
puns. I, I want, I want, I need, I feel like I feel the need to separate church and state

283
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,500
you real quick because if we, if we, I just want to put the kibosh on this real quick. Being a

284
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,900
furry does not inherently mean that you are sexually attracted to furry creatures. Now,

285
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,740
on that side of that, that's not a huge part, right? But I just feel the need to separate that

286
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,260
because I have no problem with the sexual component of it. Okay, I'm going to level

287
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,940
this through real quick. If furries were just a cult of, of red robed, you know,

288
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:31,140
Luminati fucking, you know, Burning Man type cultish freaks whose soul, you know, a tenant of

289
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,980
their, of their personality and religion is that they love to fuck like turtles. I would have no

290
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,300
problem. My, my, my problem. And when I, I should specify my problem is my, my specific, I don't like

291
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:49,700
them opinion, opinion, like danger, like red alert, Lee Sirens opinion, uh, is with their culture

292
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,540
and their culture is truly disgusting to me for in-character reasons that have been honed outside

293
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,580
of the furry fandom. Yeah. We've been, we've been magnanimous and, and dancing around the issue,

294
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,380
but let, I want to get into the shit. I want to weigh into the, the, the, the, I wanted to bring

295
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,580
up, it was funny that Munchie mentioned, uh, Burning Man because Dick always tells us, uh, Dick,

296
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,980
of the dick show. So it's the story of, uh, going to Burning Man and going to see the furry

297
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,820
tent. And it was like the only one that was like this fully realized, like the almost futuristic,

298
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,420
like technology tent where they had like built an entire hut with like TV and they'd gotten

299
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,820
cable and shit out there. Like it was just an orgy dome. Like it was just a place where they

300
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:37,380
like literally would just have a gigantic furry orgies. However, they had the best and like most

301
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,380
fully realized tent at Burning Man because the furries are, are, are geniuses. And, uh,

302
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,860
they're an entrepreneurial community. I really do think that furries, first, I don't know what

303
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,140
the connection is. There seems to be some connection between furries and engineering. And like that.

304
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,740
Yes. I've noticed this too. Because the, because the suits maybe, because they're complicated.

305
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,860
I, I think it's probably just they're both things that nerds do.

306
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,300
That's definitely a huge part of it. And I gotta tell you, I was just at this convention called,

307
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:11,380
called Torah Khan, which is at the Rochester Institute of Technology, really huge engineering

308
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,940
school that's been around for, for like a hundred years or something. However, they've been around

309
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,580
forever. They have, they're, you know, pres, fairly prestigious, but they have a gigantic

310
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:28,420
anime convention, like a 3,500 person con at the school. And it's because the school has enough

311
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,860
of a weeb population that there's not only nearby the best manga store I've ever been to,

312
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:39,380
with it like a block away from the school. One of the best tabletop game stores I've ever seen

313
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,580
in my life, like within a block of the school, like everyone at the school is a fucking nerd.

314
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,460
And while we were there, not only are there furries in fursuits all over the school,

315
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,940
like, like think about this, these people go to school here, like almost everybody at this

316
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,380
convention is somebody who goes to school here. And yet they are willing to walk around in fursuits,

317
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:06,100
like in front of everyone they know, because the school is just so full of nerds and there's such

318
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,260
a huge furry population. Well, that's true. I mean, they were all hanging out just among the

319
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,180
crowds. Well, okay, we're talking about a school that has like, like, uh, dive, like diversity

320
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,660
and inclusion, like messages everywhere. But the moment that really got to me was even like,

321
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,860
we're at a convention and there's furries everywhere, whatever. But I saw that this,

322
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:35,380
there were posters up for a cosplay formal dance. This school has cosplay formal dances,

323
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,860
and it depicted in the picture, like two, two, like a couple of like anime drawn characters,

324
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,460
like in, in, you know, gowns, like dancing, and they both have cat or they both have tiger ears,

325
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,100
because the school's mascot is a tiger. So all of their like branding, they just have like anime

326
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,500
characters with tiger ears as like their mascot characters. So it's just a furry school is basically

327
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:08,500
what I'm saying. Here's a question. If I, uh, if I own a local coffee shop and I observe a pack of

328
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,340
furries walking into my establishment, here's my question. If I refuse to serve them and demand

329
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,540
they leave immediately, uh, because they're creeping out me and everyone else around me,

330
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,420
not that this has happened. I'm just saying in a hypothetical, uh, is it a human rights issue?

331
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:30,660
Yes, of course. But, but, but they are not human. They are subhuman, you might say. These are furries.

332
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:35,380
They do not, you know, they don't fit. Uh, that's, that's my joke. Okay. That's the whole extent of

333
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,180
it. All right. But anyways, what were we getting into here? Oh yeah, Munchie. Munchie was gonna,

334
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,780
was gonna go into his deep hole. I want to give one final last disclaimer, not for the audience,

335
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,860
but for you guys, because I, I have been trying to be, you know, you know, passe and be nuanced

336
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,700
and be, you know, you know, I'm trying to put on the kid gloves and say, you know, you know,

337
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,940
I'm trying, I've been trying to defend furries. I will continue to defend furries, but make no

338
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,580
mistake. All of you are fucking idiots because I hate furries more than you could ever, ever

339
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:15,780
possibly understand. And I hate them for, for, for, for nuanced and on point reasons. My reasons

340
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,340
are on fucking- The furries are calling right now, dude. They've got a problem with this. They,

341
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,220
they want to talk to the manager. The phones are ringing off the hook. So, so, so while you guys

342
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:32,180
are being like, oh, fucking aren't whales gross or fuck you if you'd like horses. I'm over here

343
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,820
with the real fucking raw actual shit. Point one of why you would actually hate furries,

344
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,980
aka, it's my opinion, and I'll have like a reveal later and it will be narratively catharsis and

345
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:53,220
coon, coon, spheric. Point number one. Okay. This, obviously, the sex and not as in like, not,

346
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,700
not as in the like, you know, I want to fuck a horse. That's completely fine. That's completely

347
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,420
fine. Go, go at them. What I dislike is the openness. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna coin this term

348
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:12,420
that will be used at the entire thing. Unearned smothering kinship. So this is unearned smothering

349
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,460
kinship where, when you were part of a community, keep in mind, I've prowled furry forms, you know,

350
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,060
I, I, I've brought in the work. I've done the fucking work. This is true. The furrio stereotype

351
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:30,420
is not inaccurate and it is true. The, the, the sense of like, it's, it's like the Ben and Jackie

352
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,700
College fund. You enter, you, you, you enter, everyone's super nice. Everyone's super like

353
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,860
unbelievable, like, touchy and like, feeling one another and everything's soft. And it's,

354
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,300
it's this feeling that I've described over and over again throughout this podcast. It's when

355
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,380
you're in bed and you're in, you're in bed, it's winter. You want to get nice and cozy.

356
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,220
Then after a while and you're in your hop and you're like, this is too hot. This is too much.

357
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,100
Like I need to get, I don't have the covers. I need to be cool. I can't be in this fucking

358
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,740
softy, this fucking touchy, this feely, too up in, too up in my fucking grill, this cobbling,

359
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:09,300
fucking overheating, a din, this cesspool of sex and fucking villainy, the openness that these

360
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,900
people have to do, to do lewd and perverse and, and not even just like strictly destructive, but

361
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,260
like, like, nay, I think I'm trying, I'm struggling to come up with the words, but like, you understand

362
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,900
like, like how niceness, I know exactly what you're talking about. And well, the problem with,

363
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,580
the problem with communities of inclusivity is that to some degree, humans are both physically

364
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,460
and mentally, we're designed to be beasts of burden and we are expected to have psychological

365
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,900
loads and not have just everybody say how great and wonderful we are all the time. We're pack hunters.

366
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,180
Well, whatever, you know, we followed our many umbrellas here, but, but here's my point. Like,

367
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:52,980
the reason I prefer to hang out in communities that are like overtly in the opposite direction,

368
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,260
like on 4chan, where everyone is incredibly vicious and cruel to each other is because I just see more,

369
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,820
like, usefulness to come from that as opposed to people just placating me all day about like,

370
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,340
you're perfect just the way you are, there's no need to improve, like, and like, there's an,

371
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,540
that's of course important in some measures, like we want to not shame people for just being weird

372
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:17,220
or different, but to say that like every choice, now back to how much we hate furries, being a furry

373
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,100
is a fine thing to do. But if you walk around in a fur suit and people know who you are,

374
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,100
all I'm saying is I am not casting judgment, but I am telling you, there will be social

375
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,740
ramifications of doing so. Yeah, you'll have a lot of great sex with like-minded furry people.

376
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,740
That's that's what you have to look for too. Congratulations. Did you speak on the subject

377
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,260
because I want to know if you're, I mean, more on the openness about the sex thing. That's what I

378
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,340
care about. It's like really, it's really, yeah, it's intense, like, furries because of the fact

379
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,460
that they have that culture of like, understanding each other, I guess, um, yes, like, it's the

380
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,620
over the window dude. It's because it's because they can do, you know, it is definitely over to

381
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,820
windows. Yeah, they're all freaks and they allow themselves to do degenerate things. And so the

382
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,020
overall, like, you know, how, how much can you touch your friend? How, how much, you know, how,

383
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:20,260
how much weird flirting can you do? All dialogue, all dialogue between furries is

384
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,580
flirty. It's all, it's all. Yeah, in my experience, that is true.

385
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,900
Yo, yo, let's listen to this. Okay. Here's, here's the real shit. There's a word that I think that

386
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,060
has been lost to the ages a little bit. And I think it is such an important word. I don't know,

387
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,020
maybe people would disagree, but the word is classy. I like things that are classy. And you

388
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:46,100
know what? In my humble opinion, what is not classy is like talking overtly about sex, open,

389
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,700
like you're involved with it all the time, digi, like bring up sex when it's not relevant. And

390
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,180
like, like, it's, it's, you, you are allowed to do it. You are, it's fine. It's not a problem.

391
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,020
But I don't want to hear about it. I'm not interested in how much sex you are having,

392
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,100
like the weird things you get up. One time, like a neighbor of mine, when I was growing up,

393
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,340
like I asked her for a ride home, just told me like, I can't give her a ride home. I'm going

394
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,380
to a threesome. That happened to me in my real life. I would have said the same damn thing if I

395
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,660
was going to a threesome. I mean, that was totally fine. But like, you got to think, what was she

396
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,140
trying to do? She was like trying to like shock me or something, because she knew I was a fucking

397
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,420
gay ass twink. Like she could have said, I'm just busy. She chose to tell me she's going to a threesome.

398
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,820
She wants to brag about getting to go to a threesome.

399
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,260
Don't get me wrong. That's totally fine. And I, again, I respect her right to do so.

400
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:44,100
All I'm saying is classiness. Her classiness took a hit when she told me that. That's, that's,

401
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,900
that's all I'm saying. I have no attraction to the classiness that you speak of. I can tell.

402
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:55,700
I have no, I just, I don't, if you're, but it comes to like sexual stuff, I feel like, I mean,

403
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:02,420
you, I know you agree with me that like, we need to be more open about sexuality for our,

404
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,860
for our culture's sake. And I don't like, I do think that maybe the furries are like an over

405
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,500
extension of that. And I'm sure that has to do a lot with the fact that there's probably a fucking

406
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:20,180
near one to one autism ratio in the community. I've done the numbers. It is high. It is not

407
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,100
more than half, but it is high. Okay. I am on Nate's side. Like, I don't, I don't like on solicitors

408
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,460
at TMI about your sex life. Well, did you, did you is right though? I definitely agree that I

409
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,500
think society as a whole will be better off once we're at this place. But it's just that,

410
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,820
it's just that right now was like, there is a difference in your face about it.

411
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,100
I mean, that, that's true. I mean, I like, if, if we lived like, like fucking Star Trek, for

412
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,340
example, like there are just planets you can go to, like on earth, like people are relatively

413
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,980
conservative about these things. But if you go to like literally like the sex planet in Star Trek,

414
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,100
like it's like, then you can just talk about fucking anything you want all the time.

415
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:06,180
If there is, let's say a furry convention and the furry convention is just a big orgy,

416
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,940
I'm okay with that because it's just a bunch of furries, like everyone's going there knowing

417
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,700
what it is. There's definitely something weird about, for instance, at BronyCon, where every

418
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:23,060
year I would hear that there is somewhere a BronyCon orgy, like every year at BronyCon and

419
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:29,620
some hotel room nearby, a bunch of furries get together and have a huge orgy. And this is like,

420
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,860
this is something you hear about like floating over the crowds at BronyCon. And you see people,

421
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:42,820
you see furries like, you know, in fursuits with shirts like down to Yiff and shit like that.

422
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,780
It's brazenly sexual on some level. And then you're like, but this is a My Little Pony convention

423
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,380
where like, there's also six year old girls around. And it's like-

424
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,420
Well, okay, did you-

425
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,140
To a certain degree.

426
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,340
There are also six year olds at furry conventions.

427
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,540
Well, I mean, okay, you're not wrong. I want to speak on-

428
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,300
Some six year olds are furries and want to get into that orgy, I guess.

429
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,100
Like there's definitely some crossover between like, for example, like the gay rights movement

430
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,180
and stuff. Because like a lot of it is, it's about like being proud of who you are and like,

431
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,980
not allowing society to like, shame you and repress you. But like, I mean, you know, again,

432
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,180
there's a context for everything and there's degrees of doing different things. And like,

433
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,100
if you're at like a gay pride parade, like there's kind of, you're making a statement,

434
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,140
if you just like make out, if you're a guy and you're gay and you just make out with a dude

435
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:34,820
publicly, and it's like sloppy and just like, like just celebrating being gay, like that actually

436
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,300
has kind of like some utility. It's like, you're like challenging social norms and stuff. And so

437
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,580
like, I get it. I mean, and you know, now it's legal. So like, things have changed and it's

438
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,380
starting to get a little passe. So how about we shut the fuck up about that?

439
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,780
I'm just kidding. But like,

440
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,380
I'm just kidding everyone. Come on.

441
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,180
It's like taking potshots at all the fucking quote unquote repressed groups. So he's just like,

442
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,300
I got a really flag. I am currently defending all of them by saying that I totally understand

443
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,820
the desire to like, feel that you can express your sexuality just in general. And I think,

444
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,780
I think just that leads to a little bit of overcompensation is all I'm saying. Again,

445
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,300
like I agree with you guys on all of this. I think there's, there's a lot of like, I feel

446
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,820
shame. So I'm going to hyper like accentuate this in response, which is logical to a degree.

447
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,300
Sure. I think that the same time though, that becomes, I don't want to say obnoxious. That's

448
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,540
where the stigma comes from though. Right. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're being

449
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,140
more comfortable in of yourself and you're probably winning allies, but you're also

450
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,620
creating enemies you wouldn't otherwise have at the same time. That's true. There's a difference.

451
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:45,460
There's a, there's a big social problem with confusing tolerance, with like acceptance,

452
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,620
like, like people tolerate things even though they don't like them. And that's what we should aim

453
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,100
for. Like right now, everyone, you don't have the right to be loved by everybody. Well, that's

454
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,180
for sure. That's for sure. And there's a huge difference between fighting for tolerance and

455
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,140
fighting for being loved. And I feel like a lot of people have that problem. Right. Right now,

456
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,140
I still get shit occasionally. This is pretty rare for me, but it's like people will

457
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,900
at me and like give me shit about the fact that I even liked my little pony at all,

458
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,300
despite like never being in any way like a creep or like weird about it. I simply like a show.

459
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,340
And because it's associated with like things happening with other people elsewhere,

460
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,700
you know, even maybe touching into the furry community to some degree, obviously, like then

461
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,660
that there's just, there's a social miasma that just swirls around these things. And I mean,

462
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,860
it's around every community. You know, there's, there's bad things about every single community,

463
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,820
which is why I'm so anti-identitarian and think everyone should just be their individual self

464
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,940
and be judged on their own merits. Yeah. This will be a thing later. Word. To all viewers,

465
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,300
you may like think, ah, these fucking guys, what the fuck are they talking about? They just don't

466
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,820
want people to be nice to one another on their own fucking discord service. What's in her new

467
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:06,260
guys? Well, that's the thing. You fucking dumb ass slut. You fucking drink up, come you fucking

468
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:14,660
bitch. Is because I have opinions and I have been forced to think about my opinion on this subject.

469
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,220
As you all know, in a little podcast named Armour Fucking Trevill, I discussed extensively how much

470
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,940
I dislike the characters for exhibiting overly sexual and creepy, disgusting, perverted dialogue

471
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,780
constantly without any respite and how I dislike the overall, you know, jovial and cheerful and,

472
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,020
you know, hug, boxy nature of the characters in that. So don't you come fucking tell me that this

473
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,060
is some like, you know, oh, I'm just hanging furries for no fucking reason. Oh, my son's a fucking

474
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,540
foreigner. He's taking ten cocks up the ass. You know what the fuck you're talking about. Well,

475
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,660
you know what, maybe I don't, but am I not allowed to feel things? Am I not allowed to have a soul?

476
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,780
Am I not allowed to have my heart singing? All right. Well, what else you got, Munchy? What's

477
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,540
point two here? Or may I say something? Well, I actually wanted to sort of shift the topic about

478
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:08,660
your opinion about life personas and stuff. Yes. Yes. Oh, I would love to get in this, please, please.

479
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,580
Like, oh, like specifically, would you guys like to have personas or just

480
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,140
I'm, please define. Wait, wait. In major, in your own words, please define a fursona.

481
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,100
Well, basically, you that is like an anthropomorphic animal.

482
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,380
We literally all have those because we were all, we all have brony so.

483
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:38,180
Yes. I kind of, I kind of like put the brony part away from the furries. I have no interest in doing

484
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:45,220
that specifically with like an anthro animal man, man boy, or, I mean, it's just like, what, what,

485
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:52,260
what is the end game of having a fursona? If you just really like. And you want to be a person,

486
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,500
it's just natural. It's just, I think it's just a way of participating in the community. Like,

487
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,500
the same reason we all had horse characters. Yeah, that's true. It's the exact same.

488
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,780
Science, do you remember? I did like some sketches like a way, way back ago before,

489
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,540
before Munchie was even born. Oh my God.

490
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,500
Of like several of us members as like animal characters. Like, I think.

491
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,540
Yeah, that was for an RPG that we were going to do. Yeah. Yeah. I was a spider lady and.

492
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:33,220
Yeah, that was great. I remember those. Well, okay, but you're calling it a fursona. To me,

493
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,700
it's almost like just like fan art of a sort, you know, in a certain way. I think a huge part

494
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:45,540
of the existence of fursonas has to do with the fact that like fur affinity and like artwork is

495
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,660
such a big part of the furry community. And so people just kind of have a character so that

496
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:57,300
there is a vessel to have art. Like, like YMS, for instance, will regularly buy commissions of

497
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:03,060
just his like other artists he likes drawing his horse character. And since, you know,

498
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,620
commissions, they can charge whatever they want if it's a good enough artist. So like these people

499
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,580
are willing to pay to have their fursonas. So like it's just kind of a part of the culture is like

500
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:21,300
this this weird dropping all your money on like bronies were like this, too. This is also part of

501
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,780
for other levels are like they just spend lots and lots of money. And I do think there's an

502
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:34,980
element of like, uh, I think a lot of like, well, furries have disposable income is what I'm

503
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:42,980
saying. Sure. I want to stress that I have literally seen a person on Tumblr that like is

504
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:51,620
poor and could barely pay rent by $80 commissions. Like like he spent literally, literally like all

505
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:57,380
of his money, all of his written money. I'm not fucking joking. Like seriously. What would you

506
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,620
say? What would you say to someone who came back with this, like someone who's maybe like a member

507
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,660
of the trans community and would say that like, but Munchy, don't you see he needs to invest at

508
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,700
least some maybe that's too much money. But like he feels like like he doesn't belong in his body.

509
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,500
And he feels like he needs to be depicted as this persona in order to feel okay about himself.

510
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,700
I don't think that's not the point of them. But I would say no, that's not all the point.

511
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:26,820
Maybe that's the other thing. I think that what Munchy is describing with this guy,

512
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:34,020
this is something I've seen a lot of, which is just some people get locked into pleasure spending

513
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,900
and literally just spend all their goddamn money. And it's a big thing in these communities. Like

514
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:45,620
my, uh, my ex-girlfriend was not really a furry, but she was big into like buying plushies on Deviant

515
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,060
Art and like literally would just like spend all her fucking money on that and then ran out of money

516
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,900
and like had no money anymore because she would drop like $500 on a plushie, like a custom made

517
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,820
Etsy plushie like every fucking week. And eventually you don't have money anymore. So that's what

518
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:09,300
happens. It's advice like anything else. Yeah, go on Munchy, go on. Did you side topic real quick?

519
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,940
I was really listening to the horse cast for various reasons. And in the first episode,

520
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,500
like 20 minutes in, you're just like, hey, can I just like bring my ex-girlfriend into the call?

521
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,260
And she's like, uh, okay. And then she's just there for the rest of the episode. Is that true?

522
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:29,380
Just like in the background, just sometimes chiming in. Damn, I never noticed that. I must have not

523
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:37,300
listened to that one. Very funny. Very fucking funny. Well, I think I made my point. So, I mean,

524
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,420
well, what I was going to say was like, you could, I, that is a good point, did you? I totally

525
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,820
think that's a reasonable thing to say. It's just like, I don't know what I said. That was like a

526
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:53,700
pet, like none of what you just said would reconcile with the thing that I had said. Like, no, no,

527
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,020
well, I mean, no, that's what I'm saying. It's like, what I'm saying is like the most defensive

528
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,380
position that like someone who's like trying to like explain this behavior is like a necessary

529
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,820
thing somebody needs to engage in. No, no, I'm not trying to say that at all. I'm just saying that

530
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,300
some dumb motherfuckers just like to blow through all the goddamn money. That's what I'm saying too.

531
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,700
It's not defensible at all. This guy's a fucking idiot. He just doesn't know how to spend money.

532
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,020
You're right. I'm just recognizing that as a fair counterpoint to what I was saying. And like,

533
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:26,020
it's really hard for me to like know what that's like. Like, once in a while, I absolutely do

534
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:30,100
just waste some money on like a new video game that I really don't need that I want. But like,

535
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:36,100
to this degree is unfathomable to me. I can't imagine doing that. I don't know, man. I guess

536
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,620
these are just, I think these are just irresponsible people if you, if you do something, you know,

537
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:46,900
to that degree. You know, I mean, if I, if you, if you're not an artist, I can understand what

538
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,020
wanting to spend tons of money getting like art of your character made. I feel blessed. I feel

539
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,620
blessed to have the skills that I can just do it myself and turn my nose up.

540
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,860
Yeah, but that's your goddamn privilege. It is my privilege. And I'm fucking, I'm never checking

541
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:05,700
it. But you learned how to draw, Ben. I don't accept that as a privilege. No, I was born with

542
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:12,580
this ability. I never worked a day in my life. But there's like different art styles out there

543
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,860
and something you can do and maybe you want to see in a different style. That's true. That's fair.

544
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,940
Yeah, I'm not saying I do understand, I do understand the drive to like commission art.

545
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,620
Like it makes sense. I hardly ever do it. I sort of, I sort of share it. I guess it's a bit of an

546
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:34,980
ego of an artist. Why pay for it if I can do it myself at the same time? I want to, I want to

547
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,580
support my fellow artists and also I like other art styles. So I have commissioned other artists

548
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,620
to draw my characters a few times. It's really fun. It's really neat. It's just, it's kind of,

549
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,260
I guess it's kind of paying, like paying for fan art. So it's kind of sad, but at the same time,

550
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:59,940
to see the art in the end. I want to discuss OC's and not just, you know, original characters,

551
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,700
like Ben, you wouldn't consider like a magda in OC, right? This is, I'm very interested in this

552
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:11,620
discussion of what is an OC. And yeah, yeah, I think technically anything you make up yourself

553
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:17,700
is an OC. But I think that, but I think that if you talk like that, it doesn't make any sense.

554
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,340
I think you might, at that point, you might as well just call them your, you know,

555
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:27,460
I have a definition. I have a definition. Okay. For this discussion, I want, when I say OC's,

556
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,620
it'll be short for NC's, which is narrative-less characters. These are characters you can create

557
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,660
just for the purpose of having a character. See, see, that's a little different to me.

558
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,260
I mean, avatars is a word I would use as well. To me.

559
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,340
Because you can have multiple avatars, you know, and these are just the ones you cycle between,

560
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:51,460
if you even used them that way. But like, yeah, it's, it's really fascinating the way that people

561
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:59,140
will like project themselves onto an illustration they didn't even make up. And then like, be like,

562
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,580
this is who I am now, and I spend all my money on this character now, like. To me. Yeah, it's

563
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:10,820
interesting. An OC, like I always felt like the best definition for an OC is a, it's a,

564
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,540
it's a character, but it's a character that exists within like another canon that you don't know.

565
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,620
Correct. Like an OC is a character you make up that is in like My Little Pony or Danganronpa or

566
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:26,180
whatever. That's an MC most of the time, fan character. But like, I mean, the terms aren't

567
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:31,380
interchangeable. It doesn't really matter so much, but like specifically that would be a fan character,

568
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,260
like in a fandom. Fair enough. What about a character that exists outside of any fandom?

569
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,940
That's just like, those exist. And those are what I would call NC's narrative.

570
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,420
That's what I would call OC's because I always create a narrative for my characters,

571
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:49,460
even if they don't have a fandom. Well, I mean, okay, okay, if you create a narrative for them,

572
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,820
and like you create like a comic or something for them, then like no one can, like, like,

573
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,380
I know I understand super pretentious here, but I totally do. And I can't deny that I put like,

574
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,380
characters in a story above characters without a story. I think we can all understand why,

575
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:07,700
because you need narratives to get like greater insight into the characters and gives them a

576
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:15,380
purpose for existing and allows, you know, themes, narrative plots to come out of them and make me

577
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:22,260
care about them. I do not care about narratives. But aesthetic is a narrative. That's true.

578
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,340
Okay, hold on. Wait, this is important.

579
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,860
Thanks for interrupting me like three times. Sorry.

580
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,700
To make a character, I think it's important to know why you're creating the character,

581
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,780
what purpose, and for what sort of universe or whatever, even though like a lot of my

582
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,220
characters lack description and deviant, and I'd be like, Hey, I made this boy, isn't he cute?

583
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:51,460
And you know, I don't put any information, know that I still think about the information when

584
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,940
I'm drawing like, what's the purpose of this thing? So the audience, though, how do they know

585
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,380
any of this? It should be conveyed in the design, I would think, you know, the design has to be

586
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,180
informed by your ideas, because it has to have some sort of consistency with whatever you're doing.

587
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,740
I mean, by that definition, then every character ever drawn, like there has to be some thought

588
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,460
into why they are what they are. So, you know, is it really true? Because you could have the

589
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,100
decision of like, this guy's wearing this chain, because it will look cool on this outfit. Or

590
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:26,020
you can think like, this guy picked up this chain from his dead grandma, and like, it has a

591
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,300
fucking secret resonance. And also, it's like how he uses his soul play. You know what it is?

592
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,300
If your character exists in any narrative, then they have to like have like a history and a

593
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,460
story. It's like, it's like, when you try to observe an electron, that's when it like chooses

594
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,620
a placement. It's when you try to observe a character in any narrative, like their history

595
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,180
develops instantly. But until you do so, it does not exist. Shrodingers. You know what I mean?

596
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,140
I think that a character doesn't need, okay, I mean, I think that you can like plan out your

597
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,060
characters like history and backstory and personality and relationships and all that stuff.

598
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:03,540
I wouldn't say that you shouldn't do that. But I think that you totally can create a character

599
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:10,820
with like very little history or like prethought and like put them in a story and have a character

600
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:17,780
kind of emerge out of that. Totally. Totally. That's not what I'm arguing. I'm kind of arguing

601
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:24,980
against mage that like that kind of like pre narrative like character creation is like it's

602
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:30,340
not always necessary. Alright, enough of whatever the hell we were just talking about. Munchy,

603
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:37,940
get to the business. The point, the point here that I dislike OCs for is because I feel they are like

604
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:43,220
basically inherently shallow without other characters or a narrative or plot to speak of. I

605
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,700
feel that they are shallow and cannot reach like the same level as like, you know, a fucking

606
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:54,260
anime comedy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're talking about a furry in real life? No, I'm talking

607
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,180
about an OC. I'm talking about an OC. Oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay. So this ties into real life

608
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:07,700
because most of the first suits are the OCs that people have created. So I am willing to binge

609
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,980
a little bit and allow people to say, you know, it's a performance art, you know, these people

610
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,060
are performing a character when they put on the costume. But if it's a shit character then. Yeah,

611
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,900
but it's a shit character is my point. It's a shit character that is shallow.

612
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,180
And okay, there's a difference between a sona and a character, but yeah.

613
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,620
No, no, I'm aware that there is, but a lot of there are first suits that are not for sonas.

614
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,060
It's not, it's not, it's not. Is it, is it a faux pas to go up to someone and say,

615
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:39,060
you're boring and I find your real life narrative shit? Because like, is it a faux pas to come up

616
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:46,340
to someone? I have done that and it was a faux pas. It was definitely who would have guessed.

617
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,700
Because that's basically what Munchie is advocating here with the furry community.

618
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,220
Your narrative is garbage. You need to revisit why am I advocating going up to people and like

619
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:03,460
shoving them down to the ground and like, well, why am I doing that? Because you're a white nationalist.

620
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,100
When I was in high school, I told a girl she was cliche and she did not take that very well.

621
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,140
Damn girl. That's pretty, that's pretty like, that's called a girl that's like, that's like,

622
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,380
that's like that part in American beauty where the guy tells the girl that she's boring and ordinary.

623
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,180
Oh yeah. My favorite part because I'm like all women. Am I right, man?

624
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,460
Smash. Smash the matriarch.

625
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,620
What else is worth though? She was like the only female juggalo I've ever met, so she wasn't that

626
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,340
Whoa!

627
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,780
Wildly recontextualized the story. The only female juggalo I've ever met was Jackie.

628
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,700
So like, yeah, I mean, you know, she's always down to clown.

629
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:58,260
I want to shift to point two of why I hate furries and by why I hate furries,

630
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,420
you all fucking know, I'm not going to put on the fucking killings a little more.

631
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,620
It's a fucking joke. I'm supposed to be hyperbolic in order to maintain comedy.

632
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,820
I don't actually, you know, it's, it's not, I don't actually have that much ill will.

633
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:14,900
Why hate furries? Two fursuits. I hate fucking fursuits and here's the thing.

634
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,820
They're ugly, man. They're ugly.

635
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:21,940
Here's what all furries, all furries have jumped up their ears. They're the little cute tail ears

636
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:27,620
have perked up and they're buying a mean comment right now. You guys have only seen fucking mass,

637
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:33,300
you know, mascot costumes. You haven't seen the real Rasha. You're just taking the worst of the

638
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,260
bunch and, you know, making fun of them. Not all fursuits are the same, my friend. Sick.

639
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,100
But here's what I have to say to you. The best and the worst fursuits, I hate them for the same

640
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,660
reasons. That's what I say when I say that I don't like anime style or like furry style.

641
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,620
It's not that they are literally the same. I just hate them all for similar reasons.

642
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,340
That's why I say that I don't like the furries styles because there are things about, you know,

643
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,620
commonly, you know, generic furries styles that are all like similar among different artists.

644
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:10,900
Yeah. And this is the same for fursuits, obviously. There are good fursuits and there are bad fursuits,

645
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,620
but they're indistinguishable to me because they both have the same trapeze. I've seen autumn

646
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,380
fallings, yeah, fucking names dropped, I'm a partition. Yeah. Get on my fucking level.

647
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:25,380
They're still bad. I got to back that up. You know, sometimes the artwork is well-crafted,

648
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:31,460
but like aesthetically, furry art is fucking repulsive. And I'm not even going to knock them

649
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:37,700
for that because obviously a lot of the shit that I like would repulse a lot of people. Like,

650
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:44,260
the porn I look at, if you showed it to your mom, she'd just fucking die instantly. Like,

651
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,940
knowing that, literally knowing that someone jacks off to this would kill a lot of moms.

652
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,700
The thing about the furry aesthetic that gets me, more than, I mean, I don't like it,

653
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:01,060
but more than just that I don't like it is that it's incredibly samey and it's all very like

654
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:08,020
self-reflective, you know, like it all looks like itself. Yeah, it's very incestuous. It's literally

655
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:15,300
tons and tons of the same. It's all so insular. It's a bunch of young artists copying old

656
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:21,860
artists that all copied fucking Don Bluth. Right, you know, or that it's that kind of scenario.

657
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,260
The thing that makes, I think, furry stuff like not as good as like anime is that like,

658
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:30,980
anime, like there's an anime style that like anyone sees like that's an anime,

659
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,980
but there are things like just for example, one piece that does not look like a normal

660
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:40,980
anime. There's for just like that. I was just going to say that I've never seen any furry art

661
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:45,860
that like actually looks like that. Oh, no, no, no. There's tons of... I say that, but then I found

662
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:53,860
this online, but then I found this image and I knew that I had found true love on this day.

663
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,380
Where is this? It's in the main chat. It'll be in the show notes, everybody. You're going to want to

664
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:02,660
see this shit. There's this one that's undeniably beautiful here. I have to find this. You guys

665
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,380
keep talking and I'll be listening. We're getting derailed.

666
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:10,740
Tom, what do you have to say about all this? You're a known degenerate. What do you think about

667
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:18,340
all this? Definitely. I don't know. I don't really find fur suits all that aesthetically pleasing.

668
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,740
I think my biggest problem with fur suits, and there are some that dodge this problem,

669
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,820
like the ones that are done like immaculately well, they all feel very lifeless. Like the whole

670
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:34,500
idea is you're trying to portray this cartoon character, but there's just very little emotion

671
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:40,740
in the face or anything and it feels very dead. It feels like you're wearing some cartoon husk.

672
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,740
Let me tell you a little story that's somewhat relevant to this. I went to Chuck E. Cheese not

673
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:54,660
that long ago for Jackie's birthday and Chuck E. was there. The man himself. Damn. He was quite

674
01:01:54,740 --> 01:02:02,660
short. He was quite short. He only came up to my nose. I went to give him a high five and he's

675
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,620
looking down with his big stupid mouse grin and he's waving at the kids that are all jumping around

676
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,100
and grabbing tickets out of his hands. I went to give him a high five and he totally whiffed me.

677
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,620
You know why? I realized later, it's because he could not see me because he could only see down

678
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,740
out of his mouth. Well, here's here. Well, I guess that makes sense. This is supposed to be children.

679
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:29,060
Yeah. He can only see the kids below him, but here you see the world of adults that lives above.

680
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,980
This is kind of going off track, but I can kind of pull it back into something relevant.

681
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,980
That's terrifying. Is that look at this one, everybody. It's a Pikachu fursuit. All right,

682
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:44,100
I get it. The show notes. Check this out. Yeah. That's a good one. Damn. Dude, she's thick. Dude,

683
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:51,860
this girl. Have you seen the Celestias? No. I don't know. But Ben, Ben, I'm surprised they

684
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,140
still even have fursuits at Chuck E. Cheese because the current Chuck E. Cheese mascot,

685
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:00,580
he's the size of a regular mouse. Yeah. And here's the question. Is the current Chuck E. Cheese

686
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:06,580
mascot a furry anymore? He's just an anthropomorphized character and not a furry because he's definitely

687
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,060
a delineation. He's riding the line. He's getting more and more mousy, but I think he's still on the

688
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:16,500
side of evil. But the current character is the size of a mouse. He's like this tiny little

689
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,300
mouse running around wearing a shirt. Well, not when he's in a fursuit. He's not. I get it. That's

690
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,180
weird to me. I found the fur yard. That is weird. That he's an actual mouse or something. I found

691
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:31,140
the fur yard. That is good. And I'm about to post it. This is by Glitched Puppet of the comic

692
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:37,220
Floraverse. This is like the one piece. This is like the one piece. Floraverse is that one that's

693
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,180
nice. Floraverse is that one that's pretty cool, but it's got the like secret porn side. Yes, yes.

694
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:48,500
It's got the secret porn page. I remember I mirror Way Back when you discussed that. And then I was

695
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:54,740
like, huh, how interesting. Floraverse is actually pretty cool in a lot of ways. I found out about

696
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,500
it myself. And I was like, oh, this is the thing that Ben talked about. And I had the same conclusion

697
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,860
that you did. Yeah, it's like, it's cool. I mean, but it's also a little like, eh, it's a little

698
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:09,460
squeaky. This looks great. I mean, this looks really nice. I wouldn't even consider this

699
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:14,500
furry art. This is the one that you said that the artist also does like porn, right? They have two

700
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,940
patreons, one for the like the main comic and one for like the porn side stories. If this artist draws

701
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:26,340
porn, I need to get on that immediately. They do. I'll leave it to you right now, my friends. Now,

702
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:31,300
I don't think this is the case, but is this like there is one, it's not really furry, but there

703
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:37,220
is a, uh, a comic that features a unicorn that all of 4chan regards is extremely sexy. Like she's

704
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,220
like, oh, I know exactly the one you're thinking of. This is not that. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay,

705
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:46,340
I guess not. I don't know what you're talking about. It's, it's the, I want to blank that blank.

706
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:52,260
And it's, you know, it's that old meme. Indeed. Well, uh, okay, dope, dope. I mean, we've done it

707
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:58,660
guys. I guess, I guess furries are somewhat saved. We've redeemed them. You're always trying to

708
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:04,180
in podcast, you're always trying to close. That's your main occupation is podcast. No, no, no,

709
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,620
much. You don't understand. I'm going for the fake out ending. I want everyone to think that we

710
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,820
resolve so that you can blast their assholes wide open with the truth at the end of the, it's like

711
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,420
the post, uh, credits, uh, final sequence. So let's, what else you got for us? Well, okay, let's,

712
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:24,100
let's get meta here real quick because this, I'm about to launch into a thing and this was,

713
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,180
and this was made, I have not scripted this like I usually do with notes, but this is on top of

714
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:34,500
my head. But this was intended, this idea was intended to come after a long section of me talk

715
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,500
about how I dislike, you know, the, the, the niceness and stuff, but that came at the beginning.

716
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,140
That's all fine. So just know that, uh, the impassioned rant I'm about to go on is totally

717
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,980
unearned within the context of the podcast. Only makes sense in my own mind, but just make sure

718
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:51,860
that this is just, no, for a fact, this is all genuine and not fake. And this is all is true.

719
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:57,140
The reason why I dislike that all this fucking gross ass, gross,

720
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:04,340
melty, hug box bullshit is because I was fucking there. Digi knows on fucking Tumblr,

721
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,220
I was in the most perverse and disgusting parts of the Brony fandom. And I was surrounded by

722
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:14,900
hug box, gross fucking openly sexual people all the time. And it fucked me up and made me sad

723
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:20,020
all the time being around all these people who are so freely open about, about their sexual

724
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:26,020
impulses and about, about all their, you know, trying to be all touchy and feely and all gross

725
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,940
all around me. It made me a disgusting person because like, because I couldn't hold back on

726
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,220
like, unlike my, you know, my urges and I turned into a weird fucking gross ass.

727
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:39,140
Oh no. And it was completely awful experience for everyone involved. And so, and so I grew up

728
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:43,700
and I, and I knew that I couldn't be like this anymore. Due to this group right fucking here

729
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,500
at BronyCon, I was a fucking bitch. But then I hung out with all view fucking people and I turned

730
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,700
to not a bitch. Simplified. But that's fine. That's fine. So the first time we met, you were,

731
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:59,060
you were deep in the shit, huh? Yeah, I was deep in the shit. Damn. And, and, and, and due to hanging

732
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:04,020
out with you guys and, and, you know, other friends, I slowly regained my humanity and renounced,

733
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:09,620
and renounced being a fucking carpet munchery, fucking, you know, like foreign, foreign browser,

734
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:14,820
you know, is this the, is this the off discussed like role play lifestyle that you mentioned?

735
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:20,580
My role plays came, my role plays were super innocent and just like I was like a kid on the

736
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:27,860
internet doing Pokemon. Sure. It was like home stuck. You were like Nepeta. I gotta pounce.

737
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:33,060
I gotta go on a thing here because I'm looking at this forbidden flora.com that munchy.

738
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:42,820
Man, the furry porn. So annoying. I think I've realized that the only thing that makes me not

739
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:48,100
a furry is that furry is defined by like the certain aesthetic and like

740
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:55,620
characteristics, you know, because if it was anime porn, you could draw any, like, you could

741
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:01,220
draw me a furry fuck and I will look at it and like it. Monster girls, man. Of course. I love,

742
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:06,580
love monster girls or any, just any type of like animal, human, hybrid, like the game Juan

743
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:11,620
Koto Kurasa, which is just about fucking like girls who are literally dogs, but they're like,

744
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:18,260
they look like human girls. Like, I mean, and even like, I look at tons of poke porn, but like,

745
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:23,540
and I was looking at this forbidden flora and I'm like, this would be my thing. Like, I think

746
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:29,220
this artist is really good. I think they have, they draw good porn. The only problem is that there

747
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:34,660
are little subtle things that make it extremely furry feeling. And those are the only things

748
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,580
that turn me off about it. Like, otherwise it'd be perfectly fine, but I just look at it and I'm

749
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,060
like, Oh, if they didn't look like fucking furries, this would be really hot. Well, see, that's,

750
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:47,380
that's what I, that's what I think about. That's why I'm so strident in my defense of like all

751
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:52,420
these people. Cause like, I have jacked off to every kind of porn there is, and I will do so

752
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,820
again in the future. Furry, scat, well, not really a girl or anything. Well, not, not even that much

753
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:00,500
scat. The scat kind of turns me off, but it doesn't matter. The point is, like, I don't want to

754
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,820
limit my freedoms. I mean, I was watching, I was watching, not resort, Bowen, uh,

755
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:08,180
like Aerogay, it's this whatever thing. And then like, all of a sudden there's just a shitting

756
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,500
scene and I was like, what the fuck is happening right now? Uh, it does matter. It happens all

757
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:19,540
the time in porn, especially like pissing is near constant in anime porn. If you watch enough

758
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:25,060
anime porn, if you watch enough anime porn and you're not into pissing, it can be difficult

759
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:30,340
because it's just going to happen. Like, I know we've all seen Oni Chichi and I know there's

760
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:35,060
pissing at least once in that scene. I don't even know what that is. What are you talking about?

761
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:39,540
I guess, I guess I'm not as degenerate as you all thought I was. No, Oni Chichi is like the most

762
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,700
popular hentai, like, ever, other than Bible Black. It's like the one that everyone's seen.

763
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:48,180
Is it about Chichi from Dragon Ball? No, it's just about some blonde girl getting

764
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,220
fucked by like her stepdad, I think, but like, they made like 80 episodes of it.

765
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:57,540
Hit up my boys on hentai gasm to see that shit. That's the real shit. Yo, all right,

766
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,220
we earlier discussed about TMI. Hentai Gasm is a good site. I'd like it.

767
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:11,940
But all I want to say is I am so absolutist in my viewing of like, all this is fine.

768
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:16,500
Like, I don't want to shame anybody. Do exactly what you want to do. It's totally cool.

769
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:23,300
But like, I think keep it in the privacy of your own home. Like, I do degenerate shit and I talk

770
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,900
about it here because it's funny. But like, if I was just hanging out with my friends and I started

771
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,700
talking about my weird fetishes, then like, there's an audience. You got to consider your

772
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:36,180
audience is all I'm saying. And you will creep people out if you start talking about the shit

773
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:40,740
openly. Like, thinking about it from their perspective, they are all furries. They all

774
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:46,420
do this. Why would they not discuss what they that even if I was a huge furry? I like, yes,

775
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,540
there's like the emancipation element, like, we shouldn't be ashamed for this. Like, yeah,

776
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,980
we're going to talk about rah rah. But on the like, it's right the path. I don't want to,

777
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,980
I don't want to hear about heterosexual sex that my buddies are having. I'm not

778
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:00,660
interested. I mean, I think that's, I think that's kind of unique to you though, Nate,

779
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:04,340
because I think it's fairly normal for like locker room talk to be like, yeah, I fucked

780
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:10,100
that bitch last night and put it in her ass. And it's not the same thing. I think it's,

781
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,940
wait, what is different about that? What do you mean it's not the same? Well, I mean,

782
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:17,780
if it's open the door, it's different to hear about my buddy plowing his girlfriend night

783
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:21,700
after night after night, as opposed to, yeah, at one night stand with this girl who you'll

784
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:28,100
never meet. Those are two different situations. I guess, I mean, I also see it as like, I mean,

785
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:33,460
me and my friends, fair enough, me and my other, you know, my offline friends, we even talk about

786
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:38,020
porn all the time because we were all just huge porn fans. Like, so, well, you know, I'm into

787
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:42,500
porn. I mean, all day, whether it's a girlfriend or a one night stand. Yeah, I kind of don't want

788
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,940
to think about my friends having sex ever, you know, that's where I'm coming from. That's where

789
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,180
I'm coming from. But hey, man, if I'm the weird one, fair enough, I accept it. I don't think you're

790
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,420
gross for doing it, but I think that thinking about it is kind of gross, you know, you know.

791
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:01,220
Class, man. Yeah, I know that we disagree on this topic, me and Digian, probably other people here,

792
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:04,900
but that's that's what comes down to for me. I think about everybody having sex.

793
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:17,220
Thanks. Well, okay. Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to say to watch any, you know, potential uprising

794
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,060
here, people are probably going to be like, munchy, like, like, like, I'm like, you Nick,

795
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:24,660
where I think you can do whatever you want sexually and you can do whatever you want.

796
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:29,380
Like, basically, you know, I'm pretty into, you know, freedom and, you know, do whatever you want.

797
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:35,700
It's your life. But like, I'm, you know, I'm an alt person. I'm living the alternative lifestyle.

798
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:40,740
I am not, I am not, you know, following society's normals. Why should I impose society's rules?

799
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,420
Like, why should I pick and choose the ones that I choose to follow? Like, you know, not protect

800
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:48,020
the freedoms, protect the freedoms of people who disagree with you people because one day

801
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:53,060
they're coming for your shit. Exactly. So I'm, none of this is meaning to intend like,

802
01:12:53,060 --> 01:13:01,220
furries, stop it. I don't like furries. In fact, I wish that they didn't exist, but they do. And so

803
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:06,020
I'm not going to make any attempt to make sure that they stop being real. Right. And that's the

804
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:10,500
difference between my opinion and that's the difference between tolerance and like loving

805
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,900
that I was talking about earlier. Yes. Correct. And now there's an elephant in the room for this

806
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:19,380
whole conversation, Munchie, that I've deliberately avoided mentioning until now.

807
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:24,580
How big is the dick on that elephant? Cause I am, I'm getting horny thinking about all this.

808
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:30,660
Is it, is it, is it appropriate to bring it up now, Munchie? Or are you, do you want to,

809
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:35,060
you know, wait? I haven't asked the other party if they, I don't think they would fucking care,

810
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:39,060
yeah, whatever. Well, okay. Here's the deal, people. Munchie is dating a furry right now.

811
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:43,700
He is dating a big ol' fursuit furry. Yeah. So that's the context of this whole conversation.

812
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:49,060
It's not even a moderate, itch. She, she can't, Cassey, link, link in the description.

813
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,420
It's not even like a moderate furry. Like she's, she's real.

814
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,900
But see, but see, that's the thing, man. Tolerance, right? Like you, you're not into it, right?

815
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:06,660
I should also mention that she is not, she, she does not exhibit the behaviors that I have described

816
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:11,060
here. Well, yeah, there you go. She does not role play or anything. Proving that there are good

817
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:17,060
furries, you know, basically. Yeah. She does not exhibit the overwhelming, you know, heat,

818
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:25,940
and unbelievable, you know, warmness of, of unearned kinship. She does not exhibit that.

819
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:29,460
Yes. Yes. She's one of the good ones. Thumbs up. There you go.

820
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:35,940
Um, but yeah, uh, furries are all great. They give charities. How many charities have you

821
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:39,940
donated to, motherfuckers? Furries are all about charities. Do you, do you consider furry

822
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,100
patreons a charity? If so, they are the most generous organization in the entire universe.

823
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,660
That is also, that is also a good thing about furries, is that like, like, even though we can

824
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,780
make fun of them for spending so much money on commissions, and we should, because that's not

825
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:57,300
smart, uh, they do like support artists mad hardcore. Well, I think the reason that furries

826
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:02,980
support artists so much is because, like, because their fandom has no, like, canon material,

827
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,500
you can't just go buy the official release of Furry. It's just, it's all community driven

828
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,940
material. So if you want to, like, spend something, you can't just go out buy the

829
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,060
Blu-ray of Furry season one. You've got to support artists because that's all there is.

830
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:19,140
You know, I bet, I bet that is a ton to do with why they're so vocal and like fervorous in their

831
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,060
little community because it's so like shunned by, I mean, that's probably true of everybody who's

832
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,700
got a community like that, you know? Oh, I've, I've definitely, this is definitely true. Like,

833
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:32,180
the more that you voice opinions against furries, the more they will come away brazen in their

834
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:37,540
attitude. I honestly think, I think that on some level, I don't know how deliberate this is, but

835
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:44,660
I definitely think that it's understood by a lot of the furries that a lot of the outlandishness of

836
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:52,020
it, I think, is deliberate to keep people away. Because like, no one, yeah, no one fucks with

837
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,580
furries because everyone thinks they're disgusting and crazy. Like, furries, like-

838
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:00,260
You got your, like, Mr. Medicurys and those kind of guys who, like, deliberately try to, like,

839
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:04,980
you know, go out and start shit with these people. Yeah, but like, for the most part, I feel like

840
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:11,460
furries, like, the sign on the door is like, this is, this is how fucked it's gonna be in here,

841
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:17,300
so is that something you relate to? If so, come along and like, if you make it past that barrier,

842
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,740
it's like you're already, I think that's why there's such a hug box is that, like,

843
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:26,020
you've made it past this incredible barrier of, like, sacrificing your own conception of

844
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:32,420
your social normalcy. You're not wrong. You're not wrong. I mean, you're basically saying, like,

845
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:38,260
I am committing to never being a normie again. Like, something similar happened. I mean, at least

846
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:44,660
while you identify, it's not a complete transformation. That is true. Yeah, I mean, and you can, you

847
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:52,260
can stop being a furry one day, if you so desire. I'm just possibly burn and bury all footage of

848
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,820
you having been a furry. There's probably plenty of pictures out there, because these are cons are

849
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:02,820
all well documented. Yeah, social media. But like, I just think that there's, there's an element of

850
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:07,700
the fact that you even are willing to call yourself a furry is enough to give you some

851
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:13,060
camaraderie that, like, you are willing to, you know, stand in this world that, that where furries

852
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:18,660
are literally the bottom rung of society, they're everyone's punching bag. And yet, like, if you're

853
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,820
willing to call yourself that, then it's like, all right, you've made it into the herd, you know.

854
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:28,100
I think furry is, I would, I would give furries the, the immaculate distinction of being

855
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:33,780
the lowest level, like the lowest rung of society, that it doesn't quite make sense to, like,

856
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,660
deliberately mock or shame. Like, and like, when you get to, like, other can right below them,

857
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:42,340
at that point, it's like, well, okay, now that's open season, like, these people are insane.

858
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:46,740
But, you know, unless they're, I guess, they're playing around, whatever. By the way, by the way,

859
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:51,060
I just, I namedrop Mr. Medeker before, he actually is more charitable towards furries,

860
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,340
and he's just harder on, like, other can. So I just want to, like, I don't like hate the guy,

861
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,580
he's not like insane or anything, just, just saying. People might be like, why do we feel

862
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:03,300
the need to come on this? We are not furry experts. We, we, we, people like this are all the time

863
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,500
where they're like, oh, you don't know everything there is to know about physics. How dare you have

864
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:14,660
a nihilism episode? What the fuck are you doing, you dumb bitches? But, but, like, are, like,

865
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:19,620
are we not allowed to comment on things as we see them? Because it's not, it's not like we are

866
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:23,860
forming them out, out of the ether, purely from, like, going into fortune and hearing

867
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:29,860
secondhand information. We've all seen furries. I mean, it's also not, it's not as though at the end

868
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:36,020
of a PCP episode, whatever conclusion we've come to about, like, how we should all think about

869
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,380
this. We press a button and now, like, it is so, you know, like, oh, I've, we've, oh, we've concluded

870
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:45,860
furries are bad. I press this button and now that's what the world is from this point forward.

871
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:51,300
It's like, there's no consequence to this show. Well, this is, this is a comedy show, everybody.

872
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,300
It's just the conversation. And like, that's, I guess that's the interesting part is like,

873
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,740
because for everybody who's like into the furry thing, being like, they're missing so much the

874
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:03,860
important nuance, like, there's also people who are outside. If you feel that way, please look

875
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,420
at what we're like, this is how even people who are close to furries think of them. So if we're

876
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,540
wrong, this is your PR, motherfucker. Like, you gotta do something about it. I think we've been

877
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:18,500
pretty magnanimous here, relatively speaking, I think. I mean, I mean, at the end of the day,

878
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:24,420
I don't have any ill will. This has happened before on other episodes, where I am a fucking

879
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:29,700
knowledgeable saint. And I will just say what I say if you'll be like, you missed this, you didn't

880
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:35,860
factor this into your equation. But I did know that fact, and it just wasn't important. Like,

881
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:40,740
you can say a bunch of shit in the comments about how like furries are like all grain stuff,

882
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,980
or even about how they're all bad. And I will have considered them because I think about this

883
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:50,340
literally constantly. I know everything that you could possibly say. And this is my opinion.

884
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,180
People like, like the reason I feel the need to comment on this isn't just because I want to be a

885
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,620
funny people with my friends. I don't want to be, I just want to be funny people. No, it's because

886
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:03,300
I have to think about this. This isn't a joke anymore. This has reached a stage where I could

887
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,620
no longer deny that furries exist and go on with my day just treating them like, ah, they're just

888
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:14,420
fucking like elves or like trolls. No, furries are real. And I have, I have to, I have to acknowledge

889
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:21,380
them. It's suffering. I don't like this. I want them to go back to being jokes. I don't like this.

890
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:25,060
You know, I wonder if like you said at the beginning, and I just remembered my thought,

891
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:29,700
I thought of the comparison to like the flat earth thing where like that's definitely started as a

892
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,780
joke and a troll, but it just started gaining steam because I don't know, people just like,

893
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:38,340
we're like, you know what, that's actually not a bad idea. Let's, let's get in on that. And I'm not

894
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:42,180
trying to shame furries and saying there was craziest flat earthers or anything, but you know,

895
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,700
just, just saying funny comparison. The conclusion I've come away with from this podcast is that I

896
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:54,500
am a furry. And the only reason I haven't identified it is that I am too much of an

897
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:01,780
elitist when it comes to the art that I masturbate to. Like if there were furry artists who just drew

898
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:07,620
anime style, I would be all in on this community because I want to fuck a Pikachu just as badly as

899
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:11,700
this first suitor does, but she is doing a terrible job of making it look attractive.

900
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:17,380
Sure. Link did the show notes. We already mentioned I think this.

901
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:22,580
Indeed. That's the thing. I think like all of us, like, like if some like, you know, guys,

902
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:25,860
if God gave him dad, it's like, Hey, I'm going to make something to peel us to your taste. It's

903
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:29,780
just going to be like an anthropomorphic animal. Like it's that cool. So you would probably be

904
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:35,220
like, yeah, sure. It's not the actual like animal part of it. Like I don't think any of us like

905
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,820
cared that much. The furries, the furries specifically are into that, right? Isn't that what

906
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:43,140
makes them furry as opposed to like, I've jacked off to tons of furry porn, but for me, it's always

907
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:47,220
just like, that's a hot girl and oh, she's a dog or whatever. I mean, that's fine. I'll deal with that.

908
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:53,700
No, what I'm trying to say is that like, it's not like particularly the fact that it is an

909
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,860
anthropomorphic creature. It's just the way that it's always depicted. It's the culture is the

910
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:03,540
culture of society. Indeed. Indeed. It's the context in which the images exist in.

911
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,900
All right, are we going to move on to questions then? I think it's about time. I think it's about

912
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:15,140
time. I just want to quickly say, if it wasn't clear enough by this point, because it probably

913
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:21,140
isn't because it didn't speak much. But you know, overall, I, I like furries in general.

914
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:27,860
And I like the art, say for work art mostly, I like the character designs a lot. Like what

915
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:32,180
really interests me about furries is like, they take an animal and they like make a character

916
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:37,700
design and like the really skilled artists, whenever they like draw like a furry character,

917
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:42,580
is just like, I don't know why I just, I just really like art. Can my sexuality be art because

918
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,660
I really like art? Well, Mage, here's, here's my question for you. You know, we, uh, we haven't

919
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,700
really addressed this, but, and I think I've asked you personally before, I forget the answer off

920
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:54,020
hand though, would you consider yourself a furry? You like your anthropomorphic, you know, animal

921
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:59,300
boys and whatnot? I, I don't know. Like the thing is like, it depends on other people's

922
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:06,020
definition of furry. I myself am not involved in like any furry communities. Uh, I don't talk to

923
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:10,900
that many furries. I have no plans in the future to have a fursuit or I'm not even interested

924
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:15,940
in having a fursuit. I do have a fursona, but that's because I like character designs and

925
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:21,540
I like making characters and it's just really interesting for me. It's just like, for, for,

926
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:26,020
people trying to say stuff like, just because you like like MLP or something that like makes

927
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:30,340
you a brony or something, or just like, I mean, I just hate all the stuff of like, because you

928
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:33,380
like thing or are generally interested, you like now are considered a member of a community. Anyone

929
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:38,980
putting a label on you that you don't put on yourself is disgusting. I couldn't agree more,

930
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,540
could not agree more. Yeah. It's, it's like saying everyone who likes a toke is a furry.

931
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:48,100
So if, if you don't, if, if all those other Ken who refuse to believe that they're human,

932
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:53,620
guess what? We have no right to call them human. We've lost our, our, it's, it's over. We're done.

933
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:58,180
He's right. We fucked it up. Yep. We've all learned something today.

934
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:02,900
All right. Well, I guess that's it. Let's, let's head over to our questions. We're all

935
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:07,540
furries. We admit it. That was the point. That's who we were building to. We all admit it. We're

936
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:11,780
active members of the community. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's something

937
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,260
huge. Okay. What animal would you be, Nate? Like, what would your persona be? What animal would

938
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:21,060
you be? Well, I mean, okay, sure, sure. Uh, everybody always tells me a pig. Sure. That was,

939
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:26,500
that was the old animal design she did for us and Ben and I were orcs. Um, I mean, everyone says

940
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,660
I'm like a dog. My girlfriend says I'm like a dog. I think I bear a lot of resemblance to a

941
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:36,260
dog. It works for me, man. I think I'm a dog. I bear a lot of resemblance to a dog like currently.

942
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:41,540
I resemble a dog. Apparently I look like a German shepherd. I know how much Michelle

943
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,500
like dogs. So that must be, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. It's good for the old romance.

944
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:51,140
Michelle's a furry for sure, but just for dogs. Oh, it even goes with the best guy ever because,

945
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:55,700
you know, what's the best compliment to a dog? The best boy. A good boy. He's a good boy. Yeah.

946
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,900
Works for me. I think I could be a dog. I think you can make a strong argument for a dog. I think

947
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:07,300
it could also be a raccoon or an owl. I would definitely ban a raccoon is fucking perfect.

948
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,860
I was going to go with sloth. I was going to go with sloth. Especially because a raccoon has got

949
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:17,220
like kind of an edgy like design and everything. No, you're all missing the most obvious point.

950
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:22,100
Raccoons dig through everyone's trash. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's perfect. It's perfect.

951
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,900
Pensacoon for sure. It's got it. I mean, you know, raccoons are actually nasty. Like they're

952
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:32,500
actually idiots. Yeah, exactly. Deeply unpleasant creatures. I know you're saying all the right

953
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:37,540
things. All right. Have you seen their hands? Have you seen a raccoon's hands? Oh, yes, grimy.

954
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:42,660
They are. They are. They have nasty little like gremlin skeleton hands. Just take a raccoon and

955
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:46,420
have a vape pen in one hand and a, you know, a tablet pen in the other and you got yourself

956
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:52,900
a Ben St right there. All right. I would be a Hopkinsville goblin. That's what my

957
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,940
What the hell is that? Here. That's some other kinship. That is some other kinship.

958
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:07,780
It's this way right here. If I, oh god, why are Google image like links so unbelievably big?

959
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:12,180
Why is that the case? You just got to go to the actual like image.

960
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:20,100
But that's technically not an animal. It's like, no, it's an animal. It's an animal.

961
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:26,420
This is other kin. This is other kin, Munchie. Crippid. Crippid or whatever. Bigfoot is real.

962
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:30,740
So the Hopkinsville goblin. This is just like the time I told the furries that I was a that I was a

963
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:36,740
mind flare. I didn't know that fucking Dungeons and Dragons invented that. Well, wait a kink

964
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,300
shame, Ben. I would definitely be like a normal type Pokemon. I would be like some sort of like

965
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:47,620
bear or like something big and fat and doesn't give a shit. Or like, you know, you know that big

966
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:52,580
like fairy normal type bear that was a tank and like sun and moon. Beware. Beware is pretty good.

967
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:58,580
And he's a very Munchie. The way that that Pokemon is portrayed in the TV show is like a Munchie-esque

968
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:03,300
character. That's true. A power. Because all he does is show up and beat up people and carry them

969
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:10,260
around basically. All right, Digi, what would you be? Oh, I would be a walrus, probably.

970
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:16,420
A walrus. I'd like to be depicted as a walrus. Yeah, okay. Well, I already have a fursona,

971
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:21,540
but I just before I made her like she's a gerboa. That's like a like a little

972
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:28,340
right mouse thingie. That's a Raichu is right? Wait, is he? Oh, yeah, I think Raichu is one of

973
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:37,380
those based on it. No, don't you boas. You know, Mew is actually more gerboa-esque than a cat-esque.

974
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:42,580
Oh, yeah, that's true. With his weird old legs. Yeah, okay. Even the tail. And he'll like, yeah,

975
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:50,580
gerboa, hopping mouse, whatever. It's cute little hoppy legs. I love it. But before I made her,

976
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:59,540
I was heavily debating between like a unicorn or a deer or a bunny because I like this

977
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:06,340
something cute ones. And but like none of them like had all the things I needed because I wanted

978
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:12,900
a long tail and that I also wanted to like be sort of fluffy and cute and long years. Yeah,

979
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:18,500
long years and long tail and like I couldn't I couldn't have that with any of those properly.

980
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,340
So, yeah, then I found gerboa and then all my prayers were answered.

981
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:29,220
Well, if there was ever evidence of God, there it is, everybody. And Tom and Tom, I think I'm

982
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:33,460
thinking guerrilla. I'm thinking a guerrilla. A powerful beast. Oh, I think you're on the right

983
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:38,260
track. I think like a like what's the what's the long monkey? There's like a long monkey. There's a

984
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:51,540
long monkey. What's a given? A orangutan. You know, I could see Tom as like a lemur.

985
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:57,300
Okay, I don't think I don't think orangutan hits. Well, okay. Well, what does Tom think though?

986
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:04,020
I literally never thought of this before. So you're all in floor informing me very deeply right

987
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:11,460
as like a dust skull. I'm not I'm not I'm not dust skull. I'm not opposed to lemur lemur would

988
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:17,620
be kind of cool. I was all I was going to say was my favorite my favorite animals are crows. I

989
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:24,500
find crows fascinating. I can see ravens and crows are cool as shit. I can say you'd be a raven

990
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:29,860
because that's like the fucking raven that's so like fucking big. Yeah, I like the bigger versions

991
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:36,100
of crows, right? I think crows are bigger. Oh my god. Guys, this literally looks like Tom. Hold on.

992
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:42,420
This is Tom. That I mean, I see a result. I opened up discord and saw the heart Hopkinsville

993
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:53,540
goblins. Got it. All right, let's get on the fucking questions. All right. Okay, draw us as our first

994
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:59,780
is everyone. Yes, please. All right, yo, Twitter at TP Crasnators. Follow us for announcements

995
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:04,580
of stuff. And yo, here's a question. Hashtag ask bcp. Send questions using the hashtag. Okay,

996
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:09,300
here we go. Now here's one that was reading and I like this one. Okay, here we go. It's at chaotic

997
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:14,980
sloth an old patron of mine. What's up, buddy says up in your own opinion. Do you have to like a person

998
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:19,780
to be able to like their content? And for some reason, he adds animations don't count. I don't

999
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:26,900
know why he would throw that in the trash. Throw that in the trash. Yeah, what is different? What

1000
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:32,500
at all is different? Okay, mage, what do you think? What do you think? The reason he mentioned is

1001
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:38,740
because of the recent controversy in the anime community with Princess molestia getting her

1002
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:45,380
own anime at a long last. It's like the guy who made that really cute over Rony Kenshin or whatever,

1003
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:55,700
right? Like it was just a sugar cube. All right, sorry. I'm more recent one. Like, oh yeah,

1004
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:02,020
I'm a mo junkie. That anime. Oh, what did he do? What did he do? One of the directors, like, I think

1005
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:13,140
he's like confirmed to be an actual Nazi. And he's denying an actual Nazi for what? Yeah, I mean,

1006
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:18,900
I get in, he's denying the Holocaust. Oh, who hasn't denied the Holocaust? You know what's

1007
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:25,380
interesting about that? That is so weird of a thing to even know about an anime director. Like,

1008
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:32,980
how many anime directors do you know any element of their personality? Because the controversy

1009
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:38,020
was so big it reached me and I hate that. There was a huge Twitter snap. He publicly just kept

1010
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:45,060
doing it on Twitter. Even if this is a thing that happened, I still don't see why it merits an

1011
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:52,420
exception for animation. And Ben means the Holocaust. I'm not surprised about this. So,

1012
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:58,180
is it the anime director and not like the American? I'm not surprised that an old Japanese man would

1013
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:02,660
deny the Holocaust at all. I'd be surprised if most of them even know what it is. He's not that

1014
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:08,100
old. It can't be that old. I mean, the Japanese and the Germans were allies. That's like saying

1015
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,260
your best friend from back in the day killed a bunch of Jews. I'm looking this up. I mean,

1016
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:17,220
how do they know? Nobody fucking knows anything. I don't know. You know what's funny about this,

1017
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:24,100
though? It's interesting to note that, by the way, it is the director. It's Kazuyoshi Yaginuma.

1018
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:32,580
But it's interesting to note that at long last, it seems like anime maker people

1019
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:40,740
like the people who nobody has given a shit about in the West, Japan's a pretty right-wing conservative,

1020
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:46,580
especially with immigration and stuff and race issues. At long last, people are starting to

1021
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:53,620
care about what they think and they're finally facing some backlash. I think I had a moment

1022
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:58,580
actually a while back where I was like, you know, I'm really excited about the fact that

1023
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:02,020
all these animators and everything are on Twitter and we have more open communication.

1024
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:09,300
But this cannot take long before this leads to something like this. And I just didn't expect

1025
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,780
someone to come out as a fucking holocaust to die. Well, let's do this. Listen to this. Okay,

1026
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:19,540
quote from Kazuyoshi. Here it is. One bit September 8th, 2012. Have you looked into

1027
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:28,580
whether Anne Frank's diary is real? Oh, no. I mean, I haven't. I haven't.

1028
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:39,540
I love you, Jesus Christ. This guy's a big Utermilk hotel fan, for sure. Well, that's something.

1029
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:43,540
Jesus Christ, I love you.

1030
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:57,300
In the airplane over the seam, I do. I had heard of this, but I haven't looked into it very much.

1031
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,380
And I just want to say that like, just because you deny the holocaust does not actually make

1032
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:05,380
you a Nazi. I'm just putting that out there. You could be an anti-Semite. You can hate the Jews.

1033
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:14,500
I'm not putting that on you. But also, Japan, if you recall, everybody, Japan had a pretty

1034
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,860
cozy relationship with the Nazis back in the day. So they've been across the board pretty forgiving.

1035
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,820
I feel like holocaust and Nile is probably pretty rampant.

1036
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:28,500
It's probably rampant across a lot of the world outside of America and Europe.

1037
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:34,740
They did Nan King, man. Yeah, Nan King was like a nightmare.

1038
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,900
The Nan King incident, as they recall.

1039
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,820
Fuck, I forgot what I was going to goddamn say. I kept talking about the fucking Nan King shit.

1040
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:49,460
Well, I mean, regardless, I think once this Pandora's Box open and we start to actually judge

1041
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:54,580
like Japanese creators by their opinions, I think that is Pandora's Box.

1042
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:58,180
I was going to say, to answer the actual fucking question,

1043
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:05,300
yes, I think you could enjoy art regardless of the creator, but it really depends on the

1044
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:10,420
piece because sometimes you feel like the creature, like sometimes I look at something like Ruroni

1045
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:15,860
Kenshin. I don't think the original manga is even all that good, but like the offshoots of it,

1046
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:21,780
clearly there's no influence of this guy's being a fucking pedophile on Ruroni Kenshin,

1047
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:25,860
other than maybe there's like a couple of cute younger characters. There's not even really

1048
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:32,340
any lollies in it. There's a couple of minor ass characters. They are cute though, but like

1049
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:37,460
the series, you don't have to think about that when watching Ruroni Kenshin. It's not going

1050
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:41,140
to strike you. You're not going to watch a scene and be like, oh, this totally reminds

1051
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:46,340
me of the fact that he was a pedophile, but there's other stuff like some music, for instance,

1052
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:54,340
where the musician is so baked into the song that if you don't like them as a person,

1053
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:58,820
it's unavoidable when you're listening to the music that you're being hit with their

1054
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:02,660
personality basically. It's going to remind you of the things you don't like about though.

1055
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:07,620
Yeah, you also have to keep in mind that a lot of mediums are made by more than just one person,

1056
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:11,860
for instance, that anime that I said. He's just a director. He's like a whole

1057
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:18,260
slew of people working on that anime. Just because he's, let's say, a scumbag, doesn't mean

1058
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:23,860
no, you have to shame the anime. That's a fair point. That is a fair point. I haven't seen it,

1059
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:29,380
but I believe you. A lot of people have said that it's quite good, and the main character

1060
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:34,980
reminds me of you. The director didn't make the source material of it anyway. It's not his story.

1061
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:41,220
It's fair to criticize the man himself if you strongly disagree with him,

1062
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:46,660
and you can choose to not want to. Well, that's the thing. But are you supporting him so much?

1063
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:51,460
If you are supporting him by supporting his work, and if so, does that support his belief

1064
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:57,140
structure? I honestly don't think it would even be possible to support that guy by buying the

1065
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:02,180
work, because for what it's worth, first of all, it's not how anime works. If you buy a

1066
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,460
Blu-ray, it doesn't just put money in the director's pocket. And second of all, that

1067
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:10,660
dude's probably going to get fired and blacklisted at this point. Who knows how Japan works with

1068
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:18,340
stuff. Japan is just very anti-PR at anything. The fact that he has bugs around him is the

1069
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:23,060
problem. It's not what he said. It's that you can't be a controversial figure.

1070
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:29,540
The question, I think the answer to this is obviously, yes, you can enjoy work. But that

1071
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:36,740
doesn't mean that you always will be able to or even want to. If the politics leak into the work,

1072
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:41,300
and you don't like them, it's going to be hard to ignore. At that point, you hate the product,

1073
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:48,660
not the person. Who did not just use you, for example, did you? Sure, your anime essays could

1074
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:56,420
be those standalone, but they do require people to know about you and lead to you, the person.

1075
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:05,300
I mean, it really depends. I mean, I've always kept the main channel relatively clean in certain

1076
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:14,900
ways. I don't run around saying nigga constantly on that channel. The way I see it, I want people

1077
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:19,620
who wouldn't be okay with that to be able to enjoy my videos so that I can cast a wider net,

1078
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:25,220
so that I can make more money. When you come to the side channels, I don't give a fuck, because

1079
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:32,100
ultimately, I would rather just do whatever I want than be an acceptable artist on any level.

1080
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:39,780
In order to maintain making money from a larger amount of people who I am deliberately dooping,

1081
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:45,540
like I'm deliberately not showing them the entire picture of myself, as most people don't. Most

1082
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:51,780
people don't show you everything about themselves, even if it's something that is public about them

1083
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:56,660
in another way. On the internet, all those things kind of bleed together if they're all under the

1084
01:38:56,740 --> 01:39:02,340
same name. And you can call that dooping, but really, no matter what situation we're in, there

1085
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:08,260
are things that we choose to offer and choose to not offer in a given situation. Would you not call

1086
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:16,420
that dooping? Well, it's more just withholding information that you don't need. People who

1087
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:21,700
watch the Otaku Gaza Journalist channel don't need to know that I'm a guy, a white boy who says

1088
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:26,900
niggah all the time. That is irrelevant to those videos that I'd prefer they just not think about

1089
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:31,940
it. I'm not saying that it is dooping. I don't think it is, but I would think that Nate would

1090
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:37,700
think it is. I'm surprised that he doesn't. Technically, you could call that dooping,

1091
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:43,220
but it's just if you call that dooping, you have to define basically every human interaction as

1092
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:48,020
also dooping to some degree. Didn't we talk about how you consider every human action deceit?

1093
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:53,460
Yes, and this is exactly that issue. I think what he's saying is that the word dooping would

1094
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:00,580
lose meaning if we applied it to all. Then why is holding an open the door for someone deceit?

1095
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:07,300
We're talking about degrees here. We're talking about degrees. Is this the part of the episode

1096
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:11,940
where we have to splice in all of the weird utilitarian episodes? Please splice it in, everybody.

1097
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:16,180
God damn it. Well, okay, I think we've basically covered this question. So,

1098
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:20,340
chaotic sloth, thanks for the good one. That was a juicy one. That was a hashtag,

1099
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:26,020
not bad question from Twitter. Hashtag. This is from the Patreon lounge. Donate any amount to

1100
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,820
get into the Patreon lounge and you can answer the exclusive questions. Patreon.com is like

1101
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:34,580
the procrastinators. Yes. This is about Julian my Julian. How do we get closer to PCPHQ? What

1102
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:40,100
does the roadmap look like to that? Well, the roadmap is wait for digits to move and then it,

1103
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:44,900
yeah, throw money and just wait. Yeah, I mean, like some of us are just already like,

1104
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:50,500
I'm moving very soon because I have to move at the end of May. Like there's no question about that

1105
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:55,700
and my plan is move to Boston because I mean, at this point, I like it's too late to even change

1106
01:40:55,700 --> 01:41:01,780
plans. So, so we're going to Boston. Make the best of it. Yeah. And I mean, Tom's already there.

1107
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:07,380
Munchie's already planning to go there. You know, it wouldn't be hard for if Nate decides he's,

1108
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,860
you know, ready to finally leave his job, then that's probably where he's going. So like,

1109
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:16,500
it's just kind of a matter of time. But if you want to grease the wheels and make sure that it

1110
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:20,980
actually happens and nothing fucks up, keep throwing money at us because we need the money to

1111
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:27,220
make it happen. I mean, PCPHQ is entirely a financial issue. Yeah, that's correct. That's

1112
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:31,620
correct. Yeah. I mean, yeah, everybody, I don't expect anybody to go way out of their way. And

1113
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:37,220
like, I don't, I generally dislike the idea of like giving money for like future projects that

1114
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:40,820
aren't specifically being promised. Like I certainly wouldn't give it. I mean, you got to think of

1115
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:47,380
yourselves as a production committee and are you willing to take a risk on a product you want

1116
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:52,900
to see exist? Like if you spend that money now, you're making an investment towards the idea that

1117
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:58,340
a type of content you think you want, at the very least, might come to fruition. Will you be horribly

1118
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:04,020
disappointed? It's possible. But like, yeah, sure. I mean, that's a perfectly fine way to think about

1119
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:07,860
and like, again, everyone's making a personal decision, whether they give to a patron or not,

1120
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:12,020
and for what reasons. And we have specifically stated that like one of our intentions is to make

1121
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:16,180
PCPHQ happen. If we had more money, we could start making steps in that direction. I'll tell you

1122
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:22,180
right now, for me, the thing that is holding me back from currently going charging all speed ahead

1123
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:28,420
is purely like the need to or like leaving my job is the thing I need to do and being financially

1124
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:32,660
stable. So when I can earn enough money to make sure that's safe and frankly, I'm probably going

1125
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:37,060
to depend on that like whatever whatever that income is, like the portion I get from the PCP

1126
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:40,980
and the portion I get on my own, like that needs to be at a certain level where I think like,

1127
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:46,660
okay, I can I can do this. And you know, it's become a reality that like I'm pretty pretty,

1128
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:51,300
it's not that I'm comfortable at my job, but like, it's got me in a situation where I'm making

1129
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:56,100
enough money that I can keep building up my savings for a while. So to me, I think the logical thing

1130
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:00,980
to do is either my just income on YouTube stuff just goes way up and looks like it's going to stay

1131
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:06,740
that way for a while, or I like work for a while longer, save up more money so that I can take

1132
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:10,740
that risk and you know, jump out there and I'd like to do it as soon as possible. It's all I'm

1133
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:17,700
saying. Do you have any timeframe just for art? I was really hoping it would be in 2018. Looking

1134
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:24,020
at the math, I don't know if that's actually exactly right. So I guess I'd say my hope is like

1135
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:29,300
early 2019. That's my current thoughts, but I have to play it by ear. I have to play it by

1136
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:36,500
ear. All the other questions in the patron lounge are like terrible. How about this question from

1137
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:41,940
Bobby Meow 13? Here's the question, freemium games pay to win mechanics? Question mark?

1138
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:56,900
Um, yes. Yes. Exactly. Yes. Thank you. What's your persona? Wait, okay. Here's one. Here's

1139
01:43:56,900 --> 01:44:01,940
one that Cyrus asks, do you think Kanye West is a furry because he always portrays as a bear in his

1140
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:07,860
old album? It was embarrassed by it and didn't read it out loud. There you go. I just wanted to

1141
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:12,740
say Kanye because he's a good boy. I'm looking forward to the new album. Hurry up, boy. This is,

1142
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:17,380
I'm looking at the list of questions. Yeah, I know. It's really upsetting. Giffy thoughts on

1143
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:29,380
passivism. Moving on. We got a question from Hippocrite. Where's Carcat? He's right here.

1144
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:34,820
Carcat, why don't you say something? There's no reason we can't just all have three questions

1145
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:39,380
at the show, right? Like, we can just do that. You know, he's right. We can do whatever we want.

1146
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:42,740
Fuck you guys. Ask him better questions if you want to be read on the goddamn show.

1147
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:48,660
That's perfectly good. Perfectly good. Why is it every episode the proof becomes more and more

1148
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:52,740
evident that you can have wit and you can have, or you can have money, but you can't have both?

1149
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:59,620
Yeah, well, fair enough. I think they just try to rush to be like, to like ask as fast as possible

1150
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:05,620
without like, I mean, the reality is they've got an hour and a half. Yeah, yeah. Bruh on it for

1151
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:09,540
a while, guys. Maybe they think we ask right before we start the section or something. Yeah,

1152
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,660
we should clarify that for everybody. Just so you know, if you're asking a question either on

1153
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:18,340
Twitter or on the Discord, you have at least an hour for when the message goes out to form

1154
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:23,700
like, because we do the whole episode. In fact, you're actually probably, you're better off waiting,

1155
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:29,300
because if you respond to our tweet right when we post it, we're not going to dig back and see it,

1156
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,980
because we're only going to ask a question. It's better to wait like an hour and a half at least

1157
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:37,220
before you respond to it. At least an hour. Well, I mean, usually we take most of our stuff from

1158
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:42,340
the Discord, but like, they do usually like the first 10 minutes after we post a question,

1159
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:46,420
a bunch of shitty questions get posted that everybody shuts up and it's like, well,

1160
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:54,020
that wasn't helpful. Let me ask you about this, guys. The Q&A is like almost always terrible.

1161
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:57,780
No, I disagree. I totally disagree. Yeah.

1162
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:04,660
I was going to ask, like, what's the point of it? It's funny and entertaining is the point for me.

1163
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:13,140
I think we always choose good questions. They're just rarely our ones to find.

1164
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:18,820
Okay, when there are good questions, it is nice. But I feel like every episode is just like,

1165
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:22,980
look at how bad these questions are. I mean, we always say that while we're looking for good ones.

1166
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:27,620
This is why we need to do questioner rules. We've talked about this a few times here and there.

1167
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,100
Why are we talking shop on the middle of the show?

1168
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:40,180
At TP Crasnators, that's the Twitter. Check it out for announcements and all kinds of stuff.

There's like 12 now. There's a huge library being built. And they're all pretty fucking great.

1172
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:59,860
To clarify, there's 12 and you get them all. I don't know if everybody understands this,

1173
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:06,500
but when you have a patron reward, you get all of it. So like when you patron DigiBro,

1174
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:11,780
you get like hundreds of hours of commentaries of me and DeVoo watching back all of my videos.

1175
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:16,820
That's enough personal shilling, you fucking bitch. I'm definitely editing that out.

1176
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:21,540
Oh, excellent. But that's it, everybody. Thanks for joining. We will see you next week

1178
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:29,220
time. All right, thanks for being around and we'll see you next time. Bye.

1179
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:40,500
I am a furry. I love Anthrocon. See you at Anthrocon. See you at Anthrocon. Yeah.

1180
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,180
Yeah. Yeah.
