00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is a podcast called The Pro Crastinators Podcast. A variety podcast running since 2015.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is a special edition of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We are going to be talking about and playing everyone's favorite game, Nuclear Throne.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell them why I am.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm your host, Ben Saint. Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Didn't you draw something?

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The.com slash Davoo.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And I'm the first person who's talking over other people.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And you're Munchy.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And Munchy. Our friend Munchy.com slash Munchy.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to become a wrestler.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Didn't you draw something, Ben?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, I didn't think so.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is the exclusive portal to find my work.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
StComics.com.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I drew a comic.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And Davoo, don't you also claim to do something worthwhile?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I made a video about Nuclear Throne. And that's the only video I've ever made.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, mama. That's really greasing up my.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Something that may be relevant to the people listening to this is that Munchy, you're the one who's drawn all of Digibroses' YouTube avatars, eh?

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes. That's true. And I hate every single one of them.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, you.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I like your work, Munchy. I think your work has a lot of character to it.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You make that hard line edging looking look better than most people do.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's what I fucking hate about it.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, you hate the hard lines.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You do a pretty decent job with it.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All right. Well, this is about the one and only game, the one game ever made, Nuclear Throne.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Right, so Munchy, you are the resident expert because you're the only one that's beaten the throne.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You double looped, oh my gosh. I don't even know what double looping means.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It means beating the game twice.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, well, I guess I could have used my context.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In a row, like without dying. And it gets harder the second time.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
God, you're fucking, I'm supposed to see his magic sage, Davoo. He doesn't know anything.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's like a little fucking baby who can't learn anything.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm supposed to be the teacher.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I haven't looked up anything about the game. I've tried not to spoil myself.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's good. That's what everyone should do.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've just watched my video on it, a status update.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I still haven't gotten past Little Hunter, but well before even making the video,

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've watched play sessions of people looping up to four times.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've even watched people looping twice on the most recent edition of the game.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I am quite familiar with it. So, yeah.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you guys playing right now? I'm playing.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, I'm playing right now.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know if this is the thing that's ever going to catch on.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's this new genre that we've invented, this terrible abomination of content.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ultra podcast 3D. Let's play a radio show, but you don't get to see the game.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't get to see it. And it's not like a podcast where one of the people is only,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is playing it and everyone else gets to just talk.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We're all going to be distracted playing it.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And you have to hear us making the noises.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is going to be as much bedlam as the world of Nuclear Throne itself.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You know, I'm okay with that.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Listen, guys, I'm going to update you on my progress right now.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I have employed the secret ancient technique of ignoring weapon chests,

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and I just got a super chest and I just got, I just got a wrench.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Fuck yeah, I just got a wrench. That means I'm all set for the sewers.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, well, I definitely found that out.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wrench is my way of life.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The game tells you.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, Wrench was my way of life until I unlocked chicken.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm currently playing chicken right now.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
When you have chicken, you don't need the wrench, which is great,

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
because I don't even, I never, there was to be, sometimes I'd start playing

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and I wouldn't get the wrench in the first couple of levels,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
so I just start over.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because without the wrench, it's not worth it.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, I can manage the sewers with a gun, but I don't like to.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You people are fucking babies.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's not that I think the wrench is kids.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I could pick you up and throw you to do.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, no, it's not that it's not, it's not, it's not that the wrench is easy.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's that it's fun as hell.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It is fun.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
By the way, I just died in the sewers, which obviously means I'm pretty distracted.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, my gosh, God.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay, hold on.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How many hours do you have in this game, Davoo?

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have like 23.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, man.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And you haven't even seen the labs yet, dude.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't know what labs.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I've seen them on YouTube.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I know.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wrench, that's absurd.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How do you know they even exist if you haven't seen it?

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Everyone could be lying to you, Davoo.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, I've always been on the lookout for that kind of stuff.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wrench, did you check how much time I have?

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes, yes, you have 19 hours.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, cool.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah, I know.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wow.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
See, because for me, 23 hours is impressive.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Like, that's as much time as I spend on games these days.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Davoo, Davoo, Davoo.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have 372 hours in this game.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Excellent.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, my God.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, fuck.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right, well, I'll just, I think I expected to get, I expected to get good at this game faster than I actually have.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's been harder than I thought because I was already in Binding of Isaac Pro from back in the day.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This game is very different.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I mean, it's basically the same game.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, it's so different.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's basically the same game.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's, it's in principle, in principle, it's the same.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
One, it doesn't look bad.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't...

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Binding of Isaac look great.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean, okay, maybe it'll look great.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Cause like, when I'm actually playing Super Meat Boy, I think as, that's the same artist, right?

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes, yes.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not fun for me to watch, but when I'm playing it, I'm like, okay, whatever.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I disagree actually.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think...

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But even it doesn't look that good in my opinion.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm just like, it just looks like everything is really dull.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Maybe it's because I spent lots and lots and lots of time on Newgrounds.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm jaded to that look.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But with Nuclear Throne, it was, I was looking for something to make a video out of and then one screenshot into looking at Nuclear Throne.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm like, that looks like something I would be into.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The art is the only thing I can't nitpick in this game because I fucking love it.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
One look at Nuclear Throne and I was pretty much sold.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It immediately looks exactly like the kind of game I want to play.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This was actually, this game, getting into this game was the end of me like, talk, like being worried about pixel art.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Talking about how maybe we should stop doing pixel art.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Pixel shit!

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I love pixel shit.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Cause I was like...

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I love pixel shit.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What is this Undertale game?

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Pixel art always...

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's just some pixel shit, man.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Pixel art always works out well.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I'm just like, it makes games look so similar.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But then I was like, I was playing Nuclear Throne and I'm like, you know what?

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, but that's not really true.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Fuck it.

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Forget about it.

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh yeah, they all look way different.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's the other thing.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But also, it's just too effective.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It just works too well to not use it constantly.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I mean, it's a simple, effective way.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
To look professional.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like, yeah.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And it works.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And it fucking works.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So why shouldn't people do it?

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Cause in my journeys of trying to dig up random obscure Steam games to make videos out of,

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I've discovered just how many...

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like, we all know about those Steam Greenlight trailer things that are utterly terrible.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But there's a lot of stuff that's like in a middle ground period where it's a competent game.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like on the level of an old LJN game rather than on the level of Big Riggs, for instance.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And those are the most unpleasant in a way because it's like, wow, this person is actually good at one thing.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like, some of them will have decent level design.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Some of them will have decent graphics.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And it's like, if only this guy worked in a team where he only had to do the one thing he's good at,

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
instead of all the millions of other things he's not good at.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They always have terrible font choices.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're usually really badly optimized.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And things feel gross and unprofessional.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But when they're pixel art, that's never...

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's almost...

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's not as much of an issue usually.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I'm just like, dang it.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I guess pixel art just has to be a thing.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And we just have to love it as much as we want to.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, see, I think pixel art is better than anything.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, I can't necessarily disagree.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I mean, that's why I don't like...

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I just like the aesthetic.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I just like the anti-Islist and shit.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't like it.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I just like the aesthetic, even aside from all the development advantages it offers.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like, in order to have an aesthetic that's as appealing as Nuclear Throne without pixel art,

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
you have to be Ori and the Blind Forest level.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And it's like, nope.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Have you guys seen...

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Have you seen a sword and sorcery?

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've seen it.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know anything about it, but I've seen one screenshot.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Now there's a game with pixel art that's really attractive and really unique.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It really has its own atmosphere to it.

198
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sure I know the name.

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sure I know the game.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I just can't connect the name to the game when the name is that generic sounding.

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Dude, imagine a dude with a sword and he's in like a medieval times.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's that one, yeah.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a girl though.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't want 90% share.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I got to the rainy zone and then died again.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Again, I'm just running shit up.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The rainy zone?

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a junkyard, right?

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, junkyard.

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just died on Mad Dog.

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Scrapyard.

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, I just died on Mad Dog.

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What I like about chicken is that I can run into fucking everything.

215
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then even when I die, I have a chance of coming back.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Actually, when I died, I actually did come back, but I got my health back by hitting one of those explosion sniper guys.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I killed myself in reviving myself and died again.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Dude, I used to do that all the time.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've pretty much gotten over.

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I haven't unlocked.

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've only unlocked like half the characters.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Like chicken is the most recent one I've unlocked.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I haven't unlocked white bee yet.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I just unlocked chicken today.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Dude, white bee, I keep telling you how to do it too.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I know, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can do it in this podcast.

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, you should do that.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He's the second best character in the game, dude.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wait, who?

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I gotta get the freaking...

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh my god.

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's the cool one.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The Eskimo.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The triangle.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, young Venus.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And it's so cool because it's like, I've seen like one fan art picture of him with Bill from Gravity Falls.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh my fucking god.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They're the same character.

243
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh my fucking god.

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They're the same character.

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know they are.

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I know they are.

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's like reliving everything that I used to be.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Not in like a bad way, but like reliving my experiences with this game, like down to a T.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I like that.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, I see.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So it's like, so it's like you're looking at it through our fresh eyes.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're like a newborn baby.

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're like a newborn baby.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's the fact that this is new.

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In all the right ways, Finn.

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is what I hate about early access.

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is a new game, but you're an expert in it.

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You have all these memories in it.

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You know, that's FU.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh yeah, that brings me to the point.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like I said before, as soon as I saw this game, I knew I wanted to play it, but I refused

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
to because it was an early access.

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh.

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, I mean, I've seen very early versions of it.

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It did not look very different in its early ones.

267
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It had most of the same stuff.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I still didn't, I still didn't, I didn't want to play it in early access because I didn't

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
want to get good at a game that would then go on to not count for anything.

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Like, like I play this roguelike game called Dungeon Crawlstone Soup and the game is an

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
active development and every time they update it, like the classes change around all the

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
time.

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like the first time I ever beat the game, I was a crusader and now the crusader class

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
doesn't even exist anymore.

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's been completely retooled and renamed.

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And like, so like if I were to tell someone how I won the game back then, they would be

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
like, they wouldn't even mean anything because the shit didn't even exist anymore.

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Gosh darn it.

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I died in the sewers again.

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Again, I'm just running right into everything.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is great.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm having a good old time, yo.

284
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You know what?

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm okay with that.

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I'm sure the game is too.

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not really trying that hard.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I just killed like three basilisks or salamanders or whatever.

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The single shotgun blast.

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I remember when I first got this game, it was gifted to me by a friend.

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He said, you should play this game, dude.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I said, all right.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then six months later, I decided maybe I should play that game.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yep, destination steam, y'all.

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think the, like literally the second level was just, all right, this is my favorite game.

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's so, it's so, just the way you move and the way you interact with everything is so

298
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
crystal clear and nice and polished.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It has, okay, I maintain that it is basically Binding of Isaac, but it does have a way better

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
game feel.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't know how you can even like, like say that though.

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, there, dude, they're both, they're both, you know, top-down shooters.

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes.

304
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They both have roguelike elements.

305
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They both have randomized, you know, power-ups and permadeath, randomized levels.

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And that's it.

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's it.

308
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wow, they're both in the same genre.

309
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
All right, fine.

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Face it then.

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We don't like you anymore.

313
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well, what other games are there that fit that description?

314
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Other than like obvious knockoffs of one or the other?

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is not like the Binding of Isaac.

316
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I haven't played Rebirth.

317
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
See?

318
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Uh, whatever, man.

319
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Everyone could be lying to you.

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It could be a Gallagher.

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Eventually I'll go back to it.

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, it was, it was an interesting story with, you know, the YV thing because obviously this

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
game came out after Gravity Falls, but YV is based on an older game by the dude from 2010.

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, it's better.

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah.

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's better than Gravity Falls?

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, yes, but then this...

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's better than what?

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Uh, Gun Gods is better than this game only because it sets out to what it achieves to do, I feel.

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait, this game doesn't set out to do what it sets out to do?

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, I'm very jaded with this game and I'm going to explain why because I got, well,

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
what were you about to say then?

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I was going to say, yeah, tell us why you hate this game.

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, dude, what the heck?

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're supposed to... this isn't...

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What is Vayre Emotion, y'all?

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
All right, okay.

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I got this game, I would say, five months before release and there were a lot of features that

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Landbeer, like, wanted to do.

340
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, I wouldn't say wanted to do, but needed to do.

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And they didn't deliver and that's why I'm sort of jaded to the whole thing and I feel

342
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
like whatever...

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You think it could have been better?

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I think that's the one thing with Early Access games that is just inherent.

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's that you, like, see the process of, like, how it's...

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like, all games are like that.

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Like, all games don't end up being quite, you know, if they were initially...

348
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The problem with Early Access is that the audience then shares in on that disappointment.

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So what the heck was missing from this game?

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because it feels quite complete to me.

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, yeah, maybe I don't even want to know what it's missing.

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah, you know what?

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yo, we're doing this podcast for a reason.

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is it missing?

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Cheese, Davoo.

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're getting hostile.

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay, it's missing Friendship Mode, which was four-player co-op, which is a real thing.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh.

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh.

361
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey, hey, hey, Davoo.

362
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This podcast would be a lot better if we could all be playing it together.

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, it would be.

364
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, it would be a lot better if we were all playing in co-op.

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That would be rad.

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is there a planned multiplayer coming?

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, well, there is multiplayer.

369
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There is?

370
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's...

371
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh my...

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There is?

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's local, though.

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, that sucks.

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, I want to tell you my new band name.

377
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's called Extremely Donking Technical Challenge.

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And that's because a quote from Rami when the developer says they're not going to put it in an online multiplayer,

379
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
because it would be an extremely daunting technical challenge for a 2D Twitch game.

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And I really like that quote.

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm going to put it up on my wall.

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Extremely.

383
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I got the screwdriver, so I'm going to hit that against a truck or a vehicle in the junkyard, right?

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you know the car?

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you know what it looks like?

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No, you can describe it to me when I get there.

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's a slightly different color than the other cars.

388
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's all you need to know.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

390
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Right.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, because I've seen footage of YV and read him on the wiki.

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm like, whoa, that is wicked cool.

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
More cool.

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He's more cool than...

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He doesn't seem like the kind of character that I'd want to play,

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
but then again, I think I'm playing the game wrong,

397
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
because I only get real defensively.

398
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Chicken's the character that I want to play,

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
but I just appreciate seeing YV and knowing it's a thing.

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He's more cool than Bill, because he doesn't mess around with a bunch of random kids in freakin' Washington.

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He does whatever once he goes and kills things.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's way cooler.

403
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I like him more because he's black.

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Who? Young Venus?

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Are you black?

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you going to be one of those surprise black people who I didn't think was black?

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Surprise black people?

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Dude, the number of people who turned out to be black, British, or Australian,

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
who I've known online is impeccable, the number.

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, okay, okay.

412
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
First of all, we're going to transition to a new topic.

413
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What do you think I look like based on what you know about me?

414
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like, you're scribing great detail.

415
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, shit, Sledgehammer.

416
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, it's weird because you have such a high-pitched voice or like a pretty high-pitched voice,

417
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but I vaguely remember Digibro describing you as being like looking way older than you are.

418
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Am I getting you confused with someone else?

419
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No.

420
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, that's him.

421
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, because...

422
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know if he looks older.

423
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He just looks bigger.

424
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, I mean, I did have a full beard when I met you, so...

426
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, but it was a young person beard.

427
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
True.

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I feel like it's gotten way thicker and I feel like between my fingers when I rub my face

429
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
sensually during my sessions...

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's very intimidating.

431
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah.

432
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a very intimidating description.

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I want to talk about the game.

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Okay.

435
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I want to talk about strats.

436
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay.

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I want to talk about builds and how you guys...

438
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Builds.

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
...prefer to play.

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Because like I was saying, because I've been playing Crystal and I'm just...

441
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm very disposed in games in general to play with them defensively and to be like very

442
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
healing.

443
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Mm-hmm.

444
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
And so I...

445
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,100
Crystal suits that urge in me, so I'm always getting bloodlust and I'm always getting a

446
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,600
second stomach and just trying to, you know, heal myself as much as I can.

447
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah, everything I pick is healing related pretty much.

448
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Mm-hmm.

449
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Except for the melee extension.

450
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
That's the only thing that I always pick that isn't healing related.

451
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh, you got the melee DLC, the extension pack for it?

452
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,600
No, like the thing that makes your melee more...

453
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Yeah, Davoo!

454
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
...makes you move further.

455
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Okay, cool.

456
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Yeah, Davoo.

457
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Yeah.

458
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Brilliant.

459
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Excellent.

460
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
So I just came...

461
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Whoops.

462
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
I came back to life with chicken and then immediately died again.

463
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, crud.

464
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
And there was a freaking health pack right in front of me.

465
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Dang, dude.

466
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
That's fucking rough.

467
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I like how we just totally just didn't answer a bit.

468
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Davoo, you go first.

469
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm gonna die again.

470
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm a mad dog.

471
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Fucking mad dog, man.

472
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I need concentration for mad dog.

473
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
What is it that I need to answer?

474
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Uh, what have we been asked?

475
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
I don't remember what you asked.

476
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Loadout strats.

477
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Oh, yeah.

478
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, what's your strategy and like what kind of character do you choose to play?

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Um, well, I was playing eyes constantly because it was...

480
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
One strategy I had, which was probably stupid, was holding down the right key constantly

481
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,600
because then, as eyes, it would cause everything to move in a slightly more predictable pattern

482
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
because it's all moving slightly towards me.

483
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
That was my philosophy.

484
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
It was my theory.

485
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Is that if everything is moving towards me, then I'm more in control of the environment

486
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
because I know where everything is going slightly.

487
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,600
But then, of course, it was also very distracting holding down the right key constantly.

488
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
I actually do that, actually.

489
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:18,600
And I think it gets less distracting, but I don't know if it's different strokes or different people.

490
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Eyes seems really weird, and I don't think I want to fuck with them.

491
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Eyes, if you get euphoria in his throne butt, you don't have to play the game.

492
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
What's his throne butt do?

493
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
It makes you win the game.

494
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
What?

495
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm confused.

496
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Basically, it makes his telekinesis much stronger, and by much stronger, I mean, you can stand in front of the throne

497
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
and it won't be able to hit you.

498
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Oh, well, yeah, I've gotten that, but I haven't been able to win the game with it.

499
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Maybe you can beat the final boss with it.

500
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I mean, I would say that I thought his throne butt was much better than it actually is

501
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,600
because on loops, you don't want that many freaks inside of your vicinity.

502
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,600
But I think if you get euphoria and then just normal eyes, he's still good.

503
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I think eyes gets a bad rat.

504
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,600
I hate Crystal's throne butt. I never get it.

505
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I can see why it's good, but I'm not good enough to get the most out.

506
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Crystal's active is a shield.

507
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Crystal's throne butt doesn't last as long, but if you keep holding down the mouse,

508
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
when it cancels, you teleport to wherever your cursor is,

509
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,600
which is really weird, and I can see how it would be so good,

510
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,600
but I always spaz out, and it ends up ending before I expected to,

511
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
so I don't have my cursor in a good position.

512
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I end up teleporting to some places I don't want to be.

513
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
It doesn't make a whole lot of diegetical sense.

514
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,600
It's kind of ineligently conceived right there.

515
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,600
What the heck is that supposed to be in the universe?

516
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,600
I don't know about that. I'm just saying it kills me more often than it saves me.

517
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm actually going to tell you a secret before I go on bin about why I hate this game more.

518
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Do either of you know what the purple weapon's mean?

519
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm in the snow town, by the way.

520
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Do either of you know, have you ever seen a purple weapon?

521
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
No.

522
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Died in the sewers again.

523
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
You're really good to view.

524
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,600
When you get a crown, or have you seen a crown before?

525
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah, I got the crown. I got a crown once.

526
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Okay, when you get a crown, there's a chance that the weapon chest will turn into a purple weapon chest,

527
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
and that will give you a cursed weapon.

528
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh, the cursed ones, yeah.

529
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,600
You can't drop them, but they are like a higher tier than the level that you get it.

530
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,600
If you get a cursed weapon and you go to the crystal caves, which is 4-1,

531
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
something scary will happen, and you'll pee yourself.

532
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Not like in a funny way, but in like a scared, like home alone, like I drank too much Pepsi way.

533
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Home Alone is a funny movie.

534
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,600
I got tired of just running it, so I'm going to actually try now.

535
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Yeah, I feel like there should be a nuclear-thrown character based on Kevin from Home Alone.

536
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
What would Kevin's action be?

537
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
I just had a snow golem throw a car at me, and it hit me, and it's never happened before,

538
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
but luckily I'm crystal, so I can take it.

539
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Oh my god!

540
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Oh man, that sucked.

541
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
When that happened to me, I was like, what the fuck hit me?

542
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Thankfully, I was recording to find out, and I was so mad,

543
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
because I was like, that doesn't look very threatening.

544
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
There's no giant wind-up, there's no giant arrow going,

545
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,600
watch out, this is going to kill you immediately, all at once.

546
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,600
You know, I can't forget to take advantage of Chicken's weapon throw ability,

547
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,600
because that means I can get through this while wielding both my sword and my screwdriver,

548
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,600
without having any actual guns, if I take advantage of her weapon throw ability.

549
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm concentrating so hard trying to dodge all these fucking wolf bullets.

550
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm going back to eyes, all eyes on me.

551
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Ooh, that's something you just said.

552
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Yeah.

553
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,600
First level of Snowden is done.

554
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Wow.

555
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Let's talk about how this game is literally undertale.

556
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,600
One, you have pixels on screen.

557
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
There's hearts.

558
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
Yeah, there's hearts in this game.

559
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
It's a bad time.

560
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
It's a bad time? You always have a bad time.

561
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Well, I mean, the character does, that's for sure.

562
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah.

563
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,600
And also, there's someone who wears a coat.

564
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
There we go.

565
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I think we should get Toby Fox to see this.

566
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Rebel looks exactly like Sans, and it's really distracting.

567
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Well, let's see.

568
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I mean, I guess I can see what you mean by that.

569
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I mean, I saw the sprite and I thought it was Sans for a second.

570
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Wait, who do you think it was, Sans?

571
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Rebel in her costume.

572
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I thought you had bought like a skin.

573
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
No, but believe me, I worked for this.

574
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
So I've got really shitty mutations right now.

575
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I've got Throne Butt, which I don't want because it'll kill me.

576
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Wait, wait, what do you have?

577
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Extra Feet, Hammerhead, or Bolt Marrow.

578
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Bolt Marrow is fucking amazing.

579
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Shut your garbage eating eye hole.

580
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
But I don't have a bolt weapon.

581
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Well.

582
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Alright, fine.

583
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Just because I've never taken it before, I'll take it and I'll get a bolt weapon, I guess.

584
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Believe me, dude.

585
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I didn't tell you what my strats are.

586
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
No, you're the only one whose strats matter.

587
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,600
You're the only one who's winning and won the game.

588
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Why don't you tell me what your strats are, and I'll tell you what you're doing wrong.

589
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah.

590
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
I've told you my strats are get all the healing items.

591
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Killed by Little Hunter.

592
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Yeah, get all the healing items, get Bloodlust, get Second Stomach, get Rabbit's Foot, and Rhino Skin,

593
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,600
and just heal myself into an early grave.

594
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
Alright, well.

595
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Rabbit Paw is necessary for any good run, so you're right there.

596
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Also, I just looped, by the way.

597
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Oh, shit.

598
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
And I died two times, of course, so that's why I'm behind.

599
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
But anyway.

600
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Hold on.

601
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I can't fucking speak.

602
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Crystal, her throne butt.

603
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Let me tell you something, first of all, by the way.

604
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Yeah, please.

605
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Before it was like this, it was still teleporting, but you teleported before you went out of your shield.

606
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,600
You would click on some part of the screen, and you would instantly go there, well inside your shield,

607
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
and then you would come out of it normally.

608
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Oh, so you'd hold the right mouse button, you'd be in the shield, and then while you were shielding,

609
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
you'd click and it would teleport you?

610
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yeah.

611
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
That sounds cool.

612
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Yeah, it was much better, but they decided to nerf her because she was too good, and she still is too good,

613
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,600
because she's a safe character, and I hate safe characters in video games.

614
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Yeah.

615
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,600
And then you just not play them, because I almost never play freaking Crystal,

616
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
because I'm like, okay, I'm tired of dying, time to play the character with the shield,

617
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
but then I go into the shield, and I immediately get bored.

618
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I'm like, all right, back to the crazy ones.

619
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Yeah.

620
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
See, I don't find Crystal boring, because with Crystal, I don't have to wait for enemies to stop.

621
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I don't have to be safe to come out of cover.

622
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I can just rush right out of cover, and I don't have to even fucking worry about anything.

623
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
True.

624
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Like in Dark Souls, almost everything I did, I expect myself to basically be able to run up at things.

625
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:09,600
I didn't wear pants, didn't have any armor, and I got the Demon Spear, because it has a crazy long range,

626
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
and I just played that constantly.

627
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,600
I've never played Dark Souls before, so I can't comment on that, but I will say I want to play Dark Souls,

628
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
because you can be a black guy in it.

629
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Continue.

630
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Well, you're mostly without any skin.

631
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Your blackness will not be appreciated.

632
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
But I can be black, right?

633
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,600
My brother did make a black knight called Sir Homie in Dark Souls.

634
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,600
The point is, I tend to favor characters like chicken.

635
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,600
One recent exception is in Downwell, I picked the version of the game mode where you have the most health,

636
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,600
because you are really slick and fast, no matter which version of that game you pick.

637
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Nobody agrees with me, but for me, Floaty is so much easier than any other mode.

638
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Playing Floaty feels like easy mode to me.

639
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I do like Floaty, that's pretty good.

640
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
I can't, yeah.

641
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Maybe it's because I don't do any other mode, but I've never won on any other mode.

642
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Well, I have never won on any other mode other than I've never won it.

643
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
So, let's talk about Nuclear Throne's characters, which are great.

644
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Wait, no, before you do that on Downwell, I remember I played it for two seconds and said,

645
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,600
this is the hardest thing I've ever seen before in my entire life, and I got my money back, I refunded it.

646
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh, bullshit, bullshit, fuck you, that guy.

647
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Downwell deserves so much.

648
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I would consider Downwell and Nuclear Throne to be pretty similar aesthetically,

649
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,600
not aesthetically in terms of visuals, but aesthetically in terms of how it makes you feel with its challenge,

650
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:45,600
because it's just this impossible challenge that you can just bang your head against 5,200,000 in three times,

651
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,600
and it's still fun every time, so, you know, that's what I like.

652
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
I play Nuclear Throne and Downwell for the same reasons.

653
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
They give me the same kind of thrill.

654
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I don't like going down, I want to see things go up.

655
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,600
That's why I play RuneScape, classic to this day, because I like seeing numbers go up.

656
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I got very tired of ever since Bloons Tower Defense, I permanently jaded myself to numbers.

657
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
That was my...

658
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
That's upsetting.

659
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
It was Bloons Tower's Defense, your 9-11 DeVue.

660
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Yes.

661
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I couldn't defend those towers.

662
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,600
Everyone has, like, some giant grind-em-up game that they played a million hours of,

663
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,600
but it's usually something famous, whereas mine was...

664
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I have many of those.

665
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
Everyone has at least one.

666
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
That was my only one.

667
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
That's like the only game I've ever gotten big into the grind of,

668
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,600
just because instead of... I can't deal with, like, killing things all day,

669
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,600
but popping Bloons as a monkey or as a million monkeys is great.

670
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
So I've sunk between Bloons Tower...

671
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
This is relatable, right?

672
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
You say so.

673
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Between Bloons Tower Defense 4 and 5, I've sunk about over a thousand hours,

674
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
which I know isn't that impressive by many people's standards, but...

675
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh, my God.

676
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Point was, that's how I got jaded to numbers, and now I don't care about numbers at all, hardly.

677
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm sure I'll get back into them,

678
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,600
but for now, I like something like Nuclear Throne or Downwell,

679
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,600
where your numbers don't mean shit the moment you fuck up just a little bit and you die,

680
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
and you get to start back to zero, my favorite number.

681
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Here's what I like.

682
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Here's something I like about Nuclear Throne.

683
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,600
If you, like, fucking up, isn't that frustrating?

684
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Because, like, in another game, like in Downwell, if I get hit early on,

685
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I say fuck it, and I quit, and I restart, because messing up early on

686
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
is like you pay for it the whole game.

687
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,600
In Nuclear Throne, if I get, like, if I completely mess up and I'm, like,

688
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,600
ah, killed by an assassin, if I completely mess up and, like, get down to one health right away,

689
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
it's not really that hard to recover.

690
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Oh, yeah.

691
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
Like, I play smart for a while.

692
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Yeah, ironically, well, I guess it's not ironically.

693
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Nuclear Throne is a lot less depressing than Downwell.

694
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
It's less oppressive than Downwell.

695
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Yeah.

696
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
It's way more fun.

697
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it way more than Downwell.

698
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,600
It's much more interesting looking and more fun to play and stuff.

699
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Interesting look.

700
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Dude, I love the aesthetic of Downwell.

701
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Holy shit.

702
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Oh, yeah, Downwell is great in its own way, but I do, like, Nuclear Throne more.

703
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,600
I think in terms of aesthetics, I would have to go with Downwell,

704
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,600
just because it's, I don't know, it's just a little more unique in its presentation.

705
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Downwell has a more distinct and thick presentation,

706
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
and of course, you can pick your own palette.

707
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Although, once I unlocked the Vivid palette, I was like,

708
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
this is the only palette I want.

709
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
If I had unlocked that before making my video on it,

710
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,600
that would have been like all the footage you would have seen.

711
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Vivid? Which one's Vivid?

712
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,600
The best looking one. It's like, I don't know, it's like,

713
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
it's just the most pleasantly looking one.

714
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't like any, I don't like any of the non-standard ones.

715
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I think they're all inferior to the original.

716
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Well, I guess they do kind of dilute the amount of your Innawell,

717
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,600
and it's dark, and there's things that shine.

718
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
I just make it harder for me to understand what's going on.

719
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
I can't believe I just figured that out.

720
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,600
The whole reason for Downwell's color scheme, how things are brighter on the top,

721
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,600
is because you're in a well and you're seeing the light from the top.

722
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,600
I can't believe I just realized that's why things are colored that way in Downwell.

723
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Yeah, I guess that's kind of true.

724
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
Alright, well we'll discuss this more in depth in Downwell cast.

725
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Going back to Nuclear Throne,

726
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,600
when meditating on 2015 games, and like, what's my favorite character from 2015?

727
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Oh dude, we should totally do a Downwell cast.

728
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
I would be so up for that.

729
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,600
What's going on? Who's having a seizure?

730
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
I died.

731
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I died in the freaking desert.

732
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,600
I died in loop 3-3 to Big Bad Man. Stupid.

733
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I just died, I just died to the freaking, the big, the big bandit.

734
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,600
That's how distracted I'm getting, but at least I'm talking well.

735
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Yes, I realized that the whole cast of Nuclear Throne is my favorite character from 2015.

736
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm going to be a dang downer right now, because I honestly don't feel very much for the characters at all.

737
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
What's the big deal?

738
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,600
What's the big deal about the characters in Nuclear Throne?

739
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
They're just there.

740
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,600
They're mechanically different.

741
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,600
I read the Wiki, because I wanted to make sure I knew my stuff before making videos.

742
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I read the Wiki, and they all have one paragraph bios.

743
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,600
With video game characters, I can judge them based on how they feel to play as.

744
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
That's how I judge video game characters.

745
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
It's like, as eyes, I can freaking pull stuff around.

746
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
And it's like, that's a cool character to be, and so I like him as a character.

747
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Something very progressive, of course, that Nuclear Throne does is it has female characters that don't look female at all.

748
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,600
That was obviously something they went out of their way to do.

749
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,600
I mean, Crystal looks a little bit female.

750
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Not hardly. I didn't think she was a girl.

751
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,600
No. That's not accurate.

752
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Are you saying she looks totally female, or that she doesn't look at all?

753
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm saying she looks like a rock.

754
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Right, exactly.

755
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,600
And I think that they were trying to respond to the sentiment, not to the video itself,

756
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,600
but to the sentiment of one Jimquisition video where he pointed out, in his observation,

757
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:44,600
there's very few female characters in games who don't look attractive and don't have any motivations that are related to traditional woman-ish things.

758
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Like, if they just want to be either or just want to make money or something.

759
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I can appreciate it on the grounds that we take a generic looking character as assumed to be male,

760
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
but it doesn't have to be that way.

761
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,600
The generic one is the male, and the one with the bow on it is the girl.

762
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah, exactly.

763
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
But these characters are fucking monsters.

764
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
I do love the bow principle.

765
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I love the idea that putting a bow on something makes it female.

766
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I understand why Cartman understood that same principle.

767
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,600
But I can also love a game that doesn't do that.

768
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
And chicken obviously is a chicken, so it makes sense.

769
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
But then there's the one human character, the freaking rebel.

770
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
And what I loved is that rebel...

771
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Well, it's cute.

772
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,600
It's cute and all, but I don't agree with it.

773
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,600
So I appreciate that nuclear throne goes out of its way to subvert it.

774
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Yeah, well, I just actively enjoy that fact.

775
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Hi, we're back.

776
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
The call kind of got broken up.

777
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I was making a point about how rebel can help you confirm that you aren't racist,

778
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
because when I was looking at Rebel on the wiki,

779
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
I live in a place where almost everyone is white.

780
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,600
So if someone isn't white, I make a mental note,

781
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,600
like this person has this kind of hair, that kind of face,

782
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
and this is their skin color if they're not white.

783
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
One time I lived in Africa for a bit.

784
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
And you're saying that this helped you find out you're not racist?

785
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
It gave me a minute.

786
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,600
And so when I killed myself with my own buzz saw launcher,

787
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,600
it was a time I was in Africa, and if someone was white,

788
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
I made a mental note of them being white.

789
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
So that's just how you do it, that's just how you categorize things.

790
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
And when I was on the nuclear throne wiki,

791
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
I didn't even think about the fact that she was black because she was human,

792
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
and that stuck out to me more, you see?

793
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
So yeah.

794
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Okay, when I was making that point originally...

795
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I don't like her.

796
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
I don't like that she is such like a normal looking human

797
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
in a cast of like crazy monsters.

798
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Now on the one hand, I can kind of appreciate that she's...

799
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I can appreciate that she's like the control, you know?

800
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Like everyone else is a horrible mutant,

801
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
and she's like the one normal one and sticks out for that.

802
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
And that's fine.

803
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
I think in-game she looks pretty good,

804
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
but her character art on the wiki looks really like,

805
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
really cartoony in a way that clashes with it.

806
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
You know, it's no wonder that nothing happens in your comic,

807
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
because you just hate ideas in general.

808
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
You know, just like anything that's like an idea,

809
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
you just don't like it,

810
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
and that's why your comic has nothing happening in it.

811
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
It's just characters sitting around.

812
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Whoa!

813
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Whoa!

814
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Personal attacks, here we go.

815
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Coming out swinging.

816
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
No, your comic is great.

817
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Explain to me.

818
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Your comic is great.

819
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
I want you to go more into depth with what you just said.

820
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
But first of all, I want to say that

821
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
when I was first making that point about Rebel,

822
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
that was when the call broke,

823
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
and so then I just thought you guys were like dead silent from awkwardness.

824
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
I'm like, oh no, this is not coming out right.

825
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Oh God, I'm racist.

826
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
By the way, you're thinking of Rogue, not Rebel.

827
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Oh wait, which one is, wait.

828
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Rebel is the mummy.

829
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Rebel is the one with allies.

830
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,600
How can a mummy be a rebel?

831
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,600
If they're a mummy, that means they died in royalty.

832
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Because she's a bandit, dude.

833
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,600
She's a bandit, and her brother is a big bandit.

834
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Don't you understand the deep, convoluted, deep-full, good, insightful,

835
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,600
insightful, progressive, deep-full.

836
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Yeah, deep-full is my new game.

837
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Deep-full just came out of early access.

838
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
What do you do?

839
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Oh, everything is so deep-full.

840
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,600
It's a great story, and my favorite character is Undine.

841
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
She's my favorite character in this game.

842
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I like to play as her, and let's stop talking about this now.

843
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
I never told you what my strats were.

844
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Yeah.

845
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
No, you didn't.

846
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
But before you do, I'm hung up.

847
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
I'm hung up.

848
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,600
What did you mean, Davoo, when you said that I hate ideas?

849
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Well, I don't know.

850
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
What did you mean?

851
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I don't know your opinions enough.

852
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I was just, that was like a random joke.

853
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Obviously, your comic is great.

854
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Okay, but what were you thinking that made?

855
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm just not sure what that phrase means.

856
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,600
Well, disliking the fact that she's a human as the only human,

857
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
because for me, if I was in the creative department of Nuclear Throne,

858
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I'd be like, all right, guys, we obviously want to have the one character who's human,

859
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
but where's an interesting costume and stuff.

860
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
That's the idea that I would have.

861
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
And so when you said you didn't like that as a concept,

862
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I'm just trying to compile all the different negative opinions I've heard you say,

863
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
and I feel like just a wild guess.

864
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,600
There's a chain of ideas that you would probably want to include in something.

865
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Like, oh, in a world where I want to monster have the one human.

866
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
That's a pretty obvious idea.

867
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,600
And so maybe, again, I have no idea if this is true,

868
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,600
you have a personal inclination against those kinds of ideas,

869
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,600
which is why you've decided to make this comic.

870
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,600
You told me that nothing happens in this comic that you're making, right?

871
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Well, it's not that nothing happens.

872
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,600
It's a comic about nothing.

873
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Right.

874
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm just thinking maybe there's a connection.

875
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
But let me restate.

876
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
I think you're right.

877
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I don't think it's actually, I have a problem with her being the only human,

878
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,600
but I really did not care for the big MLP eyes on her character art in the witty.

879
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Maybe they could have toned it down enough.

880
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I wasn't into it.

881
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Maybe they could have toned it down a bit, but I love them,

882
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
because it like her eyes just beam out of every, you know, like her eye.

883
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
You can't see that much of her face, but what you can is mostly eyes.

884
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Very adorable.

885
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
And, you know, she wears a giant costume.

886
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
And it's like, whoa.

887
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,600
It's like, even though she's human, she wears this crazy costume, you know?

888
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,600
She's like a ghostbuster.

889
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Cool stuff.

890
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,600
There's one fundamental flaw in what you're saying right now.

891
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
There's one big flaw.

892
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
She's not a human.

893
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
She's an ape.

894
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Oh, she's not human.

895
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
What is she?

896
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
What is she?

897
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
No, no, she is.

898
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I called her an ape.

899
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I called her an ape.

900
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
She's human.

901
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh, sorry.

902
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
The call cut out in that part.

903
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Oh.

904
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,600
The call cut out at just the right.

905
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,600
The call is cutting out all racism towards Rogue.

906
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Munchy, let's hear your strats, because you're the only one who's a pro.

907
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I've been waiting for this.

908
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
I've been waiting for this.

909
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Oh, let me get inside my mecca, where I host all my ideas.

910
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Please.

911
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Idea number one.

912
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
I play as Rebels, so none of this applies to you.

913
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
Idea number two.

914
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I only have two health mutations, because don't be a little bitch.

915
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Number three.

916
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Don't get your throne butt, but if you want to, you should get your throne butt.

917
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Wow, that's a pretty...

918
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,600
That's kind of an irrelevant strategy.

919
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Do it or don't.

920
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
Idea number three.

921
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,600
We need to get clean drinking water to Africa.

922
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
Idea number three.

923
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
We should innovate in car design.

924
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
We should innovate in nuclear throne, but in real life.

925
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,600
And most importantly, remember to have fun and be yourself.

926
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Stop bullying.

927
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,600
I think bullying builds character.

928
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Sure, but what kind of character?

929
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Don't take this in a racial direction.

930
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,600
You're going to break the call again.

931
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Believe me, it's not racial.

932
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,600
It's sexual, not in a sensual kind of way.

933
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,600
But in an inferiority kind of way.

934
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Yeah.

935
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Like you agree, right?

936
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Of course.

937
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
DeVoo, on record, you agree with me, right?

938
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,600
No, I don't.

939
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,600
We had different opinions.

940
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I'm going to edit the footage, so DeVoo is actually the one who's saying all that.

941
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
And I'm saying no, DeVoo, that's horrible.

942
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Why would you say that?

943
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,600
It's the magic of video editing.

944
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
The magic of post-production.

945
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,600
Wait, do you guys have the game Sound On for yourselves?

946
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
Yeah.

947
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I have it on very, very low.

948
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
What the heck am I doing?

949
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Of course, this game is...

950
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
You need the sound to know what's happening.

951
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah.

952
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
But no wonder I've been stuck.

953
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Yeah, you do.

954
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
That's one thing I do like about the game.

955
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,600
It's one game that forces me to have Sound On because of how much the sound helps, you know?

956
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Yeah, it really does.

957
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
That's what I'm talking about when I say this game has good game feel.

958
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Like, have the screen shakes whenever you shoot a bullet, and it's...

959
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Binding of Isaac didn't have that shit.

960
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,600
No, sir.

961
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Well, see, Flambier is like the god of that.

962
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
They're like the Sumerian god of creation.

963
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
That's what I heard when it comes to good games.

964
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
That's what you called chicken.

965
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,600
No, you called chicken a Sumerian god of destruction.

966
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Yeah.

967
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'm seeing a strange logical through line in your comparisons in Flambier content.

968
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Well, see, I myself am a Sumerian god, so it would make sense that I reference my content.

969
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Sure.

970
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,600
This is going to be the best podcast on the face of the planet.

971
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,600
I was surprised how good it was for the first 20.

972
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
I guess it's actually coming out pretty good, given the nature of its production.

973
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
There are nugget.

974
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,600
There are definite nuggets in here that are good.

975
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
All right.

976
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
There's a lot of bugs.

977
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Hopefully, the keyboard and mouse sounds will give people some ASMR.

978
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Yeah.

979
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,600
Not with this microphone.

980
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Just like Funky Kong taking you home from the airport.

981
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Yes.

982
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Everyone, stop watching this podcast or listening to a go watch ASMR Funky Kong.

983
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,600
Caring and supportive takes you home from the airport.

984
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,600
The best ASMR video I've yet seen.

985
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Now, I was going to ask if that's a real thing, but I'm sure it is.

986
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Yeah, it is.

987
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Is it exactly what it sounds like?

988
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Yes.

989
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Okay.

990
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,600
It's much better.

991
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
It's much better.

992
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
Well, I want to see it.

993
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
It sounds great.

994
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,600
All right.

995
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
It sounds like a real edifying experience.

996
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,600
I see more characters that are cool.

997
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
I guess...

998
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Yeah, let me go back to...

999
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,800
I don't get what it is about the characters that's so great because I don't know anything

1000
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
about them.

1001
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,600
Honestly, the game doesn't give them much personality aside from the mechanical ways

1002
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
they play.

1003
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
That's not entirely true, but I agree with what you're trying to pick at.

1004
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,600
That does say a lot about the character, but...

1005
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
They're tooltips, dude.

1006
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Yeah, they become...

1007
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
I get to become them, so that's why they're cool.

1008
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Yeah, I guess they have character-specific tooltips.

1009
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Okay.

1010
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,880
Well, yeah, I have noticed a bunch of character-specific tooltips, but they haven't really told me

1011
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,600
anything about Crystal.

1012
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,600
Oh, yeah.

1013
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,600
That's because they don't like Crystal because she's not cool.

1014
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Oh.

1015
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,600
I mean, she said something about family, and she keeps...

1016
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,600
She says, like, oh, it's not right.

1017
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
It's not fair.

1018
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
What does that mean?

1019
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,600
Okay, you know the school of characterization where you only come up with a...

1020
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,600
You only explain a couple of details, and the rest of it is your imagination welling

1021
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,600
up with a bunch of ideas for the details.

1022
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Obviously, you can't just do that and automatically make it work.

1023
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
It has to be...

1024
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,600
The couple of details that you do expose it have to be done just right for that to work,

1025
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,600
and for me, Nuclear Throne, that totally works.

1026
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,600
And also the way that the characters feel together.

1027
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,600
If there was a game that only had one of them or only three of them, it wouldn't be nearly

1028
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,600
as cool as the fact that they're all together.

1029
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,600
And I'm looking at the character select screen, and they're all at the campfire.

1030
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,600
They all feel like they're part of the same mission in a way.

1031
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,600
They all go out on their own to get to the Nuclear Throne independently, but there's this

1032
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,600
moment where they're all at the campfire together, getting ready to get going.

1033
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
I agree with that.

1034
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,600
They are a very diverse and colorful cast, but they're also all very unified in their

1035
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
design, so I think that's pretty sweet.

1036
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
I love stuff like that.

1037
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,600
Which is maybe why Rebel, I think, I didn't care for her.

1038
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,600
Rogue!

1039
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Rogue, because she stands out a little.

1040
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
I'm just...

1041
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,600
Yeah, I'm the trendsetter.

1042
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
Yeah, but I'm with you on that front.

1043
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I mean, look, obviously there was probably some bunch of games out there with better

1044
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,600
character casts than Nuclear Throne that came out this year.

1045
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,600
I just haven't played a whole lot of games this year.

1046
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,600
What game could possibly have a more diverse character cast than this?

1047
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
There's a skeleton from this game?

1048
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
Did you know that?

1049
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Oh yeah, I do know that, yeah.

1050
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Which is kind of weird, because isn't it melting like almost a skeleton?

1051
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Yeah, but it's not always halfway to being a skeleton.

1052
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
He's almost a skeleton, that's pretty cool.

1053
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,600
I don't really play him.

1054
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Almost.

1055
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,600
He's halfway in his evolution from man to skeleton.

1056
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,600
The natural end point of all life.

1057
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,600
Well, I mean, I wasn't sure if you were baiting this response to Voo, but Undertale had a pretty

1058
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
diverse cast.

1059
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
I was baiting the response.

1060
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Yeah, that had, you know...

1061
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Well, what I love about the Undertale characters is the way that they're written in this.

1062
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Other than Flowey and especially Sans, those are characters I like.

1063
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,600
I think about how cool those characters are independently of the game themselves.

1064
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,600
But what I love about the characters in Undertale is how they work with the story and with each other

1065
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,600
and all the other elements.

1066
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:31,600
Whereas the cast of Nuclear Throne, obviously the way that they fit with the game is great,

1067
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,600
but also their own aesthetic does make me feel like...

1068
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
I don't know, it's the kind of thing where I could be walking around and be like,

1069
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,600
oh man, I wish I had eyes, powers, and I could drag that towards me.

1070
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,600
I mean, if this killed me, I sure would like to be able to run around for five seconds

1071
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
and try to get my life back.

1072
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,600
Uh... I guess, I mean...

1073
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Whereas I never go around thinking wishing I was a gay fish, like Kanye West or Rondine.

1074
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,600
I think that every second of my life, every second of my life, no matter what action...

1075
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,600
Why has no one done an undying gay fish AMV yet?

1076
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,600
That's a crime.

1077
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
I don't understand the reference.

1078
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,600
There's an episode of South Park where they come up with a joke where they go,

1079
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,600
the joke, Jimmy comes up with a joke, the joke is this, do you like fish dicks?

1080
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Yes, I like fish dicks.

1081
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,600
He goes, what are you, a gay fish?

1082
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,600
Everyone in the world loves the joke except Kanye West who doesn't get that it's a joke

1083
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
and he thinks that people are accusing him of being a gay fish.

1084
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Then at the end of the episode, after he tries to get to the bottom of this,

1085
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,600
he realizes they must be telling the truth, I must actually be a gay fish.

1086
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
So he sings a song about him being a gay fish,

1087
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,600
and he goes into the water and makes that with a bunch of male fish and then drowns.

1088
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,600
And I just don't know why no one has done an AMV with that song to undine yet.

1089
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Uh... sounds like a great idea, you should get on it.

1090
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Maybe because we're not, we're not, we're above that as a culture.

1091
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Maybe we're 2,000 years of culture into the civilization,

1092
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,600
and we don't need to degrade ourselves like that anymore to do.

1093
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Maybe this is an ancient Rome, where that kind of thing would be acceptable.

1094
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah, well, I don't know.

1095
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Maybe we've finally moved past our perverse societal need to mash up things with other things.

1096
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,600
No, man.

1097
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,600
I've been putting on that Biggie Smalls Thomas tank engine mash up every day.

1098
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
It's like one of the first things I do when I wake up.

1099
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:40,600
As much as I wish I didn't like Space Jam remixes, they never get old.

1100
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
They have yet to get old.

1101
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,600
The best one is the Space Jam theme.

1102
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,600
The little John one in Lazy Town, that one I'll never do that one.

1103
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Well, that one's only like a minute and a half long.

1104
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,600
I like the mash-ups that go on for a while.

1105
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Yeah, it is pretty great though.

1106
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,600
I better make a pretty cake.

1107
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,600
What?

1108
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,600
If the way's hazy, gotta do the cooking by the book.

1109
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Okay.

1110
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,600
No one can do that voice though, that's the problem.

1111
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,600
I've gone three disc guns on this one level alone.

1112
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,600
I hate disc guns.

1113
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Why do they're good, dude?

1114
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
They fucking kill you.

1115
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
They die when you use a disc.

1116
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,600
I like weapons that are dangerous.

1117
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,600
No man, I've gotten to the point, back to actually talking about Nuclear Throne.

1118
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,600
I've gotten to a point where I don't even pick up the good weapons

1119
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,600
because they're too fucking dangerous.

1120
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Grenade launchers, I mean I can mostly handle a grenade launcher.

1121
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,600
You're extremely wrong in your assessment that grenade launcher is a good weapon.

1122
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,600
Okay, fine.

1123
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,600
But I mean the stronger weapons, the more deadly ones.

1124
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
Explosives basically is what I'm getting at.

1125
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,600
I really like the flare gun because the flare gun can't kill you.

1126
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,600
Oh my fucking god!

1127
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,600
What?

1128
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,600
I've never seen a human being so unsophisticated as you.

1129
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,600
What's wrong with the flare gun?

1130
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
It does one damage, ever.

1131
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,600
That's not true, I have killed Snow-Mex with it in one shot.

1132
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
Snow-Mex are way weaker than they look.

1133
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,600
That's the weird thing about Snow-Mex, did they originally have more health

1134
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,600
and they decided to nerf them?

1135
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Because they die so much quicker than you think they would.

1136
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Everything in Snowtown dies faster than I expected.

1137
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,600
I go in there with heavy crossbows because everything's so big and intimidating

1138
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,600
but then I went in with a revolver.

1139
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,600
All I need to do is just put rust textures on all the enemies,

1140
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
make them all look rusty.

1141
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,600
Therefore, they would be more weak and easily deadified.

1142
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Dentified?

1143
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
I feel like they do have some rust, don't they?

1144
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
They might.

1145
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,600
But they still look really scary and they just don't live up to that.

1146
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
Have you ever seen one of the golden snow tanks?

1147
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Yes.

1148
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
Oh yeah, sure.

1149
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
Good, good.

1150
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,600
I've gotten to the snow zone pretty often.

1151
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Quite a number of times.

1152
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,600
I can't wait until you finally die to an Explodofreak in the labs.

1153
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
I can't wait for that moment.

1154
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,600
It'll be like you've all grown up.

1155
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,600
I don't think I've ever died in the labs.

1156
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Good job.

1157
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,600
I'm sure because once you get past Little Hunter you're in excellent mode,

1158
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
you're in I gotta not die mode, you know?

1159
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,600
Because you're in a rare state of success.

1160
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Little Hunter is so fucking easy.

1161
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,600
I'm always so fucking terrified when I get to the labs

1162
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,600
that I go wicked slowly and peek slowly around every corner

1163
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:46,600
and launch all my bombs ahead of me just because I don't want to take any chances.

1164
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,600
To the whole reason, one of the things that makes me really low...

1165
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,600
I know why you're not doing well is because you're using Explosive Weapons.

1166
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,600
Well I've stopped using Explosive Weapons because I'm too scared of them now.

1167
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
See, it's sort of...

1168
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
Because they just kill me every time.

1169
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Well not every time.

1170
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Honestly, I've gotten...

1171
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Oh fuck, Mad Dog just exploded and killed me because I'm stupid.

1172
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
Speaking of dying and explosions.

1173
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
No, I'm pretty good with grenade launchers.

1174
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,600
But like, yeah, disc guns kill me every time.

1175
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Anything...

1176
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,600
I got a nuke launcher against the nuclear throne once.

1177
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,600
It didn't kill me?

1178
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,600
What?

1179
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
No, that's a good weapon.

1180
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,600
That's unironically not misleading, that's a good weapon.

1181
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,600
Yeah, it dropped in the throne room and I picked it up and I was just like firing nukes.

1182
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,600
I got off like seven or eight of them before I was murdered by green bullets.

1183
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:52,600
I have a gold one of those, say in my loadout screen for YP and it's very fun to get out sometimes.

1184
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Because you know, it may be kind of weird that I like this game so much.

1185
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,600
I give it like a nine, even though I haven't really gotten that close to beating it.

1186
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm not that good at it.

1187
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,600
But the reason I love it so much is that I can love it without having to be good at it.

1188
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,600
I don't know.

1189
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,600
I mean, I know what you mean, but I'm not like that.

1190
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:20,600
For me, the whole draw of the game is the tension that it creates between just how badly I want to beat it.

1191
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,600
So if I never beat nuclear throne, I will be pissed for the rest of my life.

1192
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:33,600
I mean, up to doing my review of it, my video on it, I was like, there were many play sessions.

1193
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
I'd be like, alright, time to focus.

1194
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,600
But the play sessions in which I try to focus don't necessarily end up better than the ones where I try to focus just a little bit.

1195
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:48,600
I mean, obviously, if I wanted to do a decent job, I wouldn't be doing a podcast while playing it.

1196
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Oh gosh.

1197
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Well, see, I feel the same way like I can't be laid back.

1198
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,600
The thing with video games and getting great at them is that when I get great at them,

1199
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
then I feel like, well, I'm done.

1200
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,600
I can't get quite the same level of engagement.

1201
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,600
But with nuclear throne since it always goes on forever and ever,

1202
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,600
then I will never feel like I'm about to hit that limit of goodness.

1203
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
I guess once you get to like, you're fired or something.

1204
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,600
The game ends when you get a world record.

1205
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
That's when the game ends.

1206
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,600
Well, no, because the game has to end when you get a world record and then the world ends,

1207
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
so you know no one else will ever get that record.

1208
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Yeah, exactly.

1209
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,600
So the real goal, you're saying that the real goal of nuclear throne is first get the world record

1210
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
and then destroy the world.

1211
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Getting the world record and nuclear throne is only the beginning.

1212
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,600
But you can only destroy it by building a nuclear throne that will destroy the entire world

1213
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,600
and cause the events of nuclear throne to happen.

1214
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:48,600
The goal of nuclear throne is to bring about nuclear throne in real life.

1215
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,600
And you'd be so good at surviving in that world because you know.

1216
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Yeah, exactly.

1217
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,600
So you become like the top.

1218
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,600
I mean, I'm sure there's an explanation for this in the game, but I don't know it.

1219
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,600
But I guess in this fantasy world, we're creating...

1220
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Wait, which level of the scrapyard is the car in?

1221
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
Oh, one. It's always in one.

1222
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Crud, I passed it and I had to screw it over, whatever.

1223
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
I'll get it someday.

1224
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,600
I think it spawns in all other stuff.

1225
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,600
No, no, no.

1226
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Man, it sucks not having a melee weapon that pulls back bullets when I get to the big dog.

1227
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,600
That's the most funnest thing about the big dog is that I can hit all of his bullets back at him.

1228
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
That is pretty fun.

1229
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,600
Luckily, I died by the way.

1230
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,600
I'm not really...

1231
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Man, it sure feels good to be a man and not be a little baby.

1232
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
A little baby crystal player.

1233
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,600
It's just so...

1234
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,600
It's just the shield is just so indispensable.

1235
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
I got an auto crossbow and bolt marrow.

1236
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,600
We have a run, boys.

1237
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Oh, fuck.

1238
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:02,600
I never take the weapon-specific upgrades because I don't feel like committing.

1239
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,600
Well, see, you always take two in a run.

1240
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Yeah, I actually do.

1241
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,600
I guess it's like...

1242
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,600
What's that?

1243
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
What were you saying, Munchie?

1244
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,600
You always take two in a run.

1245
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Unless you are like a melee user and then you have to always take long arms and laser brain.

1246
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
Why laser brain?

1247
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,600
Oh, shit.

1248
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
You people don't know.

1249
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Oh, nigga.

1250
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,600
So what were the upgrades you said you had?

1251
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,600
How about laser brain?

1252
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
In four dash...

1253
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Actually, they might have changed it.

1254
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,600
I mean, I know that there is like some upgrade that you only get if you get two...

1255
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Are you going to tell us about that special mutation?

1256
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,600
There's a weapon that drops in 5-1.

1257
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
What?

1258
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,600
Yeah.

1259
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,600
There's an energy sword in this game and it's the best weapon in the game.

1260
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Oh, I think I saw that.

1261
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
I've watched playthroughs of that.

1262
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,600
Man, I want to get good just so I can get those freaking weapons, man.

1263
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
I think I saw it one time but didn't get to pick it up.

1264
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,600
Well, see, it drops in 5-1, I'm pretty sure.

1265
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
It's not like a late game weapon.

1266
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Oh.

1267
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,600
Well.

1268
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Yeah.

1269
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:16,600
So if you can get that laser brain in long arms and preferably trigger fingers, but you

1270
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,600
don't need that specifically, then you won't die.

1271
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,600
I do love melee with trigger fingers.

1272
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
So the laser sword is in level 5-1.

1273
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
How do you get it?

1274
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
Well, no.

1275
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
It's not a guaranteed drop.

1276
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Oh, okay.

1277
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,600
It may show up all right.

1278
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,600
I wish it was because when I saw that I'm like, well, I want that, man.

1279
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Oh.

1280
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Well, see, the thing is, the reason it's so good is because you can swing so fast.

1281
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Yeah.

1282
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,600
And so much damage just builds up over time.

1283
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,600
And all the high tier weapons are, well, not high, well, yeah.

1284
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:56,600
All the high tier weapons in pretty much every class are energy.

1285
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,600
So you might as well be picking up laser brain anyway.

1286
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,600
I just want to be able to kill the enemies as fast as possible.

1287
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,600
My favorite character for nuclear throne is just to be the dev and just open up the game

1288
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,600
file and just hit, just control A all the enemies in the room and hit delete.

1289
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
Yeah.

1290
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
That's my favorite too.

1291
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
A super splitter gun.

1292
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Oh, Nick.

1293
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600
Oh, no.

1294
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,600
Oh, Nick, are we in there?

1295
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,600
Why do the levels load to 101% or more?

1296
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
Because it's cool, dude.

1297
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1298
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,600
Munchy.

1299
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Yeah?

1300
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,600
I know that there is a, there's an up, or there's a mutation that you can only get

1301
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,600
if you have two weapons specific upgrades.

1302
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,600
It's three, actually.

1303
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,600
What's up with that?

1304
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Oh, okay.

1305
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,600
What's up with that?

1306
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,600
It's heavy heart and you get more weapon drops.

1307
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Is it good?

1308
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
No.

1309
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
Oh.

1310
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,600
Well, all right.

1311
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,600
There's no reason for it to be in the game.

1312
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:57,600
I am not capable of focusing on the game enough to play well when I'm also talking.

1313
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,600
So, unfortunately, my social tendencies override my game tendencies.

1314
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,600
So, not going to be able to do well.

1315
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,600
And if I was trying to do well, I still wouldn't do well.

1316
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,600
I would still lose to Little Hunter.

1317
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,600
So, actually, I'm pretty sure if I encounter him another couple of times,

1318
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,600
eventually I'll get him because I understand that it's probably better philosophy to just

1319
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
run right at him and start swinging.

1320
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,600
That seems to have better odds than running, which is what I was doing before.

1321
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,600
I'm going to tell you like Game Dude, like Nintendo, like Power Nintendo,

1322
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,600
Good, Ultra, Guy Fieri, Power Breakfast, like a tip.

1323
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,600
Okay.

1324
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
Sure.

1325
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,600
Pick up the jackhammer and fight Little Hunter.

1326
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
You know what?

1327
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,600
I had the jackhammer and honestly it didn't do that well against Little Hunter.

1328
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
I don't know why everyone says that.

1329
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Why does the jackhammer help Little Hunter?

1330
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,600
I remember hearing that, too.

1331
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Ben.

1332
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
Ben, is it possible that you are an escaped mental patient

1333
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,600
and you shouldn't be out with us normal humans?

1334
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,600
He was...

1335
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,600
I kept trying to hit him with it and he would just like jump away

1336
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
and I would only get like one or two shots on it.

1337
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,600
I know, but you'd have to keep doing that.

1338
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
Well, yeah.

1339
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
You could do that with other weapons.

1340
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
I know, but it's safe and easy.

1341
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,600
I'm just saying this for DeVoo because he needs medical assistance.

1342
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,600
Maybe.

1343
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,600
He's fallen.

1344
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
I guess.

1345
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,600
Medical assistance.

1346
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
I guess I haven't really tried the jackhammer.

1347
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
Whenever I picked it up, I'm like,

1348
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,600
I don't want to use this and I put it back down.

1349
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
I should give him more of a chance.

1350
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,600
Yeah, something about it.

1351
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,600
I picked it up one time.

1352
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,600
I've used it like once because I knew Little Hunter was coming up

1353
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,600
and I heard it was good against him and it was okay.

1354
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,600
And once because I was out of ammo on my other gun

1355
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
and there was a jackhammer there and I was like,

1356
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
oh, okay, and I took it.

1357
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
And I don't know, I didn't like it.

1358
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,600
It felt like the flamethrower, which I also don't like.

1359
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,600
And it just expends a lot of ammo really fast

1360
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,600
for not a whole lot of payoff.

1361
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,600
I didn't feel like it was doing huge damage or anything.

1362
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
No, see, the thing is it's not.

1363
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,600
A lot of melee weapons aren't weapons and more tools for you to use.

1364
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,600
And I feel like the jackhammer's not a good weapon,

1365
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,600
but it saves your ass a lot of the time.

1366
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,600
Like the Throne 2 just gets destroyed by...

1367
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Oh, shit.

1368
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,600
Forget I said that.

1369
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Okay.

1370
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,600
There isn't a Throne 2.

1371
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
No, why would there be?

1372
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Why would there be a new End Boss on subsequent playthroughs?

1373
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,600
Are you trying to avoid spoilers here?

1374
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,600
No, I don't want to do this broadcast again.

1375
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,600
I saw it and I don't want to do it.

1376
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Then why is he so aggro?

1377
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,600
I'm going to be on the level!

1378
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,600
Oh, but I was going to say, yeah, Little Hunter,

1379
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
I feel like I'm just starting to get to a point

1380
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,600
where I kind of have a handle on what to do with Little Hunter.

1381
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,600
I think I've faced, I don't know, maybe a dozen times now,

1382
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:57,600
and I'm just starting to not be overwhelmed and terrified by his very presence.

1383
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Little Hunter is my BGSM sub.

1384
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,600
You're what?

1385
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Nothing to do.

1386
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,600
Gross.

1387
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,600
But it's accurate.

1388
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,600
He seems pretty, he seems pretty dumb to me.

1389
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,600
Oh, that's what we were saying.

1390
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Gotcha.

1391
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Well, I mean, see, well, I think the most effective weapon,

1392
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,600
and this is probably just the most effective weapon period,

1393
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,600
but on Little Hunter, the Super Crossbow,

1394
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,600
if you have that, then just shoot him once in his bed.

1395
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
Well, that sounds good.

1396
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Because you know, when I see the Crossbow upgrade option,

1397
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,600
I'm like, okay, if I have the Crossbow, I'll always pick it,

1398
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
because yeah, you know, the one that makes the aiming better,

1399
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
and then sometimes I'll be like, you know what,

1400
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,600
I want to get the Crossbow.

1401
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,600
I like the feeling of a Crossbow.

1402
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,600
I like the feeling of like weapons that are light,

1403
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
but do a lot of damage.

1404
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,600
Like revolvers in some games are like way more powerful

1405
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
than like freaking shotguns or something.

1406
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
Yeah, the Crossbow feels really good.

1407
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Yeah, it's my favorite sword and weapon in any game like ever.

1408
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Yeah, it just feels really good to like carefully aim a shot

1409
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,600
that does like ridiculous damage.

1410
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
It feels great.

1411
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,600
But there's a late game revolver that's like fucking beautiful,

1412
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
and I love it.

1413
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
Is it the Super Revolver?

1414
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
No, there isn't a Super.

1415
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Well, I'll just tell you this, I don't care anymore.

1416
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,600
It's an Ultra Revolver.

1417
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Ultra.

1418
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,600
Is that the one that takes rads?

1419
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
Yep.

1420
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,600
Is that the one that you spend rads?

1421
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,600
I should do an analysis of revolvers,

1422
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,600
and it'll just be my memories with revolvers.

1423
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
I've never touched a real revolver,

1424
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
but my memories with games and revolvers,

1425
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,600
like playing Clue, obviously.

1426
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,600
But my fondest memories of revolvers is in Fallout 3,

1427
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,600
because I really, that was like the 44 revolver in that game

1428
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,600
was my favorite weapon.

1429
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Because again, it's so tiny, but it does quite a bit of damage.

1430
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,600
And then when I got into cheats on Fallout 3,

1431
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,600
there's one cheat you can get to give yourself a revolver

1432
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
that doesn't have a scope.

1433
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,600
And for some reason, that revolver does over 5,000 damage.

1434
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,600
And so, like a super mutant behemoth would come,

1435
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
and I insta-killed him with a revolver.

1436
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
And I would just go through the whole game

1437
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,600
insta-killing absolutely everything with my revolver,

1438
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
and it was the greatest time.

1439
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
So whenever, and I recently played Half-Life,

1440
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:24,600
and so I shot down, like, telekinetic aliens with a revolver,

1441
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
I don't have to cross, though.

1442
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,600
Revolvers are always a special time in video games.

1443
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,600
Well, the crossbow in Half-Life is pretty rad.

1444
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,600
Oh, shit.

1445
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
Revolver quest.

1446
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
Revolver quest.

1447
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Yeah, man.

1448
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,600
Oh, this gold scorpion fucked me up.

1449
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Oh, yeah, I hate those.

1450
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,600
They're dead.

1451
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,600
I'm gonna try to try to do well enough to get YV.

1452
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,600
All right, yeah, this is no more baby bullshit mode.

1453
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
We're just gonna go silent.

1454
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
I guess.

1455
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
No, man.

1456
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,600
That's missing the forest for the trees.

1457
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
I don't even know what that means.

1458
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Oh, right.

1459
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,600
At some point, I accidentally dropped my freaking screwdriver.

1460
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,600
When did I drop my screwdriver?

1461
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,600
So I'm killing a big hunter, I mean, a big bandit,

1462
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,600
just by, I killed big bandit just by throwing my wrench

1463
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,600
out of a bunch of times as chicken.

1464
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
That was pretty funny.

1465
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
Yeah, that is good.

1466
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
There's a bug in this game where if you have a melee weapon

1467
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,600
and you hit big bandit as soon as he charges,

1468
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,600
you can hit him 47 times.

1469
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,600
Huh.

1470
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:39,600
Well, unfortunately, I somehow dropped my screwdriver.

1471
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,600
So I guess I'll have to get it again.

1472
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,600
Well, it sucks because I would never get a screwdriver

1473
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,600
for any other reason because it negates everything

1474
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
that I like about melee weapons.

1475
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
Yeah.

1476
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,600
Oh, here's something I like to do.

1477
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,600
It's as chicken if I have the wrench as I do right now,

1478
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,600
I'll switch between my blade and my wrench

1479
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,600
to be able to rapid-fire hit things.

1480
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,600
Yeah, that does not sound cool.

1481
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,600
That is the coolest.

1482
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,600
I guess it makes sense.

1483
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
I don't know how practical it is,

1484
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,600
but it's a fun thing to pull off.

1485
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
No, man.

1486
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
You said, I said before, trigger fingers.

1487
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Trigger fingering with melee just feels so great here.

1488
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Yeah, you run up to something and just smash them

1489
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,600
and kill them and then because you got trigger fingers,

1490
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,600
you can just run right up to the next one and whack it again

1491
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,600
and just keep whacking.

1492
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,600
And you guys ever played Geometry Wars?

1493
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,600
That's like the ultimate in games

1494
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,600
where you feel like you're mowing through enemies

1495
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,600
where enemies are grass and you are a mower.

1496
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,600
If you like trigger figures, play Geometry Wars.

1497
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,600
It's where the enemies will cluster up in a cluster

1498
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,600
and you just, your bullets eat into them.

1499
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,600
Like it's eating through a wall of enemies

1500
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,600
that are slowly being eradicated.

1501
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,600
That is pretty cool.

1502
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,600
Like that fight against a thousand heartless

1503
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,600
in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1504
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
Or maybe there were nobody to do whatever.

1505
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,600
Freaking Geometry Wars needs to come back as a roguelike.

1506
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
As like a steam-friendly roguelike.

1507
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
Because the problem with Geometry Wars

1508
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,600
is I don't like the level structure of it that much.

1509
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,600
The roguelike setup can make the game

1510
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,600
constantly challenging and engaging forever basically.

1511
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,600
And I'm glad that it's a trend that's catching on so much.

1512
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
It is a good thing.

1513
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,600
I really like the roguelike elements.

1514
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,600
So yeah, Geometry Wars needs to come back as a roguelike.

1515
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,600
I mean, do we need like a new sub-genre signifier

1516
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
for like the specific type of roguelike

1517
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,600
that Downwell and Nuclear Throne are?

1518
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Mystery Dungeon. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon.

1519
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,600
No. Procedural Death Labyrinth.

1520
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,600
PDL for sure.

1521
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,600
Because like Nuclear Throne feels a little bit more arcade-like.

1522
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,600
There's almost like an arcade-y feel to it.

1523
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,600
Which makes it like the only type of arcade-y games

1524
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,600
that I really, really like.

1525
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,600
I like video games that are video-game-y.

1526
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
Yeah.

1527
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
I do too.

1528
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Dude, you just hit my sweet spot, yeah.

1529
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,600
Like, yeah, like...

1530
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Yeah, like, yeah.

1531
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
I haven't played Mass Effect.

1532
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,600
But games like Mass Effect seem inherently kind of unappealing.

1533
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,600
Like, I don't feel much drive to play games like that

1534
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,600
that are like about their stories.

1535
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,600
Interesting.

1536
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Exclusively.

1537
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Well, I haven't played Mass Effect.

1538
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I mean, I know that's an overstatement.

1539
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,600
It is a game and it has gameplay and stuff.

1540
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,600
But I don't know.

1541
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,600
Something about a game that is all about its mechanics

1542
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,600
and the moment-to-moment feel of the game.

1543
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
It's got a heavy crossbow.

1544
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
It's really great.

1545
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
Swapped up.

1546
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
I love the heavy crossbow.

1547
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,600
I don't know how many times I've had the heavy crossbow.

1548
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,600
But specifically what's great about Trigger Fingers and Melee

1549
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,600
is that it's that feeling that you're swinging faster

1550
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
than you should be able to

1551
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,600
and you have to keep chaining them to be able to keep doing it.

1552
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,600
And so like, your window to hit...

1553
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Oh, the blue one.

1554
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,600
Your window of opportunity to kill the next one is shortened

1555
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,600
and you have to jump on it.

1556
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
It's like you're on the edge of your seat.

1557
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,600
It's like this tense thing where you have to chain them together

1558
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,600
to achieve maximum deadliness.

1559
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
Yes.

1560
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,600
And your offense, your strong offense becomes your best defense

1561
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,600
because you just got to keep killing.

1562
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,600
And if you stop killing for a second, then they'll kill you.

1563
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,600
Yeah, man.

1564
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,600
Okay, the combination of my chicken sword and my heavy crossbow,

1565
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,600
I'm getting into that vicious Rambo Mode.

1566
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Dang it, I got nothing but crap upgrades.

1567
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,600
I have Lucky Shot and I have Strong Spirit, Hammerhead,

1568
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,600
and Extra Feet.

1569
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,600
Strong Spirit's not bad.

1570
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,600
It says prevent death once, but I've never noticed it preventing death.

1571
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
Maybe I'm not understanding it.

1572
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,600
Well, it just lets you take one extra hit, basically.

1573
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,600
That's weird.

1574
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,600
And Hammerhead, going through a limited number of walls,

1575
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,600
I only picked once and forgot that I picked it,

1576
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,600
and it threw me off constantly.

1577
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,600
It was really distracting that I was eating through walls,

1578
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
and I was like, what?

1579
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,600
So it's nice to know that you can do a whole strategy

1580
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,600
that involves manipulating the walls to create your own cover and stuff.

1581
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,600
I feel like that's kind of like Crystal's Throne Butt

1582
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,600
in that it's probably really good in the hands of someone

1583
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,600
who really knows what to do with it.

1584
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,600
Who likes to go play the Worms games or something.

1585
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
I don't know, just someone who has a plan,

1586
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,600
who's like, yes, if I can eat through walls,

1587
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,600
I would do this for my strategy, but I don't know what to do with it.

1588
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,600
Alright, I'm back with a sandwich. What did I miss?

1589
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,600
We were just talking about Hammerhead.

1590
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,600
Yes, Hammerhead is good.

1591
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,600
You think so? What do you do with Hammerhead?

1592
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,600
Well, see, I don't use it offensively.

1593
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,600
If you get a bad spawn, you can just dig into the wall behind you

1594
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
and you can use it as a shield.

1595
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,600
Yeah, okay, so you can funnel enemies towards you through your tunnel?

1596
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Well, that too, but also just make a little cove.

1597
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Spawns get especially bad on loops,

1598
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,600
where you will spawn in a big room full of enemies,

1599
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,600
so you have to make a little bit of a safe space for you.

1600
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,600
I'll say, because what I was talking about

1601
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:28,600
was how going through a limited number of walls

1602
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,600
made me think that there would be a lot of strategy

1603
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,600
involving creating cover for yourself and stuff like that,

1604
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:38,600
where there would be more spatial tactics that you could employ.

1605
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,600
One thing that was a little disappointing about Nuclear Throne

1606
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,600
is that I was thinking there was going to be people

1607
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,600
who would be specializing in careful runs of the game,

1608
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,600
but then I look at the top runs and it's all run into the middle of the action.

1609
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,600
So I framed that as a positive thing in my video

1610
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,600
that it encourages you to go crazy mode,

1611
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,600
but I think it would be cool if there were incentives to do careful mode,

1612
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,600
and there's no scoring in this game, right?

1613
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,600
Okay, yeah.

1614
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,600
I think all you have to do is create some sort of scoring system where...

1615
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,600
No, there is.

1616
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,600
Oh, there is? Okay.

1617
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,600
Monchi, should I get the flat cannon?

1618
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
Yeah, yeah.

1619
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,600
Do you have a strike on the shoulders?

1620
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,600
No.

1621
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,600
If no, don't, then don't.

1622
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,600
Well, I'm in the freaking Diamond Spider Zone

1623
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,600
for the first time in this podcast.

1624
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
I finally made it this far.

1625
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,600
God help you.

1626
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,600
I mean, I usually get here pretty consistently.

1627
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
I've looped five times since we've started this.

1628
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Wow.

1629
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,600
Anyway, I think maybe one of the modifications you can make to the game

1630
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,600
to encourage careful runs

1631
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,600
is that you get higher combos of your points.

1632
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Like, your point ratio goes up significantly

1633
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
if you don't get hit at all.

1634
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,600
So there's a multiplier for your points

1635
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,600
if you don't take any damage.

1636
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,600
That would incentivize careful runs.

1637
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,600
I just died on the Crystal Spider.

1638
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,600
Basically, it means if you do a careful run,

1639
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,600
it will take way longer to get to the top loops, you know?

1640
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,600
But then you could do,

1641
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,600
you could get more points that way.

1642
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,600
That way, your objective in a careful run

1643
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
would be to get the highest score

1644
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
rather than to loop the highest number of times

1645
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,600
or to beat your speed record.

1646
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,600
So yeah, so you could do speed records

1647
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,600
versus point records, and one would be careful.

1648
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,600
Right, because then you can really get a lot of advantage

1649
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,600
out of stuff like running through the walls,

1650
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
using grenades to manipulate the walls.

1651
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,600
That's such a good idea that I just had.

1652
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,600
I must preach into the heavens

1653
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,600
and post this podcast everywhere.

1654
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,600
Let's get Vlambeer in this podcast.

1655
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600
Hey, Vlambeer, how you doing?

1656
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
What do you think about video games?

1657
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
I do not speak English.

1658
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
Does he not speak English?

1659
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Where's he from?

1660
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,600
He's from Sweden, I think.

1661
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Well, good for him.

1662
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,600
You know what's funny is that you guys were talking about

1663
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
how great it feels to have the screen shaking,

1664
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,600
like, within five minutes, first booting up on me.

1665
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
Oh, no. What?

1666
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,600
Oh, no.

1667
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,600
Please, yeah, come on, it's awesome.

1668
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,600
I'll turn it back on. It's not like I was super opposed to it.

1669
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,600
I'll just...

1670
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,600
You know what put it back on?

1671
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Max.

1672
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,600
I don't know what level I have it on.

1673
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
I have it on whatever the default is.

1674
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
Wow, it's like the whole freaking screen chugged.

1675
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Maybe it'll make me better. I just figured it would make me worse,

1676
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,600
but if it...

1677
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,600
It just feels awesome.

1678
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,600
I didn't really get mage to play Nuclear Throne.

1679
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,600
I knew she wouldn't because I know it's not her kind of game,

1680
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
but I was making my case for it

1681
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,600
and she went and looked up a video for it

1682
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,600
and she said...

1683
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,600
and she said she didn't like the shaking screen.

1684
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,600
She said it made her feel sick.

1685
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,600
And you know, I could see it in a video.

1686
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,600
If you're just watching it, it probably doesn't feel good at all.

1687
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,600
But when you're playing it, it's so awesome.

1688
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,600
Okay, well, I...

1689
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,600
The funny thing is...

1690
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Immediately, 100% was too much.

1691
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,600
So I turned it down to 35%.

1692
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,600
And if I can warm up to that, then I'll go higher.

1693
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,600
Let me see what I have.

1694
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,600
I'm curious now what...

1695
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,600
My screen shake is on 100% and it's rad.

1696
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,600
There wasn't even going to be like a slider in this game,

1697
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
but people were literally saying

1698
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,600
that the game was making them nauseous.

1699
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,600
And so J.W. had to play a slider.

1700
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,600
What a bunch of fucking ssss...

1701
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,600
Ssss...

1702
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,600
Real men play Nuclear Throne.

1703
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,600
I wish everything had a slider like that for like the hunger games.

1704
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,600
You know, turn off the camera shake.

1705
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,600
Those movies would be way better.

1706
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,600
I thought you were saying

1707
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,600
that you wished the movie, the Hunger Games,

1708
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,600
had a screen slider to turn off the screen

1709
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,600
so you could just like slide down the screen

1710
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
to just like make the movie not happen?

1711
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,600
No, no, just make it...

1712
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,600
Just get rid of the generic...

1713
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,600
Get rid of the contemporary movie aesthetic

1714
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,600
where everything shakes constantly.

1715
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,600
When you tie it into the Hunger Games...

1716
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,600
Dude, I got the blood hammer.

1717
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,600
I've never even seen the blood hammer.

1718
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
I would like it except...

1719
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,600
I could accept it's blood

1720
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,600
and that, you know, I lose my health, so...

1721
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,600
You know, maybe Nuclear Throne is the Hunger Games.

1722
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Maybe Nuclear Throne is the Hunger Games.

1723
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,600
They're put up to this to do with...

1724
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,600
By Jon Snow.

1725
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,600
Yes.

1726
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,600
That's his name, right?

1727
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,600
Wait, you know that you don't

1728
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,600
lose health with a blood hammer

1729
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,600
if your swing hits?

1730
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,600
Oh, really? Oh, whoops.

1731
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,600
You didn't notice?

1732
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
I wish I had been...

1733
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Well, I mean, I've never actually had the blood hammer.

1734
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,600
I just happened to be reading about

1735
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,600
melee weapons on the wiki today and I read that.

1736
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
Yeah, because you see, when I get a weapon,

1737
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,600
the first thing I do is I shoot it around a bit

1738
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
before actually engaging anything.

1739
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,600
I'm like, oh, I lose health each time, okay?

1740
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Yeah, I mean, I see that.

1741
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,600
So anyway...

1742
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,600
But that would be terrible if you lost one every time.

1743
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,600
I wish I'd been told that one half a second sooner

1744
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
because then I would have gotten it

1745
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
before going into the portal.

1746
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,600
Well, I don't know.

1747
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,600
But it ties to my chicken sword

1748
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
that I'm not sure if I want to get rid of it, you know?

1749
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,600
Oh, oh!

1750
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
Top strat!

1751
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,600
Drop your chicken sword

1752
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
on the first level,

1753
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,600
and then when you loop, it'll be there,

1754
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
but it will be like a super mega,

1755
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,600
like Superman ultra good

1756
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Bill Cosby good sword.

1757
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,600
Yeah, but he's not going to loop, though.

1758
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,600
But Bill Cosby isn't that good.

1759
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
No, she's kidding. Bill Cosby's very good.

1760
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,600
He's like hero.

1761
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
Okay, yeah, but anyway,

1762
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,600
that's true, that's a lie.

1763
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,600
Would I ever tell you a lie, Davoo?

1764
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,600
I don't know.

1765
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,600
Look, there's a bazooka,

1766
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,600
and I'm not going to...

1767
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,600
I just killed 5 million enemies

1768
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,600
with my power crossbow,

1769
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,600
and it was the most amazing

1770
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,600
empowering moment.

1771
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,600
Oh, your super crossbow?

1772
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,600
Wait, is there a difference

1773
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
between the super crossbow

1774
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,600
and the heavy crossbow?

1775
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,600
Yeah.

1776
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,600
Super crossbow shoots like a spray.

1777
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,600
Heavy crossbow, that's what I have.

1778
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,600
Heavy crossbow is so fucking bad.

1779
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,600
My brother has a crossbow.

1780
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
If you have trigger fingers,

1781
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,600
then it's good.

1782
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,600
But the reload time on that thing is just so...

1783
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,600
I got trigger fingers,

1784
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,600
and it's quite good.

1785
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,600
Impact wrist,

1786
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,600
corpses fly and hit harder.

1787
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,600
Oh, that's so good.

1788
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,600
That one is so much...

1789
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,600
When I heard that, when I read that description,

1790
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,600
I'm like, well, it probably doesn't make him fly

1791
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,600
that much further, so I'm going to pass.

1792
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,600
But then when I picked it, I'm like,

1793
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
oh, they fly like 5...

1794
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Oh, I met a little hunter.

1795
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,600
I believe in you, Davoo.

1796
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,600
Everyone pray, dear God in heaven,

1797
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,600
I love Davoo.

1798
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,600
If he doesn't tell a little hunter I'm going to go to jail.

1799
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,600
Please don't make me go to jail.

1800
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,600
God, I'm a good man.

1801
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,600
I love America, and I love everything about it.

1802
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,600
Please don't make me go to jail.

1803
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,600
Well, I died.

1804
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
Nice job, dude.

1805
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,600
I died, but then killed little hunter,

1806
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,600
and now I'm dead.

1807
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,600
Wait, so you and little hunter killed each other?

1808
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,600
Kill each other.

1809
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,600
That's something.

1810
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,600
Congratulations.

1811
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,600
Basically, I killed little hunter,

1812
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
but I didn't get past him.

1813
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,600
But that's the first time you go to jail.

1814
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,600
And the thing is, I did not go into him

1815
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,600
with any strategy, because going after him

1816
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,600
with a crossbow is the stupidest idea ever,

1817
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,600
because if it's really low time,

1818
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,600
if you don't have triggers, you're right about that.

1819
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,600
Because I just wasn't even thinking

1820
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,600
about the fact that I was coming up against him.

1821
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,600
Oh, and the other thing that made it really great

1822
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,600
is that we were in a very tight corridor

1823
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,600
with like, the cops were not on my ass at all.

1824
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,600
Yeah, that's the best way to fight him.

1825
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,600
Because I just, the location was perfect.

1826
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,600
So the only reason I did that well

1827
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,600
was that nothing else was there.

1828
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,600
Which is always the reason why little hunter

1829
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,600
kills me, is because he forced,

1830
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,600
he panicked, and I run into everything.

1831
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,600
So that's kind of another reason why

1832
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,600
I'm not focusing, is that, yeah,

1833
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,600
when I don't focus at all, I could die

1834
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,600
before I even get to the sewers occasionally.

1835
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,600
But that level of like,

1836
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
crazy, just my mind

1837
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
can ramble, sometimes

1838
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,600
brilliant things can occur.

1839
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,600
So I like having

1840
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,600
a randomly generated brain at the same time

1841
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,600
to make it truly roguelike.

1842
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,600
Mmm, that's good.

1843
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,600
True roguelike experience.

1844
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,600
I have another 3DS 3D

1845
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,600
super food tip for you.

1846
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,600
When you,

1847
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,600
okay, when you get to

1848
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,600
5.3, it's a timer

1849
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,600
for when little hunter comes.

1850
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,600
It's not like how many enemies you kill with big bandit.

1851
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,600
So it'll immediately start taking down.

1852
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,600
So what you want to do is,

1853
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,600
you want to go right up next to a wall

1854
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,600
and kind of like walk into it, you know?

1855
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,600
And then little hunter will be like,

1856
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,600
oh, I'm going to land right on top of him.

1857
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,600
So he'll land right inside of that wall.

1858
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
And then he'll make like a little cove for himself

1859
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,600
so he can't really back away or anything.

1860
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,600
So you can just nail him right then and there.

1861
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,600
Against as well.

1862
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,600
Huh.

1863
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,600
I want to say,

1864
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,600
that I think that the fact that

1865
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
the hunters pretend to be dead,

1866
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,600
I mean that the assassins pretend to be dead

1867
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,600
is really cool. Yeah, yeah it is.

1868
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,600
Wait, which ones are the assassins?

1869
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,600
The purple ones?

1870
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,600
You know, like you'll come upon them

1871
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
and they look like they're dead.

1872
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,600
But sometimes you can see they're like...

1873
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,600
You mean like they pretend to be undead.

1874
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,600
You mean like they play POSSIBLE? No.

1875
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,600
Yeah, those guys killed me a couple of times

1876
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,600
before I understood their nature.

1877
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,600
Dude, they're great.

1878
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,600
And then, oh, fucking mimics.

1879
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,600
And then they get up and they run at you

1880
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,600
but they run in this erratic pattern.

1881
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
They know exactly what to do and make it really hard

1882
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
to hit them. And you never even see their attack

1883
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,600
because it's so fast. They can also reflect bullets.

1884
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,600
Yeah, well, you have like...

1885
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,600
They can reflect bullets. Wow.

1886
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,600
See, I always love games where you feel like

1887
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,600
enemies that have the same movesets

1888
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
and the same mindset that you have.

1889
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
That's always the coolest thing.

1890
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,600
You know, that's what Undertale's got.

1891
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,600
It's got a character who has...

1892
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,600
It's basically the same powers as you

1893
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,600
that you're in competition with.

1894
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,600
Again, this is the sequel to Undertale.

1895
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,600
It just came out this year. Toby Fox

1896
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,600
shipped it off to some people in Sweden.

1897
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,600
He doesn't want to make video games anymore.

1898
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,600
He got all this money. He doesn't need to make any more art.

1899
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,600
This is all just a front to get money.

1900
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,600
And now this is the sequel to Undertale.

1901
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,600
Just like Downwell is the prequel to Undertale

1902
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,600
because it's about falling down.

1903
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,600
The post-cool to Undertale is Shovel Knight

1904
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,600
because that also has...

1905
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,600
That also has...

1906
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,600
All the bosses in Shovel Knight

1907
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,600
make me think

1908
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,600
if I were playing as that character

1909
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,600
with that moveset, I would try to

1910
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,600
fight Shovel Knight roughly the way

1911
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,600
this AI is trying to fight me.

1912
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Where...

1913
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,600
Not all of the bosses. I mean, they're not quite that on that level.

1914
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,600
But a lot of the bosses

1915
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,600
that you fight in that game

1916
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,600
seem to be getting the most usage out of

1917
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,600
their stamina level and

1918
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,600
their moveset as they possibly can.

1919
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,600
And that makes the fight feel

1920
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,600
way more engaging than most boss fights do.

1921
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Where most boss fights are total bozos

1922
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,600
who sit around and wait for you to hit them.

1923
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
And that's why most boss fights are not interesting

1924
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,600
to me in most games.

1925
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,600
Oh shit, my niggas. Gatlin Sugga.

1926
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,600
I think I'm going to be encountering

1927
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
a little hunter.

1928
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,600
Little pizza maker? That's what I call him.

1929
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,600
I almost called him little slugger.

1930
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,600
Dude, that'd be cute.

1931
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,600
Hey!

1932
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,600
I don't know how else to phrase this question

1933
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,600
other than did you know, even though

1934
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,600
I know you don't know, you could play as big dog

1935
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,600
at one point.

1936
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,600
What takes a big dog? Oh yeah, that big dog.

1937
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,600
What? Yeah.

1938
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,600
The one that I keep calling mad dog.

1939
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,600
It's a mad world.

1940
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,600
Wait, why would you play as mad dog?

1941
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,600
You can't go anywhere.

1942
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,600
I know, that's what was good about him.

1943
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,600
Fuck!

1944
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,600
That's how you do that.

1945
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,600
Shit! Holy fuck!

1946
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,600
Fucking ice.

1947
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,600
Look up footage of big dog

1948
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,600
playing a nuker throne and you're going to like

1949
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,600
shit yourself.

1950
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,600
Hey, here's the thing.

1951
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,600
I encountered an enemy version

1952
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,600
of horror the character

1953
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,600
before I unlocked.

1954
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,600
Wait, which character you said?

1955
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,600
Horror.

1956
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,600
Which one is horror?

1957
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,600
Little green doggo.

1958
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,600
Little radiation monster.

1959
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,600
Oh yeah, that one.

1960
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,600
Yeah, what was up with that?

1961
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,600
Will you ignore radiation

1962
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,600
for three levels of spawns

1963
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
and that's how you unlock him?

1964
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,600
I got long arms.

1965
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,600
This is gonna be great.

1966
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,600
Long arms is, you know...

1967
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,600
Well, that's cool.

1968
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,600
I unlocked him without even meaning to.

1969
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,600
Yeah.

1970
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
Long arms is the most

1971
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,600
nice thing for me to have

1972
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,600
with a chicken sword.

1973
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,600
Aw, man.

1974
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,600
Oh yeah, man. If I was chicken, I would...

1975
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,600
Well, actually, then again, the chicken sword

1976
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,600
is not really that great, is it?

1977
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,600
Because it doesn't...

1978
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,600
Like, the wrench is not very good.

1979
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,600
Like, the wrench is good for the sewers,

1980
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
but after that it's like worthless.

1981
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,600
And if the chicken sword does less damage...

1982
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,600
Nice.

1983
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,600
And if the chicken sword does less damage than the wrench,

1984
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,600
I gotta imagine it's probably not that good.

1985
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,600
Yeah, honestly, it's not that good.

1986
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,600
For me, I can't...

1987
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,600
I just can't quite deal with

1988
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,600
the reload time of all the other melee weapons

1989
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,600
that are bigger.

1990
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,600
That delay,

1991
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,600
even if I have trigger fingers,

1992
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,600
that delay is a bit too much for me.

1993
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,600
I would much rather have to finagle around

1994
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,600
doing more strafing to get those hits in

1995
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:20,600
than I would

1996
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,600
with the delay.

1997
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,600
Davoo, next time you pick up...

1998
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,600
Well, the first time when you pick up the energy sword,

1999
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,600
you're gonna feel like a Sumerian god of swordsmanship.

2000
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
Believe me.

2001
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,600
It's gonna rock your brain and destroy your dick.

2002
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,600
I saw it.

2003
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,600
I saw a guy loop like four times with that.

2004
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,600
But I didn't get it.

2005
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,600
Oh, I was gonna tell you, Davoo,

2006
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,600
the world record right now is like a slow play.

2007
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,600
So I think you'd like it.

2008
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,600
I'll link it to you later.

2009
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,600
The world record for what? Score?

2010
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,600
I see.

2011
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,600
I didn't even know there was a score.

2012
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,600
Yeah, it's how many kills you get, dummy.

2013
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,600
Oh.

2014
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,600
That's why it displays it afterward.

2015
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,600
And so it's just your kills,

2016
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,600
not any other factors.

2017
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,600
Because I would love...

2018
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,600
I would be interested if the game had

2019
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,600
a really advanced scoring system,

2020
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,600
based on lots of different factors.

2021
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
That'd be pretty cool.

2022
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,600
I want to be based on distance, too.

2023
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,600
But I think the farther someone's gone

2024
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,600
is like loop four, I think.

2025
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,600
I'm not sure.

2026
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,600
Loop three,

2027
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,600
turn things up a bit,

2028
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,600
and you get scared,

2029
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,600
and you turn into Home Alone.

2030
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Because I like that movie.

2031
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Yeah, apparently.

2032
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,600
What are you talking about?

2033
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,600
What does Home Alone have to do with this?

2034
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,600
You turn into Home Alone, Davoo.

2035
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,600
Don't you understand?

2036
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
Okay, whatever.

2037
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,600
You know, whenever I recover

2038
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,600
my life back as chicken,

2039
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,600
I always forget that that means

2040
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,600
my health is reduced.

2041
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
You know how to regain your health?

2042
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,600
You either have to get

2043
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,600
a stationary medkit,

2044
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,600
or you can pick Last Wish,

2045
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,600
if you're stupid.

2046
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,600
Yeah.

2047
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,600
Well, unless you want to unlock chicken.

2048
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,600
Oh, wait.

2049
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,600
Never mind.

2050
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,600
I can't believe you actually found that out

2051
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,600
without me telling you, by the way.

2052
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,600
How do I unlock chicken?

2053
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,600
I looked it up.

2054
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,600
Who, me?

2055
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,600
You told me.

2056
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,600
I just looked it up.

2057
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,600
Although to be fair,

2058
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,600
I wanted chicken because I heard she has

2059
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,600
a melee weapon from the start,

2060
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,600
and I wanted a character with a melee weapon by default,

2061
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,600
so I went out of my way to unlock chicken.

2062
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,600
So I looked it up.

2063
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,600
The way that I unlocked chicken

2064
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,600
actually got to a

2065
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,600
point where I had to choose a mutation,

2066
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,600
and I was at one health, and Last Wish was an option.

2067
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,600
I was like, you know, I actually kind of want that,

2068
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,600
just so I won't die.

2069
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,600
Okay.

2070
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,600
I've regained my faith in you.

2071
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,600
Your faith was on the line here,

2072
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,600
and I was thinking, you know,

2073
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,600
if Ben doesn't say that this was an earnest

2074
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,600
take at trying to get chicken,

2075
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,600
I might not even like him.

2076
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,600
I don't like this person anymore.

2077
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Like if I cheated at the game

2078
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,600
and just had to say, you know what, Ben,

2079
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,600
we're not going to cut a little more.

2080
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,600
When I first was playing this game,

2081
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:14,600
when I first saw Last Wish,

2082
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,600
I thought of Last Dream,

2083
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,600
which is that item in the final

2084
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,600
Undertale.

2085
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,600
Oh, yeah.

2086
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,600
That reminds me of one nitpick

2087
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,600
with the aesthetic of this game is that,

2088
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,600
I don't know if it could have been done better.

2089
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,600
It's Undertale.

2090
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,600
It's not Undertale.

2091
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,600
That's my own complaint.

2092
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,600
It's that the level up

2093
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,600
cards that you see

2094
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,600
have, I don't know if this could have been done

2095
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,600
better necessarily, but the level up

2096
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,600
cards all have a character on them,

2097
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,600
which is kind of, it makes it

2098
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,600
a little confusing. It's like,

2099
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,600
I'm not that character right now,

2100
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,600
so I just feel like if they had done

2101
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,600
other types of illustrations that were more abstract,

2102
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,600
then that would have been

2103
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,600
better. But again, the way this is fine,

2104
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,600
once I got used to it, it wasn't,

2105
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,600
it was only distracting when I first began

2106
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,600
playing the game.

2107
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,600
I don't mind that, but it does make me wonder

2108
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,600
if the ones that have

2109
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,600
a particular character on them,

2110
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,600
if that's that character's canonical

2111
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,600
moveset. That would be interesting.

2112
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,600
Well, I think my head canon

2113
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,600
is that they're all canonical to everyone.

2114
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,600
Ever since,

2115
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,600
I guess another thing I like about

2116
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,600
the nuclear thrown characters

2117
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,600
is thanks to Undertale,

2118
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,600
where ever since Undertale, I now think

2119
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,600
of every video game protagonist as a time

2120
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,600
traveler.

2121
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,600
See, the thing about this game is that

2122
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,600
it takes place in different universes.

2123
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,600
That's what Loops is. It's not the same universe.

2124
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,600
It's a different universe.

2125
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,600
I see, okay.

2126
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,600
I just naturally think

2127
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,600
of all video game protagonists as time travelers now.

2128
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,600
If you watch my Emily as a Way video,

2129
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,600
there's a part where I mention

2130
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,600
like, so then you go back in time

2131
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,600
to do it this way instead.

2132
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,600
I've been playing

2133
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,600
papers, please.

2134
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,600
And I literally think of this guy

2135
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,600
as this art stoatskin citizen

2136
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,600
who thinks don't go well for him

2137
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,600
so he starts over again to try to make things right.

2138
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,600
I just think of that way now

2139
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,600
because that just makes so much more sense

2140
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,600
and it makes every video game better.

2141
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,600
So that's part of what endears me to the nuclear thrown cast

2142
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,600
is their determination.

2143
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,600
And that's why Undertale is the best game in the world.

2144
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,600
That is. Because it made all other games better.

2145
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,600
When I was playing it, I actively thought

2146
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,600
this makes all video games

2147
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,600
15% better,

2148
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,600
like, approximately that amount.

2149
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,600
Hey, what would that number be

2150
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,600
if it was 5% more?

2151
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,600
Say that sentence again, but have 5% more

2152
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,600
on that debut.

2153
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,600
Yeah, when I said that I realized,

2154
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,600
but I'm talking about better, not like cool or anything.

2155
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,600
Hmm.

2156
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Well, aren't they the same thing?

2157
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,600
No. I don't know.

2158
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,600
I would argue so. I got prescription sunglasses the other day.

2159
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,600
Oh, very nice.

2160
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,600
I've got some.

2161
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,600
Prescription sunglasses, did the doctor have to measure

2162
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,600
that I haven't worn in years?

2163
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,600
Yeah, I did.

2164
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,600
It was an arctuous process, but you know what?

2165
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,600
It was worth it, because now I look 20% cooler.

2166
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,600
Very tidal back in.

2167
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,600
So I died as chicken,

2168
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,600
but then I opened the portal

2169
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
and so now I get another chance.

2170
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,600
I'm sweet. I have a chance for, um...

2171
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,600
Last wish.

2172
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,600
No, actually not really. I have a chance for some kills

2173
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,600
for regenerate HP and more melee range.

2174
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,600
I'm going to go with some kills for regenerate HP

2175
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,600
because I want to be able to live.

2176
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,600
Dude, that's an awesome upgrade.

2177
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,600
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, yeah.

2178
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,600
I didn't make it, so...

2179
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,600
Bloodlust is good too.

2180
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,600
Bloodlust is my favorite upgrade, I think.

2181
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,600
Partly because the card for it looks so awesome,

2182
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,600
because it's white and red.

2183
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,600
It's like, oh yeah.

2184
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,600
The card does look awesome,

2185
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,600
and it's wicked good,

2186
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,600
because it benefits you for killing

2187
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,600
and killing is the one thing you always have to do,

2188
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,600
which is why I really like what he shot too,

2189
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,600
although I don't think it's quite as good as this one.

2190
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,600
Yeah, you might be right about that, but...

2191
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,600
I mean, because like...

2192
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Okay, it's great if you're having ammo problems,

2193
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,600
but not every game

2194
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,600
do you have ammo problems,

2195
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,600
and if you have a game where you're good on ammo,

2196
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,600
it's not a very useful upgrade.

2197
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,600
Well, I think having more or ammo

2198
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,600
isn't necessarily a bad thing ever.

2199
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,600
No, it...

2200
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,600
God, please let me live!

2201
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,600
God, no!

2202
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,600
But it's like...

2203
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600
You only hit...

2204
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,600
You only have to think about ammo

2205
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,600
if you're running low,

2206
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,600
and so if you are running low,

2207
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,600
then Lucky Shot's gonna be great,

2208
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,600
but if you're not, then it's like...

2209
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,600
Well, since I do melee, I never had to worry about ammo.

2210
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,600
So did you die, Munchy?

2211
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,600
Yeah, when you're...

2212
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,600
When you're a melee, it's not as big a deal.

2213
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,600
Which is another reason why I haven't been taking Lucky Shot

2214
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,600
as much, because I've been doing more melee.

2215
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,600
Munchy, did you die?

2216
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,600
No, I didn't die.

2217
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,600
Yeah, I know.

2218
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,600
I can make it out of any situation.

2219
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,600
My name's Henry Houdini, and I live inside the universe.

2220
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,600
Okay.

2221
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Of the game, I mean.

2222
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
Not in this universe.

2223
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,600
It's just the real universe.

2224
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,600
You know, one thing I like about,

2225
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,600
um, like,

2226
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,600
something that this game has made me feel good at

2227
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,600
is being able to swap weapons

2228
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,600
while I'm in the middle of a thought,

2229
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,600
you know?

2230
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,600
Because when I was first getting into Nuclear Throw,

2231
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,600
for some reason I just haven't played games

2232
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,600
or anything yet, where whenever I'm switching weapons

2233
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,600
I have to preoccupy myself with the fact

2234
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,600
that I am switching weapons.

2235
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,600
It's not something that I could just do.

2236
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,600
But now I am good at that.

2237
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,600
I'll hit you with one bullet of this,

2238
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,600
with two bullets of that,

2239
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,600
and with one more bullet of this.

2240
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,600
It has a...

2241
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,600
It's a good, simple...

2242
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,600
It has a bit of a...

2243
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,600
It has a rubbing your head

2244
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,600
and patting your head

2245
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,600
sensation to it.

2246
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,600
What do you...

2247
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,600
What do you mean by that?

2248
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,600
That's hard to do.

2249
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,600
What are you talking about, Manji?

2250
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,600
I'm just saying, like, when you succeed at...

2251
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,600
I've never heard that expression before,

2252
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
ever in my entire life.

2253
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,600
You've never heard the expression

2254
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
rubbing your belly and patting your head?

2255
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,600
No.

2256
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,600
It's not really an expression as much as

2257
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,600
just a description of a thing.

2258
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,600
Well, the idea of it is that it requires...

2259
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,600
It's like an interesting allocation of brain

2260
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,600
that's a little bit harder to do than you'd expect.

2261
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,600
And you have to, like...

2262
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
You have to, like, meditate on it

2263
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,600
for a few seconds before you can do it.

2264
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,600
And when you do it, it has, like,

2265
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,600
this interesting sensation of, like,

2266
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,600
it's really satisfying multitasking and stuff.

2267
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,600
So, um, yeah.

2268
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,600
Davoo, are you

2269
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,600
a serial killer?

2270
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,600
Answer the question, Davoo.

2271
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
There was one time...

2272
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600
There was one time

2273
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,600
a box of Crave fell for no reason

2274
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,600
wasting most of it, and so I shredded the box

2275
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
to pieces because I was so mad.

2276
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
And I knew that if any

2277
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,600
serial ever did that again,

2278
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,600
I would also ceremoniously kill it with a sword

2279
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,600
like I did that box of Crave.

2280
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,600
What the fuck is Crave?

2281
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,600
It's a Kellogg's

2282
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,600
serial that is like...

2283
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,600
It's like, um...

2284
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,600
Ew, Kellogg's? Don't you know

2285
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,600
you're supporting the man?

2286
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,600
Let's talk about politics.

2287
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,600
It's true.

2288
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,600
It's on Paul.

2289
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,600
No, dude, that's old man Rand Paul

2290
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,600
2012.

2291
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,600
Then it'll be Ryan Paul

2292
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,600
his son.

2293
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,600
Good old Ann Rand Paul.

2294
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,600
Yeah, then it'll come full circle.

2295
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,600
The entire libertarian

2296
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:24,600
circle of life will be complete.

2297
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,600
Uh, what kind of...

2298
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:28,600
Oh my god, Rand Paul probably was named after me.

2299
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600
I thought about that.

2300
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,600
I don't have the nerve to look it up because if it's true,

2301
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,600
it'll be very creepy and hilarious and awesome.

2302
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,600
What kind of

2303
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,600
social views do you think these characters have?

2304
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,600
Like, one by one?

2305
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,600
Well, I think they're...

2306
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,600
Munchy, have you seen

2307
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,600
um, that picture

2308
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,600
that's floating around the internet?

2309
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,600
It's called, it's Ask Human Tail.

2310
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,600
Yes!

2311
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,600
Yeah, okay. Well,

2312
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,600
in my opinion, all the characters

2313
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,600
in Nuclear Throne have

2314
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,600
weird and

2315
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,600
out there gender and sexual

2316
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,600
identities of that sort.

2317
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,600
They're all like

2318
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,600
asexual, bi-romantic demigods.

2319
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,600
Asexual. I remember when

2320
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,600
I was looking at someone's DeviantArt pictures

2321
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,600
and like,

2322
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,600
he had like this one of him and he said

2323
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,600
I'm asexual, bi-romantic.

2324
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,600
I'm like, whoa, it's an all new type.

2325
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,600
I haven't seen, I haven't heard of before.

2326
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,600
Yeah, of course.

2327
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,600
I was talking to Digi about this the other day

2328
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,600
and we just after a long and complicated

2329
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,600
process of deep soul

2330
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,600
researching, we determined that Digi is

2331
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:34,600
a, is a hetero-demiromantic

2332
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,600
hetero-demisexual.

2333
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,600
What? That was too mean.

2334
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,600
Hey, you know what? I believe it.

2335
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,600
What the heck is, what the heck is

2336
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,600
demiromantic mean?

2337
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:46,600
Demi is the worst thing ever

2338
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,600
because it describes literally everyone

2339
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,600
in the world, so everyone who describes

2340
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,600
themselves as it is a genius.

2341
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,600
I don't understand what demi means.

2342
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,600
Being demisexual means you have sexual

2343
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,600
attraction, but only for people

2344
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,600
with strong connection to.

2345
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,600
Oh.

2346
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Meaning basically

2347
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,600
a normal person.

2348
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,600
Well, I guess you need that word.

2349
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,600
I mean, we are homo-safians after all.

2350
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,600
Yeah.

2351
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,600
Like, you know, people complain about

2352
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,600
the whole how every Tumblr thing has

2353
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,600
like this detailed description of their

2354
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,600
gender and I'm like, you know,

2355
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,600
when I first was seeing that, I'm like, that's a little bit weird.

2356
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,600
But at the same time, I want to know that

2357
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,600
because, you know, it's

2358
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,600
I know it's kind of weird, but I do

2359
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,600
like being able to know the gender

2360
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,600
of whoever I'm talking to because it does

2361
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,600
slightly affect my etiquette with

2362
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,600
them, right?

2363
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,600
Very slightly.

2364
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,600
On a place like Tumblr,

2365
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,600
where you don't know

2366
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,600
who you're talking to, I can kind of see

2367
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,600
how, you know,

2368
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,600
yes, I'm a girl, use this pronoun

2369
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,600
is like, it makes sense.

2370
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,600
If I know that someone is male or female,

2371
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,600
I will talk more

2372
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,600
like, I mean, in real life,

2373
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,600
you will talk to certain people of different

2374
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,600
genders very with a different kind of

2375
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,600
different level of tone, you know, just

2376
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,600
but

2377
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,600
if someone, okay, if someone

2378
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,600
let's say someone looks male

2379
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,600
but they want

2380
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,600
but they don't identify as male

2381
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,600
and they want to be referred to by

2382
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,600
I don't know, let's say female or

2383
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,600
or neutral pronouns

2384
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,600
like they want you to call them they.

2385
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,600
Um

2386
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,600
Am I an asshole for finding

2387
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,600
that like a big ask and

2388
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,600
like it's sort of an imposition

2389
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,600
like it's asking me to go out of my way

2390
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,600
to refer to you as something that

2391
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,600
is like not

2392
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,600
is not how I would naturally

2393
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,600
do so.

2394
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,600
I don't know what I'm saying.

2395
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,600
I think if you look like

2396
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,600
a little girl, like

2397
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,600
me, then it's

2398
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,600
easier to do it.

2399
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,600
Like

2400
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,600
the biggest qualifier

2401
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,600
because at first I was like saying my opinions on this

2402
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,600
like, oh, you know, this and that, but like

2403
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,600
I don't know any openly trans people.

2404
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,600
I don't know anyone who I know is trans

2405
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:02,600
or anything like that. So I know

2406
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,600
I can't say because, you know, you get

2407
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,600
certain people who are like

2408
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,600
these trans guys who then will like

2409
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:10,600
dye their hair purple

2410
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,600
and then like not look like a woman at all and it's like

2411
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,600
well, that's weird, but obviously

2412
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,600
I'm sure many people think this

2413
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,600
obviously all the people who do an unconvincing

2414
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,600
job of being trans are going to be the ones

2415
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,600
who you notice

2416
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,600
and all the ones who you don't notice are going to be

2417
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,600
the ones who are good at it.

2418
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,600
I think if someone

2419
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:30,600
was good at convincing me they were

2420
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,600
a woman or a man, then it would be very

2421
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,600
natural and easy for me, I think.

2422
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,600
I mean, it

2423
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,600
yeah, it would be easy and I know

2424
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,600
I know one, I know a trans

2425
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,600
woman who is

2426
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,600
I mean, it looks like a man, like

2427
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,600
when I see them, I think, oh

2428
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,600
male and I want to say he, and I

2429
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,600
felt like I was the only person

2430
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:52,600
in my circle who had any problem

2431
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,600
with this and I felt really bad about it

2432
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,600
because nobody else seemed

2433
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,600
to ever make the mistake and I constantly

2434
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,600
did. Is it Nate? Are you

2435
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:02,600
trying to be on the bush here?

2436
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,600
It's Nate, it's

2437
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,600
the best guy ever

2438
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,600
who is now the best girl ever.

2439
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,600
No, but

2440
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:12,600
yeah, and like

2441
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,600
it's unfair to say that, oh

2442
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,600
if you can

2443
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,600
actually look like

2444
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,600
what I imagine a woman to look like, if

2445
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,600
you look a certain way

2446
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,600
then I can accept your request to

2447
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,600
refer to you by this special pronoun

2448
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,600
and if you look another way then I can.

2449
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:30,600
I'm thinking bringing this back to nuclear

2450
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,600
throne, I have no difficulty thinking of

2451
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,600
I have no difficulty thinking of

2452
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,600
obviously chicken as a female, but

2453
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,600
I have no problem remembering that

2454
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,600
I have no problem remembering that

2455
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,600
you know, crystal is female

2456
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,600
I actually do, it took

2457
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,600
me a long time, I mean

2458
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,600
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it, but

2459
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,600
even after I found out crystal was real.

2460
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,600
Like if you have heads around the house you can get good at that

2461
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:54,600
you know, remembering which ones

2462
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,600
which genders, you know whatever.

2463
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,600
Yeah, I guess you're cool.

2464
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,600
I think of people

2465
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,600
being able to select their gender like a freaking

2466
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,600
vending machine is part

2467
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,600
of what makes

2468
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,600
life cool where everything can become a vending

2469
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,600
machine. Everything that you used to take for granted

2470
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,600
can now be an option

2471
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,600
and obviously people are going to be

2472
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,600
really annoying the way they'll go about

2473
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,600
it, some of them, and some people will be

2474
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,600
flam

2475
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,600
will be very aggressive and

2476
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,600
hypocritical about it, but everyone will

2477
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,600
be, there was a moment at which

2478
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,600
I made peace with all of the LGBT

2479
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,600
stuff in its militantism

2480
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,600
when I realized everything

2481
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,600
gets militarized, everything is hypocritical

2482
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,600
maybe that

2483
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:40,600
core has a slightly

2484
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,600
larger percentage of

2485
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,600
people who are militants and hypocritical

2486
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,600
maybe the percentage is

2487
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,600
slightly higher, but

2488
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,600
because that's the worst thing when there's some minority

2489
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,600
that you're a part of and then

2490
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,600
if it's like an

2491
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,600
obscure one

2492
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,600
then people will only have very limited

2493
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,600
experiences with that minority

2494
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,600
and it'll most likely be

2495
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,600
the big assholes who want

2496
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,600
everyone to know it and

2497
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,600
that's kind of the problem with any group

2498
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,600
any group, there's going to be a percentage of them

2499
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
who are normal people otherwise, then there'll be

2500
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,600
a bunch of weirdos, then there'll be a bunch of assholes

2501
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,600
the asshole slice of

2502
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,600
that pie will leave the pie

2503
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,600
and tell everyone about the pie

2504
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,600
and then everyone will think that that group

2505
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,600
is a bunch of assholes because the assholes

2506
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,600
are the activists who represent them all

2507
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:28,600
so

2508
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:30,600
that's what I like to keep in mind that

2509
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,600
I'm not going to think of someone

2510
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,600
as some jerk face until they start being a

2511
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,600
jerk face to me until then

2512
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,600
it's like, you know

2513
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,600
everything else about the advanced

2514
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,600
21st century society

2515
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,600
I really like, so

2516
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,600
you know, I like the fact that

2517
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,600
I can just make youtube videos as a living

2518
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,600
that's a pretty crazy notion

2519
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,600
that's a pretty crazy stupid thing

2520
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,600
that people from the 50s would think

2521
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,600
is lazy, but that's the whole

2522
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,600
point of

2523
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,600
yeah, like

2524
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,600
50 years ago it wasn't expected that

2525
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,600
you could just identify as a different gender

2526
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,600
that would be considered a weak thing to do

2527
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,600
that you'd be giving into

2528
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,600
what you feel is comfortable for you

2529
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:12,600
rather than manning up or

2530
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,600
womaning up and just dealing with life

2531
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,600
and people back in the

2532
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:18,600
50s or whatever back 100 years ago

2533
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,600
could have had the nerve to just deal

2534
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,600
with it and move on

2535
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,600
but guess what, people 100 years ago

2536
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,600
they couldn't have survived 10,000 years ago

2537
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:28,600
when you had to learn how to build a spear

2538
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,600
and fight a fucking tiger

2539
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,600
that whole point we invent stuff

2540
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:34,600
and make society better

2541
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,600
is so that you can be more comfortable

2542
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,600
and be a big baby and live exactly the way you want

2543
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,600
without having to die or get uncomfortable

2544
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,600
or without having to get hungry

2545
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,600
that's the whole point of human progress

2546
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,600
is to have every little tiny stupid thing you want

2547
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,600
so yeah

2548
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:52,600
ah shit, killed by on

2549
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,600
gosh dang, I hate when the rat kills me in this video game

2550
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:58,600
well I pretty much

2551
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,600
I agree with all that stuff you just said

2552
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,600
thank you very much

2553
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,600
there was a

2554
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,600
yeah I think in the past

2555
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,600
I might have been a little salty and been a little like

2556
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,600
you know

2557
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:12,600
being a transsexual is just like

2558
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,600
they're just making it up

2559
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:16,600
I don't know about that

2560
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,600
but it all kind of comes down to how you define

2561
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,600
it all just comes down to definition of terms

2562
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,600
some people don't acknowledge

2563
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,600
that gender is a

2564
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,600
performative thing

2565
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,600
when some people say gender

2566
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,600
what they mean is

2567
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,600
biological

2568
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,600
but when other people's tumblr pages will list their gender

2569
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,600
and their sex which threw me off at first

2570
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,600
but if you feel it's not that way

2571
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,600
then fine

2572
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,600
yeah yeah but like people

2573
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,600
that are trans generally don't use the word

2574
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,600
that way so when someone says

2575
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,600
oh you know it's not real

2576
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,600
you're not really a female or whatever

2577
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,600
you're not really whatever gender you say

2578
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,600
well that's just a question of how you're defining your terms

2579
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:58,600
I like the colors

2580
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,600
in this game

2581
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,600
a nuclear throne yes the colors

2582
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,600
it's you know it starts off with a desert level

2583
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,600
which obviously means that they were

2584
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,600
like that's usually level 2

2585
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:10,600
is desert at least in mario

2586
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,600
desert is level 2 but they made it level 1

2587
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,600
and it's actually

2588
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,600
that's because everyone's mean in this game

2589
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:18,600
they all wear big boy pants

2590
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,600
and kill people because they're mean

2591
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:22,600
you know I just I wish

2592
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,600
I was a little girl

2593
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,600
I think that nuclear throne would be a much

2594
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,600
better more solid game

2595
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,600
if you started in a planes

2596
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:32,600
and level 2 was a forest

2597
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,600
and level 3 was a mountain

2598
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,600
and level 4 was snow

2599
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,600
and level 5 was fire

2600
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,600
with the yachty joke

2601
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,600
which is just him going

2602
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,600
grass world desert world water world mountain world

2603
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,600
rock world boss

2604
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,600
it's a remix it's every mario game

2605
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,600
I have heard

2606
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,600
I have heard him say things like that

2607
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:54,600
that reminds me

2608
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,600
I haven't watched any zero punctuation

2609
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,600
a while ago

2610
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,600
I just stopped watching his

2611
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,600
episodes like for like almost a year

2612
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,600
and then I would just get through them all

2613
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,600
but now I'm back to following them weekly

2614
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,600
you know what I just realized about

2615
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,600
the level color palette is that

2616
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,600
the desert level is actually the most vibrantly colored level

2617
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,600
isn't that interesting

2618
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,600
it's actually the most vibrant level in the game

2619
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,600
I don't know about that

2620
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,600
maybe the

2621
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:24,600
it's got all this fucking

2622
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,600
yeah maybe that but at least for

2623
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,600
all the games

2624
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,600
well I'm talking like how

2625
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,600
overall bright everything is

2626
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,600
because usually the desert level is a time

2627
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,600
to have a more

2628
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,600
reserved color palette where everything is

2629
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,600
more monotone and even though it is kind of

2630
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,600
monotone it's all yellow it has fewer colors

2631
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,600
going on but it is the most vibrant

2632
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,600
the most brightly lit so it does

2633
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,600
give you that sort of planes feeling

2634
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,600
you know of grass feeling where like things are the most

2635
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:52,600
optimistic in a way

2636
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:54,600
because like even though it's a desert it's the most

2637
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,600
optimistic because there's so much sun

2638
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:00,600
so that's kind of a cool

2639
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,600
way it conveys the level one sensation

2640
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,600
that was something that was weird to me

2641
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,600
what's your favorite level in this game

2642
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,600
by the way

2643
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,600
well I'm gonna say the junkyard area

2644
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,600
because it's got rain and the rain is cool

2645
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,600
you may notice in my video on it

2646
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,600
I predominantly use the rain section

2647
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,600
that's true

2648
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:22,600
oh Jesus save me a prayer

2649
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,600
I'm on the prairie

2650
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,600
and I'm a slave

2651
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,600
my favorite level

2652
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,600
is

2653
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,600
I don't know they're also annoying

2654
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,600
in their own ways

2655
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,600
I just actually love them even more

2656
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,600
they all piss me off in

2657
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,600
special unique ways

2658
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,600
I actually really like the caves

2659
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:46,600
yeah the caves are nice

2660
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,600
the caves are really cool

2661
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,600
they make me so mad those fucking

2662
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,600
laser gems make me so mad

2663
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,600
and those crystal

2664
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,600
spiders take so many hits they're so durable

2665
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:58,600
so I hate the caves

2666
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,600
it's funny that you say that because I'm actually on the caves right now on loop

2667
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:02,600
and gosh dang it

2668
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,600
do I hate this boss and how much health it has

2669
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,600
are we trying to avoid spoilers

2670
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,600
munchie is trying to avoid spoilers

2671
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,600
yeah the spoilers

2672
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,600
came in like a giant van

2673
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,600
should we explain

2674
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,600
what this game is

2675
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,600
oh yeah so

2676
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,600
viewers

2677
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,600
nuclear throne

2678
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:32,600
is a roguelite

2679
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:34,600
top down

2680
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,600
they couldn't afford it that much guys

2681
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,600
they know that much

2682
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,600
that was the coolest thing I've experienced

2683
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,600
oh yeah crossbow time

2684
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,600
when I was watching

2685
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,600
Bruce Jenner

2686
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,600
by the way I've been

2687
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,600
by the way I've been getting worse at the game

2688
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,600
the longer I've been playing it

2689
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:54,600
I haven't even made it to the snow

2690
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,600
to Snowden in like

2691
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,600
I've been getting mediumer

2692
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,600
that was the coolest thing when I was watching

2693
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,600
some loop play through and the giant

2694
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,600
vans showed up and then I learned that the way

2695
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,600
to get to the

2696
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,600
you're throwing a monkey rich right inside

2697
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:10,600
the asshole right now

2698
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,600
there's no way someone is going to

2699
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:14,600
listen to a podcast

2700
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,600
Ben, his name is

2701
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,600
Ben, he's a chocolate man

2702
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,600
and he's listening right now DeVoo

2703
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,600
wait I actually wasn't listening right there

2704
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,600
did I miss the spoiler

2705
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,600
what's the point of spoilers

2706
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:28,600
it's not

2707
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,600
I actually appreciate it

2708
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,600
I actually like being unspoiled so

2709
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:34,600
well you shouldn't come into a podcast

2710
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,600
if you don't want to get spoiled to it

2711
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,600
you just have to say things in like

2712
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,600
super like extra cool

2713
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,600
like terms like say if I want to say

2714
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,600
Van I say the big truck man from

2715
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,600
Texas he isn't going to come down and run you over

2716
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:48,600
I have seen the van

2717
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:50,600
I have seen the van in a video

2718
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:52,600
there's no way you can

2719
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,600
be on a podcast about something

2720
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,600
and try to avoid

2721
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,600
spoilers for it hey buddy have you

2722
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,600
been the throne I thought not

2723
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,600
I'm the boss of this gym

2724
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,600
he is, he's a champ

2725
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,600
well the fact that you said

2726
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,600
that there's a throne as a spoiler so there you go

2727
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,600
shit

2728
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,600
because you know back when I was first playing it

2729
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,600
before I looked anything up I was like

2730
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,600
maybe there's not a throne you know like

2731
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:18,600
because of the way the game builds it up

2732
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,600
but there's a tool tip that says

2733
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,600
the throne definitely exists

2734
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,600
exactly that's what made me think

2735
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,600
that it may not

2736
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,600
that maybe it doesn't

2737
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,600
I was getting sort of a Wizard of Oz vibe from it

2738
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,600
have you ever been liked

2739
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,600
in your life yeah by the Wizard of Oz

2740
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,600
the Wizard of Oz the greatest thing about

2741
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,600
that thing contributes to the world

2742
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,600
of storytelling that I don't know if a lot of people

2743
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,600
get from it is the classic

2744
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,600
act of subverting audience

2745
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,600
expectations

2746
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,600
because that's what the whole movie is about

2747
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,600
is you always try to get to the wizard

2748
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,600
but then he ends up being a jerk but then he ends up

2749
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,600
just not being a wizard it like

2750
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,600
superverts your expectations twice and even

2751
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,600
if you're already it's a double twist

2752
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,600
it's an old mobius double

2753
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,600
it's so emotionally dense

2754
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,600
it's so emotionally thick

2755
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:06,600
did you say fuck because you referenced Homestuck

2756
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,600
because that's what you should have done

2757
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:10,600
no I love Homestuck Homestuck's the best thing ever

2758
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,600
I said fuck because I crystal to deflect a missile

2759
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,600
but then it just happened to explode

2760
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,600
I didn't know you were a giant dancing homo bin

2761
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,600
hmm I have just

2762
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,600
what have you ever read

2763
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:22,600
Problem Sooth by the way

2764
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,600
yeah of course

2765
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:26,600
we agree that that's better

2766
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,600
it's not better

2767
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,600
Problem Sooth is better than Homestuck

2768
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,600
Problem Sooth is not better

2769
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,600
yeah I know the one

2770
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,600
what is that

2771
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,600
Problem Sooth was the one he did before

2772
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,600
I'm gonna get into Homestuck at some point

2773
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,600
feel free to spoil it to me though

2774
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,600
that's fine with me because I know that

2775
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,600
no

2776
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,600
I'm not asking

2777
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:50,600
I'm just saying feel free if you want to

2778
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,600
if you want to mention something

2779
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,600
if you've seen like anything from Homestuck

2780
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,600
I see troll fanfiction quite a lot

2781
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,600
yeah well yeah

2782
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,600
there's the trolls but I mean aside from that

2783
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,600
okay what really got me about Homestuck

2784
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,600
was it wasn't like anything

2785
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,600
about the story which is like it's a good story

2786
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,600
it's fine but

2787
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:10,600
what really blew me away about Homestuck was how

2788
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,600
just how like

2789
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:14,600
it expanded in scope

2790
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,600
not just like in its story

2791
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,600
but in like the methods it used to tell it

2792
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,600
this is kind of what

2793
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:22,600
it's sort of what impressed me about Undertale too

2794
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:24,600
is like how I didn't expect it to tell

2795
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,600
its story so like

2796
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,600
just the way that

2797
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,600
in a lot of ways they play like a 16 bit

2798
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,600
RPG to get around

2799
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,600
that sounds cool yeah I know you already know

2800
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,600
about that but like the fact that it starts

2801
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,600
off as this weird goofy little

2802
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,600
comic and yeah some of them are animated

2803
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,600
some of them are gifts and whatever and it's got kind of a

2804
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:44,600
weird format and that's fine but then

2805
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,600
suddenly these fucking like big like

2806
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:48,600
crazy flash movies start happening

2807
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,600
these interactive games and these like

2808
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,600
huge set piece moments

2809
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,600
it was just

2810
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,600
it just man back in the day

2811
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:58,600
when you were reading Homestuck when it was new

2812
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,600
and you didn't know that it was coming it must have been like

2813
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:02,600
holy shit

2814
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,600
holy shit it was scary

2815
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
it was scary wait

2816
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:08,600
did you read Homestuck when it was coming out

2817
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:10,600
it's not done first of all and yes

2818
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,600
yeah

2819
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,600
you would have been like 10 years old

2820
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,600
I'm 65 right now

2821
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,600
he's

2822
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,600
he's like 15

2823
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,600
it's not

2824
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,600
I didn't read it when it was brand spanking new

2825
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,600
I picked it up when

2826
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,600
which granted was a long time ago

2827
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,600
but

2828
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,600
I mean I think that's about when I picked it up too

2829
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:38,600
I picked it up in like 2011 or something which like yeah

2830
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,600
it wasn't new but I didn't know about

2831
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,600
it and so for me it was new when I

2832
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,600
when I got to the you know

2833
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:46,600
wayward vagabond at the end

2834
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,600
it was the longest time and I still love him

2835
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,600
I remember yeah I remember he was

2836
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:52,600
oh yeah I remember

2837
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,600
he's awesome

2838
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,600
yeah that first one where his station

2839
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,600
like takes off it's just like

2840
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,600
it's just so much more than you expected

2841
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,600
from this fucking goofy little comic

2842
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,600
and I mean I hadn't read Problem Sleuth

2843
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,600
before I started Homestuck but I wish I had

2844
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,600
me too because I feel like it would have

2845
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:10,600
set my expectations differently

2846
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,600
God no I fucking love Homestuck

2847
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,600
the best thing ever

2848
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:18,600
no it doesn't matter we're talking about Homestuck

2849
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:20,600
okay

2850
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,600
Undertale and

2851
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,600
how they're the same

2852
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:26,600
that's the biggest thing

2853
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,600
that people need to be educated on whenever they call

2854
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:30,600
Undertale

2855
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,600
Tumblr core it's really Homestuck core

2856
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:34,600
yeah that's true

2857
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,600
Homestuck had the same

2858
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:38,600
Homestuck had the same criticisms

2859
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,600
levied at it for like basic

2860
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:42,600
Homestuck is big enough of a deal on its own to be

2861
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,600
its own thing it doesn't have to be Tumblr

2862
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,600
everyone hates Homestuck now though

2863
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:48,600
no that's not true

2864
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,600
Homestuck ever

2865
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:52,600
no I'm talking to Davoo Homestuck is definitely

2866
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:54,600
got criticized for being like Tumblr

2867
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:56,600
that's stupid you know what's funny is that like

2868
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:58,600
it's funny it's like

2869
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:00,600
the more it went on the more the game

2870
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,600
most of the things I've become a really big fan of in the past

2871
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,600
three years have been things that Tumblr loves

2872
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:06,600
you know even though I don't love Tumblr

2873
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:08,600
you know my little pony Steven Universe

2874
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:10,600
Undertale

2875
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,600
maybe it's just because like that's

2876
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:14,600
the audience that that creators

2877
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,600
have to appeal to you know

2878
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:18,600
so like of course that's the stuff that you know

2879
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,600
well you know like yeah

2880
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,600
well for one thing creators are going to

2881
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,600
especially if they get into Hollywood

2882
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,600
or something they're gonna be inclined to be liberal

2883
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,600
because of the social structure

2884
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,600
there

2885
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,600
that's my understanding is that basically

2886
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,600
Hollywood is

2887
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,600
like it's sort of

2888
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,600
like liberal

2889
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,600
liberal mentality

2890
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:42,600
is inclined to be in Hollywood

2891
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:44,600
because it's kind of a sort of

2892
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,600
commune type of area you know

2893
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,600
in a way like everyone works together

2894
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,600
you have to work in sort of a

2895
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,600
collaborative mindset

2896
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,600
in a way you know what I'm saying like

2897
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,600
rugged individualism doesn't make

2898
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,600
Hollywood movies for the most part you know

2899
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,600
and a million other factors

2900
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,600
there's a million other factors

2901
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:04,600
yeah I mean I guess I see what you mean I think it's

2902
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:06,600
maybe more just that like

2903
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:08,600
the culture of Hollywood is

2904
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,600
liberal so therefore

2905
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,600
the people that get accepted into that culture

2906
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:14,600
will be other liberals generally

2907
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:16,600
obviously a lot of it is also self perpetuating

2908
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:18,600
but I think well what started it

2909
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:20,600
being that way and I think

2910
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,600
there's also a sense of

2911
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,600
well obviously people who hate their parents

2912
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,600
have a lot of inspiration

2913
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:28,600
to create art you know

2914
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,600
through parent hatred

2915
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,600
parents are conservative and Christian

2916
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,600
so there you go there's the correlator right there

2917
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,600
um I mean

2918
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,600
I think maybe there's something to that

2919
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,600
well I think there's got to be a lot because like most of

2920
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:42,600
I'm the freaking only

2921
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:44,600
person on the internet who I

2922
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,600
who I know I don't have any online friends

2923
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,600
who come from Christian

2924
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,600
conservative households who don't hate

2925
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,600
their Christian parents everyone is

2926
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:54,600
either raised by liberal parents

2927
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,600
or hates their conservative parents

2928
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,600
I'm a Christian but

2929
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,600
doesn't everyone kind of hate their parents though

2930
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:02,600
no no you're wrong and I hate people

2931
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,600
like you well I hate

2932
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:06,600
okay I'm using the word hate very

2933
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:08,600
lightly I mean like disgruntled

2934
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,600
is the proper word you know

2935
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,600
I'm not not disgruntled

2936
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,600
at all alright well little hunter killed me

2937
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:16,600
I'm fucking disgruntled

2938
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:18,600
listen to me hey Ben have you ever tried

2939
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,600
to eat your own body

2940
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,600
it's I think you should do that right now so you stop existing

2941
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,600
and you like put your like arms

2942
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,600
inside of your mouth and then you just chew away

2943
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,600
dude I watched one cartoon where that happened

2944
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,600
where like a sheep ate itself

2945
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,600
that was the coolest thing it just

2946
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,600
just shh shh shh shh shh shot everything

2947
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,600
Deveaux do you read one piece

2948
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,600
nope watch it

2949
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,600
awful fucking eats himself

2950
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,600
and it's awesome but he does it

2951
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,600
to become more powerful

2952
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:46,600
because his his devil

2953
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,600
his devil fruit is about like he can

2954
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:50,600
eat things and like take on their

2955
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,600
properties sort of it's it's hard to

2956
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,600
explain I don't really understand it honestly

2957
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,760
but there's

2958
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:58,600
yeah he and at one point

2959
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:03,600
He actually eats himself to, like, reform his body into, like, a new shape.

2960
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:08,600
So what you're saying is that one piece is Steven Universe?

2961
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:12,600
Um, no, it's good.

2962
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:15,600
Unlike Steven Universe, it's good.

2963
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:18,600
You know, one of the other strange stuff.

2964
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:20,600
Yeah, say something about Homestuck.

2965
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,600
Right.

2966
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,600
Oh, I think...

2967
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:25,600
I'm sure this is, like, literally only me,

2968
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:28,600
but I think Spurb was the most interesting thing about that,

2969
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,600
and I wish it just stayed with the kids.

2970
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:32,600
No, I totally agree with you.

2971
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:35,600
And the fact that the game isn't gonna have Spurb in it fucking breaks my heart.

2972
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:42,600
And, yeah, the fact that the early comic is all about exploring the mechanics of this crazy game,

2973
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:44,600
that's what got me into the comic.

2974
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,600
Now it's all about the characters, like, you know, resolving their arcs and whatever.

2975
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,600
I mean, that's fine.

2976
02:01:48,600 --> 02:01:49,600
Are you joking me?

2977
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:50,600
They're not gonna res...

2978
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,600
I don't know.

2979
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:58,600
Hustle's all about meta shit, and he's gonna pander to DigiBro, and I hate him.

2980
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:00,600
He's gonna pander to DigiBro.

2981
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,600
Yeah, he'd better.

2982
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:05,600
If he wants to get to DigiBump, that is.

2983
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:07,600
Um, no.

2984
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:10,600
No, I mean, I'm reserving judgment on the ending of Homestuck.

2985
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:15,600
I want to see the end so I can get perspective on all the fucking bullshit we've had to deal with.

2986
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,600
I know, I know.

2987
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,600
See whether it was all worth it.

2988
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,600
So long, dude.

2989
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,600
I want California to win.

2990
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,600
I want that to be the big twist.

2991
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,600
That would be meta.

2992
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:25,600
That would be super meta, dude.

2993
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:33,600
Dude, when John went back and, like, saw Caliborn and, like, brutalized him and left him traumatized,

2994
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,600
I feel so sorry for him.

2995
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,600
I know, he's his character.

2996
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:39,600
Yeah, he's hard to hate.

2997
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,600
He's gotta be.

2998
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,600
He can't be the same Lord English that is, like, the fucking monster man.

2999
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,600
He's gotta be a different dude, because he's too lovable.

3000
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:50,600
Just unrelated.

3001
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,600
I don't really like him.

3002
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:53,600
I don't really like him that much.

3003
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:54,600
Nah.

3004
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,600
He's too green.

3005
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:56,600
I don't know.

3006
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,600
I don't know what it is about him.

3007
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,600
I like his coat the most.

3008
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,600
I think his coat is, like...

3009
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:01,600
Oh, yeah.

3010
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:02,600
His coat is really cool.

3011
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,600
But, you know, I think he designed the coat before he designed the Lord English.

3012
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,600
Yeah.

3013
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,600
You know, I think that's literally true, actually.

3014
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,600
I think it's definitely...

3015
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,600
Homestuck induced.

3016
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,600
Just, dude, oh, shit.

3017
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:16,600
Oh, because you saw that fucking coat in the fucking scratch in Mission with the midnight crew.

3018
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,600
Oh, my God, it was so fucking cool.

3019
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:19,600
That was the shit.

3020
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:24,600
You know, back in the day, people who skipped that are the vein of my existence.

3021
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:25,600
Dude, I didn't...

3022
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:29,600
I think I skipped it my first time through, and I felt like such an asshole when I went

3023
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,600
back and read it, and it was so awesome.

3024
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:36,600
Homestuck has allowed me to zone out a bit and made me realize I have the music on, and

3025
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,600
that's also distracting me.

3026
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,600
I just need the sound effects, so thank you.

3027
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:41,600
You've helped improve my skills.

3028
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,600
Welcome, dude.

3029
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:44,600
Yeah, the music is droning.

3030
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:45,600
Yeah.

3031
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:52,600
I think Jack Noir was like my favorite villain for a long time, just because he was so cool.

3032
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:55,600
He's just cool.

3033
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:56,600
He's pretty cool.

3034
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,600
I don't know if I'd say he's my favorite villain.

3035
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,600
Well, not now.

3036
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:01,600
He's just kind of like an angry...

3037
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,600
He's just kind of like an angry...

3038
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,600
I mean, he's always just been like...

3039
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,600
He's just an angry dude.

3040
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,600
I know, but he was...

3041
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,600
He got personality, nigga.

3042
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,600
He does.

3043
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,600
He does.

3044
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:12,600
He's got a lot of heart.

3045
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:18,600
So, Munchy, you were talking a little while ago about why you're jaded to this game.

3046
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,600
It didn't have the co-op like they wanted.

3047
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:24,600
Oh, it didn't have the co-op, and there's a lot of...

3048
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:29,600
I think just balance issues that they promised and didn't really deliver on just because

3049
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:30,600
of time.

3050
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,600
Well, not time.

3051
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:32,600
Well, maybe time.

3052
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:36,600
The way this game was released is they made a deal with Sony.

3053
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:38,600
At least I'm pretty sure it was Sony.

3054
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,600
What?

3055
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:40,600
I know that's something to do...

3056
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,600
Yeah, it's on the PlayStation.

3057
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,600
In case you didn't know.

3058
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:43,600
And we know.

3059
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,600
They said they were going to release it by the end of the year.

3060
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:49,600
And the end of the year came.

3061
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:52,600
And so they had to release it, even though they...

3062
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:54,600
Like, this update is extremely broken.

3063
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:57,600
I don't know if you've ever encountered a...

3064
02:04:57,600 --> 02:05:02,600
When you go into a Crown Vault, there's a bug where you...

3065
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:10,600
Sometimes it will like turn into like a broken level, and you'll have to like fight enemies

3066
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,600
from the level, like before it.

3067
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,600
Sounds like some NES glitches right there.

3068
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,600
Yeah, it really is.

3069
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,600
It changes like part of the walls.

3070
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,600
Do you?

3071
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:20,600
It looks really weird.

3072
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,600
That's like some...

3073
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:22,600
I've seen it change part of the walls.

3074
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,600
That's cool.

3075
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,600
Yeah.

3076
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,600
I've seen it change part of the walls.

3077
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:28,600
Honestly, I think it is cool, but the problem about that is it takes up one of your...

3078
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,600
You can only have three...

3079
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:35,100
You can only enter three Crown Vaults per run, which I think is the most stupidest thing

3080
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,600
I've ever heard before.

3081
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:41,600
But anyway, the reason that's not like cool is it like takes away one of those and you

3082
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:45,600
can't, you know, takes away an opportunity to get a Crown.

3083
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,600
Wow.

3084
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:49,100
Man, I picked something I don't often pick.

3085
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:52,600
I picked less enemy HP because I'm going...

3086
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:54,600
Dude, that looks great.

3087
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,600
You need to prioritize that one.

3088
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:58,600
Because I'm playing chicken, but I have the screwdriver because I want to unlock YV,

3089
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:02,600
which means I'm basically doing all melee, which is great except it takes forever to kill

3090
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:05,600
things, but with less enemy HP, that is not a problem.

3091
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,600
Uh...

3092
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:08,600
Oh, yeah.

3093
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:09,600
One of the main...

3094
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,600
The scarier face is awesome.

3095
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's great.

3096
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:14,600
One of the main things I had about this game is something that neither of you know about

3097
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,600
yet, so I can't...

3098
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:16,600
Well, actually...

3099
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,600
Yeah, fuck you.

3100
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,600
Davoo has like warped my brain.

3101
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:22,600
See, he's perverted my brain into something more sinister, something more dark.

3102
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:23,600
If it's...

3103
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:24,600
If it's not like a...

3104
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:27,600
I mean, I'm probably not going to mind.

3105
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:31,600
I'm definitely going to appreciate whatever you say, if it's interesting.

3106
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:34,600
Oh, well, that's going to be up to you.

3107
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:38,600
When you reach the throne room, and you're going to know, you're going to know what it

3108
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:43,600
has been, and I'm going to ruin this price for you right now, but the generator...

3109
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,600
Is it about blowing up the generators?

3110
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:46,600
Okay.

3111
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,600
When you get to the throne, you walk up and there are these generators, and from your

3112
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:53,600
guys' perspective, they've always been there, right?

3113
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,600
There's never been a time where there hasn't been generators.

3114
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:57,600
Okay.

3115
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:03,600
In order to loop the game, you must destroy the generators and have the throne go super

3116
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:07,600
aggro, and when you kill the throne, you get taken to the throne too, which is, you know,

3117
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:11,600
a baddie, super boss, mega ultra 3D.

3118
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:14,600
Anyway, it didn't used to always be like that.

3119
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:18,600
It used to be you just destroy the throne and you get taken to loop.

3120
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:24,600
Now, this doesn't seem so bad, and in and of themselves, I guess generators aren't exactly

3121
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:30,600
the biggest problem in the universe, but what it implies is what?

3122
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:32,600
Davoo got on the biggest problem in the universe.

3123
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,600
Yeah.

3124
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,600
Okay.

3125
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:36,600
Well, whatever.

3126
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:37,600
Okay.

3127
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:40,600
The special car is red, right?

3128
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:41,600
Yeah, red and gold.

3129
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:42,600
Sweet.

3130
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:43,600
Yeah, it's a little darker.

3131
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,600
Okay.

3132
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:45,600
Everyone stop.

3133
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:46,600
Wait, you died?

3134
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,600
I did it.

3135
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:48,600
Wait, did you die?

3136
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,600
Turn your follow-up and mute Skype.

3137
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:51,600
Turn your music up.

3138
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:52,600
Turn your music on.

3139
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:53,600
Please.

3140
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,600
I died.

3141
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,600
Damn.

3142
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,600
You're disappointing to me.

3143
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:57,600
Anyway.

3144
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:58,600
But did you get the...

3145
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,600
But did you get YV?

3146
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:05,600
I exploded the red car.

3147
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,600
No.

3148
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,600
No, you're not supposed to explode the red car.

3149
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,600
You're supposed to just...

3150
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,600
What do you do?

3151
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,600
You hit it with the screwdriver and it fixes it.

3152
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,600
Oh, and then you get in?

3153
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:15,600
Yeah.

3154
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,600
Okay, cool.

3155
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:17,600
It says get in.

3156
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:21,600
Guys, you need to get up in the fact that you're doing a podcast while I'm not paying

3157
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:22,600
attention.

3158
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,600
Geez.

3159
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:24,600
All right.

3160
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:25,600
Well...

3161
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,600
All right.

3162
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,600
Next time.

3163
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:31,600
The reason I don't like this is because loops are pretty much integral to the game and making

3164
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:34,600
it any, at least, somewhat interesting.

3165
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:37,600
Because all of the best weapons you get are like level five and up and you're going to

3166
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,600
use it for that long if it's just getting thrown.

3167
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,600
Yeah.

3168
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,600
That's...

3169
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,600
Loops are like my favorite part about this game.

3170
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:47,360
Well, obviously the loops is like the whole thing that keeps it endlessly challenging.

3171
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:52,600
So, yeah, the fact that loops is this very specific requirement is, is, uh, stupid.

3172
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,600
Mm-hmm.

3173
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,600
I can't believe you actually agreed.

3174
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:57,600
I don't know.

3175
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,600
I can't have an opinion until I've actually agreed.

3176
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:00,600
And it's a pain...

3177
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,600
I said generators aren't that big of a problem, but they pretty much are.

3178
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:07,600
It's just like an animate object you have to, like, shoot at.

3179
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,600
And it doesn't always give you your ammo back.

3180
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:15,600
So it's, like, sometimes, like, not even, like, fun to do it or rewarding.

3181
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,600
Because, you know, another...

3182
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,600
Because, like, I guess the idea is that they wanted to make loops mysterious or something

3183
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:20,600
where, like, hard to get.

3184
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,600
No, no, no, no.

3185
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:24,600
It's not that because when you sit on the throne, you get an ending.

3186
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,600
So they wanted to make it a cinematic experience, I'm assuming.

3187
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:29,600
I've never even seen the ending.

3188
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,600
I've only seen loops.

3189
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:32,600
Mm-hmm.

3190
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,600
So...

3191
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,600
So they wanted...

3192
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,600
But why would they make it...

3193
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:39,600
Oh, killed by a big rat that's never happened before.

3194
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,600
Why would they make it to where the quicker...

3195
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:45,600
The actual ending is easy, but then the looping is hard?

3196
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:46,600
That's to make it mysterious, right?

3197
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:49,600
To make it like, whoa, I actually got even further than expected.

3198
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:50,600
Is that the idea?

3199
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:52,600
To make it like, I'm going beyond...

3200
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,600
That sounds...

3201
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:54,600
Like, basically...

3202
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:56,600
That sounds like the idea.

3203
02:09:56,600 --> 02:10:00,600
Which doesn't work quite as well when it wasn't already like that in the original version.

3204
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:02,600
So you're, like, mystifying something that wasn't already mysterious.

3205
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:08,600
But even in and of itself, something that Undertale very much convinced me of is that that kind

3206
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:13,600
of crazy going beyond the barriers, freaking, you know, like second half of Girl in the

3207
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:17,600
Lagoon type of stuff, should be easy to get to.

3208
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:21,600
It shouldn't be this crazy thing where you have to do three back flips and then you

3209
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:25,600
will stick a bubble gum on top of a trash can in order to unlock.

3210
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:29,600
Because it's the coolest part of the game, you should just do it easily.

3211
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:34,600
Not like automatically, but do it just enough to where it's easy to get to, because it can

3212
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:36,600
still be just as satisfying.

3213
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:40,600
And there's so much content that's like, restricted to loops.

3214
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:46,600
There's so much content that just some people just won't do, because they don't know.

3215
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:50,600
Like, how do you get the whole second half of Symphony of the Night?

3216
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:53,600
Don't you have to do, like, a specific thing?

3217
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,600
Oh, yeah.

3218
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,600
I forget.

3219
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:58,600
But it's like, I think you have to...

3220
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:00,600
I have no idea.

3221
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,600
It's something like that.

3222
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:02,600
You do have to do some secrets.

3223
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:07,600
Yeah, and it's like, you know, you can make that not crazy secretive and it'll still be

3224
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,600
really satisfying.

3225
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:10,600
You'll still feel like you're going against the room.

3226
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:11,600
I don't know, man.

3227
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,600
I think it's cool.

3228
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:14,600
I think it's cool that it's, like, hard to find.

3229
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,600
I think that makes it more meaningful.

3230
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,600
I don't know.

3231
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:17,600
That's what I would have...

3232
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:18,600
Something like Nuclear Throne.

3233
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:21,600
I think it might be different, because you have to do it every time.

3234
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:22,600
Yeah, exactly.

3235
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:27,600
In something like Castlevania, if it's hard to do, that's fine, because you just do it

3236
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:28,600
once, and then you got it.

3237
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:29,600
I guess so.

3238
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,600
Yeah.

3239
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,600
Because that's how I would have used to feel, but the way the Undertale leads you into it

3240
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:34,600
made me feel like...

3241
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:38,600
Because Undertale does have plenty of things that are crazy obscure to get that are, like,

3242
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:39,600
little things.

3243
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:42,600
So I don't know.

3244
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:46,600
Dude, I've got Rabbits Paw and Scary Face for my first two upgrades.

3245
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,600
You're doing it.

3246
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:48,600
Is this the run?

3247
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:52,600
I want one of you to be the Throne on podcast, so you can, like...

3248
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:55,600
That's definitely not going to happen.

3249
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:57,600
I haven't even made it to...

3250
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,600
You have to understand, even if I get past Little Hunter, I'm going to get to the freaking

3251
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,600
labs, and I'm still not going to be paying attention.

3252
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,600
The Palace is super easy.

3253
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:07,600
Well, it was super, until they buffed the Guardians.

3254
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,600
It depends.

3255
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:12,600
I've gotten layouts where it's really hard, because it's, like, big and open, and everything

3256
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:14,600
is coming at me from every direction.

3257
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:18,600
Then I've gotten other ones where I'm in, like, a little safe corner, and I can, like,

3258
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:20,600
safely proceed through, and that was really easy.

3259
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:22,600
Oh, well, the Guardians are the ones that, like, shoot the orbs of you.

3260
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:25,600
They used to be really easy, because they only shot one.

3261
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:26,600
And they were...

3262
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:27,600
Those ones aren't so...

3263
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:28,600
I know, but...

3264
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,600
It's the ones that jump at you.

3265
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:31,600
Oh, the dogs, yeah.

3266
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:32,600
You know...

3267
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,600
Go to PetSmart and get a leash, dude.

3268
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:39,600
The thing about doing the podcast in this format that's pretty insane is the fact that we

3269
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:41,600
all do not have any sense of how long we've been going.

3270
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:46,600
Like, we don't see the time code, so we don't ever feel the urgency to stop, which is funny,

3271
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,600
because I could just go on forever.

3272
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,600
Yeah, I...

3273
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,600
How long have we been...

3274
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:52,600
It's probably been two hours.

3275
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,600
Oh, my...

3276
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:55,600
I'm gonna cut this down a bit.

3277
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,600
Yeah, have fun cutting it down.

3278
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:57,600
I'll take a while.

3279
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:02,600
Well, I mean, I love, like, seven-hour videos, so to me, this is, like, the perfect video.

3280
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:06,600
Yeah, because for me, I always feel like I'm always able to just talk forever, like, literally.

3281
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,600
Yeah.

3282
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:08,600
For I...

3283
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:12,600
It's almost always someone else who leaves or stops a conversation.

3284
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:17,600
My endurance knows no bounds, even when my throat is dying.

3285
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,600
Mm-hmm.

3286
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,600
Like, if anyone...

3287
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,600
I feel you, I feel you.

3288
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:24,600
If anyone who's listened or watched my Q&A would know that even if my throat is dying,

3289
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:29,600
I will still just keep talking into oblivion forever and ever more.

3290
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:32,600
And, oh, my gosh, this level 1-3 is insane right now.

3291
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,600
Oh, my gosh.

3292
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:35,600
This level 1-3 is insane?

3293
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,600
No, no, no.

3294
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:37,600
This particular version of it.

3295
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,600
This particular...

3296
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,600
Whoa!

3297
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:43,600
This plane flipped this out of the charts!

3298
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:44,600
Is it...

3299
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:45,600
Is it...

3300
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,600
Is there a gold scorpion?

3301
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:48,600
Yeah, there was a gold scorpion before I killed it.

3302
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:50,600
Okay, well, there better be.

3303
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:54,600
But, like, the way the level was arranged was, like, everything was all in a very tightly compact,

3304
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:56,600
like, like, hoop.

3305
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,600
It was the most insane 1-3 I've seen.

3306
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:02,600
I'm not saying 1-3 is insane.

3307
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:05,600
I'm saying that particular one was insane 4-1-3.

3308
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:06,600
Come on, guys.

3309
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:07,600
Get the picture.

3310
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:08,600
I get it.

3311
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:09,600
I get it.

3312
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:11,600
We don't hate you yet.

3313
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:12,600
Yeah.

3314
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:13,600
Much.

3315
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:18,600
I'm gonna play YV because I don't feel like trying.

3316
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:23,600
Yeah, the fact that he doesn't actually die, he just gets bored of the failure.

3317
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:24,600
Is that...

3318
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,600
That's canonically what happens, yeah.

3319
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,600
Yeah.

3320
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:31,600
You know something, I was taking a swig of water, so an enemy was coming toward me.

3321
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,600
That's like Kirby.

3322
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:33,600
Kirby never dies.

3323
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:34,600
He just gets bored.

3324
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:35,600
I'm sorry.

3325
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,600
I totally steamrolled him up there.

3326
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:37,600
Don't do that.

3327
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:40,600
I was taking a swig of water, and I didn't pause because I don't like pausing.

3328
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,600
And then an enemy was coming towards me, and so I'm like, oh, I'll just shoot him.

3329
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:46,600
And it was a grenade launcher, so I died.

3330
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:49,600
Oh, well.

3331
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,600
Holy shit.

3332
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:56,600
Like, 40 ravens just, like, they flock, you might say, onto my screen.

3333
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:58,600
Well, I like them when they...

3334
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,600
They're okay.

3335
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:02,600
I don't ravens when they have a wrench.

3336
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:07,600
Ravens with a wrench becomes like a whack-a-mole in reverse.

3337
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:08,600
In corridors.

3338
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:10,600
In, like, tight corridors, they're easy.

3339
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,600
In, like, a big open space, they're hard.

3340
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:14,600
Ravens are the birds that come down, right?

3341
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,600
Yeah.

3342
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:19,600
When you've got a wrench or any other similarly powerful melee weapon, they become whack-a-mole

3343
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:20,600
upside down.

3344
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:21,600
And...

3345
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:24,600
Wrench is like the worst melee weapon.

3346
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:26,600
Why is that the worst melee weapon?

3347
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,600
It goes fast and it's fun.

3348
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,600
Well, it's...

3349
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:29,600
Well, it's because it's...

3350
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,600
I mean, obviously the screwdriver is the worst.

3351
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:38,600
And, like, the wrench is the worst of the acceptable melee weapons.

3352
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:44,600
I mean, a wrench is serviceable in the sewers, but beyond that, it, like, can't kill anything

3353
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:45,600
in one hit.

3354
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:46,600
Freaking try...

3355
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:51,600
Well, I mean, I'm gonna stick with my chicken sword, though, because I get to always have

3356
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:52,600
it.

3357
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:53,600
No, no.

3358
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:58,600
Like, I look for a wrench, like, I want a wrench to get into the sewers, but beyond that, like,

3359
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:01,600
I'm always trying to get a sledgehammer from the shovel.

3360
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:06,600
There is some sense in that, because I built up my affinity for...

3361
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:07,600
What do you mean there's some sense in that?

3362
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,600
They're just way better.

3363
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:14,600
That personally applies to me, because I built up my affinity for the wrench when I was beginning

3364
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:20,600
the game and not usually getting very far, not usually getting, you know, to Snowden.

3365
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:25,600
So, obviously, in the couple of times I've used, like, the sledgehammer in the Snow area,

3366
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,600
I was getting pretty good use out of it, because, yeah.

3367
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:33,600
So, yeah, I guess I will start planning around using the hammer.

3368
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:36,600
I mean, I just like to kill things in one hit.

3369
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:41,600
And when you got to get really close, like, in a melee situation, it's like, if you can't

3370
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:44,600
kill it in one hit with a melee, it's not worth meleeing.

3371
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:46,600
Well, I don't know about that.

3372
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:50,600
Yeah, especially in the Snow area, because when you hit them once, then they start flying around

3373
02:16:50,600 --> 02:16:54,600
if they're not dead yet, and that could cause some damage, so that wouldn't be good, you know.

3374
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,600
There's something I was going to say, but I forgot.

3375
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:02,600
Oh, oh, Davoo, I want to, like, record, like, VHS record for future generations.

3376
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:06,600
Your face when you find the Ultra Shovel for the first time.

3377
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:07,600
Let me think.

3378
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:08,600
I've never seen the Ultra Shovel.

3379
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:11,600
I mean, I've probably seen some footage of the Ultra Shovel.

3380
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:12,600
What does it do?

3381
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,600
It's a shovel, but ultra.

3382
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:22,600
When did that become, like, established that, like, the system of Super than Ultra?

3383
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:25,600
Like, that was, like, the way it became established.

3384
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:30,600
Well, Ultras are, like, oh, oh, oh, you mean, like, ever?

3385
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:31,600
Yeah, in all of video games.

3386
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:33,600
Like, in language generally.

3387
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:35,600
Yeah, like, was that a video game invention?

3388
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:37,600
I wouldn't be surprised.

3389
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:40,600
It's my first encounter where there was Super Star Saiga.

3390
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:47,600
I'll bet that there was less of a clear hierarchy between the two words before video games came around.

3391
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:50,600
That's one of the cool things about video games in terms of how they benefit culture,

3392
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:58,600
is that it's allowed people to, like, systemize a lot of things that were very abstract before,

3393
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:01,600
but now we think of them as more...

3394
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:03,600
I don't think it allowed us to systemize them.

3395
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:06,600
I think it just demanded more systemization than we had previously.

3396
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:11,600
It just made us more, what I mean is, not allowed, but it made us more inclined to think that way.

3397
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:12,600
You know?

3398
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:14,600
And I like that, that's pretty cool.

3399
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:16,600
Uh, yeah, probably.

3400
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:18,600
For us, us millennials who play video games.

3401
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:19,600
Finally, I have a year...

3402
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:20,600
Hold on, uh...

3403
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:22,600
No, are you gone, Davoo?

3404
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:25,600
Finally, I have the energy weapon upgrade and an energy weapon.

3405
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:27,600
I almost never have both for some reason.

3406
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:28,600
That's good.

3407
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:30,600
Dude, Lisa Brain is good.

3408
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:35,600
Anyway, what I was saying is I completely fucking forgot and Davoo ruined the podcast.

3409
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:40,600
I never get Lisa Brain because I never really use energy weapons,

3410
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:45,600
because they don't seem to do as much damage as they wish they did for their low rate of fire.

3411
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:48,600
To remember what you were saying, just recreate what was being set up to that point.

3412
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:50,600
Like, recreate the scene.

3413
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:53,600
All I can think is black people.

3414
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:55,600
Um...

3415
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:58,600
Melee, Ultra...

3416
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:00,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

3417
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:04,600
This isn't like a thing that you people will have input on, this is just a statement.

3418
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:05,600
What do you mean?

3419
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,600
Yeah, you kind of people.

3420
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:08,600
Yeah.

3421
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:10,600
Ultra weapons should be called nuclear weapons.

3422
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,600
Just think about that.

3423
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:12,600
Oh, yeah.

3424
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,600
Yes, I agree.

3425
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,600
I immediately...

3426
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:15,600
I don't even have to think about it.

3427
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,600
Everything is nuclear in a way, so...

3428
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:21,600
Although, there is already a nuke launcher.

3429
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,600
It's like, what would you have a nuclear nuke launcher?

3430
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:25,600
Dude, wouldn't that be cool?

3431
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,600
It would be kind of cool.

3432
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:30,600
I mean, since nuclear stuff is part of the world building,

3433
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:33,600
calling stuff nuclear would be a little inelegant.

3434
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:37,600
Well, the weapons aren't nuclear.

3435
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:39,600
I mean, like, the things are.

3436
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:42,600
I think that is cool.

3437
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:46,600
The only thing that I don't think it would work with is with the nuke launcher,

3438
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,600
but, like, whatever.

3439
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:48,600
Just give that one a different name.

3440
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,600
Who fucking cares?

3441
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:53,600
Call it a thermonuclear...

3442
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:54,600
Thermonuke.

3443
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:55,600
Yeah, thermo.

3444
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:56,600
Thermo's got to...

3445
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:57,600
How about men's gay and I eat butt?

3446
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:58,600
Everything should be thermo.

3447
02:19:58,600 --> 02:19:59,600
How about that?

3448
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,600
How about that's the name of it?

3449
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:06,600
No.

3450
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:09,600
Well, over the course of this podcast,

3451
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:13,600
I've become very much into crossbows more than I was before.

3452
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:15,600
Yeah, dude, they're really good.

3453
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:17,600
Yeah, I'm a fan of crossbows.

3454
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:19,600
Because doing really specific aiming where you're, like,

3455
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,600
weaving in and out like crazy and the enemies are weaving in and out like crazy

3456
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:29,600
and, like, against all odds that Arrow finds its way to the enemy is pretty sweet.

3457
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:30,600
It's just so satisfying.

3458
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:32,600
It's way more...killing an enemy,

3459
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:35,600
killing, like, a salamander with a heavy crossbow bolt

3460
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:39,600
is way more satisfying than killing them with, like, a bomb.

3461
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,600
I don't know why.

3462
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:44,600
Yeah, it's probably the most satisfying killing in the game.

3463
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:51,600
Ben, I don't know how you even, like, survive, like, life using explosive weapons.

3464
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:52,600
You know, here's the thing about...

3465
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:53,600
I only came to that conclusion.

3466
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:54,600
I don't know, dude.

3467
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:58,600
Here's the thing that annoys me about, like, all pro discussions about from pros in games

3468
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:02,600
is that if a weapon or an option is not very effective,

3469
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:04,600
then you're called a pleb for using something that isn't effective.

3470
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:06,600
But in the end, if something is very effective

3471
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:09,600
and you're called a pleb for using something that's too effective,

3472
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:10,600
I don't understand.

3473
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:11,600
I'm not a pro.

3474
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:16,600
Like, you've been shitting on things that are too effective

3475
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,600
and then shitting on things that are effective,

3476
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:19,600
and it's like, I don't understand.

3477
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:22,600
Dude, you have to be me.

3478
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,600
Or you aren't cool.

3479
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,600
The...

3480
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,600
Shit, I feel like I had something to say to that.

3481
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:32,600
But it's gone.

3482
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,600
That's because I was right.

3483
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,600
The... oh yeah, explosives.

3484
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:44,600
I get a lot of good use out of, like, grenade shotguns in Snowden.

3485
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:47,600
I don't know, I just, like, fire them down quarters and...

3486
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:49,600
Whenever you decide to do an explosive run,

3487
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,600
make sure to always get boring veins so you don't die.

3488
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,600
I never get boiling veins because I'm crystal,

3489
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:00,600
so I feel like only the very low minority of the time

3490
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:03,600
am I going to be at low enough health to benefit from it.

3491
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:09,600
If you, like, get hit at, like, HP 9 or something, you know, high,

3492
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,600
it'll still, like, make you not die.

3493
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:15,600
Like, if you, like, get with a point-day explosion when you have full health,

3494
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:16,600
it'll...

3495
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:20,600
Oh, will it make the explosion only bring me down to 4?

3496
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:23,600
Oh, that's really good, then.

3497
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:26,600
That's way better.

3498
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:30,600
I thought, I thought if I was at 5 and got hit with a 5 damage explosion,

3499
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,600
that I would die.

3500
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:34,600
Oh, that's so much better than I thought.

3501
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:36,600
Munchie...

3502
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:37,600
Oh, that's so good.

3503
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:38,600
That's a good weapon.

3504
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:43,600
And don't let any of those cocks in the big government tell you otherwise.

3505
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:46,600
Never.

3506
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:53,600
Is it worth getting the homing bolt upgrade if you have the secret pistol?

3507
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,600
Yeah, because it's, like, way more accurate than what it does.

3508
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:01,600
Like, when you have, like, the normal, like, without the mutation,

3509
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:03,600
like, you can't shoot down a hallway, but when you have it,

3510
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:06,600
it'll, like, lock on to any of these from very far away.

3511
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:07,600
That's totally worth it.

3512
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:09,600
Yeah, it is hard to shoot it down.

3513
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,600
Hey, which aiming reticule do you guys use?

3514
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:14,600
The first one, because it's the best one.

3515
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:17,600
What?

3516
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:18,600
You can choose your aim there, yeah.

3517
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:21,600
What?

3518
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:25,600
Well, for me, I actually go with the YV one.

3519
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:26,600
Partly because it's cool.

3520
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,600
Yeah, the YV one is nice.

3521
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,600
But also because it's a graphic, it's like an actual thing.

3522
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:35,600
It's YV in the shape, it's like YV's shape with the triangle on the eye.

3523
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,600
But because it's an actual graphic, it always catches my eye,

3524
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:42,600
and therefore it's easier to pay attention to it.

3525
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:46,600
When I use any other reticule, I just forget it's there.

3526
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:51,600
Partly because it, like, also the YV one is more solid of a thing.

3527
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,600
Like, it's more of a shape that, like, really catches my attention.

3528
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:58,600
And so it's, I never forget where my reticule is,

3529
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:03,600
whereas with using any other ones, I will sometimes forget where I put it.

3530
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:11,600
Yeah, I mean, I don't have a problem because I mostly just aim by, like,

3531
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:13,600
I don't even know.

3532
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,600
Like, I don't look at my crosshair ever.

3533
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,600
I just kind of infer where I am.

3534
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:20,600
I just shoot blindly, like a child.

3535
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:23,600
Dude, when I get the Steam Controller, this is going to be the first game I try it on.

3536
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:26,600
I just shoot blindly, like a child.

3537
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:28,600
What kind of child are you?

3538
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:31,600
Well, right now.

3539
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:35,600
All of the little kids with their pumped up nuclear thrones.

3540
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:40,600
Chicks, go, run better, run out, run my 2011.

3541
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:45,600
Um, it was a good year.

3542
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:46,600
It was a good year for the internet.

3543
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:48,600
Wait, that song came out in 2011?

3544
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,600
Man.

3545
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:50,600
I think so.

3546
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,600
I'm feeling 2012, but...

3547
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:53,600
That sounds about right.

3548
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:57,600
Because I remember that was all over the radio when I was in California,

3549
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:00,600
and that's also the year that I picked up Homestuck.

3550
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:01,600
Oh, okay.

3551
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:02,600
Yeah, I don't know.

3552
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:06,600
And so you made Homestuck AMVs based on better run, better run.

3553
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:09,600
Just one or two, yeah.

3554
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:13,600
There's a lot of narrative of fucking...

3555
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:14,600
Something.

3556
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:16,600
I don't know, emotional something there, you know?

3557
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:20,600
The most emotional part in Homestuck is when Carcat gets his shoes stolen.

3558
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,600
You know what I'm saying?

3559
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:28,600
I've conceived of more ideas for AMVs than I have watched AMVs.

3560
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:31,600
I don't like anime.

3561
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,600
Yeah, I don't really watch AMVs.

3562
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:37,600
I guess I don't seek them out.

3563
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:39,600
But there are lots of times where I'm like,

3564
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,600
oh man, I could sync this up with that and it'd be great, but...

3565
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:43,600
Yeah.

3566
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:50,600
In high school, I made a Fully Coolie AMV set to float on by Roddy's mouse.

3567
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:55,600
It was before I knew what an AMV was, so it was still cool back then.

3568
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,600
I rammed my mic until it was cool.

3569
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:00,600
It was face of a kid today.

3570
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:04,600
He grew a horn and said, that's not okay.

3571
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:10,600
Is that how the song goes?

3572
02:26:10,600 --> 02:26:12,600
That's FLC over here.

3573
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:20,600
What's sad is I feel like I'm pretty decent at coming up with improvised parody lyrics,

3574
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:23,600
but then I can't sing at all.

3575
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:25,600
Oh no.

3576
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:28,600
You might as well just throw yourself off a bridge.

3577
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:30,600
I think I'm pretty good at making parody lyrics.

3578
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:35,600
I can immediately sync up all the syllables and make every line different,

3579
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:40,600
but also syncing up with the theme of the original song and the new parody theme.

3580
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:42,600
Davoo, we all think we're good at something.

3581
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:47,600
It's time you just learned to not think highly of yourself.

3582
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,600
It's time you learned that no one has anything.

3583
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,600
I am way above average good at making parody lyrics.

3584
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:56,600
And that's quite the skill.

3585
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:57,600
Yeah.

3586
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:02,600
Well look, I mean, obviously by the fact that I don't do it often,

3587
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:05,600
it proves that I understand its lack of usefulness.

3588
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:12,600
You know who thinks they're really good at singing?

3589
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:14,600
Christian Weston Chandler.

3590
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:23,600
He has described her voice as having a quote unquote Bing Crosby flavor,

3591
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:27,600
but she's totally toned out.

3592
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:30,600
I mean, I've watched enough videos of her trying to sing.

3593
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:32,600
Wait, she's identifying as female now?

3594
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:34,600
I didn't know about this.

3595
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:39,600
I went to the Sonichu Wiki and I didn't mention that.

3596
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,600
By the way, I went to the Sonichu...

3597
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:43,600
Oh no, well they might still call her Christian there,

3598
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,600
because I mean, that's how they've always referred.

3599
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,600
I mean, I still think of him as Christian.

3600
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,600
I still think of him as a guy, honestly,

3601
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,600
because that's how I always read about him.

3602
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:54,600
Did you hear about how he got arrested?

3603
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:55,600
Oh yeah, dude.

3604
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,600
I mean, which time he's been arrested?

3605
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,600
I've heard of Sonichu years ago,

3606
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:05,600
but it seems like you guys really keep up on your CWC information.

3607
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:07,600
No, it's me, man.

3608
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:09,600
I am a fucking scholar.

3609
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:12,600
I am a fucking scholar of Christian.

3610
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:16,600
My junior and senior year of college,

3611
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:19,600
following the adventures of him was my main hobby.

3612
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,600
I even tried to make a fan game about him.

3613
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:25,600
I made an RPG maker game based on one of his own games.

3614
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,600
And I actually did a shit ton of sprites.

3615
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:30,600
Wait, did you post that anywhere?

3616
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,600
I think I remember seeing.

3617
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:34,600
No, no, no.

3618
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:36,600
There are other versions of it that were made.

3619
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:37,600
I never post them.

3620
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:41,600
You see, I can be fascinated by the autism universe,

3621
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,600
but then I get...

3622
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:44,600
It's something that I only appreciate in spurts.

3623
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:46,600
It's not something I can stew in.

3624
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:49,600
It's not like...

3625
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,600
I was in the chat, introduced me to the new storyteller,

3626
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:55,600
and I was so into him for like 30 minutes.

3627
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,600
I did subscribe, but then I unsubscribed.

3628
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,600
No, it's not the same.

3629
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:01,600
The new storyteller...

3630
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,600
I mean, I haven't watched his videos,

3631
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:06,600
but he just makes ridiculous videos.

3632
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:09,600
Christian Weston Chandler not only makes this ridiculous content,

3633
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,600
but he also had this bizarre narrative surrounding him.

3634
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:17,600
Okay, you know Max Landis' video about where he condenses down

3635
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,600
the whole story of Triple H?

3636
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:21,600
I could do that.

3637
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:24,600
And I actually think I almost want to do that for Chris.

3638
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:27,600
But you should draw it in the style of Sonichu.

3639
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:32,600
Maybe, maybe, I don't know.

3640
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:33,600
But okay, here's the thing.

3641
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:37,600
The story of Chris is like professional wrestling

3642
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:39,600
in that it's a bunch of people playing characters.

3643
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:43,600
The only thing is that the main character doesn't know it's an X.

3644
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,600
June Show crossed with wrestling.

3645
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,600
Yes.

3646
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,600
I've never described it that way before,

3647
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,600
but that's a really elegant way of describing it.

3648
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,600
I'm really impressed with myself right now.

3649
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:55,600
Yeah, it's like a big circus,

3650
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:57,600
but the main character doesn't know it's all an X.

3651
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:02,600
He really believed that all these ridiculous characters were contacting him

3652
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:06,600
and that Shigeru Miyamoto was talking to him about getting his game,

3653
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:08,600
his comic license for a video game.

3654
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:12,600
And he thought that Reggie Philzheim and Jay-Z

3655
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:15,600
and all these famous people were talking to him.

3656
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:22,600
And he had like, have I told you about, there was the liquid side where a guy,

3657
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:27,600
yeah, this guy, just for fun, for his own time, he wasn't trying to mess with anyone.

3658
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,600
He just made videos where he pretended to be Chris

3659
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:32,600
and put them up for his friends to enjoy.

3660
02:30:32,600 --> 02:30:35,600
But people found the vids and sent them to Chris

3661
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,600
and pretended that this was the guy who was actually trying to impersonate him.

3662
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:43,600
And so Chris got really upset and challenged the so-called imposter

3663
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:48,600
to a karaoke contest to determine who was the real Chris.

3664
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:50,600
And the fake Chris crushed him.

3665
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:52,600
Wow.

3666
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:54,600
And the story just goes on.

3667
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:57,600
It's like years and years of people playing these roles

3668
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:02,600
and just duping Chris into believing that these outlandish things are happening.

3669
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,600
Wait, I need to talk directly to you, Ben.

3670
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:07,600
This isn't directly related to a Christian,

3671
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:12,600
but have you heard of a man named Jace W. Connors?

3672
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:16,600
Otherwise known as ParkourDude91.

3673
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:18,600
No, I've never heard of him.

3674
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:21,600
I think I might have sent you a video of him at one point in my life.

3675
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,600
Wait, wait, was he the guy who was like, you gotta follow your bliss?

3676
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:25,600
No, no.

3677
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:26,600
You gotta follow your bliss.

3678
02:31:26,600 --> 02:31:28,600
That guy actually knows him.

3679
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:29,600
Oh.

3680
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:32,600
But we'll see, ParkourDude, we found out it was an act.

3681
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:35,600
But anyway, it's a really fucking good act.

3682
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:38,600
And the one that I'm gonna link you one day, it's this guy.

3683
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:40,600
Hey, speaking of, oh man, I got interrupted.

3684
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:44,600
Speaking of really good acts, have you ever heard of My Immortal?

3685
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,600
Yeah.

3686
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:47,600
Yes, I know about My Immortal.

3687
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,600
I'm pretty sure it's an act, but it's pretty good.

3688
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:53,600
It may have been sincere, like, at first, somewhat,

3689
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,600
but it definitely became a comedy thing.

3690
02:31:56,600 --> 02:32:00,600
That's probably my favorite autism thing that I was into for a while.

3691
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:03,600
But, Munchy, what were you saying about the...

3692
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:11,600
ParkourDude91 is this character where he's supposed to be a 420 gamer.

3693
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:14,600
That's his character, and he's really into Parkour,

3694
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:23,600
and he thinks he's a marine, even though he's never been in the army.

3695
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:28,600
And he'll say, I'm a disabled and wounded veteran.

3696
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:30,600
I need to keep you with respect.

3697
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:34,600
But all of those things contradict everything else.

3698
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:37,600
Being into drugs, being into Parkour, and being a wounded veteran.

3699
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,600
None of those things are compatible.

3700
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,600
I know, but see, it makes this...

3701
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:43,600
That's intentional, oh my gosh, that's brilliant.

3702
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:47,600
It makes such a convincing case, because those are all the things

3703
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:51,600
that people who play shit like Call of Duty extensively,

3704
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:55,600
and all that Xbox Doritos culture,

3705
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:58,600
it all culminates into this character this person made,

3706
02:32:58,600 --> 02:33:01,600
who continued to be like...

3707
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,600
He kept up this for like two years, I think it was,

3708
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:07,600
making constant videos.

3709
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:12,600
One time he flipped his car, and he said he was in a drag race,

3710
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:16,600
and his Prius couldn't perform.

3711
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:19,600
And he got mad at his car, yeah.

3712
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:20,600
In the bedroom.

3713
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,600
He's so insane.

3714
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:26,600
I would like to see some of this dude.

3715
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:29,600
I'm going to give you my favorite one, it's called The Hater Hit List.

3716
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:33,600
Here's the thing, I think people who are able to convincingly put on an act like that,

3717
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,600
and then keep it up for a couple of years,

3718
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:37,600
they have to also be somewhat insane.

3719
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,600
Because that's the thing, anyone who can come up with the idea

3720
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:42,600
of I'm going to play a crazy artist,

3721
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:46,600
and then you will get bored of it immediately, that's what I do anyway.

3722
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:49,600
And I'm just thinking, people who can actually keep up that act,

3723
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:54,600
the lines blur just a smidge as to whether or not you're actually insane.

3724
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:56,600
People who are able to keep doing it convincingly,

3725
02:33:56,600 --> 02:34:01,600
and not go insane doing it, to not be bored.

3726
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:06,600
Some like, I mean, do you guys know Froggy Fresh, the rapper?

3727
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:07,600
I know of him.

3728
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:08,600
AKA Krispy Kreme?

3729
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:14,600
Yeah, well, he released these famously terrible raps.

3730
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:20,600
But the thing is, they were just good enough that they actually sounded kind of good,

3731
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:23,600
even though the lyrics were embarrassing.

3732
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:27,600
I mean, it's still an open question.

3733
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,600
Nobody really knows, but I am one of the people that comes down on this.

3734
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,600
I kind of think he was faking it.

3735
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:35,600
I think that Froggy Fresh is a character.

3736
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:36,600
But no one believes me.

3737
02:34:36,600 --> 02:34:37,600
Everyone else thinks he's legit.

3738
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,600
And maybe he doesn't.

3739
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:41,600
You know, someone like the new storyteller is,

3740
02:34:41,600 --> 02:34:46,600
there's no way that can't be legit, because it's not that funny.

3741
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:49,600
It's not, like, the level of effort that it takes

3742
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:54,600
versus the amount of funniness that it is, is just too diminishing of returns, you know?

3743
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:56,600
So there's no way that's not funny.

3744
02:34:56,600 --> 02:35:01,600
I mean, full disclosure, I didn't actually watch any of his storytellers videos.

3745
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:02,600
Brilliant.

3746
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:03,600
I love him.

3747
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:06,600
I think he's boring, honestly.

3748
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:07,600
I think he's, like, whatever.

3749
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,600
Well, he's not like someone who you could endlessly come back to or anything.

3750
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:13,600
He's not that interesting that you could just always enjoy him.

3751
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:18,600
But, like, his voice, he has some major speech empowerment.

3752
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:22,600
I really feel like he must have been the inspiration for Bane, the new one.

3753
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:24,600
The way he talks.

3754
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:25,600
Like, I just feel like Christopher Nolan.

3755
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:26,600
Bane?

3756
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:28,600
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

3757
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:30,600
The new Bane.

3758
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:34,600
Like, Christopher Nolan, like, watched the new storyteller,

3759
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:36,600
and was like, that guy is really cool.

3760
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:38,600
You know, I can see that.

3761
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:43,600
Christopher Nolan has a famous taste in what cool voices are sounding like.

3762
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,600
You know?

3763
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:45,600
This is a cool voice.

3764
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:46,600
And so is this.

3765
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:52,600
Everyone is cool in my world.

3766
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:54,600
Oh, oh, man.

3767
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:57,600
A snow golem blew up, and I almost died, but I was okay.

3768
02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:00,600
I like how we're all still playing Nukia from.

3769
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:01,600
Yeah.

3770
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:02,600
I thought...

3771
02:36:02,600 --> 02:36:05,600
I'm actually getting into the swing of talking and not even thinking about what's going on

3772
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:06,600
in the game.

3773
02:36:06,600 --> 02:36:08,600
And I'm not doing that great, but, you know, I'm getting better.

3774
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,600
Like, I'm actually making it to snow.

3775
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:13,600
I am shocked at how good this is and how this is actually making all of our conversation

3776
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,600
better, I think.

3777
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,600
Yeah.

3778
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:20,600
It makes me realize that Sam's the noises, not the skeleton.

3779
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:24,600
This is a great setup for a podcast, you know, other than...

3780
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:26,600
Do you want to, like, make this a thing?

3781
02:36:26,600 --> 02:36:28,600
I, you know, I've been thinking that.

3782
02:36:28,600 --> 02:36:30,600
I mean, I really...

3783
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:31,600
Oh, shit.

3784
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:32,600
I just killed a little hunter.

3785
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:33,600
Good job, dude.

3786
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,600
Yeah, boy.

3787
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:39,600
I mean, I think this is obviously a lot less entertaining to listen to than we think,

3788
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,600
because any boring parts are, we then start playing the game more seriously

3789
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:44,600
when we aren't talking.

3790
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:45,600
Oh, absolutely.

3791
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,600
This isn't going to come out.

3792
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:49,600
That's why I'm saying, like, even though I'm having a good time, I'm definitely going

3793
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:51,600
to have to edit this down.

3794
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:55,600
Like, honestly, we've, honestly, we've spent a disproportionate amount of this podcast

3795
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:59,600
talking about this podcast, and I think I'm going to try and trim some of that.

3796
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:00,600
Because I'm...

3797
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:05,600
I think I'm just amazed that it's not like that, like, it's not, like, incredibly boring

3798
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:07,600
and we're not even, like, saying anything.

3799
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:08,600
Yeah.

3800
02:37:08,600 --> 02:37:09,600
No.

3801
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:12,600
We haven't had much radio silence, which is a victory.

3802
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:13,600
Victory.

3803
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,600
Dot, dot, dot.

3804
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:15,600
Blood launcher.

3805
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,600
Oh, do that.

3806
02:37:16,600 --> 02:37:18,600
I don't even know what that is.

3807
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:20,600
It won't hurt you unless you want it out of ammo.

3808
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:23,600
And if you try to shoot it when you don't have ammo, it, like, it, like, will shoot,

3809
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:26,600
but it won't, like, it'll take damage.

3810
02:37:26,600 --> 02:37:27,600
Oh.

3811
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:31,600
Well, then I just won't use it with no ammo.

3812
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:32,600
Sweet.

3813
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:36,600
If you get the cannon, it's a much better version.

3814
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:39,600
Well, I can only do what I can do.

3815
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:44,600
Like, the, like, blood explosions that it shoots, it won't hurt you, and it destroys projectiles,

3816
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:46,600
like enemy projectiles.

3817
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:48,600
Yeah, yeah.

3818
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:49,600
Nice.

3819
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:55,600
Well, I found my new favorite weapon.

3820
02:37:55,600 --> 02:38:00,600
How often do you guys go in the pizza sewers?

3821
02:38:00,600 --> 02:38:02,600
I've never gone to the pizza sewers.

3822
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:04,600
Is that the place with the turtles?

3823
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:07,600
Yeah, I've been there a couple times and I don't know what the point is.

3824
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:15,600
The way weapons drop in this game, every portal you go into ups the tier of weapons you get.

3825
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:22,600
So if you go in one more portal, that means you'll get one, like, slightly better weapons.

3826
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:24,600
Holy shit, that's so cool.

3827
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:28,600
Because I've always been fascinated by the way it'll show the map of levels that you're going through

3828
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:31,600
and how going through a side portal will show a distraction.

3829
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:34,600
Like, I always felt like there must have been some more significance to that.

3830
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:35,600
Yeah, I know.

3831
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:39,600
That is some freaking cool stuff, man.

3832
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:42,600
Now, I'm going to tell you something that will blow your mind.

3833
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:43,600
Okay.

3834
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:48,600
Robot, his, like, passability is that he gets one tier better weapons.

3835
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:49,600
Okay.

3836
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,600
I see.

3837
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:55,600
Now, if you go into the pizza sewers, you go into both of the vault portals.

3838
02:38:55,600 --> 02:39:01,600
And since, uh, cursed weapons can appear, like, two tier more weapons.

3839
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:08,600
And, like, say if I get a cursed chest and, like, one-one, I can get a one-three weapon.

3840
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:09,600
So it's like that.

3841
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,600
If I do all those things, I can get a cursed super plasma cannon,

3842
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:16,600
which happens on the throne in, uh, two-two.

3843
02:39:16,600 --> 02:39:18,600
Or, I mean, in, uh, five-two.

3844
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,600
Wow.

3845
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:20,600
Yeah.

3846
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:21,600
That's pretty cool.

3847
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,600
So it's great how that works.

3848
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:26,600
Yo, relevant about the pizza sewers, because I haven't been there,

3849
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:28,600
but I checked out the music for it.

3850
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:31,600
And that's the music I used at the beginning of my video.

3851
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,600
That's the only weapon, yeah.

3852
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:36,600
I mean, the only music that I genuinely like a lot.

3853
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:37,600
Yeah.

3854
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:40,600
Besides the Venus Mansion music, which you'll see why I like that.

3855
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:41,600
Yeah, I've listened to that, too.

3856
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,600
Okay.

3857
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:45,600
I listened to almost all the OST in, um, when making the video.

3858
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,600
And I ended up going for the pizza sewers for the first half of the video.

3859
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:53,600
And so, obviously, it sounds exactly like the music for the-

3860
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,600
Shit!

3861
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:56,600
God fucking damn it!

3862
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:57,600
The thing-

3863
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:58,600
Did you win?

3864
02:39:58,600 --> 02:39:59,600
Damn, it killed by a horror dog.

3865
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,600
I mean, thank you, man, y'all.

3866
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:02,600
Hee-hee.

3867
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:03,600
I was on, ugh.

3868
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:05,600
I was in the- I was in the darn.

3869
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:06,600
I was in 7-1.

3870
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:08,600
That was the best I've done so far.

3871
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:09,600
Well, hey, getting better.

3872
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:11,600
I think we're, like, we're training you.

3873
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:12,600
We're-

3874
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:13,600
I guess so.

3875
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:16,600
This is, like, this is the longest I've played at a stretch in, like, maybe ever.

3876
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:19,600
Dude, I play this game for hours on end, and I have no friends.

3877
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:20,600
I-

3878
02:40:20,600 --> 02:40:24,600
I have been going in, like, short spurts, which is not usually how I play games.

3879
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:26,600
Usually I fucking marathon them.

3880
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:29,600
But nuclear throne, I've been more like, oh, I'll play, like, four or five games,

3881
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:30,600
then I get bored and I go do something else.

3882
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,600
I can't wait until you guys unlock hard mode.

3883
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:35,600
Yeah, there is.

3884
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:36,600
Is there a hard mode?

3885
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:39,600
Okay, so the thing about the pizza sewers music is that it sounds-

3886
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,600
I don't know if this is obvious to everyone, like it is to me.

3887
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,600
It sounds exactly like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles NES game music.

3888
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:46,600
Which-

3889
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:47,600
Well, yeah.

3890
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:48,600
That's probably intentional.

3891
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:49,600
Yeah, yeah.

3892
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:52,600
But, like, the thing about that that was so impressive to me is, one, the fact that-

3893
02:40:52,600 --> 02:41:00,600
The most impressive thing about that to me is that the Ninja Turtles NES game music

3894
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:02,600
was its own distinct sound.

3895
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:04,600
Which is something that I wouldn't have thought about.

3896
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:05,600
That-

3897
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:09,600
That Ninja Turtles NES game music was a distinct sound.

3898
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:12,600
That could be imitated with a new song.

3899
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:18,600
That was, like, really made me reflect on NES music.

3900
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:20,600
8-bit chiptune.

3901
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:27,600
And the observational powers prowess of Lambeer, whoever made that song.

3902
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,600
Like, it's such a specific thing.

3903
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,600
I couldn't-

3904
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:31,600
I don't know.

3905
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,600
He probably just identified some, like, key riffs in it.

3906
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:41,600
No, like, the way that the instruments are set up, I don't know what the terminology

3907
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:47,600
is for chiptune, but the way that it's done is, like, the way the synths blare out is

3908
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:48,600
similar.

3909
02:41:48,600 --> 02:41:51,600
But maybe there's some similar melody going on as well.

3910
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:52,600
I don't know, man.

3911
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:56,600
I listen to quite a bit of chiptune, and there are different types.

3912
02:41:56,600 --> 02:41:57,600
There are chiptune.

3913
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:58,600
I'm always fascinated.

3914
02:41:58,600 --> 02:42:03,600
Have any of you guys ever heard, like, a chiptune remix that's, like, really low energy?

3915
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:06,600
It's, like, it's almost like a lullaby.

3916
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:07,600
Yeah, I hate those.

3917
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:09,600
I can't stand those.

3918
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,600
Well, you know, I hate it when I'm looking for an exciting one and I get a lullaby.

3919
02:42:14,600 --> 02:42:18,600
Like, before my body is dry, chiptune is like that.

3920
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:23,600
And it's, like, I do appreciate the unique tone that that gives it, but I want a real

3921
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:28,600
one, and I feel like people are demotivated to make one because that one exists.

3922
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:32,600
So it's, it's, I feel like it's deprived the earth of a proper chiptune.

3923
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:34,600
Don't lose your way.

3924
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:39,600
I feel like pixel art and chiptune, by nature, should be energetic.

3925
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:40,600
It needs energy.

3926
02:42:40,600 --> 02:42:41,600
It needs strength.

3927
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:42,600
It needs stamina.

3928
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:43,600
Those do not have the strength.

3929
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:44,600
Don't have the stamina.

3930
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:46,600
Dark souls.

3931
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:48,600
Dark souls.

3932
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,600
This is pixel shit.

3933
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:52,600
You heard it here, folks.

3934
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:53,600
Why?

3935
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:54,600
Why?

3936
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,600
I was embodying Trump.

3937
02:42:56,600 --> 02:43:00,600
I was talking about pixel art that doesn't have energy, doesn't have the strength or

3938
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:03,600
the stamina to be part of the indie scene.

3939
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:08,600
I saw on the, on the Asanshu Wiki that, that CWC was opposed to Trump.

3940
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:12,600
And, you know, that was pretty, pretty influential.

3941
02:43:12,600 --> 02:43:14,600
CWC doesn't have his own opinions.

3942
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:15,600
CWC.

3943
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:17,600
He's a god.

3944
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:19,600
He just, he just parrot, he just parrots things.

3945
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:21,600
It's like whatever.

3946
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:25,600
The only thing you can consistently count on him to do is hate men, mostly gay ones.

3947
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,600
That's true.

3948
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:28,600
And without good reason.

3949
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:31,600
I mean, or with good reason.

3950
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:33,600
He has, he has some kind of weird line.

3951
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:39,600
He'll sometimes say about how his like principal in elementary school like molested him, but

3952
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:41,600
I don't believe it for a second.

3953
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:42,600
I think it's some lie.

3954
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:47,600
I think, I think his, I think his dad like made up the story or like grossly exaggerates

3955
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:48,600
the story.

3956
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:49,600
They only molested him a little bit.

3957
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,600
Some like weird southern agenda.

3958
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:54,600
Like there, there was one time where a counselor said, where did they touch him?

3959
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:55,600
Where did, where did they touch you?

3960
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:59,600
And he pointed to like some really inoffensive place and like, oh, okay, you can go home now.

3961
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:02,600
That was a pretty okay place to be touched.

3962
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:03,600
I get the feel.

3963
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:04,600
Okay.

3964
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:07,600
Now I'm just kind of going off of my vague memories here, but I'm pretty sure he just,

3965
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:12,600
he talks about like that the, the principal like made him sit on his lap, which is not

3966
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:17,600
necessarily an inappropriate thing to do with the kid, but he says it as though it's like,

3967
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:19,600
you know, this weird gross section.

3968
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,600
I don't know man.

3969
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:28,100
The only way that I can follow an asshole and like study them is if they do something

3970
02:44:28,100 --> 02:44:30,600
that's cool and I like them.

3971
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:33,600
Dude, Sonichu is cool and I like it.

3972
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:34,600
Maybe.

3973
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:38,600
That's why, that's why I can follow Chris because I can get, I can follow him through

3974
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:39,600
the lens.

3975
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:40,600
Okay.

3976
02:44:40,600 --> 02:44:45,600
Like the only person who I study and dislike is movie Bob because I mean like, I don't

3977
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:48,600
know, maybe overall he's an okay person, but there's so many things about them that

3978
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:53,800
are jerky that make me mad, but his reviews are just a little bit too good that I can't

3979
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:56,760
keep, I have to keep coming back to them.

3980
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:00,520
So then as a result, I have to, yeah, he's, he's got you by the balls over the last four

3981
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:01,520
years.

3982
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:04,600
I've had to analyze him to understand why he's like that and he's not, you know, he's

3983
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:05,600
not that big of a jerk.

3984
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:10,840
It's just that like, I think his prop, his capacity to be a jerk is probably not significantly

3985
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:12,400
higher than most people.

3986
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:16,600
It's just that he's willing to let it ruin his videos, which no one else is willing to

3987
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,600
do.

3988
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:22,100
Like anyone who makes good videos doesn't want their jerky tendencies to ruin them.

3989
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:25,560
They'll put their asshole in this aside.

3990
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:26,560
I know I do.

3991
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:27,560
I don't know, man.

3992
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:29,560
His videos are all about his opinion.

3993
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:36,760
Well, it's not, it's not the same thing I would have to, if you want me to, I could

3994
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:41,080
go into an in depth explanation, but I don't think I want to hear it like the way he does

3995
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:43,600
it is not quite the same.

3996
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:49,600
But I guess you may have, you may have tapped into the way he sees it though.

3997
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,600
I mean, yeah, I'm not sure.

3998
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:55,600
I'm not sure what you want from him.

3999
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:00,600
I mean, if he's, if he's a guy with shitty opinions and his videos are opinion pieces.

4000
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:04,600
Well, yeah, it's not like I've ever told him, like, calm and didn't stop doing this.

4001
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:08,600
But if he'll be pissing me off and pissing me off and I could explain it, but you know,

4002
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:10,600
I don't, I don't want to get into all of that.

4003
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:16,600
I mean, he's not like someone like say Sargon of Akkad, whose videos are shitty and obnoxious,

4004
02:46:16,600 --> 02:46:18,600
even aside from their content.

4005
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:21,600
Just the format of them is obnoxious and shitty.

4006
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:24,600
That's part of it.

4007
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:30,600
Like if you were like really tightly written, like the flaws in his writing and the, is

4008
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:32,600
like really the, they're intertwined.

4009
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:34,600
This is like an intertwined issue.

4010
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:41,600
The flaws of his writing and the writing itself are too, are too closely linked to it.

4011
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:42,600
Yeah, yeah, I know.

4012
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:43,600
I do each other.

4013
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:45,600
I don't know.

4014
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,600
I mean, I don't really get it.

4015
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:48,600
I don't want to.

4016
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:49,600
I feel like I could go on too long.

4017
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:52,600
I mean, I'm not, I'm not even that big on movie Bob hating.

4018
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:57,600
I'm mostly been exacerbated in it because Digipro has been ragging on movie Bob lately.

4019
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:01,600
So that's kind of amped me up, but being like, yeah, frickin movie Bob.

4020
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:02,600
Exactly.

4021
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:06,600
But I really haven't been mad at him in a while, except for that one time where I watched one

4022
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:08,600
of his videos and then turned it off because I got so mad.

4023
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:11,600
But I don't like, I have a frickin life now.

4024
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:12,600
I don't frickin.

4025
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:13,600
All right.

4026
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:14,600
I picked up the shovel.

4027
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:22,600
I, I forwent, I forwent, I forwent my, my chicken sword to get a shovel.

4028
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:24,600
Now I'm at five one.

4029
02:47:24,600 --> 02:47:27,600
So hopefully I can find a screwdriver somewhere around these parts.

4030
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:28,600
Oh wow.

4031
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:29,600
Shovel on five two.

4032
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:30,600
Best weapon in the game.

4033
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:32,600
Munchie.

4034
02:47:32,600 --> 02:47:34,600
You're on the West coast, right?

4035
02:47:34,600 --> 02:47:35,600
What time is it?

4036
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:36,600
12.

4037
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:38,600
Oh my God.

4038
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:39,600
Okay.

4039
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:48,600
Using a melee weapon to hit the robo snipers bullets back at them is like, probably like

4040
02:47:48,600 --> 02:47:53,600
my favorite gaming thing to do in a game of 2015 that isn't in Undertale.

4041
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:59,600
Like, like that is the most, I sometimes I would just sit there for a while and just

4042
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:00,600
do that constantly.

4043
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:04,600
Just, just hit them, hit the bullets back, hit the bullets back.

4044
02:48:04,600 --> 02:48:08,600
Unfortunately, I'm a little baby crystal, so I don't have to do that.

4045
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:11,600
I can just shield them back at them, which is also pretty cool.

4046
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,600
I like how it's significantly lower than it kills them.

4047
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:16,600
It's like self like worth just by calling him a baby crystal.

4048
02:48:16,600 --> 02:48:18,600
Well, but I accidentally triggered the ICC.

4049
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:20,600
Well, I mean, I mean, no, be IPPC, whatever.

4050
02:48:20,600 --> 02:48:25,600
You see, you see the reason why is because on, is because on some level I already knew

4051
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:26,600
it.

4052
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:28,600
So when you said it, it just, it just.

4053
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:33,600
Like, if I didn't really, if I didn't deep in my heart know that I was a little baddie

4054
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:36,600
for playing crystal, I wouldn't be bothered by you saying it.

4055
02:48:36,600 --> 02:48:38,600
But because I know it's true, it hurts.

4056
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:41,600
Dude, Otto Crospo, Crino.

4057
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,600
Oh, it's so good.

4058
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,600
There's an Otto Crospo.

4059
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,600
Yeah.

4060
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:46,600
Whoops.

4061
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:48,600
Oh, I went, I went into the green portal.

4062
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:50,600
They got to the throne room.

4063
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,600
Whatever you call that thing, the green portal.

4064
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,600
Oh yeah, the chronicle.

4065
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:56,600
All right.

4066
02:48:56,600 --> 02:48:58,600
So now it's time to make a choose here.

4067
02:48:58,600 --> 02:48:59,600
No HP drops.

4068
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:00,600
Big age.

4069
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:01,600
PGS more common.

4070
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:03,600
Get curse weapon chests.

4071
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:05,600
Get the cursed one.

4072
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:07,600
Because that's the best.

4073
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:08,600
A lot more curse chests.

4074
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:09,600
Yeah.

4075
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:10,600
Okay, fine.

4076
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,600
Why?

4077
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,600
Because curse chests are like good.

4078
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:15,600
There's like not a big downside of them.

4079
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:16,600
Like not being able to drop them.

4080
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:18,600
Like if it's a good weapon, why would you want to drop it?

4081
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:21,600
Dude, the Otto Crospo is the new stage of life.

4082
02:49:22,600 --> 02:49:23,600
I know.

4083
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,600
It's so good.

4084
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:25,600
Do you know what?

4085
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:26,600
Do you know what?

4086
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:27,600
Do you know what?

4087
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,600
If you pick last wish while you have a curse weapon.

4088
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4089
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:31,600
It's nice.

4090
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:37,600
Because you see, the only problem with Crospo is that they don't have a rapid fire, but

4091
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:39,600
then the Otto Crospo negates that problem.

4092
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:40,600
Oh my gosh.

4093
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:41,600
There's a heavy Otto Crospo.

4094
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:46,600
Well, but then it introduces the new problem that you run out of ammo for.

4095
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:49,600
Well, all you have to do is just not hit the button that often.

4096
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:52,600
Not a...

4097
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:57,600
Are you saying that even three-year-olds can serve their ammo in nuclear thrones?

4098
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:58,600
That big dog.

4099
02:49:58,600 --> 02:49:59,600
Oh boy.

4100
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:00,600
Oh man.

4101
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:02,600
How long have you been alive?

4102
02:50:02,600 --> 02:50:04,600
Like two months?

4103
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,600
Roughly.

4104
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:12,600
That's, you know, that's within two orders of magnitude of the correct answer.

4105
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,600
So yeah.

4106
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:14,600
Right.

4107
02:50:14,600 --> 02:50:16,600
Now the Otto Crospo and Trigger Fingers.

4108
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:19,600
This is going to be intense.

4109
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:21,600
I'm playing fish right now.

4110
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:22,600
Which do I want, Munchie?

4111
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:25,600
Do I want the regular Crospo or the Splinter Pistol?

4112
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,600
Splinter Pistol.

4113
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:34,600
Thanks to my Otto Crospo, I faced right down against the crystal that was aiming its bullet at me.

4114
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:35,600
I didn't flinch.

4115
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:36,600
I didn't try to run away.

4116
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:38,600
I just kept firing my Crospo at it.

4117
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:41,600
I love when, like, you're scared of an enemy, but then you get a good weapon.

4118
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:46,600
You can just mow them down and you just feel like you're like a Samarian god of life-taker

4119
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:47,600
aware.

4120
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:48,600
Oh.

4121
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:49,600
Life-taker aware.

4122
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:50,600
God.

4123
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:52,600
Except I'm now only HP.

4124
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:54,600
So I better, I'm being careful again.

4125
02:50:54,600 --> 02:50:55,600
Okay.

4126
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:58,600
What were you saying, Ben?

4127
02:50:58,600 --> 02:51:01,600
I was trying to think of a, I was trying to think of a joke.

4128
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:02,600
It's hard though.

4129
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:03,600
I'm not smart.

4130
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,600
We all know that Ben isn't funny.

4131
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:10,600
So we just invited him and this podcast just to make him feel better about himself.

4132
02:51:10,600 --> 02:51:19,600
I was going to say, like, for example, oh man, I took a, like, I had, I had real severe

4133
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,600
diarrhea earlier today.

4134
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:28,600
I felt like a, I felt like a total Sumerian god of taking a shit.

4135
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:30,600
That's what you sound like.

4136
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:32,600
Also, I have a cursed jackhammer.

4137
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:34,600
So what the heck is up with cursed weapons?

4138
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:36,600
What do cursed weapons do?

4139
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:38,600
You can't drop them.

4140
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,600
You just can't drop them.

4141
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,600
You can still switch them.

4142
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:42,600
Yeah, yeah.

4143
02:51:42,600 --> 02:51:45,600
If you find another cursed weapon that you like more, you can switch out cursed weapons.

4144
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,600
Oh, that's cool.

4145
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:50,600
I'm going to pass.

4146
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:51,600
I'm going to stay.

4147
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:52,600
I'm going to stay.

4148
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:53,600
Yeah.

4149
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:54,600
Really?

4150
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:55,600
You get a thing called cursed ammo.

4151
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:56,600
What the frick?

4152
02:51:56,600 --> 02:51:57,600
Oh my gosh.

4153
02:51:57,600 --> 02:51:58,600
Whoa.

4154
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:05,600
I got to 5-1 and it's a mostly open environment with like half the enemies of the level all

4155
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:06,600
right there.

4156
02:52:06,600 --> 02:52:07,600
Yeah.

4157
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:08,600
I have paused.

4158
02:52:08,600 --> 02:52:09,600
That's what I'm talking about.

4159
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,600
I have paused.

4160
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:13,600
I need to take this in for a moment.

4161
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,600
That's what I was saying before, like a huge flock of crows just like flew down at me all

4162
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:18,600
at once.

4163
02:52:18,600 --> 02:52:19,600
It's the worst.

4164
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:20,600
That's crazy.

4165
02:52:20,600 --> 02:52:22,600
It's like most of the enemies.

4166
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:24,600
Grab a triple machine gun.

4167
02:52:24,600 --> 02:52:27,600
Big robot guys that slide around.

4168
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,600
It's like seven of them.

4169
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:33,600
In my immediate vision, the moment I spawn, I'm still paused.

4170
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:34,600
I need to take this in.

4171
02:52:34,600 --> 02:52:36,600
I'm going to go refill my water.

4172
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:38,600
Maybe I'll go to the bathroom.

4173
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:39,600
Well, anyway.

4174
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:40,600
Yeah, whatever.

4175
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:42,600
Cursed ammo, it explodes if you don't get it in time.

4176
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,600
Don't get it in time, but it gives you more ammo per drop.

4177
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:46,600
All right.

4178
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:47,600
See you for a minute.

4179
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:54,600
Oh, you mean the item on the ground explodes?

4180
02:52:54,600 --> 02:52:55,600
Interesting.

4181
02:52:55,600 --> 02:53:00,600
Well, yeah, I have not found a single cursed weapon.

4182
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:01,600
Maybe that's normal.

4183
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:04,600
Well, you need a crown in order to...

4184
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:05,600
Oh, wait.

4185
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:06,600
You only get them with the crown?

4186
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:09,600
I don't like it either, but whatever.

4187
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:10,600
I'm not the maker of the game.

4188
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:15,600
My name's not J.W.

4189
02:53:15,600 --> 02:53:16,600
J.W. Bush.

4190
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:18,600
Yeah, George Bush made nuclear throne.

4191
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:22,600
He made it as his foreman.

4192
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:24,600
George Weedman, creator of nuclear...

4193
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:28,600
Edward Snowden, creator of nuclear throne.

4194
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:29,600
Edward...

4195
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:30,600
John...

4196
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:32,600
John Edward Snow.

4197
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:35,600
We could do this all day, folks.

4198
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:37,600
Oh, and we will.

4199
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:41,600
We've already gone for like three hours.

4200
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:42,600
Holy shit.

4201
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:43,600
All right.

4202
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:44,600
This is the run.

4203
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:45,600
Okay.

4204
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:46,600
I'm going to hold you to that.

4205
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:47,600
Oh, shit, my nigga.

4206
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:48,600
Because I've got gamma guts.

4207
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:53,600
And I'm just running over maggots right now, and it feels...

4208
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:56,600
It's filling me with determination.

4209
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:59,600
Oh, that wasn't the last enemy?

4210
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:00,600
Okay.

4211
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:02,600
Oh, and this time, you know where I'm going?

4212
02:54:02,600 --> 02:54:04,600
I'm going to...

4213
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:08,600
I'm going to gosh dang...

4214
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:10,600
I'm going to...

4215
02:54:10,600 --> 02:54:11,600
I mean, young Venus.

4216
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:12,600
Okay.

4217
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:13,600
The car.

4218
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:14,600
I'm going to the car.

4219
02:54:14,600 --> 02:54:15,600
Yeah.

4220
02:54:15,600 --> 02:54:17,600
You said that the car spawns on 5 or...

4221
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:18,600
3-1.

4222
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:19,600
Yeah, 3-1.

4223
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:20,600
3-1?

4224
02:54:20,600 --> 02:54:21,600
3-1?

4225
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:22,600
Okay.

4226
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:26,600
Have you ever picked up a golden weapon before?

4227
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:28,600
Yeah, I...

4228
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:29,600
Wait, no.

4229
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:30,600
No.

4230
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:32,600
I just had YV's gold pistol.

4231
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:39,600
Well, gold weapons, if you take it to an enemy portal and you start a new level with it after you pick it up,

4232
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:46,600
then it will store and it will always be selected right from the start of a run with that character forever.

4233
02:54:46,600 --> 02:54:48,600
If you just take it to the next level.

4234
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:50,600
If you just beat a level with it, yeah.

4235
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:51,600
Nice.

4236
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,600
With it in your inventory, yeah.

4237
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:55,600
Okay, well, I guess I should try to do that then.

4238
02:54:55,600 --> 02:55:00,600
Well, I mean, the tier 1 gold weapons, which are in the mansion, aren't super good,

4239
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:05,600
but there are ones that are on loop that are really good.

4240
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:07,600
But I still think it would be nice.

4241
02:55:07,600 --> 02:55:13,600
Right now, I have a slugger for eyes and it's really nice.

4242
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:14,600
Shit.

4243
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:15,600
I missed that.

4244
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:16,600
Alright.

4245
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:17,600
I'm back.

4246
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:18,600
Good.

4247
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:19,600
Alright.

4248
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:20,600
That's good.

4249
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:21,600
I need to create a battle plan.

4250
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:26,600
I'm gonna switch to my autocrossbow and then run to the right and start firing like crazy.

4251
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:27,600
Whoops, I did not...

4252
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:28,600
That's good.

4253
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:32,600
Now I'm running and now I'm shooting my autocrossbow and now I'm dying and I got my health back

4254
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:35,600
so now I'm not dying anymore and now I'm dying again.

4255
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:38,600
So now I am dying and then I got some health back and so now I'm alive again and now I'm

4256
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:40,600
not dying and now I'm out of bullets and now...

4257
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:43,600
I was not speeding that up in my commentary.

4258
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,600
That's how fast all that just happened.

4259
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:47,600
Okay, now I got some more health and now I'm well...

4260
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:48,600
Now I have half health and...

4261
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:49,600
Okay.

4262
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:50,600
Wow.

4263
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:53,600
I kind of wish I'd been filming that because that was the most incredible thing that's ever

4264
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:56,600
happened in my life and now I'm down to one health.

4265
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:57,600
And I still...

4266
02:55:57,600 --> 02:55:58,600
You're making it?

4267
02:55:58,600 --> 02:55:59,600
No place for cover really.

4268
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:01,600
Oh, freaking health health health health health health health health health health health health.

4269
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:03,600
Oh, I got some health, alright.

4270
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:04,600
Oh, my gosh.

4271
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:05,600
Oh, man.

4272
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:06,600
That was...

4273
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:07,600
Oh, now I got some more health.

4274
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:08,600
Aw, yeah.

4275
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:09,600
Aw, freaking...

4276
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:10,600
Now I got more health.

4277
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:12,600
Now I have almost full health and oh, my gosh.

4278
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:13,600
That was...

4279
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:14,600
Oh, man.

4280
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:18,600
I was so engrossed with your story that I actually believed that I was at one health.

4281
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:22,600
Do you want to remake The Christmas Carol with me?

4282
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:25,600
Because...

4283
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:27,600
I

4284
02:56:27,720 --> 02:56:33,700
You know that those kinds of those kind of decisions you need we need to think about them carefully

4285
02:56:34,080 --> 02:56:36,080
Before we take that kind of step in our relationship

4286
02:56:36,320 --> 02:56:40,760
Your gift of gab in your story made me think you're just a such a great

4287
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:47,040
Remake the Christmas carol for a modern audience. What a great story. Oh, I'm dying. I'm alive now. I'm dying

4288
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:50,560
That's the magic

4289
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:54,160
Okay, I don't know what the hell this guy wants. I don't even care

4290
02:56:54,360 --> 02:56:57,520
That's the match. That's really that's my chicken right there

4291
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:01,400
Is that I became alive and in dead in the live again multiple times only?

4292
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:05,320
Talking

4293
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:10,160
Munchie, I just shamed myself. Do you know how I died? I

4294
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,560
Tried to eat. I tried. I tried to use gamma. Oh

4295
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:16,280
Man

4296
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:22,360
Yep. Oh well. Yep. It was good. I did it and it worked. What do you know? I wish one game

4297
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:27,840
It's the one that it's when enemies touch you they kill you and snipers are the ones that when they die

4298
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:30,800
Yeah, I had to die up a handful of times before on

4299
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:34,400
That's the other thing I like about them. I like about

4300
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:40,320
These kinds of games this you know down well this kind of this sort of new bird age of

4301
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,200
I

4302
02:57:42,200 --> 02:57:48,200
Roguelikes is that my favorite way to learn how to do anything is to fail five times first

4303
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:51,800
But the problem is that you know fail a bunch of times is really frustrating

4304
02:57:51,800 --> 02:57:54,680
So in a roguelike where failing is like, yeah, I get a fresh start

4305
02:57:54,680 --> 02:58:00,640
So failing feels like cool. So I get to learn exclusively through failure, you know, like I don't

4306
02:58:01,360 --> 02:58:04,160
It is all about learning. I mean all games are kind of like that

4307
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:08,880
But most games try to make you not fail the first time because it's frustrating to die

4308
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:14,980
but in roguelikes you can really roll with the punches and so I died to the

4309
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:22,560
Sniper bots like five times before I finally drilled it into my head to not be close to them when I killed them and that entire

4310
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:26,800
Process felt totally satisfying. It didn't feel like oh when the heck am I gonna get the hang of this?

4311
02:58:27,280 --> 02:58:32,600
So yeah, that's something because yeah, I like I really like what the heck I went into the purple portal

4312
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:35,880
But it but I went through the green portal. What the heck happened? Yeah

4313
02:58:35,880 --> 02:58:39,920
Well, you can't open the green portal because of Lambert will think oh well

4314
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:46,800
He obviously wanted to go inside the crowd but he just couldn't do that. Oh rusty revolver. What does the rusty revolver do?

4315
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:48,640
Oh

4316
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:54,120
Okay, let me explain that entire chest right there that chest if you put a gun inside that chest

4317
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:58,040
Then in an entirely different run with a different character

4318
02:58:58,040 --> 02:59:01,240
You can go to that chest and the same weapon will be in there

4319
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:05,480
So that's it's permanently in there even if I turn off the game and stuff. Yes

4320
02:59:05,880 --> 02:59:10,720
That is a cool, but freaking tool brood pub the blue thing but unfortunately

4321
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:15,080
I love my autocross bow a bit too much. Whoops. Oh, okay. I'm fighting these green guys

4322
02:59:15,080 --> 02:59:19,040
Oh fighting these green guys from the lab. All right fighting green guys thankfully my

4323
02:59:19,680 --> 02:59:24,280
Yeah, big glowing guys. Yeah, wait, whoa, whoa, where are you?

4324
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:29,360
I was I was in a crown room. Yeah crown ball, right? Oh

4325
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:34,640
All right, which crown should I get now?

4326
02:59:35,880 --> 02:59:37,880
More drops when it full HP

4327
02:59:39,120 --> 02:59:41,120
Ultra I

4328
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:44,480
Mean level 10

4329
02:59:44,480 --> 02:59:49,120
Level 10 what the heck is level 10? Oh, I'm at level 7 and I'm halfway through

4330
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:54,560
Don't get destiny if you're close to ultra you most of the time want to do destiny

4331
02:59:54,560 --> 02:59:57,560
He's you can just fit like squeeze an extra mutation in there

4332
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:03,680
But since you're not pickups fade fast are worth they

4333
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,240
Pickups fade fast are worth more. Well, see most pickups. I do get pretty quickly

4334
03:00:08,960 --> 03:00:12,080
Remutation narrow future a lot more cursed things no ammo

4335
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:15,960
You know what? I'm gonna go with nothing because I want to keep things predictable because you know

4336
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:19,280
Yeah, I'll start shaking it up after I've beaten the game. How about that?

4337
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:24,880
Yeah, the crowns. I don't really know what they were. Oh, I forgot. I'm fighting a little hunter

4338
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:32,680
Good luck. Godspeed. Yeah, the crowns don't the crowns don't seem very good. Yeah, they really are

4339
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:36,800
Didn't kill a little hunter. Dang it. I

4340
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:41,400
Died to the hunter. There was even a health pack up there, but I knew that the amount of time

4341
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:44,600
I would take to get oh, man, I might die by the time I get there

4342
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:51,160
That's a that's like a special property that the the snow area has which I guess is probably present in later areas

4343
03:00:51,160 --> 03:00:56,560
But the snow area has a tendency to drop health packs way into the middle of danger

4344
03:00:57,640 --> 03:01:00,160
So you have to start really counting for your temptation

4345
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:05,280
Well, yeah, because because everything because everything's blowing up in the middle of these giant crowds

4346
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:11,880
So that's where people are done. I'm glad. You know what Deville? I'm glad we both managed to kill little hunter

4347
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:14,080
in this

4348
03:01:14,080 --> 03:01:16,760
Thing any but I think I mean are you guys tired?

4349
03:01:18,560 --> 03:01:23,640
Almost four in the morning. I can't do this without you. Well, I I don't know, but I'm not tired for one

4350
03:01:23,640 --> 03:01:25,640
I can yeah, I could go forever

4351
03:01:26,240 --> 03:01:29,040
All right, okay. Yeah, but I

4352
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:36,600

4356
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:57,320
Nuclear throne is a game about shooting things and I did I like it a lot you should go buy it. It's a

4357
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:00,320
$100

4358
03:02:01,720 --> 03:02:06,800
Mm-hmm. Oh, but I don't think we mentioned Monchie that you gave me a copy. I did you

4359
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:14,640
I'm gonna be probably giving Nate one too because I'm getting the physical copy and I won't have a use for another copy of the game

4360
03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:16,640
So I might

4361
03:02:17,320 --> 03:02:19,320
