1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
My friends ask me why I cry.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's cause I feel like I wanna die. These tears spring from my eyes. Every since you said goodbye.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, I'm gonna cry like a man. Cry like a man. As hard as I can. Yes, I can. And if you had a heart, then maybe you'd start to understand. Oh, I know you understand.

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All the cool shit on the internet. I'm the best guy ever and I'm joined by my basket of deplorables as always. Ben Saint. That's me, every buddy. Digibro. We're gonna put some pro crass right up yo ass. And Hippocrit.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And so, as everyone famously knows now, we are doing a new thing where we're getting suggestions for topics off of Twitter. So everybody can go to, yeah, it's famous. You tweeted it like five minutes ago.

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, that's not what I'm saying. Like, we, I, last episode, or before last, because we decided to do Pokemon on our own. But before that, we're doing a thing where we're just questions, topics people ask us on our Twitter is what we're just gonna talk about on the show that they've asked just throughout the week. So anytime, go to Twitter and tweet at tpcrestinators.

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But by the time you're hearing this, it will be too late.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, for next week. No, this understanding that the concept, this podcast, the crying podcast was suggested on Twitter. Who suggested this name?

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, yeah, the right, right. So this was suggested by Palm Top Vulture, or at Pop Vulture. And their suggestion was, as a suggestion for a podcast topic, how about art and moments in media that make you cry? So thank you, Pop Vulture.

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think we're going to expand that a little bit to...

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That made us cry, or that made us cry.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That make, apparently.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The tense there is important for me.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So they asked make. They asked make you cry. So still to this day.

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't think there's anything that will make me cry consistently. And if there is, then I don't know how to test it.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Like, I'd have to watch something every single year and update my, did this make me cry, ometer, which is not something...

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I know some people who do that. I know some people who are like, I watch it every month and I cry every time.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I don't usually watch something more than once every few years.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's what's funny, because I am probably the biggest media cry baby that I know. I cry all the time when I'm watching stuff.

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Like, whenever I watch, whenever I just hear, Sorairo Days come on the radio, or not on the radio, but on my fucking MP3 player, whatever, I cry.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My friend Ghostly, I know he's cried many times just hearing that song.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wait, I do it to all kinds of animals.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Which one's Sorairo Days?

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, specifically, it calls to mind.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, the girl, when you say the girl in login theme, did you ask?

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, everyone, yeah.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, but the thing is, what makes me cry listening to songs like that is the emotions that evoke.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So whenever I listen to that song, that song is the insert song, which every time they do the theme song of a show during the Big Climax finale, it's always a 10 out of 10 best thing ever they do.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I cry every time I hear Ro Ro fight the power, and I think of that picture of the bird sitting on the sign that says no birds.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, that is a good one.

31
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's good to me.

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So when I hear that song, because that song plays in its entirety throughout the climax, I just in my mind play the movie of how it starts up with the da da da da da da da da da da da.

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's when someone's like, no, not yet!

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and then Lord Genome is like, she-bon!

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,720
And then the whole like the whole sequence plays up to the ultimate victory over the antispirals

36
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
So it just calls that whole greatest scene ever to my mind and that's true of just like every I kind of want to

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,320
I mean, I don't like tears don't form in my eyes

38
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,360
But there's lots of like things that I like get really emotional about and I'm like, oh, yeah

39
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,200
Yeah, it's the coolest thing ever but tears don't come. I'm wondering like

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't well. Yeah, I don't actually cry a lot personally. I'm gonna try to be very rigid with this

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm only going to select things where I have shed

42
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,800
At least one actual tear not just teared up not just welling like eyes full of tears

43
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,680
No, something has to fall down my cheek because I have a less sensation of the tear rolling down

44
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
I never get tears

45
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
There's maybe two

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,440
Times where I can remember that happening of the top of my head two times. Well, yeah, like a

47
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,880
For a podcast right welling up as far as I go

48
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,640
Emotion I felt tears rolling down my face just watching shelter the other day and I've kind of cooled off on it

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,280
But at the time at its peak but the reason I ask about the tear thing is that I think just some people make tears more than others

50
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,160
Yeah, yeah, and you get to an emotional level where you would be crying if you made as much tears as someone

51
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,880
Even I can be like I can be like sobbing and tears aren't actually rolling down my face. That's interesting

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,320
Yeah, I think if I think if it's sobbing it counts

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800
I think we're gonna classify this as

54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,240
It was not something that lasted like a half a second

55
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,400
You know just like I have lots of things that will make me tear up for like half a second when it's right at the emotional

56
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,720
Climax like right at that moment, but then you know the second it's over it all just

57
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,240
Drives right back out. You know the problem, you know, it's not there anymore. The problem with you guys is that

58
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm I'm a golden god and you guys all your tear ducts are clogged with all that fat all that fat

59
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,320
Fill it up that shit. They can't squeeze them through. That's your problem. It hit the treadmill my friends

60
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,480
You got it. You got to be a vegan like that guy in Scott Pilgrim. Yeah

61
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,640
Yeah, you know, you know how most people only use 10% of their brains because the other 90% is all full of curds and way

62
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,880
Yeah, that's true

63
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,040
So, yeah, it seems pretty clear that people have different like degrees of their crying capacity

64
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,760
It's it's it's it's something that I've got like

65
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,840
Rolled eyes are like people like oh, you don't cry because I don't often but it's like I don't literally

66
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,400
Tear up but I do get emotional about things and people always say, uh

67
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,400
You're just you're just pretending to be tough. You fucking loser. I don't like that. It's like I want to say

68
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,080
For the record, I also don't don't cry much

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,440
Which is why

70
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,000
Like I'm being so strict about it because there's such a small tiny pool of times

71
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,200
I have shed actual tears that I literally have a list. I have a list of every individual tear

72
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,960
I've shed while consuming media. So Jesus Christ. Well, that's interesting. I'm gonna go through it in the course of this podcast

73
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,680
I could I could list too many to name. So, uh, I really am a big cryer

74
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,880
I cry a lot when I when I do all kinds of media stuff

75
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
So there's no point in going through my I could bring up one that

76
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,360
A lot of you might also agree with which is the ending of Toy Story 3

77
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,760
Oh, yeah, well, which part specifically because there's any part and then there's the

78
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,760
It was it's the bit cry at the ending of Toy Story 3. It's the bit near the end

79
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Uh, where Andy's giving the toys away and he's like, oh, yeah, that's the one I'm 17

80
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,680
But I still sort of care about these for some reason but I'm giving them to a little girl

81
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm saying goodbye forever and it's like I don't know everyone gets their little moments when when he's just like this is ham

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
He's like the evil baron

83
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Oh my god, I want your dark souls

84
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,880
Ravenpure

85
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
It's a lone dinosaur

86
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,960
I hope you're recording this jesse because this is gold and the people are gonna want to hear it

87
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,560
Well, I'm glad you're here jesse. We were just talking about how we wanted you. Well, we what's the topic this week?

88
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,080
Jen's crying. It's media that's made you cry, which I know you have basically everything

89
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,400
Let me tell you people about crying, you know old uncle endless has been doing a lot of that lately

90
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,640
And uh, you know, but by lately, I mean the last 27 years

91
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,440
I've cried a thousand tears and I'll cry a thousand more

92
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:08,360
I have yeah, I have both on video and in person witnessed jesse literally crying while describing something

93
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,680
Uh, I know it happens in the batman versus superman video when he reads um reads that passage from that batman comic

94
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,960
And I believe you shed an actual tear that glistened in the light of your of your uh basement that glistened in the light of my yellow room

95
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
an actual

96
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
He stained tear

97
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Rolling down my jaundice cheek

98
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,400
And I could hear that you were crying in the the the second panel cast and you described the spider-man

99
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,480
scene yeah, I I cried I cried twice in that panel cast and I cut one of them out because it was it was too much

100
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,600
Jesse and me I think are birds of a feather when it comes to crying. Uh, we you seem more predisposed to to this kind of uh

101
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Gay activity as opposed to you guys

102
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,640
You know, I have it's the most straight thing in the world

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,000
I agree over time. I have I mean as a kid

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,920
I always didn't want to cry and that's still sort of true like I every time tears come. It's like it's unnatural

105
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,000
It's unusual. I don't I'm not used to this and I try and stuff it back even though I'm alone

106
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,600
That's true. I feel that I feel I feel like kind of weirdly self-conscious about it when it when it happens

107
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,880
I'm like, is this right? Is this right? Yeah, I know what you mean

108
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,640
Uh, I feel I want I feel that about not crying

109
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,080
Like I have so many times where I'm witnessing something emotional

110
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,920
And I'm starting to get there, but I don't cry and then I worry that I'm just such a jaded like

111
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Like that that I've I'm so broken that I can't even cry at anything

112
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
And I have I have a real legitimate jealousy of jesse's

113
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,640
Like whenever I see jesse feeling something so strongly and like why can't I feel anything that strongly? Why can't I feel?

114
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, I so know it's a it's a gift and it's a curse buddy. Let me tell you

115
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Yeah, it's my burden. I'm sure I wouldn't want it if I was on the other end when it would that pendulum swings in the other

116
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,120
Direction, I think I you know I I might be like the most emotional person I've ever met in my life

117
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,280
And it's a it's a terrible terrible thing

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,640
You know, that's funny. I actually kind of feel guilty. I also second guess myself like ben

119
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,680
When it's like is this right? But the thing is I'm usually already crying by that point and I'm just kind of like

120
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, am I

121
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,480
Do do I because that's the thing I feel like I cry too easily and I worry that it's uh, it's cheapening it

122
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,480
Even though it doesn't matter to anyone except me, but I kind of value my own cries

123
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,320
I don't want to pass them out like fucking candy. You know, I wanted to be important and yeah

124
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,520
I guess when when you you you talk about something you like and you said, oh, yeah, it was so good

125
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,760
It made me cry. That's like a like a an indicator of how emotional and how good it is

126
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,120
And if you cry it's something that you're like, oh, I guess I don't really care about it

127
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,120
But I cried so a man's tears are like a woman's vagina

128
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,640
They need to only be shared with the public on very rare occasions

129
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Or else you're trash

130
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,840
That's right. That's right. That's real quick before we even continue any further. Let's do a sink test with jesse

131
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
On the count of three say cry

132
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,920
one two three cry cry

133
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Okay, that's good enough. Okay

134
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,600
Um, just had to make sure before that I don't I don't want us to get to the end that we don't remember at the end

135
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
That's right

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,200
So all right. Well, we've talked a lot about our like philosophies of crying to media

137
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,920
We need more actual examples. We know Nate cries every time he hears the opening theme of girl in the gond

138
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,200
I do every time. Oh also the one where um, you know, like there's what there's one in the middle of the episode where

139
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,560
Simone becomes a man when uh, when he finally, you know, sacks episode 11 that one too

140
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,920
When we're nears behind him when he's for a recent example, that's right. Um, she bought up

141
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
But uh, but uh, shut up

142
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
All right. All right for a recent example

143
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,520
Um

144
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,840
The the show that we watched for a plebe in the weed planetaria got me pretty close once or twice there

145
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Yeah, I remember I kept looking over it

146
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,560
Emotional narratives. I kept looking over seeing Ben and Jesse almost made us cry. It was the fucking closest that hadn't a while

147
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,640
Okay. All right. All right. Honestly, it looked like Ben was crying

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,320
I don't know if there was any tears

149
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,760
But I kept looking over at Ben and Jesse who were losing their shit and that's why

150
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,120
For for anyone there were there were some tears welling up and my lip was quivering. You know, that's okay

151
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,000
for anyone who doesn't know why we ended the plebe in the weed that way because it was

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,360
Because it was such an emotional episode and we had just been watching baby cakes diary number two

153
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,840
Which is the episode where uh, you know, baby cakes and his dad and his granddad

154
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
They all just like break down crying

155
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,080
After this like this huge like it's just this crazy emotional turn the episode takes where they all start singing and crying

156
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,320
And they just destroy everything in the house and burn it down

157
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,400
And we all thought it was like the most emotionally poignant expression ever

158
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,080
So after watching this this show we were all like standing around talking about how feelsy it was we were like, oh my god

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,480
The emotions. Uh, we can't take it. I was like, what if we just unleash and we just like break everything in the set

160
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,200
Just like a baby cakes and it would be the perfect expression of how emotional this show made us feel

161
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,400
Um, though it it ended up being portrayed more that we were all mad about me, uh, not giving the show

162
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,600
It's true. Yeah, it didn't it didn't quite have that baby cakes pathos

163
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,240
Uh, but I mean what does no nothing true true

164
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,080
I so okay. Let's hear some more. Oh, sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, get there

165
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
There uh

166
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Well, uh, the the only other one I can think of off the top of my head. There's probably more. Um, is the ending of okami

167
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I don't know if any of you've played that

168
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Not at the ending of okami, but I don't I'm interested in your reason remember the ending very well

169
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,280
The ending was like you go through the whole world

170
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,000
The whole of japan and then you save the world

171
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,640
But then okami has to to leave forever and he never and she never gets to come back and you mean amaturasu

172
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, well, I think okami's a pretty cool guy

173
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,560
That's you know, what I just I think okami literally means great god, which is what she is so technically that's appropriate

174
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,000
okay

175
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,040
And then you soon has to go and and spread the tale of of everything that happened to everyone alone

176
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
And I'll tell you I'll tell you what was oh, I'm sorry

177
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,200
I didn't mean to interrupt but what I what I did really love about that part

178
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,520
The best part to me was when you're fighting

179
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,240
I forget the name of the big bad, but you're fighting the big bad in that heaven ship and uh, you have to

180
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,800
This is a moment that might have brought some tears years ago

181
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,000
And I just don't remember but it's when over over the course of the game

182
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,120
You've helped everyone in japan in all these various ways and at the end

183
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,920
It is their prayers to you the god that give you the power you need to finally defeat it

184
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:42,520
No come and become god mode amaturasu now that was a great emotion powerful moment of that bending and then the credits song as well

185
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,160
The the thank you reset or whatever it's called

186
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,120
That's just got all the the cool parts

187
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,760
It's a great game, man. It's a really good song. I cry to that occasionally

188
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
almost cry

189
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Uh jesse you had you were about to say one it sounded like what oh, yeah

190
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,160
um

191
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
You know, I don't know there's there's a lot of like

192
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,680
Like I could name like a million movies and stuff and like things that video games that make me cry

193
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
But what really always

194
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,440
Just just really opens up a hole inside me

195
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,880
Just like just rips me open and destroys me all the time

196
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,280
Is just when I think about my friends not you guys my actual friends

197
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,320
The ones right of course the ones that when I hang out with you guys

198
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,000
I feel guilty about not being around them and I resent you guys a little bit for even being a part of my life

199
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
You know we're enablers. Yeah

200
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
um

201
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, so like uh, where we where are you going with that just I just I just I just really wanted to confess how much I hate

202
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
all of you okay

203
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,760
I hate to say it nobody gives a shit because this is about media that makes me cry

204
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,560
Nobody cares about this is our media and it's gonna make everyone in the world cry when they hear it

205
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,600
Because I'm connecting with my audience like I always do because I'm the best guy at that

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,840
Damn you. You know

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,560
Fucking you what the fuck? I hate him. So sure. Okay. All right. That's fair. This is a media this show

208
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,240
Makes sense to me. No, it's terrible. Oh, yeah, every time I listen to the procrastinators podcast. I well up a little inside

209
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,320
It's a bummer now, it's you know, I really

210
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,200
I really have a lot of sentiment inside me for the people close to me and it really

211
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,000
It really makes me a a wreck if I if I if I dwell on it too much

212
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,120
Like uh, you know, like uh, like I'll have some friend

213
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,280
Or you know and she's like going through a breakup or anything and she's like all crying

214
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,520
And and I'm just like trying to help her and I'm just like trying to tell her how much that she means to me

215
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
But then just saying that is making me cry

216
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,160
So now I'm crying harder than her and it's like who the hell is supposed to be cheering up who at this point

217
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,720
And so then I'm the weirdo and so then I've got a fucking everyone's judging me

218
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,880
So then I go to a party and I I'm the fucking guy at the party crying

219
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,560
Nobody wants to be the the crying guy at the party

220
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,960
Nobody wants to be sitting there crying into another man's birthday cake

221
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,680
And everyone's yeah, no no no one no one came there looking for a reenactment of the day of the clown cried, but they got it

222
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:25,400
You know, uh, that's really that's interesting jesse, uh, you seem like a very empathetic person, uh, and it's it it amuses me

223
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Or this is

224
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Well, it does it does

225
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,360
That's actually kind of the thing because like I've been thinking lately how you know how I'm all about like I'm I'm a

226
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,320
I'm a futurist and I want I want humanity to succeed and go to the stars and I want all these things to happen

227
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,000
You fucking yeah

228
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm in the middle of an emotional breakdown at a party and I'm crying. I'm I'm losing my mind and it's like oh, I'm using

229
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
That amuses me

230
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,120
All right, it does because I was just thinking about how

231
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,640
Uh, I want all these things for humanity and I interests would have been a better word than amusing

232
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,560
Yeah, okay, it just interests me. It it makes me think of something else that relates to me, which is cool

233
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,880
Uh, which is just how I I don't give a shit about people on an individual level basically at all

234
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,080
Uh, like I'll see people and I'll just I'll hate them. I'll just hate them for no reason

235
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:22,200
We're like I I want the best for humanity, but I hate everyone. I want everyone dead. Nate. Let me let me let me respond to that

236
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,160
I I feel the same way a lot of the time, you know

237
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,760
I feel all misanthropic and like oh, I hate people and I hate everyone

238
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,280
And you know, I get frustrated at people a lot, but I always

239
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
Like every single fucking time when when I actually

240
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,360
Come to know someone I always think better of them than I did that is true

241
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Like saw them and got my you know initial impression was like oh this person's just this this person's just that this person

242
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,240
Must suck and these are that ways and then I'm like I'm always I always change my mind

243
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
So I try I try to keep it in mind

244
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,640
I try to tell myself like don't judge that person

245
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,080
You know, you would like the more if you got to know them you always do

246
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,680
But like it's it's it's you know, it's my natural inclination is to be like oh fuck that guy

247
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,880
But that's a very mature point there ben. I try to find a point

248
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,480
You know, it's funny because much like with the like what we said about crying earlier where I said I kind of like

249
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,560
Feel broken because I can't cry as much as I want to

250
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,880
I feel similarly

251
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,360
About like other people where like I I kind of always assume that everyone's great

252
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,880
Like I assume everyone I see I'm like that guy's probably doing something interesting or has something going on in his life

253
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
More than what I have

254
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
You would think that

255
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,840
But then I but then I have no ability to connect with any of those people and I don't feel like

256
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,280
Pressured to do so and like even like what jesse talking about his friends who he's like, you know

257
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,960
I miss them and wish I connected with them more like I've kind of

258
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,000
Completely don't even talk to any of my friends anymore like ever since ben and divu moved in

259
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
I've gotten to the like I mean

260
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,640
I was already pretty alienated from my friends because the fact that they all have different interests and we don't do any

261
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,560
The same stuff and I'm not the type to go out of my way to put myself

262
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,640
In a situation where I'd hang out with them and now that I've got ben and divu

263
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,320
I just don't even talk to him anymore

264
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,120
Like I haven't even seen half of my friends in three months

265
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Plus to be fair like we haven't seen each other in days because I haven't left my room

266
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,640
Ben has been straight up in his room for like three days now for like poke a lot

267
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,600
I've been sick. I haven't had any desire to leave my room lately

268
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,800
I have I saw divu once and I saw you for like a second when you'd ask me if I left water boiling

269
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,360
Which I didn't because I'm responsible. Thank god. You've got the cure to power of the vape to nurse you back to hell

270
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,960
The vape is what fucking caused this problem. I'm convinced. I'm convinced it dehydrated my throat and caused this whole

271
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Nonsense, I don't know possibly

272
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,360
Well, I still see victor and divu so

273
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,800
You know as long as I see like one person a day even if it's only for five minutes

274
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,360
I feel like I've got a ton of social interaction for that day

275
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,360
Something happened in between me making 300 videos

276
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Every single fucking day of my life

277
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,560
But we have gotten

278
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,400
Completely off the topic of crying in media. This is now just a piece of media for people to cry to as jesse

279
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Expected this to be just a sort of a general emotional discourse

280
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,800
I mean because I don't think the guy really cares that much about like when the tear physically comes down you cheek

281
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
it's about it's about

282
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Oh, it's like that future drama episode where you know when when that

283
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,720
Fuck the the asian girl. She's gonna marry that little green alien man. Yeah, the kiff right

284
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,240
It's it's not about the fact that he touches lila and it was lila's dna that became his his little babies

285
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,280
It's it's about the person who evokes that feeling that causes him to be able to reproduce

286
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,000
Which just happens to manifest in the first person incidentally

287
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,920
You know what I mean who all has cried watching future drama. There's so many times. Probably absolutely

288
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,480
The dog man

289
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,040
Yeah, yeah, he waited. He waited. He always waited. He didn't forget

290
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,560
I because I mean it's been in fucking ages since I saw any of those episodes for the first time the dog one's emotional

291
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
The one about his brother

292
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,680
Everyone mentions the dog one I'd forgotten about yancy fucking yancy yancy's a really emotional one and then the one where

293
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,200
At the end we see how lila's parents took care of her for her whole life and it plays baby love child

294
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,640
By pizzicato five the one where a obscure japanese pop band the one with fries mom where he

295
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Um went into her dream at the end

296
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh, yeah, I remember that I don't think I saw that that wasn't I remember I either I watched a bunch

297
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,240
Yeah, that was that was a new one too. Yeah, I was one of the new wish

298
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,920
It was okay. No, I didn't see it. I also really love the the very last episode

299
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,480
Which just has of lila and fry just spend their life together and then at the end

300
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,360
There I don't know

301
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,680
There's something really emotional about like you want to give it one more round and then they just like start

302
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,240
Like time loops and it's just something beautiful about how like these two of this connection

303
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,240
Good never even even now. It's just it's just really getting to me. How much these two guys have come to care about each other

304
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,160
That's that's beautiful. This podcast doesn't end until one of us makes someone else cry by way of remembering a scene

305
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,640
It's not gonna happen for me. I'm distracted. I'm distracted training for the pokemon race

306
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,400
Yeah, ben. Did you have any uh any particular examples of something that has made you at least even well?

307
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,760
You said planetarium. I said planetarium. I have another one. I have another one

308
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,120
And maybe you guys can help me

309
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,720
This is there's a movie that like I cried more watching it than I might have ever cried in my life

310
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,080
And I don't remember what it was called eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. No, I haven't seen it. That was a good one

311
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,040
Everyone tells me how much they cry at them. It's like a romance

312
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,880
Sort of between this like gothy teen girl and this like schlubby middle-aged man

313
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Hmm and it's it's got a name its name is like it's not harold and maud, but it's got a name

314
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,920
That's like oh that sounds familiar two names

315
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,920
Uh lowlita

316
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,960
No

317
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,400
She's like a fucking goth or something and he's a beetle. I don't know I

318
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
People in the comments comment on this shit

319
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,560
It's a it's a sad romance between like a teen goth chick and this like and this like fucking middle manager

320
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Ty wearing that looking yeah, you're definitely talking about harold and maud. No, that's that's definitely beetle juice

321
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,760
Wait, it does sound like beetle. I know there is a harold and maud, but I don't think that's it

322
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,600
Oh, yeah, I don't think that's it either well looking at it. You have to do some research and uh, I don't know people in the comments say something

323
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Now harold and maud is like a dark comedy

324
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,600
Hey ben here's a here's a moment uh that I believe we both cried at the same time

325
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,880
Uh, this is a deeply emotionally moving uh situation so ben and I when we were very young

326
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,080
We're playing mario rpg and we got to the very last boss. This is not exactly what people are asking

327
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
This is what they want so

328
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,240
Wait, you told the story. You've told the story on the show before

329
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
I remember

330
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,320
Who I don't care who cares did you go on Nate? All right, so tell the people what they want to know

331
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
I will I'm sure somebody wants to know now

332
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,440
So we're fighting the very last boss smithy and at this point we're we're babies. We are not veterans

333
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,440
This was like one of our first rpgs. I use I used malo. He has an ability that shows you how much hp the boss has

334
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,520
He had like psychopath. He had like no hp

335
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,160
He would have died in one hit if I had one attack that turn

336
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,880
One died and then the guy fucking summon boulders or whatever like twice in a row and just wipe the whole party

337
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,200
And we've been trying to be we flipped our shit

338
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,600
We've been trying to be the boss for so long. We've been playing mario rpg for like old man

339
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,120
We fucking cried and went ballistic that that 26 hp. He had left is burned into my mind

340
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm never gonna forget. It might it might have been 46, but it was one of those our dad got really upset because the game made us

341
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,440
Cry he thought he wasn't out of the game for doing that to us. Yeah, I remember this video

342
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,480
Why did you tell the story before maybe it was about parents reacting to video games negatively?

343
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,200
You definitely told it before though. I might I might not have been there for that, but whatever

344
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,480
How could you not have been there? You told the story. It was you. I thought you were saying ben to told it

345
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
No, you told this story before

346
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,360
Well, whatever they heard it twice. Okay, let's move on. That was a joke. Anyway, I didn't want to dwell on it

347
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,840
Uh, has everyone gone except did you now give did you do one already?

348
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,400
Uh, yeah, I went I I couldn't really think of I can't really think of any

349
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,600
Specific times. There's probably lots of times as a kid like playing fire emblem where a character died after like 40 hours

350
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,600
playing a single level

351
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,720
Yeah, you know to try and grind through that's fair. Oh, you know what? Uh, sorry

352
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,680
May here's just one short one. I've probably told the story before but when I was

353
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,760
Reading one piece on the day that uh ace died luffy's brother died

354
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,880
I was supposed to go on a date with my girlfriend and a bunch of our friends

355
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,680
We're all gonna go out and do shit in the snow and um

356
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,400
My ex gonna go out and shit in the snow

357
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
But but like she comes into my room

358
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,880
I I didn't I didn't shed a tear but I was just sitting in my room

359
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,240
Ace was dead luffy was never going to be the same

360
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,240
He was a broken man and in walks like my girlfriend and she's like, all right, Nate

361
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,520
Let's go. Let's go fun in the snow and I'm just like what the fuck

362
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,800
My friend my friend just died and he wanted me to go play in the fucking snow and she did not understand

363
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,040
What was going on? She did I explained it look luffy my my my buddy luffy his brother just died

364
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,440
I can't fucking go on a date right now

365
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,240
And uh, she just was like she was so mad at me for so long after that. She did not get it

366
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,040
That's why I hate you lauren the worst person i've ever known. I hate you. I'll never forgive you for what you did to me

367
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Oh god cut this please

368
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
How could you do it um

369
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,640
There you go. Um speaking of tragedy. Um, I don't know if this counts. I don't know

370
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,240
I think I might have teared up a little bit when fucking goose died

371
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,960
Oh, really but not his lovely roulette. Yeah, my well. He was a yeah when when monkey killed my my fucking uh

372
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,400
Flight commander flight or no flight lieutenant goose. Look, it's not that it wasn't actually sad

373
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,720
I think I was I was much more angry than I was

374
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,800
That's okay. I think I might have just just just had like fucking tears of tears of like just frustration and like hating myself for having for having

375
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,760
You know, that's that's fine. That's like a father's I went through the stages of grief like so hard

376
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,080
I was like no, it's he's not really gonna gonna gonna kill goose and then I was like, okay

377
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,520
But like it's not it's not it's not really that bad, you know like and then like oh, but but

378
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Yeah, it's and there's just mad just probably did some bargaining like maybe I don't have to nuzzle like this

379
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,560
Particular pokemon. Maybe I can just let this one live bargaining. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but you know, that's

380
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
I I want to ask uh

381
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Angry tears angry tears

382
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,000
We're all very much thinking like, you know consume piece of media cry

383
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,160
Uh, have any of you had times because I've had a few of these where it was more that you watched something

384
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,000
And then like what it made you think about eventually made you have a total fucking breakdown

385
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,680
Like, um, well, you know, yes, and even I'll give an example to kick us off just so I can just so I can finally

386
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,040
Share one, um, this is I did not cry watching this show

387
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,400
But an example for me was when I was uh, like in when I was going into 11th grade

388
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,720
And I watched the show manavi straight, which is an anime series about a bunch of high schoolers who basically the main character is this girl manavi who like

389
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,040
Um becomes a student council president and she's trying to have like a great student

390
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,520
Festival on like the last you know the last year that she's going to be in high school

391
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,000
And this high school is kind of shutting down because it's in a future where high school is like not really a thing anymore

392
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,840
And everyone just doesn't take it seriously

393
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,720
And she tries to have the most fun high school ever and then the last episode is like all the characters are graduating

394
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,680
And they're all talking about what they're going to do in the future

395
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,960
And you know, like most of them have plans except manavi and she's like i'm just going to become a freeder

396
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,640
Which just means like go around and get random part-time jobs and just do whatever

397
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,880
And everyone's like what how can you how is that possible because you could do anything

398
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,240
You're such a great leader you did all this stuff over the course of the show and she's like, you know

399
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,840
I could be happy doing anything

400
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,160
So i'm just going to go do whatever I want and like I was about to start

401
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,280
Uh like taking all these advanced classes in school

402
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,560
And I was trying to like fast-track myself to do like some kind of successful

403
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Collegiate career, you know like thinking oh, I really got to succeed in school

404
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,480
If I ever want to make anything of myself and then I see manavi like just yeah, I can be happy doing whatever

405
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm going to be a freeder and I was like

406
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:44,120
And I had just a total mental fucking breakdown that night and like just cried all night long and couldn't like just trying to figure out

407
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,320
What I was going to do with my future incidentally 11th grade miserable

408
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Everyone's heard about it probably on the depression podcaster on my let's play show very bad year

409
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,440
But yeah, manavi incited a total breakdown. That's that's really interesting to me because I uh when I was in high school

410
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,400
I

411
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,960
So it was sort of in a similar way. I didn't really know what I wanted to do

412
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,160
But I insisted my ego demanded that I take

413
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,040
Even even the valedictorian didn't do this, but I took every single ap class that was offered and like it's fucking psychotic

414
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,480
It was really dumb

415
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,960
But I passed them all but I got like b's and c's for the most part because I I didn't actually care about them

416
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,120
Nor did I care about what they would do for me

417
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,840
I was only interested in like proving to everyone how smart I was and in the end

418
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,440
Like I got worse grades than most people or you know like the higher level people

419
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,560
So it was it entirely shot myself on the foot for no reason

420
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,880
And it wasn't even you know to accomplish anything other than satisfying my own ego

421
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,840
So yeah, it was just a big waste of time to do shit like that

422
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,680
And living living your life like her and like she just wants to be happy

423
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,840
You know, you you don't need all this extra bullshit. This is kind of tying into the whole school thing

424
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,640
You don't need these don't listen to procrastinators school sucks. I was gonna say go listen to uh fucking uh the college dropout

425
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,400
And uh and shit

426
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,240
Um my degrees are gonna keep me warm

427
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,400
My dad gave me all his degrees and I wear them on my clothing and I feel so good about them

428
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,560
And I'm gonna get more degrees so I can get more degrees and it's just gonna make the happiest part of the world

429
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,520
It's cool. Go watch the school one. Does anybody have examples of shit that made them break down crying?

430
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,760
I have a lot of examples man. Let me tell you people about the probably

431
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
like the thing

432
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,720
That has like the the highest the piece of media that has the highest ratio

433
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,320
Of moments that utterly destroy me and and turn me into like a balling sobbing mess. It's the rocky series

434
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Oh, just that fucking

435
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,720
Oh my god, that fucking whole series is so emotional and that score the music if I hear like one note of like the music from those movies

436
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Not the ones that everybody not not not like the

437
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,520
Yeah, not bad, but I mean like there's this there's this piece of music that plays in rocky every time something sad happens

438
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,640
And every time I fucking even think of it if I just like try to picture the notes in my head

439
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,400
I'll start crying at notes. There's so many parts the whole fucking saga because it's it's the greatest

440
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,280
It's the greatest saga in the history of fiction. It tells

441
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,760
It's the it's just like a guy's entire life story

442
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,000
It's it's just like 30 40 years in a dude's life. He like he starts out

443
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,200
He's 30 in the first movie and in the most recent movie creed

444
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,880
He's like 70 and you're just and you're just seeing this guy get older

445
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,560
And all of his like triumphs and his trials and tribulations everything he gains and everything he loses

446
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:33,080
And it's like the most real human saga that was ever put to film in the history of mankind

447
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,080
That that's fucking you know the the the first movie when he's when he's you know, he's all pissed off

448
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,800
You know because uh mickey is grilling him about what a bum he's become and how he's never amounted anything

449
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
And he's just getting pissed off and he's like

450
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
And he's like punching the wall and yeah, I feel it

451
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,520
I feel it's so hard that frustration of not accomplishing what you want to accomplish in your life of looking at yourself

452
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,280
And hating yourself and being a bum especially especially because mickey was the one who would kind of ignored him up to that point

453
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,920
And only now is mickey into it. Yeah, like does that scene where he's like hey mickey? Why are you always pushing me?

454
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,840
Yo, why are you always, you know, you know, why are you always yelling at me and mickey's like, you know

455
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:20,200
Why I hate you rock because you had something you could have been somebody but you didn't you ended up breaking thumbs for some

456
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,680
two-bit mob boss and and rocky's like

457
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
The whole movie is just

458
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
And i'm watching it going

459
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,480
Me too man

460
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,800
And he's fucking and then there's that part in rocky 3

461
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,920
Where mickey dies and mickey's you know, it's after he fucking he he because because rocky wasn't listening to mickey

462
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,720
He had to fight clubber lang and mickey kept telling him rock. This guy's gonna

463
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,520
Clapper you he's gonna kick your ass unless you take it seriously

464
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,880
And and rocky was getting all full of himself because he was a champion and he was like

465
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
You know, I'll just I'll just you know training this high tech gym

466
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,200
I'll take a I'll take a selfie with these fans and you know, I don't really give you

467
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Then he goes and he goes

468
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,440
And and like right before the fight, you know clubber lang like pushes mickey

469
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,800
And then they have the fight and clubber lang just kicks the shit out of rocky

470
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,880
He beats the shit out of him and rocky loses the fight and it's this humbling experience

471
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,080
And and he realized you know, you know, I should have listened to mic mic was right

472
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
But then he finds out that mix like in the in the locker room having a heart attack and dying

473
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,920
And he runs the mic and and mic's dying and he's sitting there and he's crying

474
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,960
You can't even understand what the fuck he's saying because he's fucking sylvester stalone

475
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,960
He has too many emotions sylvester stalone has the same thing that I have

476
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,240
He has too many emotions and he's got a half paralyzed face

477
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,120
And it's this perfect concoction that makes him the greatest actor of all time and it makes him, you know

478
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,760
Like something about sylvester stalone has the ability to convey emotion on a level on on a grand scale

479
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,360
Beyond what any other person in the history of mankind is capable of and it connects with me

480
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,240
And I feel I have a I have a spirit bond with sylvester stalone and when I see him sad

481
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
I get sad and I feel everything he's feeling

482
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
And and and mix and mix like

483
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,000
Oh, did you do it rock? Did you win the fight? Did you win the fight? And he goes? Yeah

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
We well, he's lying to mic

485
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,440
He's telling him he won the fight and then mic dies and it's the saddest fucking thing ever and then in rocky 4

486
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,880
When apollo creed dies, he gets killed by avan drago and and you know and rocky, you know, he has he's he's gonna throw in the towel

487
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,080
He's gonna throw in the towel for for apollo and apollo looks at rocky

488
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:35,000
You know apollo his old enemy who's become his friend through the years because they've they've had so many battles with each other

489
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,040
That they're like they're the original goku and vegeta

490
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,960
It's it's apollo and rocky and you know, they're friends now and and he's watching this fight

491
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,120
He's watching apollo creed get his ass kicked by this fucking russian superman super villain

492
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,280
Ivan drago

493
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,560
He's got the towel and he's like I gotta throw in the towel apollo and apollo's wife is there and and his wife is like

494
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,760
Come on rocky throw in the towel. What the fuck and apollo looks at rocky. Don't you throw in that towel, man?

495
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,520
Don't you do it, man? He's got too much pride. He's got that warrior pride

496
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,600
He won't let rocky throw in the towel and then apollo goes down and he dies

497
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,920
fucking Ivan drago just

498
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,800
Punches him to death and he dies in the rig and and and rocky finally throws in the towel

499
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,880
But it's too late apollo's dead and then he has then he goes to apollo's funeral and he's like

500
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,600
You know, uh, apollo always did things this way

501
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,280
And then

502
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,920
And then you get to rocky five and it's like the worst movie ever rocky five. It's it's a piece of shit

503
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Nobody likes it. It's

504
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,440
It's the bad one. He's there's this guy called timey gun, but even in the bad one

505
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,800
There's great scenes that make you cry. There's that fucking part, you know, because rocky can't fight anymore

506
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,360
He's got brain damage from all the punching he's he's had if he gets punched anymore

507
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,560
He'll die

508
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,080
So he can't he can't box anymore, but he's trying to relive his glory

509
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,000
He's trying to train this up-and-comer timey gun and timey gun is a huge dick

510
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,280
And he's taken advantage of rocky's kindness and he's going off with this other promoter and he's just being an idiot

511
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,480
And and everyone knows it and everyone can see up at rocky

512
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,640
But rocky doesn't want to see it because it's all he has left

513
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,600
It's all he has left

514
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,160
He just has to to train this guy and so he can live vicariously through timey gun success

515
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,640
So he's fucking trying to fight him and adrian's yelling at him. She's going god damn it rocky

516
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,720
Don't you see you're fucking he's taking advantage of you and rocky's like

517
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
What do you think i'm stupid? I know

518
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,880
And then there's just the fucking there's that part where where rocky has that flashback

519
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,080
He's he's got a flashback to like where he was younger training with mick and mick

520
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,080
He gives him this uh this uh little crucifix. No, not a crucifix. It's golden gloves

521
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,440
It's silver gloves from like some boxing thing. He's like, I don't even remember what the fuck it is

522
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,280
But he's like, you know, you know, rocky machiano gave me this back in the day and now i'm giving it to you rock

523
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,800
And and and and and and so and so rocky's remembering mick his his his dead mentor mick and in this flashback

524
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,440
mick is giving him this speech like uh, you know

525
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Yeah, you know rocko

526
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,880
Uh, sometimes when you get older

527
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,560
Yeah, I think nature is smarter than us rock

528
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,160
I think we get older and everyone around us that we love

529
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,400
They all die rocky and and you look around and you ain't got no one left and you says to yourself

530
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Who what am I still doing here rock?

531
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,120
And and and then so I want you to have this I want you to have this

532
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,840
And when you look at it, I want you to hear my voice

533
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,040
And it's gonna be saying get up you son of a bitch

534
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,360
Because mickey loves you and then at the end of the movie where he has to street fight with tommy gun

535
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,800
Tommy gun is beating him up because he's got brain damage. You can't fight anymore

536
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,600
He's getting headaches and like migraines in the middle of his fucking fight

537
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,560
And tommy gun he tommy gun beats up pauli. He beats up everyone and but so so so rocky's down

538
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,600
And but then he has that flashback and he remembers the voice of his old mentor mick get up

539
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,000
You son of a bitch because mickey loves you and he just somebody punches the guy

540
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:12,840
He punches him with his fucking feet and fists. He punches him with his feet. He doesn't care. He's out of control

541
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,440
He's a street fight. There's no rules in a street fight. You can punch with your feet

542
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,200
And then you get to rocky six rocky valboa where he's old as fuck and he can't even fight anymore

543
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,200
And the boxing commission won't even let him box anymore because he's a fucking dinosaur. He's a thousand years old

544
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:35,240
Yeah, and he has to go before like the tribunal of boxing the old wise men who control the boxing industry

545
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,720
And he's got his like pletus case. He's like, hey, you know, you don't you guys ever have something that you always wanted to do

546
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,760
That you didn't want to do and you feel that you see your last chance to do it and they're like, oh god damn it

547
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,640
Rocky, you've moved us to tears. We're gonna let you fight even though you're even though you're a fucking ancient wizard

548
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,400
And your bones are as brittle as fucking as as cookies

549
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
of Santa Claus cookies and

550
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Merry Christmas everyone

551
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,720
It is a merry christmas. It is a merry christmas. He fought Ivan Drago on christmas day

552
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
That's right

553
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,600
Does he fight Ivan Drago on christmas day to save us all from sin?

554
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Oh

555
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,120
God

556
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:28,360
And the last movie adrian's dead and and you fucking you know, he talks to he talks to poly there's that scene

557
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,400
It's not even in the movie. It's a deleted scene and even the deleted scenes are an emotional fucking

558
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,440
Maelstrom where he's talking to poly and poly's talking about adrian. He's like, oh rock

559
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,720
Oh, oh, you treated a good rock. I treated a bad. I don't want to remember and then he's oh fucking rocky

560
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,880
And then there's the fucking the new movie where he's he gets replaced by a black and that's the saddest part of all

561
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,360
Now you have to watch a bunch of movies with some black guy and rocky's probably gonna be dead in the next one

562
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,160
Rocky gets cancer in creed. He gets cancer and and he has to fight cancer

563
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
You know, he's fought Ivan Drago

564
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,080
He's battled Apollo creed

565
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,560
But now he has to battle his strongest boxing opponent of all cancer and he and it's a beautiful saga

566
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,120
And that's my favorite and not even just rocky also Rambo the Rambo series

567
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,840
Sylvester Stallone is a fucking machine for emotion. He's an emotional fucking

568
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,000
It's not good enough for him to make one to make the bed

569
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,200
Just the one most emotional fucking journey of all time

570
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,280
He had he had to make Rambo at the same time all the Rambo movies are amazing

571
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,400
The first fucking Rambo movie at the end were like he he breaks down and he's talking about, you know

572
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,600
How how sad he is and all he's got this PTSD and then the second movie where he meets

573
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,200
He meets co and and he falls in love and she teaches him that he's not expendable

574
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,600
But then at the end of the movie, you know, he he says

575
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,200
Coming for you because he found out the government used him they used him again

576
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,280
They don't care about the soldiers. They just use you up and they throw you away. They is and then in the third movie

577
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,240
The third movie is not very good, but then in the fourth Rambo movie

578
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,320
The fourth Rambo movie is he finally goes home to his family at the end

579
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:15,960
It is also another thing and speak enough how the government they don't care about the soldiers the metalgear solid the fucking

580
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
Oh my god

581
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,440
You are my best friend have no fear

582
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,560
I am your godsend if I had to choose between

583
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Merrill and metalgear

584
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,760
Merrill would lose three cheers for metalgear

585
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,400
But it's my duty to kick some real booty beat down the baddies

586
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,960
That's what I that's what I sing to myself. I scream sing that to myself to ward off the tears so they don't over take me

587
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,440
Whenever I have an emotion I start thinking about the metalgear song, but it reminds me of metalgear. It makes me cry even harder

588
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
So it's a worthless song

589
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,840
Sensible strategy. Oh my god the fucking part in metalgear solid

590
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,200
Where sniper wolf dies and she's talking about that's like oh man. That's a beautiful thing

591
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,720
You we're dogs of war, but you you're a wolf. Oh, you're a wolf

592
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh my god, I love your handkerchief. It smells so good when when liquid snake is is killing gray fox

593
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,600
And he's like in the middle east without hunt foxes

594
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,920
We hunt jackals and gray fox is like i've carried foxes more dangerous than a jackal you got sucker

595
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,920
And he shoots at him and then he dies and then he gives that speech and he's like snake

596
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,040
We're not tools of the government or anyone else

597
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,640
You gotta fucking get up and you gotta get a boner and you gotta fuck the world by your own standard

598
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,080
How how beautiful was it that that snake took that message to heart and started philanthropy with

599
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,600
To fight against the evil corporations trying to fucking

600
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,920
Kill us with machines. Yeah, man. Remember when remember when Tommy Wiseau shot himself at the end of the room

601
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:18,440
That was fucking point poignant. Now it's so it's so sad you have to laugh. It's too sad for tears

602
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
He's true

603
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,960
Ah god

604
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:30,040
My favorite parts for the shit. Is he dead? Is he dead? He's got a fucking bullet in his brain. You dumb bitch. What do you think?

605
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,320
Remember when that remember in the party scene when that guy shows up and just starts

606
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,080
Chastising the girlfriend and the lover as though he's been there all along even though no one's ever seen him before

607
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,880
I think that he's the doctor recast inexplicably, but I just love it so much

608
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,920
It's I don't want him to be the same guy. I wanted to be a new man

609
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,360
I think he's just a stranger that showed up to fucking moralize at these people

610
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,360
I think he just goes from party to party looking for people to preach at the room is the greatest piece of

611
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, man, never considered you men. Just gonna totally mess up our circle of friends. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who are you?

612
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,120
Have we met sir?

613
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:17,240
That's the perfect line for that character. Holy shit our circle of friends, you know, you know our well-established circle of friends that we have

614
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Oh my god

615
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,480
Well, I'll tell you what's it. What's a tear jerker another one. Yeah, since you mentioned the doctor

616
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,040
Man, good old doctor who every fucking every season of doctor who like every four episodes

617
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,080
There's there's got to be one that just that just wrecks everybody

618
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,240
It's the doctor is such a great man. He's such an emotional hero. Oh shit

619
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,160
I remember that there's another time. I cried. It was it was when rose got trapped in the the alternate dimensions

620
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,520
Yeah

621
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,520
That music playing that was that was really big. Oh man. Yeah, it was I thought it was a choice to go. Hey now

622
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,800
You're an all-star get your game on go, but it works so well. It works. It really works

623
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Good Shrek cameo

624
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,080
You know to shift gears a little bit, um, wait, I just want to say, um, you know, our movie wasn't that sad

625
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Was that grave of the fireflies?

626
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,480
I agree

627
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,760
Because what I mean, it would have been sad except that it didn't make any sense. Why she died

628
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,800
She died because the dude had too much pride. He wouldn't go ask for food. He let his sister die

629
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,240
But like that's fucking sucks the the very day

630
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,680
No, like like he the kid had money, right? Like he had money in the bank and then

631
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,320
The girl starves like almost to death and then on the day that she dies

632
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,840
That's when he decides to go and maybe get some of the money that he has out and buy some food

633
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,600
Like what are you are you fucking kidding me? Food wasn't available. I don't I don't know

634
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,720
Okay, we get exactly this detail, but I don't well

635
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,920
I don't I don't even understand like like the day that she is too far gone

636
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,640
To that she will die from starvation

637
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,920
Why don't you steal food if you had money? I don't I don't get it

638
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,240
Like he stole food like that very day

639
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,840
He has money and buys her some food and she can't eat it because like for me the the thing about grave of the fireflies

640
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,880
I'll extend this to a lot of stuff like it that like

641
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,960
I feel like what is meant to make that movie sad is the realization that it's that it's like real

642
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,160
And this is all like real things that happen to real people and stuff like that

643
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,680
But I don't feel like as a movie and maybe this

644
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,640
This is something that's hard to say without feeling like I'm some kind of inhuman jackass or something

645
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,000
But it's like I already know that people are suffering everywhere

646
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,760
I kind of take it for granted that everyone that life is terrible and everyone's suffering forever at all times

647
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,480
and and children are dying and mass

648
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,760
uh

649
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,760
everywhere and so like

650
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:55,560
For if you want to actually make me feel something then the movie has to like actually have characters

651
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,880
I care about and grave of the fireflies. I don't connect with anything like the characters are all assholes

652
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Everyone in the movie is an asshole

653
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,440
The little sister is not an asshole. All right, and that's the one who dies. You're supposed to cry. She's she has she has no personality

654
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,520
She's just some kid. You know, it's like yes some kid died. I mean that is that true

655
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:22,920
Speaking of movies that totally tried and just completely failed to make me like connect to characters and like feel something about what was going on

656
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,920
song of the sea

657
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,480
Was like so I didn't see that yet. It's so

658
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,720
emotionally

659
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,400
I don't know like it it strives for this big fucking grand vision

660
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,920
And there's this big emotional scene at the end where all the girl or like the mom has to like take

661
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,840
Like she wants to take the daughter to like the spirit realm and all the spirits

662
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,280
All the spirits have awakened and they go back to the spirit realm and all the mom is in the spirit realm

663
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,600
And all the daughter's got to go to the spirit realm

664
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,920
But um, it sucks. It's fucking gay and it sucks. You know, that's interesting

665
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,560
Because the one they made before that's basically all I have to say the one they made before that the studio's the studio's previous movie

666
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:08,440
Secret of kels. Secret of kels. It's not it's not it doesn't it's not as tear jerky, but it's it's I don't know

667
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,880
It's just an infinitely better movie

668
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,440
I fucking hate song of the sea not because it's terrible just because it's so much worse than secret of kels

669
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,040
Secret of kels, I consider to have one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a movie

670
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,440
What the fuck are you talking about everything about that movie was

671
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,280
Do not let this devolve into an argument about secret kels

672
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,000
All I was gonna say I just I was gonna say was that I well whatever

673
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,040
I think the ending would like the book it wasn't satisfying to me. No the ending was great. Stop. Stop. Okay, but

674
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,680
I don't care what you wanted. What does that have to do with crying? Is it gonna? Yeah?

675
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,440
Okay, okay, it's just it's it's in secret of kels

676
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,640
Like I don't know the sequel apparently failed the corn event. I want to see it

677
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,200
But in the first one I think I think I actually might have cried a little bit at the ending of secret of kels

678
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,920
So there fuck you buddy. Okay. All right. Good for me

679
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,080
The what I what I did like about the end of secret of kels is the relationship between the boy and that silver-haired girl

680
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,320
Yeah, father aiden

681
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,120
Father no, no not him. Um, I'm talking about the girl in the woods and the kid Brandon or whatever

682
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,840
It's like aishley. It's like a weird spelling, but whatever spelled eisling, but it's pronounced Ashley

683
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,720
That's right. It's a weird Celtic thing. Anyway, uh, just their relationship and the way he like leaves and you don't know

684
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,680
What happened to her for like decades and then at the end he sees her years and years later briefly

685
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,240
And it just there's just like a there's like a sad lost friendship there that really got to me

686
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,640
That was the one emotional thing. I liked father aiden a lot

687
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,880
I liked father aiden more than I liked eisling

688
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,280
But whatever. Yeah, it's great. It's great. It's a great fucking movie and song of the sea

689
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,440
It's just it's just fucking empty in comparison

690
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I'm gonna try to go through these as fast as I possibly can

691
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,440
Okay, please go I'm gonna go through all the animes that made me cry

692
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,880
I have a list of the exact tiers of shed during each show so the first in a little jar

693
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,560
Uh, yes

694
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,280
No, I actually made I made a post about this back in 2009 and I'm looking at the post right now

695
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,080
So I could keep track of you know the older ones from back in the day

696
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,600
So all right the first tier I ever shed watching anime apparently according to this list is from the anime series canon

697
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,000
Which is this uh sad girls moe show where everyone fucking dies

698
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,440
The part that makes me cry is that the like the main character is staying with his cousin and her mom

699
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,720
And her mom gets hit by a car in like episode 22 and she's just like this cool side character

700
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,440
Who's just a super lovely mom who's awesome and she's the best mom ever and she gets hit by a fucking car

701
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,440
She doesn't die, but there's like a scene where her daughter is like all emotional over it and uh got one tear out of me

702
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Tier number two

703
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,560
Tier number two the ending of her reka seven

704
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,880
Holy shit. It's a good one. It's so fucking beautiful and in tier number five

705
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,920
Which we're skipping to because it was also from the last

706
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,760
No, the previous episode of reka seven the last two episodes have made me cry

707
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
But on different times watching the show

708
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,360
Um because the second or last episode is about the end of the relationship between anemone and dominic

709
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,720
And it's like anemone is this girl who's been this total bitch through the whole show

710
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,880
She's this evil cruel motherfucker, but this guy dominic's like in love with her and obsessed with her and she doesn't appreciate it at all

711
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,120
She's just this entitled brat through the whole show

712
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:17,880
But then in like the last arc like things stop going her way and like everything just fucking dog pals on her and all this

713
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:23,320
Bullshit happens but then dominic's there for her and she realizes that you know what he's been doing all this time

714
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,440
And she finally appreciates how his love for her and they have this fucking beautiful scene where they're falling through the air

715
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,920
And they've they've fucking embraced in mid air. It's beautiful made me cry then in the last episode when renton and reka finally, you know

716
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,840
Have their big payoff like they they I mean they are already kind of

717
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:49,240
The the whole last episode has this 10 minute song called niji which means rainbow by denki groove

718
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,080
That's what I was trying to say the whole last 10 minutes of the uh of the of the episode

719
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,720
That was an insane bit. That was so odd. That was like a speed racer ending. He fucking goes god mode

720
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,840
Save his bitch. It's a little rushed, but it is beautiful. Nonetheless. I'm sure he would describe it

721
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,040
As he needed to reclaim his property and he did it

722
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,800
um

723
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,880
Anyways tears numbers three and four were apparently shed during f a tale of memories

724
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,680
I don't remember what scene because it doesn't list here. What scene made me cry

725
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:24,040
So I I just know that happened during that show. What a shitty list this is. Yeah, and then it says uh

726
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:31,800
This the last entry on the list is tears number six seven eight nine ten nose run number one and choke up number one

727
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,280
All happened at once while watching uh, this is the last one on the list

728
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
All happened at once while watching clenad

729
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,040
Uh episode nine of clenad. Yes clenad the crab with testicles

730
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,000
An episode nine of clenad then there's this girl called fuko

731
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,440
She's like this little girl who turns out as a ghost holy shit the crab with testicles. I remember the crab with testicles

732
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,120
What happens to the crab did you

733
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,360
I have multiple times received like fan art of the what people imagine the clenad is like the crab

734
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,200
Um, so what happens to this crab ghost? Well, okay, it's not a crab. It's just a little girl. She's a ghost

735
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:34,520
The little girl like she she just like her sister is getting married and she just wants to be able to like see the wedding

736
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,760
Uh, and she'll be able to pass on to the next life

737
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,160
And so in episode nine there's like they do the whole wedding scene

738
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,760
It's just it's just so like the way they directed it and

739
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,800
Animated it and everything is just so fucking emotionally, you know manipulative that

740
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,680
It was a huge it made me cry like crazy even though I didn't care about the character or anything about the show

741
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,160
It's not even a good show. That sounds that sounds good

742
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:01,320
That sounds almost as good and similarly emotionally resonant as this uh this one hentai watch about a ghost who couldn't go

743
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,280
She couldn't pass on until she got fucked real good by one dude

744
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,080
And then she did and she she felt at peace. It was great

745
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,080
I bet I've seen that so to just follow up because that list was from 2009

746
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:17,160
I've had a few more times I cried another big one was another show from the same guy who wrote canon and uh in clenad

747
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,520
Which was angel beats the last episode of angel beats because

748
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,560
Oh my god

749
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,520
That one's so fucking emotional because the whole show takes place in purgatory

750
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:27,720
And it's like all these fucking kids who are like trying to

751
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,040
Figure out why they're there and like how to move on and then the last episode

752
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,760
It's like most of the whole cast has already moved on from purgatory

753
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,600
There's just like five characters left and they've basically resolved all their major issues

754
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:44,200
And they're just like having like one last like uh like goodbye. They literally stage a graduation

755
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,560
They all meet up in like the auditorium of the the purgatory that is high school

756
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,840
And they uh

757
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:54,760
They each of them one at a time gets up and like gives their graduation speech and it's all fucking emotional and they you know

758
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,200
They vanish after they give their speech

759
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,200
So it's like you're literally watching the characters one by one exit the show to go to heaven. Oh my god. It's so fucking emotional

760
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,800
um

761
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,040
That's that one definitely made me break down

762
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,160
Really fucking hard. Um, and then some more recent ones

763
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,520
uh

764
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:17,320
The most recent time that I cried apropos of nothing was watching kaon and thinking about hippocrite because

765
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,840
It was after we had I've probably told this story before but uh at least to you guys

766
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:31,720
It was after we had met up at brony con in 2014, I guess and it was like everyone got to go except for hippo

767
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:38,120
You know 2013 then no yeah 14 whatever in 2014 everyone met up. We all went to brony con except for hippo

768
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,760
and it was like

769
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,160
I realized because we had this we made up these little memes and stuff while we were at brony con

770
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,760
Which is still survived with us to this day like the lord of shit mountain little things that we were just giggling about like all night long

771
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,760
yeah, and uh

772
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,520
Double batman was the next year. I think that was the year hippo was there. So was it yeah

773
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Lord of shit mountain was the first year though

774
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,560
And like we just kept like all night staying up like saying whoo shit mountain and then we'd all giggle for like

775
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,040
10 fucking minutes because we're idiots

776
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Um, but we had all these memes and stuff and it really reminded me of the scene in kaon where they go on the school trip

777
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,560
And uh, they're all just like laying in bed at night and they keep going like

778
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,840
Like a peen and then they all laugh and then one of them's like should it go bad and they all laugh

779
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,960
And then it comes up later in the show and like during the most emotional moment in the show

780
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,840
In episode 20 when like the band has just done their last performance and they're about to like

781
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,200
You know this is the last time that they're ever going to do something major together again

782
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,160
and they all just break down crying at the realization and then

783
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:44,600
Like ritsu to try to cheer everyone up says like go peen and they all start laughing while crying and oh my god that scene

784
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
Absolutely makes me cry every single fucking time. I watch it. Um

785
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,920
As does the ending of season one now

786
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,320
Basically all of kaon makes me cry now because the more I think about it the more emotional I get about it

787
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,800
But that's the scene that that got to me out of nowhere was because you know, I made that connection between us cry on

788
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah

789
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,240
You know, I made that connection between us taking out

790
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:14,120
And in that scene but then I'm watching the show and I'm halfway through season one and azusa shows up

791
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,880
Who's you know, the the youngest fifth member who joins the crew later?

792
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,800
And I suddenly like upon seeing her I suddenly remember

793
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,200
That in that episode where they were on the school trip. She wasn't there because she's a grade lower

794
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,520
They all went to Kyoto and they had this great time

795
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,800
But meanwhile she was stuck back at home and she was just hanging out with her like underclassmen friends

796
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,560
And so she had this other sort of adventure that was going on with her friends

797
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,240
And she you know has her own little stories from that but it's obviously less interesting

798
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,040
um and hippo at the time had been at this like uh

799
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:51,000
Like this camp for retarded kids, I guess and he cleaned shit for retarded kids or something

800
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,520
And uh, and he had been doing that and like he had said, you know, it was it was a it was a good time on its own

801
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:01,800
But you know, it was not the same trip that the rest of us were on and like I remembered all of that when I saw

802
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,480
Azusa and I was like, oh my god

803
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,680
It's the same and then I just fucking lost it and I was crying like all day

804
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,400
I all I could think about and I was just like like babbling to myself. Oh my god hypocrites. I was in yon

805
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,640
It's so a chaos perfect

806
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,720
um

807
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,600
And it didn't help that I think the reason I was so emotional is that I was like hopped up on painkillers because this was after

808
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,720
I'd broken my foot

809
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,800
So I'm like laying I'm like laying in a chair watching k-on like half

810
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:31,080
Half asleep like just downing oxy cotton and crying my eyes out thinking about azusa

811
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,720
Uh, and then yeah, and then I cried at like every major episode from then on um

812
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,280
And then k-on became my favorite anime of all time officially

813
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,520
interesting

814
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,680
I have

815
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,880
I think I cried at the end of shiro bako too. I don't know if I shed a hole here, but the scene where

816
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,240
Oh, I hope you does anybody care if they get spoiled for shiro bako is anybody I do care

817
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:00,040
I don't want to be spoiled though. It's been a long time. So I wouldn't really see you nerd. I am working on it

818
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,960
I want to talk about it though. Do you can you cover your ears for like one minute while I freak out?

819
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,840
Yes, yes, I can I'm gonna take off my headphones. Okay, so at the end of shiro bako

820
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,880
Uh, like the whole show the five girls have all wanted to work on an anime together

821
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,560
Like that was their dream when they were in high school

822
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,680
They had an anime club

823
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,400
They all wanted to work together on this one show and then

824
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,240
They they've never gotten the chance because they've all gone to different jobs and they're they're all in different places in their career

825
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:34,120
Some of them are having a lot of success some aren't and the voice actress girl the whole show is just getting shit on

826
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,280
She never gets work the whole fucking show

827
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,720
She never has any success and in the second half of the show all four of the other girls get to work on this show together

828
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,360
In some capacity and like they have to have meet-ups with the other girl like they're all hanging out and they're all like

829
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,200
Oh, yeah, we're

830
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,840
Yeah, we're kind of on the show too and you know the voice actress girl's just like yeah, I I understand

831
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,360
You know it's it's hard out there for a voice actress and there's like beating down out of the whole show

832
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,080
But then they like the whole second half

833
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,400
They're like talking about rewriting the script for the show and then it turns out that they end up writing

834
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,760
Rewriting the last scene of the last episode where they're going to have them go to this like a

835
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,160
To meet one of the main characters in the show

836
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,720
They're making to meet one of her like her little sister

837
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,400
And so the voice actress girl ends up getting to voice the little sister and they all like find out

838
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,240
At once and like they bring her in and she gives us really emotional performance

839
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,120
And she's like crying because she got to be in the show with all her friends

840
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:31,080
No, I'm still going and then fucking Emma who's the animator she gets the anime

841
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,160
Emma gets to animate the scene that she was voice acting shut

842
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,000
Jesse got to go on for 15 fucking minutes about rocky. I can talk about sure

843
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,640
He used up all the fucking goodwill. He used up all the goodwill I have then you have had no contribution to this so far

844
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,560
So I'm going to talk about sure my contributions have been concise and pointed

845
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,800
They had nothing to do with crying and chose. I fucking seen shirobako. Okay. Yeah, it's a really emotional scene

846
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:03,240
It makes you fucking watch it may be cry when when Emma is animating the scene that she got to do then that was extremely

847
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,400
Emotional

848
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,000
It's a good ending. I didn't I didn't cry. All right. You're good. I wanted to say um

849
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,720
There's the the ending of lucky star was always quite emotional. That is a good one

850
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,640
It's uh, it was really just that that idea that

851
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,520
It's the end of school and

852
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,120
You know all the friends they've made and all the stuff they've done. That's it after that

853
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,600
Everyone's gonna go away and never speak to each other again. That's also a genius ending

854
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,360
It really it really makes me think I mean I think I cry most when it's like

855
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,480
An idea or a concept that I can closely relate to like a character dying

856
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,400
I've never seen somebody die in front of me. So that never really affects me that much

857
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,960
Like, uh, you know the lion king

858
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,480
I can't really relate to that because I'm not a lion and also

859
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,400
I

860
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,400
And I'm not african so I can't

861
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,360
Lions attack him. Yeah, I can't really that's true. No empathy

862
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,880
But um, I was thinking like if there was

863
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Something like one of my worst fears

864
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,200
Not one of one of my worst fears, but if there was like a character death

865
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,360
From the perspective of somebody who just didn't know because I've had nightmares

866
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,120
Or rather just like I've waken I've I've cried in my sleep

867
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,480
To to the idea of just coming home one day and then

868
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,160
Like my brothers or my parents just not coming home because they died

869
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,520
And I just didn't find out about it. And if if that was in like a tv show, I would cry probably there

870
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,400
But like things where it's like all dramatic and

871
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,480
There's music and there's like, oh no, he's dead, you know

872
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,720
Hippo you're bringing a tear to my eye

873
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,840
I just I can't I can't relate to things like that and I don't cry so much

874
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,200
So if it happened if it's happened to me or if it's something I fear

875
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,560
Then I would cry more go back to lucky star

876
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,800
That scene where they like reminisce about konata's dead mom

877
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,960
That's yeah, I was gonna say and the funny thing about that ending of k

878
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,920
Or of a lucky star that you described that like it's all of them graduating and like this sort of emotional thing is that

879
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:11,320
It always works and yet every single one of those shows has done it like lucky star has that

880
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,640
He didn't really sketch us elements of that azumanga dayo ends that way

881
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,600
K-On ends that way obviously. There's no other way

882
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,120
Like an end. It's it's not even that I had a good high school experience

883
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,560
It's just that I was starting to make one or two friends at the end of high school

884
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,560
And I was like, oh I have to start again

885
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,600
I'm not not so basically I'm saying like even though they all do it

886
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,960
It always works like every single one of those is an emotional ending

887
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,920
Even when the show wasn't like azumanga dayo has like a surprisingly emotional climax for a show

888
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,600
That was never emotional, you know, it's kind of hard to avoid being emotional when like it's the end of you and all your buddies

889
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,520
Like you reading it. They're like your friends, you know, tomo and the classic one

890
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,080
My friends in high school like any of the ones I kept talking to after high school

891
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,120
Like by that point we didn't see each other in school anymore

892
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,600
We only saw each other outside school because like most of them are people because in japan

893
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,920
They stay in one class typically

894
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,640
For like three, you know, you have a lot of the same people

895
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,120
Especially if you're in the same grade range, you know, and of course anime will you know skew it

896
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
So everyone ends up in the same class

897
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,360
Or they're all in the same club or something

898
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:20,120
But you know for me and my friends it was like by senior year

899
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,840
Nobody was in classes with me or half of them had dropped out. So, you know

900
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,160
Hey before we move on from lucky star

901
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,760
Let me just say how genius that ending is in that the the whole like

902
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,440
Performance that they're putting on is the opening that we've seen every episode. Yeah fucking genius. Love it

903
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,400
I just want to ask about the school system in america. I don't really know how it works

904
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,040
Do you have like a a class of people?

905
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,040
that

906
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,240
You stay with throughout the school time or is it just like

907
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,600
It's all just based on you you move between classes every in the uk

908
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:00,200
We have like two two groups or at least my school had two two groups where it would be a group of people

909
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,120
And we had a name and we stayed in that class

910
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,760
The whole way through but when we get into different subjects, we would be in different classes

911
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,080
Like if we chose german, we'd be all with all the it changes every year

912
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:19,240
You have a homeroom, but like you don't stay with them through the day. Yeah, it's just like where you go

913
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,240
I mean it's it's almost

914
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:25,080
It's almost completely because like I remember in in uh

915
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,240
I mean in elementary school, we were in one class the whole time in middle school

916
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,560
I remember the homeroom meaning something but like in high school for me

917
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,920
It was just homeroom was just whatever your first class was like there was no

918
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,200
We didn't go to a homeroom every day. It was totally pointless and they never understood why they even bother

919
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,240
Well, did you guys have an a and b did you guys have a a and b days like we had like a b

920
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,640
We had like a six day cycle. I think

921
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,640
Holy shit. How the fuck does that work? I mean, I I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, we did

922
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,880
I mean for my school it was you took four classes on one day and then four classes the next day

923
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,120
And they were all totally different. So you did not go to the same room at all two days in a row

924
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,800
So the thing that's that's different about uh, the uk is that

925
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,920
um

926
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:15,320
We have like middle school middle school and high school combined into one and then also a few years added on at the end

927
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,840
So if you were to go study like year seven and you would go through to year 12 or 13

928
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,720
You would be with that one homeroom or tutor group

929
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,520
for many years

930
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,640
It's nothing like that here. It feels kind of similar to the way Japanese things happen

931
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,560
Well, that's cool. Uh, but hey, I wanted to kind of bring things in a different direction

932
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,120
If are you done get would you anything else you're gonna say? Okay

933
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:43,640
I was just gonna ask about and this might be something interesting uh to talk about from a from a crying perspective

934
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,960
specifically since we're all content creators

935
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,520
I don't know about you guys, but I've on many occasions

936
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:55,000
Well, I guess not many but on several occasions stuff that I have been making has made me cry kind of on an intellectual level

937
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:00,280
As I just realized so well, it's maybe it's because like I'm so I have such a pension

938
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,480
Where I thought you were going with that is I thought you were gonna say

939
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,400
I've got lots of comments that have said they cried watching my videos. I was not

940
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
Care about them. I don't care about them. Yeah

941
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:15,480
Well, yeah, I mean the comments too people do say that I've not cried at my own videos

942
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,560
I never I have never

943
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,720
I mean I have gotten really emotional in various ways about my own stuff

944
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:27,880
I've not crying like usually crying is not a feeling that I like, I don't know

945
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,560
It doesn't just like spontaneously well up inside me. I guess like when I'm with the stuff that I'm working on is not

946
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,720
Like that. I don't know. I guess I was the closest is brunswick brunswick's kind of a tear jirker, you know

947
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah, but I didn't like cry making it, you know, right?

948
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:47,560
Sadness and was not the feeling in me as I was producing it even though it was

949
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,560
All malfunctioning people say I mean some of the best

950
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:56,360
Yeah, people say that brunswick makes them cry sometimes and that feels great. I love that

951
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,080
Um people when when people told me that they cried at the end of nuzlocke genocide

952
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,600
That was like one of the proudest moments. I felt I was so happy. No, it wasn't no, it wasn't the end

953
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,000
It was the second it was the penultimate episode

954
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,800
Yeah, yeah, because I mean I really tried to go all out and make it an emotional moment and people were like

955
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,360
You're fucking nuzlocke let's play series made me fucking cry, dude. I was like, yes

956
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,880
I did it. I did the impossible

957
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,760
I uh, I think

958
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,200
Go on Gib

959
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:32,360
I was just gonna say I don't know whether I would cry even if I deliberately tried to make something emotional like that

960
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,960
Yeah, like brunswick is sad and emotional, but like at no point in actually making it. Did I like oh did I like, you know

961
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,920
Yeah, well, you know like when I listen back to uh to to my gur and lug in part two

962
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,840
You know when I was making it even now like I I use I use tracks in there that evoke certain emotions in me

963
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:56,760
So like like baby universe, which is uh, what I use when I'm like describing the the two types of characters like the

964
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,760
Communists and the rosses or whatever

965
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,880
And then later on with the um like the the next song is uh

966
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:07,240
From bravely default. It's like the the finale song and like that's like the emotional client acts of the video

967
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,880
Like I use that song because it really gets me

968
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:15,000
So, you know, kind of just through through the fact that I I steal

969
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,520
I steal content from other people and use them in my videos

970
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,040
I kind of get to experience the same emotion as other people if I had made the song

971
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,920
Maybe I wouldn't feel that way, but you know, I the brave little toaster, you know, yeah

972
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,840
I think that when I think that it's hard like that. You're worthless

973
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,640
I mean, maybe some of the ideas

974
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,440
Behind and a work that you're doing might make you really emotional like

975
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,440
See that that's what I really want to get at with this making of the thing

976
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,080
I I don't think I would ever be in danger

977
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:53,240
Of that happening in danger never like the fucking no like I don't know just when when you're seeing the actual sausage making process

978
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:59,000
You know, just like like making a thing and experiencing a thing are just so fucking different from each other

979
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,800
I cry when I think about how long it took to make these things

980
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,320
When I think about how when I think about how far behind I am and how much I hate myself in my life

981
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah, I get really emotional about my own stuff in that sense

982
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,520
The one I thought would be most likely to have experienced this was jesse

983
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,280
So jesse, do you ever cry when you're making or watching your own work?

984
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
boy

985
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:27,560
Like that, uh, like the wrestle the wrestle boy, you know toast for the douchebags. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that one seemed like it might

986
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
I don't know about watching them

987
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,520
I don't know. I haven't been fucking

988
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:39,480
Oh, jesse hates his own work a little too much for that. I think no, no, I think it's a different sort of feeling

989
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,280
I'm uh, oh doing this podcast has opened something up inside me

990
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:53,640
I'm having trouble deem it out here. Do you feel a tear coming out of your eye? Oh and another one fallen from my other eye

991
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:59,320
Um, I'm sure you all know what the intro for this podcast is going to be

992
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,040
Yeah, yeah

993
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I don't know I've been

994
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,920
I can definitely write things that like while i'm writing them it's bringing

995
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,600
Like an emotion out of me that I hadn't confronted yet

996
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,840
And you know like while i'm putting it on the paper or the fucking board pad document or whatever it's like while i'm writing it

997
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,200
I'm crying

998
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:29,000
Or scribbled on the bathroom wall in my own feces, you know, however the writing process takes me, right?

999
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:34,040
Yeah, like I've yeah, I've been writing a thing recently that's been making me cry a lot the whole time

1000
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,720
I've just been oh cool. It's not for public consumption though. It's a private thing

1001
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,560
But I've been writing it through through like just a veil of tears

1002
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,960
I'm writing isn't that fanfiction about ray playing smash brothers because that's

1003
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,840
It's not a fan

1004
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:54,120
No, I've yet to finish that because I know it'll be too emotional. I'll have to kill myself

1005
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,120
Yeah

1006
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,680
You know, uh, I'm glad to see that uh, you're not a man who only appreciates osca like a lot of the osca fags out there

1007
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,560
You're you're too too to jump in on this question. You know who I also um

1008
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,400
I think a lot about misado and I think a lot about that one scene in particular

1009
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:19,880
Where she's just like coming to terms with the fact that kaji's probably dead and she's crying at the kitchen table

1010
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:25,960
And that little like just that like piece of animation of her like crumpling at the table is like so raw and real to me

1011
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,120
and like yeah

1012
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,120
I always think of it

1013
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,400
and

1014
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,160
I wrote a little song

1015
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,520
Just to that piece of animation because it's always in my head

1016
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And so one day I started just singing

1017
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:47,560
And what I ended up singing was the song desperado by the eagles. Yeah, but instead of desperado it was hey misado

1018
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,200
And oh

1019
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,720
And it stuck with me and this is like I've always thought about making this a video

1020
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,480
Because I I do this all the time where I'm like pacing around my room

1021
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,800
And I'll just start thinking about it and going

1022
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,960
Hey misado

1023
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,920
Why don't you come to your sense? And I'll just start crying like an idiot

1024
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:17,240
Wait a minute, that's such a great song the dark soul song. What no nigga fucking eagles

1025
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,120
And Orlando, why are you such a cocksucker?

1026
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,800
Talk to bottom mother fucker. It's not even

1027
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,760
It's not even like it makes me cry because i'm sad it makes me cry because it's so stupid and silly that I've like

1028
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,480
That I've ruined the scene in this show because whenever I see it from now on i'm gonna be thinking about the fucking eagles

1029
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,400
Wow

1030
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:47,160
I hate the fucking eagles. Oh god, you know stupid stuff's the coolest stuff

1031
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:52,760
It's odd because I'm I'm thinking like I'm racing through all my videos in my mind trying to think if there's any

1032
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,080
Like that I've made that would make me emotional

1033
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,000
But it's odd because I have I have some videos that people have told me make them cry

1034
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:04,120
And I have ones that are definitely more emotional like you're gonna carry that way the cowboy bebop video

1035
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,040
Um, you know people told me that made them cry or some of the more personal stuff the like

1036
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,920
S4 diary stuff from the pony days and shit like that

1037
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,880
Um and like but I don't know I feel like I go out of my way to undercut emotions in my videos

1038
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,520
Like where I I I tend to go more for like a numbness

1039
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,720
When I do get emotional and if you watch my philosophy is if I have to feel it then god damn it

1040
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,360
You're all gonna feel it to your sons of bitches

1041
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:37,320
Yeah, I don't know it's it's odd like I when I think of because nat I know you use music to make things emotional

1042
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:44,360
And you always have these this sort of overpowering feeling in your videos like hitting like here's all the emotion make

1043
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,360
And I feel like I'm taking people on a guided tour when I do this shit

1044
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,760
And it's rare for me to use music in my videos

1045
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,840
But when I do I almost always pick stuff that deliberately

1046
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:00,920
Won't feel that way almost except like and I'm thinking of the the migraine reviews and insomnia analysis

1047
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,280
And probably the most emotional thing I've ever done which was just copying jesse's usage of this song

1048
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Green bird from cowboy bebop and I used it at the end of my migraine review

1049
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,880
But like all the music used throughout that up until that point

1050
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:19,320
It's all like depressing songs but have this very like numbing jaded kind of depression and like

1051
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,880
That's sort of the way I always present

1052
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:27,080
Myself is like I don't usually try to say like oh, I'm very emotional right now

1053
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,760
It's more like I feel dead and I feel like I wish I could feel something

1054
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,520
I guess this is that's what this whole podcast is this has been my stance this whole podcast is

1055
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:41,400
I wish I could feel something but I'm just so fucking dead inside and I feel so neurotic and broken

1056
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,480
That I don't I I'm like struggling to eke an emotion out of something

1057
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,880
I have a similar sort of feeling that I feel I don't feel like I'm dead inside

1058
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,160
I just feel like I want to be able to cry more. I want to be more emotional because it seems like

1059
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,440
You know, maybe it's a it's a curse, but it

1060
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,480
It results in a lot of cool things

1061
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,080
Yeah, like I'd probably be funnier if I could be more emotional

1062
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,920
You know, it's uh the podd cast is a good place to go

1063
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,680
Listen if you want to hear like me be emotional every single week about the amazing things that happen in one piece

1064
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,640
If you want to hear the exact same speech about how amazing one piece is and how gratifying it is

1065
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:27,560
That there's all these things that were set up. It's our 10 years 10 whole years of setup paying off 20 years now. Yeah, all right

1066
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:34,680
Yeah, I do like the body cast but you do give that speech every episode. I can't wait. I we did this one. Oh, I'm late with that one

1067
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,680

Speaking let's talk about ben for a minute. Let me tell you people the most ben story that I could that that's ever happened

1094
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:28,360
It happened in our fucking in our discord server about maybe three or four weeks ago

1095
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,240
Maybe ben remembers this

1096
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,480
I don't

1097
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:38,440
I think I uh, I had like offhandedly mentioned that I was oh, yeah

1098
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,520
No, I do remember and I stand by it shut up. All right. Let me tell the story fag

1099
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,680
all right

1100
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,600
I'm just saying I stand by it, but um ben showed up and he's like

1101
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:55,320
Hey, jesse you offhandedly mentioned that you were depressed. Why don't you tell me what's got you so sad?

1102
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,880
That's not how it shut up and let me tell the story

1103
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,800
fine

1104
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Go on and I was like

1105
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,080
Well, ben, you know, I feel kind of heartbroken lately

1106
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,320
I feel kind of sad and depressed about a lot of real deep personal stuff

1107
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:13,500
And ben goes oh on second thought it's boring and I don't care. Goodbye

1108
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:22,680
Ben you mad man. First of all, I was being tongue-in-cheek right here. I was confiding in a friend

1109
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,760
And you and you guys wonder why I present you all

1110
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
And like I was like

1111
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:36,520
I made some because you said you were depressed and I was like, but jesse you just got laid. How could you be depressed?

1112
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,600
You know, I was joking. I was joking

1113
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:43,240
And then you're like I was and then you're like, oh, I don't know. You get well sometimes ben

1114
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,520
Sometimes ben getting laid, you know romance can bring out emotions

1115
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:53,240
You know some normal people have emotions and you're like, let me let me fucking all right

1116
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:57,160
Let me just let me just completely love with you like I was being jokie about and I was being but you know

1117
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,920
But there was kind of I was okay. I'm I'm I'm mad right?

1118
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:05,160
I'm mad because I live in virginia beach and I have nowhere to go and I haven't gotten laid in a long time

1119
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:11,080
It feels like I'm really mad and I resent you jesse. Wait, what I resent you for having had sex recently

1120
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:16,760
So there there it's out there. I said it and then I come in I come in here and I'm like, oh jesse

1121
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,480
I'm making a joke about how why would you be depressed when you just had sex and then and then you're like

1122
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:27,240
Well, there's just other girl. Oh, she said some something and now I'm in love with her. I'm like shut up

1123
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,120
I didn't I just didn't want to hear it. Okay. So yes, it was stupid and retarded

1124
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:39,080
And there you go. I'm not really I'm not really mad. It's just it just strikes me as such a well. I'm fucking mad

1125
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,040
You had sex with a girl

1126
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,920
You know what if you guys are going to be mad at me every time I've just had sex with the girl

1127
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,680
Then I guess you just always hate me because I've always I was trying to keep I was trying to keep my resentment fucking bottled up

1128
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,560
And buried deep inside and now it's going now. You're making it bubble. You're boiling that channel

1129
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,240
Okay, let's all just let's all just let it all out

1130
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
Okay, good

1131
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,160
I'm zipping other guys

1132
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,760
Let me uh, all right, I wanted to give one last shout out to uh data from star trek

1133
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,600
What that's not a joke

1134
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,040
It's the way you're phrasing it as a shout out, I think that's

1135
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,200
What

1136
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,960
Friend of the show data, you know coming all the way from the federation

1137
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,800
To big bird guys

1138
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:45,480
He cares about me. He understands what it means to be human. I like you

1139
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:52,840
You know when mr. Hooper died and big bird had to learn about death and he had to confront the reality that we're all mortal

1140
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,920
We all died

1141
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,720
That we all die except for him because he's a muppet who asked that he's cursed with immortality

1142
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,360
He has to watch all of his friends die forever

1143
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:06,680
You know, I really want to give a shout out to big bird for feeling that feel for me

1144
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:14,600
All right, well you've ruined it thoroughly everyone congratulations. I hope you had I hope you're happy with yourselves

1145
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,160
This is the best part because anyone have any last

1146
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:22,600
Anyone have any comments we before we started this show we randomly decided to start a new thing

1147
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,320
I have one work. I have one comment before we go

1148
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,600
I have one comment before we go into the ending show and that is that I've been looking this like half of this time

1149
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:35,000
I've been looking up lists of sad movies on the internet and I cannot find this fucking sad

1150
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:39,240
Like weird pseudo romance between like a gothy teenage girl

1151
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,800
And and like a and like a shrubby middle-aged man. It's like a comedy, but it's a role of romance

1152
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:47,800
It's really sad and it made me cry and and I have no and I think it's named

1153
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,440
Harold and mod or butch in Cassidy

1154
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:55,640
Is it the one where they like do they go around like killing people or something? No, no anything like that

1155
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,440
No, no, no, no, it's just like if anyone knows what the fuck i'm talking about

1156
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,480
Please tell me in the comments because I really want to remember what it's called now

1157
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:12,520
Anyway, just yeah, I just want to point out for the record that I didn't actually ruin a party by crying into someone's birthday cake

1158
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,280
That was a hypothetical. I don't believe you. I do not believe you. That's a lie

1159
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:20,280
That's a lie. That was too. I was trying to go off on like a funny tangent

1160
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,080
And but then did you like oh man? I'm really into this story about how Jesse ruined a birthday party

1161
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
I'm like wait a minute

1162
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:32,760
I didn't think the detail about the birthday party was real, but I did think the crying get a party was real

1163
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,200
I just assumed you got drunk and cried at a party because that's what happens at every party

1164
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,560
Me and my friends have ever thrown is that someone gets drunk and then cries about their life for like six hours and

1165
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,760
That's generally how our how our greeta our meet and greets tend to go. I love parties

1166
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,760
Parties are all good

1167
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:54,760
They're all fun. I'm not referring to like party parties. I'm talking about like me and three friends hanging out and drinking

1168
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,440
That's what a party means to me

1169
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:01,640
Um, and it usually ends in one of those friends crying about whatever's going on in their life

1170
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,880
For hours. No wonder you've lost touch with all your friends. Yeah, exactly

1171
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:07,960
Uh

1172
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,640
So we started up a segment this time where for whatever reason at the start of the show

1173
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:17,000
We put out a tweet saying we will answer one question that someone has for us on twitter

1174
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,920
And now we will answer one question. Nate. What's the question? We have no questions. Okay. Here we go

1175
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,800
I I searched started through them and I think I found the most provocative of them all

1176
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:34,120
Uh quick shout out actually to uh at rabbits foot 99 for their incredible cute duck from princess two to icon

1177
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,440
But anyway, moving on the actual question is uh by at quincy ackerman

1178
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,080
The question is John. Is there a middle road our fifth? Yeah, that's right

1179
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:50,040
He didn't live up to his father's legacy, but uh, is the question is from quincy ackerman

1180
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:59,160
He wasn't there about he was friends and family about 17th century politics or 18th century. Okay. Here's the question

1181
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:04,600
Here's the actual question quincy ackerman. Yeah, is there a middle road for normies and non normies?

1182
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,200
Uh, what? No, I'm completely

1183
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,360
Next question I'm gonna say the answer is uh, it's sort of

1184
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,760
Uh, because you see you can you you need to in your heart of hearts be a non normie

1185
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,400
Because if you're just a normie then you're just worthless

1186
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:26,920
But you can put on a mask of being a normie and that's the way that you survive in today's uh, you know

1187
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:33,800
Does that count as being a normie or is it just wearing? No, no, it doesn't. Well, that's why I think that what they mean is like is like

1188
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,960
not being

1189
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,960
Like being a normie in some ways, but then being a non normie in other ways

1190
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:45,960
Can you be a mature normie in terms of like I think my brother victor would be like a perfect middle road

1191
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,320
between those he's you know a handsome

1192
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,600
uh

1193
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:57,800
Personable guy who works with other humans and gets and he's out all the time and has like a functional relationship

1194
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:03,880
but he also like hates everybody and is incredibly neurotic and every part of his body is broken and he's

1195
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,400
Uh, and most especially his brain doesn't function, right?

1196
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:13,880
So he is like he's like the most non normie person to ever walk in the skin of a normie

1197
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:19,320
So he's the day walking about yeah, so how about that? Are we satisfied with that question?

1198
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,160
Sure. No, uh, you could ask another one because that one was terrible. So

1199
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:28,680
That was the thing. None of them were very good. But okay. Here's one. Maybe you like this retarded one. None of our fans are very good

1200
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:33,800
But we try what is okay? This is this is from at true start true stardust 97

1201
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:39,000
What is the canonical power scale of the pcp weakest to strongest does that tickle your fancy people?

1202
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:43,080
Is that what you want? That's such a big question. That's that's nebulous. I don't know how to quantify

1203
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:48,920
We can eliminate what end of the spectrum because we know cult is both the cutest and the strongest

1204
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:54,840
That's probably its own entire fucking podcast. Yeah, wait, we could we could find that out

1205
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,920
We can find that out at rad con 2 with

1206
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,160
That's true in console mania 2. Oh, yeah, the video game let that decide

1207
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,320
So right now would it be would be hippo is the strongest? I mean he won right?

1208
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,480
He had like didn't like cane win or like triple h or something one one and

1209
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,480
And uh

1210
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,480
Okay, that's enough uh, so people we're gonna do this again next time

1211
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,480

Instead i'm tweeting

1229
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Hashtag repeating

1230
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:12,600
That's why there's no heat and holes in the ceiling

1231
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,560
