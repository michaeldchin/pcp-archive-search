00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, there you go. We always record a podcast. And if you think we won't, well, that is similar.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm the best guy ever. And Steven. Yeah, and Steven is here, aka Hippocrit.

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm Pearl. It's me. I did it. Oh, by the way, I think we should mention Munchy is not here

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,920
because his voice is dead. Go watch the video, live and learn on Munchy's channel. You will

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,960
understand. Indeed. Please do. Please go watch that video.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Wait, shut up, everyone. Let me talk more about which crystal gem I am. I'm actually

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,200
amethyst, and let me give you a long, let me give you... Because you are a literal trash

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,440
eater and a garbage person. No, I'm amethyst because I have tender feelings and you just

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,680
shattered them. Yeah, that makes sense. Do people not like amethyst? I love amethyst.

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,480
Ben, did you not see the new Steven Volley? It was confirmed that amethyst is the most

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:26,000
emotionally mature. Amethyst is canon. It's canon. They said so. Well, I don't like her

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
as much anymore, but I used to like her. But Ben, she eats trash, so you know. Yeah, and

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,080
she's fat, like me. Yeah, I guess that's true. Ben's here. We're past that. Tom is here.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:48,800
She likes horses. Ben. Oh, sorry. She is a horse. I'm here. There he is. I'm great.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,760
I still like Peridot. Peridot's good. And Mage. Mage is here. It is I, the Mage. Mage

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:04,680
is like Garnet because she's a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I'm two little lesbians in

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,800
a trench coat. Yeah, that would make sense. That pretty much sums up Garnet right there.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah, there's not much else going on there. I'd say I am like Ruby, who also is my favorite

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,800
of the Crystal Gems, because I'm a little Spitfire with a big attitude. Nate, are you

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,880
a part of me? What? Yes, you are my mother. You birthed me. It was a traumatic experience.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,960
That's incorrect, and it's the opposite sort of. Garnet is sex. That is what she is. Garnet

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:45,120
is like if two kids gave birth to their own mom. You're right. That's true. This is the

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,120
quality Steven Universe discussion the internet's been missing. I love Steven Universe. I do like

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Lapis Lazuli at least design-wise, but Garnet is my favorite. Lapis is best design. Seems like a lot

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,200
of sad girls really like Lapis Lazuli. Like broken women seem to really enjoy her. I wonder why

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,040
that could be. They might see to relate to in that character. You know what it is? I want to

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,440
criticize real quick everyone who likes relatable characters. Y'all are basic as fuck. You bore

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,480
me with your opinions on things. Well, I think that Amethyst is more aspirational than relatable

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,600
to me. Yeah, eating more trash. Even believe not just eating it, but living in it. You know,

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,480
much like Ben, I hated Amethyst intensely at first and still do. I actually warmed up to Amethyst

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:46,200
quite a bit. Amethyst was like the barrier to entry for anyone who saw Steven Universe because

33
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,280
she's like, oh, she's fat, she's sassy, and she's sort of kind of black. This is one of those

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Tumblr shows. I don't know about this, but then you watch it and it's like, hey, you know what,

35
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,720
they're all cool. I like them. Amethyst became good. Well, okay, I can't remember when I started

36
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,080
to like it. It was sometime in season two. Maybe I'll resign that subscription to fucking Stormfront

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,800
after all. The main reason I like her is because she's purple. That's a good reason to like something.

38
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Like her hair. Relatability? No. Color? Yes. The best thing about Amethyst by far was that time

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,240
that she met the other Amethysts and belonged for the first time. That was great. It was the most

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,800
endearing moment of hers by far by a huge margin. What the fuck was the name of the Amethyst and

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Steven Fusion? Oh, Smoky Quartz. Smoky Quartz. That was a big fucking funny guy. It's a problem.

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,480
It's a problem that's real. Absolutely. I mean, we all agree it was hideous, right? Yes. Really

43
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,320
just unpleasant. That's the worst thing about it. That's the weird three arm thing. What is that

44
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,600
about? It's up. It's like it splits at the elbow and that bothers me. Yeah, it's really fucked up.

45
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,480
Don't you like Nika Robin, Nate? But Nika Robin is temporary only. Nika Robin is like

46
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,920
artistically symmetrical. She never does things in ones. Nika Robin is all about style. All about

47
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,720
style. Smoky Quartz has never even heard of the word Gucci, which is a serious problem. She lacks

48
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,360
style entirely. That's my main point. She is gross. She is very, very gross. I like the Yo-Yo

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,640
fight thing. Yeah, it was all right. It was okay. The episode where she appeared was kind of weird,

50
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,440
though. Is that the one where they fight orange in the quarry? And then there was a game show. There

51
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,160
was a game show in the next episode, which is very weird. Yeah, it was that one. It was the same

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,280
bomb. Different episode. Why can Steven fuse? It doesn't make any sense. The gems are made out of

53
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,760
hard light and he's made out of fucking flesh. Why can he fuse with fucking connet? It doesn't make

54
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:08,440
any sense either. I mean, no. That makes just as little sense. Yeah, even less, I'd argue. The

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,760
gems fusing makes perfect sense because they don't have physical bodies. I don't know. It bugs me

56
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,600
out that Steven confused the physical body. It actually makes zero sense. It makes 100% sense,

57
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,280
more or less, the gems confuse. And I would say it does make zero sense that Steven was especially

58
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:34,040
the molecules, I guess. But what about magic? Steven and Connie die in the moment because

59
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,480
their molecular structures change and then they revert once they infuse. Fusion is just like the

60
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:48,240
transporter in Star Trek. See the video by my favorite brony analyst, Night Sphere the Gnostic,

61
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,480
discussing why Twilight actually died when she became a princess because her body was destroyed

62
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,720
and an identical clone of her was reconstructed. Does this majorly interfere with his love of the

63
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:09,960
show or is it not a big deal? Of course not. Okay, well, that's good. They have teleporters in

64
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,680
Steven Universe and maybe they're always dying. Well, we see them move though. It feels like,

65
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,480
you know, they don't get deconstructed and reconstructed. They go through like a wormhole,

66
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,880
like two things or space because they get lifted up. You see them go whoosh. Yeah, you see them in

67
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,720
the like hyperspace continuum or whatever. And didn't the first time Steven goes through the

68
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
teleporter like they showed him like getting stretched out before they get to the next place?

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:42,040
So that's safe. That's that's that's existentially safe teleportation right there. I agree. I agree.

70
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,400
Thanks, Rebecca Sugar. I appreciate that. By the way, spoilers for Steven

71
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,880
Universe. Steven Universe season five, I think is officially over at this point. There was just a

72
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,720
Steven bomb, which is why we're here doing Steven Universe part two. Remember episode two of the

73
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,120
PCP more than two years ago. Episode three. It's back. It's back. No, oh, sorry. You're right. It

74
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,760
was episode three. I forgot. That was two years ago and like, more than that. Yeah, nothing's

75
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,920
happened. That's not true. But it's not enough. You know what? What was happening when we talked

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,120
and that actually is relevant. So what was happening when that happened was we were we were

77
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
going through the time it was like after Peridot had been redeemed. Yeah, that was like what just

78
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,240
happened. It was the end of that bomb. Yeah, I think that's right. I think that's right. And the

79
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,360
things that have happened since then, the cluster thing happened notoriously was kind of

80
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,160
unsatisfying. We like met the diamonds went went to the yeah went to homeworld went to homeworld

81
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,600
and now learned a lot about the diamonds. Yeah, the stars and all that. And that's really that's

82
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,600
really it. Connie Connie spent an entire bomb being broken up with Steven for reasons didn't

83
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,840
make any sense. Oh, I think she was on her period, guys. You know, that's probably what they were

84
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:11,240
going for. I liked it. You know, what was weird about that specifically is that she spent that

85
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,560
whole bomb like broken up with Steven, she comes back. And in this, this bomb, there's a big final

86
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:25,320
battle with the the the two yellow and blue diamond and Steven and Connie do not fuse once.

87
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,480
They don't get together to do a big cool thing. They just the soul breaks in Connie is there was

88
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,600
so much emphasis on Steve Vani recently. I can explain to you why this didn't happen. I think

89
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,920
it's because Steven Universe sets out to resolve all conflicts through talking and understanding

90
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Stefani would be, you know, them fighting and most likely losing. I mean, I wouldn't have I

91
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,000
understand the talking part, but like they did have a lot of fighting and Stefani coming together

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,880
be like, Yeah, we're gonna fight and then they get hit apart or Steven gets knocked out or something.

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,680
And then Connie could have been they could have done something, but they just didn't.

94
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:13,080
So, so did you guys like the newest bomb? Yes. Yes, I did. Yes. Why this bomb was good. It was

95
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,600
good because it didn't fuck around. It was just like, they didn't have any bullshit for the most

96
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,000
part. It was just good. Yeah, the first one was really weak. The first episode I like grown the

97
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,760
whole way through. Wait, which one was the first episode? The amethyst and Steven looking for Ruby.

98
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,560
I completely forget that. No, you just referenced it when you said that she's the most mature one.

99
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Oh, yeah, they made that conclusion. I didn't think that was a way that was character development.

100
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:51,880
It's fine. Wait, what did we learn about amethyst that she doesn't think that Rose's problems are

101
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,840
her fault? I don't know. That doesn't seem like a premise for the entire episode. I think the

102
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,920
interesting thing about that episode was that like, like, like for the entire show, like everyone

103
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,840
has like been dumping their shit on Steven. And like, Steven's been like the character that like

104
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,320
interjects and becomes like the focal point of like the problems, like like Pearl's problems

105
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,080
be ends up Steven's problems, Garnet's problems end up Steven's problems, even Ruby and Sapphire's

106
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,600
problems are now Steven's problems. That's the whole point of the episode. But like this entire

107
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,680
time amethyst has all the shit that she's going through. And the point of the episode is that I'm

108
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,560
not going to dump this on you. This is my burden. I'm going to, you know, you already have enough

109
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,760
shit going on. I'm not going to give you more shit to deal with. I'm just going to like,

110
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,800
you know, suffer in silence and keep it to myself and not put that on you as well. And that was

111
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,920
the point and it was good character moment. I don't want to say like, I think the idea and the

112
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,760
message and what they did is really good. I liked it. I liked the concept, but the execution of it

113
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,000
within that episode is what I decided. It was just kind of slow. It was just felt kind of slow and

114
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,640
patted out. Well, it did feel a little patted out. I could tell this was like part of the beginning

115
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,400
of the Steven bomb, but they needed to like have each part of the Steven bomb be an episode's length.

116
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,920
And so, you know, they couldn't have half of the next cowboy episode in the first episode,

117
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,760
even if it would make more time, makes more sense. Like they have to be their own self-contained

118
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,200
episodes, despite being released in a bomb format for some reason. But yeah, it was slow. I did

119
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,120
kind of like how Steven didn't really know how to react to it though. It was just like even the

120
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,640
pizza and it was like- You know what? You guys were actually wrong. It was the second episode of

121
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,480
the bomb. Yeah, the first episode is where they find out about Pink and Garnet unfuses. That was

122
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,400
the one that I was okay because that one starts off and it's like, now let's all talk and discuss

123
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,560
and deal with the fallout of this massive revelation that Rose Quartz is Pink Diamond. And I rolled

124
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,760
my eyes and was like, oh god, I don't want to. I don't want to see this. It's the same episode.

125
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,440
No, I'm looking. It's there too. There's two episodes. The first one is now we're only falling

126
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,760
apart. And that's about they tell Sapphire the story of how- Oh, you're right. They tell Sapphire

127
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,400
the incredibly tedious story of how Pink Diamond becomes Rose Quartz. And then the second one is-

128
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,680
It was super tedious. And it was so bloated and weird.

129
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,640
Okay, it's the second episode. Right. Okay, the first episode. Forgettable, obviously.

130
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,520
Well, whatever. It was insane. It wasn't too bad though. I mean, it was-

131
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, yes, it was. Let's- I didn't have a huge problem with it. I think the problem is that

132
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,640
most of it, most of that stuff we already knew as the audience just threw like infer-

133
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,280
Yeah, it felt like a recap episode maybe. It felt like a recap episode and like the

134
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,320
I don't know. I get that the characters would be stunned by this revelation, but I'm already over

135
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,560
it, so I don't care. Well, that's because this show has like huge gaps in between it. Like,

136
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,000
if this was a normal show, like we would have only found out last week and it would have-

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't think that's the reason because I did not find the reveal that Rose Quartz was Pink

138
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,200
Diamond to be surprising or interesting. Well, we haven't talked about that.

139
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,200
To go back to that for a second too, like- Yeah, that's a good one.

140
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,400
This bomb was good, but like the last time we talked about Steven Universe was way the

141
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,920
fuck before. I think the fact that we went on this whole fucking like year-long side quest of like,

142
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,760
no, Rose and Pink aren't the same, even though that was like the assumption for a while,

143
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,160
and then they went so far out of their way just to be like a U-turn of like, actually it was

144
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,760
exactly what everybody thought the whole time. That was a whole waste of time. That was like a

145
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,960
waste of a year. It's profoundly unsatisfying to have the- like everyone had all these theories

146
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,600
and then they really worked hard to fight against our expectations that that would be true and

147
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:40,120
then it just was true and here we are. Yeah, so obvious and I was like, oh, yeah, it was dumb.

148
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,440
I didn't- I didn't like that. We made you think you were wrong. Yeah, I was right. Did we not say-

149
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,640
Oh yeah, go on. Yeah, I was- I was wondering about this when it happened. I was like,

150
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,320
why is this not satisfying? Why is this not interesting? Because like,

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,200
it's- it's not like- I've already blown my load over Rose being Pink like three years ago and-

152
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,520
Well, I didn't- I didn't like know like the fan theories or like piece that together.

153
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,520
So it was like a surprise, but I still wasn't that interested because all it meant was that Rose's

154
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,760
mom- I mean, Stephen says this in this current- in like episode two when he's talking down with

155
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,600
this in the pizza shop. He's like, well now my mom didn't kill Pink Diamond, so she's not complex

156
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:31,160
a character. She's now like less complex a character and I don't know how to feel about that and

157
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,000
Stephen says, yeah, I don't know how to feel about that and like, yeah, this is stupid. But now I'm

158
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,920
just in like- in a weird like side step. Oh, now she just like is a liar, so let's like lump in those

159
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,080
weird mixed emotions here and we'll have to like sort it out. What am I supposed to be mad at Rose

160
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,720
about again? It feels like an asshole because like there's like- it just seems like, oh, if she's

161
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,640
like one of the three most powerful people, she couldn't find a way to deal with this without

162
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,160
like starting a war against herself. It just seems- well, well, the other two are like definitely

163
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,200
stronger than her. Like sure, but it seems weak. It seems weak to me. I agree Tom, that it does seem

164
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,000
weak. The excuse they gave was essentially she tried to reason with them and they simply would

165
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,760
not even meet her any of the way after the fact. So it feels like, oh, like this is kind of a weird

166
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,080
plot hole. I guess we can semi-try to justify it. And I suppose so. I mean this whole situation is

167
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,760
extremely like Ben was saying, it feels super unnecessary to have this weird double reach

168
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,600
around explanation for Rose. They should have just played it straight or they should have

169
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,800
happened to be separate characters. The reason they do it is because like I remember Rebecca

170
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,080
Sugar saying something about writing herself into a corner. Really? But like in like a cocky, like

171
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,880
yeah, but it's okay. I got it. I sorted out. I'm sort of the best writer. This is it. This is what

172
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,080
she wrote herself into a corner. What she did is that yellow and blue diamond are too powerful

173
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:58,440
and they hate- they loved pink diamond and Rose killed pink diamond. So the only way for like

174
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:05,800
Steven to, you know, beat them is either like literally overpower them, which is a bit much,

175
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,240
I guess, or to like reason with them. And if he just so happens to be pink diamond,

176
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,520
then they're now allies and they can fight white diamond or something. I guess that makes enough

177
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,400
sense. I absolutely believe that Rebecca planned from day one that Steven was going to be pink

178
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,360
diamond. I absolutely believe that. It just wasn't like pink diamond wasn't really even mentioned

179
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,640
for like the first three seasons, I think. Something feels- No, that's not- Season one,

180
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,280
we see pink diamond, I think, on the wall of one of the- I mean, there's a lot of like-

181
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,680
I can't remember exactly when we first see her, but I know in season one we do see the diamonds.

182
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,400
Well, remember that episode where they go to the weird Rose field with all that stuff? If I

183
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,560
remember correctly, I believe in that episode on the wall. I know that we at the very least see

184
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,560
some of the diamonds like on the wall, so the diamonds more intended. You see the insignia

185
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,040
like pretty early on. Yeah, the pink diamond insignia, I think beyond a shadow of a doubt,

186
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,240
proves there was intentions to make pink diamond a thing all along. Well, you know, something feels

187
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,080
cheap. Like, I think it would have been better if the revelation had come earlier and it was like-

188
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,520
Well, that's the story of Steven Universe. This whole thing is dragged out way too fucking long.

189
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,600
And Rose was just like a name that pink diamond had taken, but like the fact that she was literally

190
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,200
shapeshifting like the whole time for thousands of years, I don't know. Does it strike anyone

191
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,400
else as dumb? Absolutely. I think that is what we're all kind of feeling a little iffy about.

192
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,240
I mean, it was also weird. They showed like the flashback episode and it's like- and Pearl's

193
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,320
was like, oh, why don't we go down to the kindergarten and you can shapeshift as one of the

194
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Quartzes. And so she does, but like she doesn't look like a Quartz. She looks like Rose Quartz.

195
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,840
She makes herself a special Snowflake Quartz. We have to do that.

196
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,200
No, no, no, guys. When they shapeshift, they can't- I haven't seen them change the color. For

197
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,280
instance, when Amethyst shapeshifts into things, she's always purple. She's always purple, but

198
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,840
she doesn't- but the shape is the same. Like Rose gets this weird fucking hair that isn't the same.

199
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,040
If you look at pink diamond, pink diamond is pink and Rose Quartz has flesh colored skin. So

200
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,880
that is a change. So that fear is right in the fucking garbage right there.

201
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
It's a bit off. It's a bit off.

202
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,360
We have other Rose Quartzes and so we can't think they have Rose Quartz.

203
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,080
Exactly. Therefore, it's a very odd choice for her to blend in with these Amethysts as a fucking Rose Quartz.

204
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,200
Well, she's being a stupid idiot. And Pearl is explaining that you're gonna draw attention to

205
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,680
yourself. I don't mind that too much, but I did notice that the skin color thing was a bit off.

206
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,520
But what I want to know is how the plus size community on Tumblr thinks it feels about this

207
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:55,240
betrayal. Pink diamond is fucking skinny. People literally committed suicide over this.

208
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh my god. I didn't even- I didn't- No, there was a suicide attempt. Yes, real.

209
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,560
What? Okay, what actually happened was there was a fan artist lady who drew a skinnier version

210
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,040
of Rose Quartz and she received so much hate and death threats or something. That's right.

211
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:24,600
Such that she- I believe she did attempt suicide. Yeah, I remember that. I really hated how the

212
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,800
community bullied the person for drawing a thinner. It wasn't even like skinny. It was just like thinner

213
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:37,160
Rose Quartz. And in protest, I drew a skeletal Rose Quartz on my DeviantArt in protest. Yeah,

214
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,720
you did. I love that. But like- Fuck you. Real question. What if they knew at that time that

215
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,880
she had been pink diamond? Would that have made any difference, do you think? No, probably not.

216
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,240
You don't think so? They would have been mad at the fan artist and at Rebecca Sugar.

217
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,000
Like we're talking about kind of like identity politics and it's kind of like a weird-

218
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,960
I mean, identity politics and Tumblr people are linked to the show. I think like people were mad

219
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,680
that one of their fat icons was being drawn as you know like skinny, right? And it's like that,

220
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,040
I think is what they were rebelling against. And ironically, she was probably like the most like

221
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,000
normal proportioned character. She, oh my god, she's literally a- she culturally appropriated

222
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
fatness. She is in fact the worst offender of all time. She is a skinny bitch and she needs to-

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Was that fat face? I really like pink diamonds design. I'm kind of annoyed that she didn't

224
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,720
keep the hair like that. Yeah. That was cool hair. Yeah. No, again, like we don't know how other

225
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Rose Quartzes look like. So when she shapeshifted, she should have, you know, she'd probably look

226
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,920
like a Rose Quartz. I totally understand that. My question is that if she wants to blend in with

227
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,400
the regular Quartzes, why be a Rose Quartz? Because she cannot change color and I don't think-

228
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,280
Mej, we saw her change color. We have seen- Mej, not really. Days upon her visage that is different

229
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,440
in color. Mej, Mej, Mej. I'm not talking about the shade. The entire shape of her hair and her

230
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,240
face is different than the other Quartzes. And like, Amethyst can mimic anything. It just doesn't

231
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,600
have the right color. That is clearly done. Okay, now we're getting lost. What matters about this

232
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,880
debate is that it was clearly done as a visual indicator for our benefit as the audience. I

233
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,640
don't think this is something to really be criticized. Look, I'm an Autist and I get bogged down in

234
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,440
tiny details. Well, okay, this is my hypothesis. She looked like that because that's what Rose

235
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,160
Quartz looked like. Okay, well, but that's like a weird backwards logic. They had to make her look

236
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,760
like the character that we know and love. Well, okay, here's what I think would have been the

237
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,720
right move here. Okay, we have never seen another Rose Quartz ever. Does that mean that no other

238
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,160
Rose Quartz exists? They can't be true. They probably do. They can't be true. Because it wouldn't make

239
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,600
any sense for her to be named that. They think it was weird. We saw it. We didn't know that. Yes,

240
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,280
we do. In one episode, they've bubbled. They've bubbled all of them. They do. That is a plot

241
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,800
point that they bubbled all the other Rose Quartz. They bubbled them all because she was evil or

242
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,640
you know, because she made them hate them all. That's right. Right. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it wouldn't

243
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,680
make any sense for her to call herself Rose Quartz if Rose Quartz is not a real kind of gem.

244
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,240
Like, it's a real genocide, by the way. That's a real Rose Quartz genocide. The diamonds would be

245
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,880
like, wait, a Rose Quartz. What? That's not, that's not anything. Okay, but Mage proved it. They're

246
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,480
real. They are a thing. They are a thing. But here's my question though. Why did the show runners,

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,080
the directors and whatnot, choose to not show a single other Rose Quartz at this kindergarten?

248
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,160
Because it was an Amethyst kindergarten. Or a regular Quartz. But then why?

249
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,440
And that's my question. Why did she become a Rose Quartz? It's stupid. Maybe we can get

250
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,040
a geologist in the comments. Geologists in the comments explain, like, are Amethyst Quartz's

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,960
is a tambourine also? Here's the thing. The thing was, like, they could have gone to any other

252
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,320
number of, like, kindergartens that had Rose Quartz's on earth, if there were any. The reason

253
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,240
they went there is for that one scene where the the troupe was waiting for one and Amethyst is in

254
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,280
there. And that's like, because this is like our kindergarten. Within the universe, though, within

255
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,240
the universe, the reason why they went there is just like, oh, they're about to emerge. And she

256
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,680
wanted to see it to be there when they're emerging. That's like, in universe reason why she was there.

257
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:22,360
In Steven Universe. Yes. Also, like, I also have the issue with the fact that, like, it was all

258
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,760
Amethyst and she was the only Rose Quartz. Like, the main reason, like, the main issue I had, it

259
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,000
was no one questioned why a Rose Quartz was an Amethyst. That's been my point the whole time.

260
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,520
Yeah, it was very silly. Within the universe, no one questioned. They were not all Amethysts,

261
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,360
right? They were all Amethysts. I think they were a few higher rank ones. Some of them had other

262
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,160
names. I don't remember what they were, but they were called things like Tanzanite and whatever.

263
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,640
Yeah. Purple Rock. You know what, okay. I can't guarantee, but I don't know. Those are just their

264
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,200
names to distinguish between the Amethysts, I think. Well, you know what? You know what? If it's

265
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,600
a combination of things like, okay, Pink Diamond is pink. Rose Quartz was also pink. She's like,

266
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,920
ah, okay, I've got it. I'll be, you know, the other type of gem that is the same color as my gem.

267
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,400
And I'll, you know, rotate it so it looks like theirs. And I remember only seeing Amethysts,

268
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,640
but if you're saying that there were other gems too, then it's like, okay. Well, I guess there

269
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,040
probably was. I'm pretty sure they had other names besides Amethysts. No, the names they called out

270
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,520
were their numbers, sort of, so that they could distinguish between all the Amethysts.

271
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,560
Did they? Okay. I think that's the impression I got. I could be wrong, but I think that's the

272
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,800
I suddenly, I feel like I need to go and rewatch it for commenting. This is a small point, regardless.

273
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,800
I'll give you that, though, then. I think there might have been higher ranked gems that were not

274
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,920
Amethysts that were ordering Amethysts around. I didn't pay attention to that part, so I can't

275
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,560
say for sure, but it makes sense. If so, those might not have been born in the kindergarten.

276
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,240
They might have been from somewhere else. Yeah, but I mean, like if there were other

277
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,560
than Amethysts, then, you know, maybe this rose quartz was also, you know, one of the

278
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:16,520
others for some reason. Yeah, yeah, true. So I think we, I think we have enough ambiguity here

279
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:25,320
that we can assume that the disguise made sense in context. I think I just googled it and indigo

280
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,200
quartz is a real thing. So I guess like you could just put quartz after the end of a color and you

281
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,520
could get like a quartz, like that's like the default size for quartz is that tall and that,

282
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,520
you know, thick, you know what I'm saying. Nice, nice. Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

283
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,080
I went to go pull up the episode. Didn't Amethyst come out like thousands of years later?

284
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:54,040
Yes, she did. Yeah, she was a freak. I guess it's a good thing that didn't, this annoys me.

285
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,000
It annoys me that things with gems happen on human time scales. Like all of those

286
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,120
quartz is emerged like within minutes of each other and then the one outlier took thousands

287
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,880
of years to come out. Well, she was pretty fucking defective. Not that much. She's just

288
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,240
all retarded. I mean, to me, I think I feel like they would all emerge over the course of maybe

289
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,720
like a year or a decade. I don't know, like that they would all come out within minutes of each

290
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,840
other. Maybe this is nitpicky. It just feels weird. Okay, one thing I sort of want to bring

291
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,400
up now, I don't remember if this is Canner was just a fan theory, but like when gems stay longer

292
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,400
or stay too short, they become different types of gems. So if she stayed for over a thousand years

293
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,480
or whatever, she should have become a different gem. I think if that's possible, I'm not sure how

294
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,000
Amethyst worked, but you know, those theories or whatever. We're gonna have to tweet at Rebecca

295
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,480
Sugar. She'll clear this up. By the way, I googled more. Amethyst is the name of purple quartz.

296
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,560
So Amethyst is quartz by default. Yeah, they're quartz. I am actually, I've just clicked through

297
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:14,120
the entire episode, the entire scene of her. I mean, they're there appear to be only like

298
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,760
big burly quartz like her, but there are no rose quartz at least on screen. But also I care

299
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,040
very little about this issue. So I'm just yeah, you know, I mean, none of the quartz there seem

300
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,800
to give a shit. So I knew do I? That's yeah, you know, I think we can just assume they were others

301
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,840
or something. Um, my God, does anyone have anything else to say about Steven Universe for the love

302
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,880
God? Let's move on to questions. Diamonds though. I mean, the diamonds are new.

303
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I like the diamonds. You do like them? I liked the battle. I liked the fight at the end.

304
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,920
Oh, I love the battle. I was fucking sick. It was the best fight in all of Steven Universe.

305
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:02,040
Their boss battles were cool and like it didn't feel okay. It felt like they felt appropriately

306
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,360
powerful. Like it didn't feel like the diamonds just were suddenly like the diamonds were struggling.

307
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,040
No, sorry, the crystal gems were struggling the whole time. Like they're pretty strong,

308
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,120
but like they still had a really hard time even against just one of these diamonds.

309
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,920
I guess I'm I'm quite glad that they didn't overpower the diamonds because it's just like,

310
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,720
you know, they're built up to be like so powerful and so big. We have to protect our power scaling

311
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,160
for sure. Yeah. And if like a handful of gems could have defeated them, why didn't Roscoe

312
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,760
with an army? I would imagine a fusion would probably like they fused all together into

313
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,520
Alexandrite or whatever. And I think Alexandrite is like as big as a diamond. So it's as big.

314
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,400
I think it's smaller. Well, maybe. I mean, we didn't really see him next to each other. I don't

315
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,440
think. But I mean, I was glad that they did that and then address like why that wasn't working.

316
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,040
But they could have fused later on in the fight. I mean, they could have done that.

317
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:00,440
I thought that I thought that blues like crying aura was really cool. I loved that. I was into

318
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,960
that shape. That was like she's just like she's just so sad that she just like fucking emits this

319
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,440
field of like pain and like everyone in it is like incapacitated. Dude, that was literally

320
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,720
Kino. It was literally Kino. And I fucking loved every blue diamond. Also her voice is sexy as

321
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,000
hell. And I love blue diamond. She's the best. She's the best garbage. As soon as I saw her in

322
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,480
her fucking veil and her fucking pangolin. Yeah, what? No, what's the thing?

323
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,120
No, pangolin is a little funny animal. Damn it. It's a pangodopolis. I can't remember.

324
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,840
The thing everyone pronounces wrong. Walker. Palad box. AT-AT Palankeen. Palankeen. That's

325
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,480
what it is. And with her veil and her Palankeen, she was the coolest immediately. Also, did you

326
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,960
notice that the diamonds faces were really cool during this fight? This episode, no, no, no. This

327
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,000
episode, I got the impression like it had some pretty cool looking faces. And I felt like I think

328
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,680
this episode might have been storyboarded by an anime person like maybe someone from Japan.

329
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm not too sure, but I saw something on Twitter. So, you know, take it with a grain of salt. But

330
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,560
I think one of the storyboarders actually has a manga going. I fucking called it.

331
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:25,880
It's called Naruto. Oh, no. Palankeen is also not the most

332
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,400
Kino form of transportation you've ever seen in your life. I love them, again, intensely. And the

333
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:38,280
scene of Blue Diamond more like crying over the pink overgrown Palankeen. Again, literal blood-borne

334
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:49,480
the best. Just so cool. Just so cool. I really appreciated how the fight scene was satisfying

335
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,840
enough, but it wasn't overindulgent in fighting because the show hasn't got a lot of fighting in

336
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,400
it. But when they do, it feels cool, but it's never enough. And with a thing like this, you want

337
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,680
all the characters there. You want all the guys doing all the moves, and you get enough of each of

338
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,040
them that you don't feel like anyone was shafted and everyone gets their moment to shine. And then

339
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,320
it's over. I still am waiting for Peridot to do anything. Yes, please.

340
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:29,320
She was adorable, though. She is the comic relief now, and it's kind of unfortunate. I don't want

341
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,600
to either. She was fucking dope. She was scary because of the threat of Homeworld that she

342
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,840
represented. She was physically powerful with their thing. She was a data analyst.

343
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,400
She had like little robots that did her fighting for her. She is not like a fighting gem. She

344
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,400
could get those back. I don't necessarily want to. I'm just saying if they gave her metal

345
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,400
bending powers, she should probably do something with it besides floating a soda can. She's done

346
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:02,360
literally nothing with it. It was a cool character thing to say. She had to rely on technology

347
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,280
because she didn't have any powers. But then they give her a power, and it's used for nothing but

348
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,920
jokes. It feels like it ruined an aspect of her character. That's true, but they haven't developed

349
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,560
her power yet, so her lifting something has to steal. It's been like a year and a half. They've

350
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,800
had to have it. I don't want her to be an ass-kicking badass. I don't want that to work.

351
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,600
I don't want her to become a badass. I just wanted to do something.

352
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,680
Fuck's sake. I'm trying to smash in my car into the lane just so people can cut me off

353
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,800
constantly just for breaking everything. I've killed seven children. I don't care. I want to

354
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:44,280
say this thing that Ben was already saying. I don't mind that she's not a combat person

355
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,800
in the same way they don't want Greg to suddenly become a super badass fighter.

356
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,240
I want that. That sounds pretty sick, dude. I want him to join Lars and the Stars.

357
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,720
Oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. He could be like the, you know, what's the...

358
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,520
He's the universe, man. I'm trying to think of like a musician, Brooke. He would be the

359
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,960
Brooke. I mean, Brooke has a sword. He needs to be... He's the bard of the party. He gives them like the

360
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:20,120
funny guitar melody and they go, yeah. Wait, wait, I just got to say Lars, Lars as fucking Simone

361
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,600
on the ship with the fucking jar with Greg's head in it, like Lord you know.

362
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,160
That'd be good. That'd be good. Greg needs to be like the guy.

363
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm not sure how useless Greg was in that episode. It's just...

364
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,040
I mean, he's always used. I mean, Greg can't do anything to fight.

365
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Yeah, but he felt like a little disconnected from the whole severity of the situation.

366
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I mean, that's... He's a dead.

367
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,960
When everyone else was like just prepared to do something or like evacuating, Greg stayed in the

368
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,120
house, which is like, you know... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I was just gonna say that. It's a little weird.

369
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,720
We have like these fucking starships of these like cosmic entities that have come to Earth to like

370
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,880
fucking destroy everything potentially and Greg's solution is like, I'm just gonna wait inside.

371
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,920
That's a very Steven Universe thing to do.

372
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,200
Okay, but first he said it's time to turn on the old Greg Charm or Steven Universe Charm or

373
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,040
something, but he joked. What does that even mean?

374
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,560
He was gonna fuck those diamonds.

375
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,120
I think there's some... Because he did have this whole long

376
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,640
conversation with Blue Diamond and talked to her as an equal for a while.

377
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,040
So maybe that was what that was referring to. That's true.

378
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,080
Wait, do you remember when she first comes to Earth? Like they both have this whole conversation.

379
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,640
I completely forgot about that. You are absolutely right. That's actually a good thing.

380
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,520
But it's not like Blue Diamond was walking up in person. This was like her arm ship,

381
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,560
which by the way, the arm ships are pretty cool. They're pretty cool.

382
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,520
I don't know. I don't mind Greg making a joke, but I do think that

383
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,200
going, like go inside, like this is the ship is like the size of a mountain.

384
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,520
Like going in the house is not going to do anything.

385
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,240
I wonder where they're going to go with that one-eyed cat that they have.

386
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,960
He's just going to be a mascot. He's going to be there.

387
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,360
That's going to be a plus to sell on Cartoon Network.com.

388
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,280
It's a ton of runway of what to develop this cat into.

389
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,960
No, no, I feel like it will be a plus point in the future.

390
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,440
They'll develop the cat into a line of toys that they will sell for massive profit.

391
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,080
Sure, sure. Maybe he'll be the new Cookie Cat mascot.

392
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,640
Get the cat, get the pumpkin, collect all two.

393
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,440
Do it. I want a plushy pumpkin.

394
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,720
Collect all one-eyed.

395
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:37,320
I want like a funny, like a gooey, ewe, gross, sticky pumpkin plastic guy.

396
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,040
I do like pumpkin a lot.

397
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,440
They're going to throw at the wall and have it stick.

398
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,520
Pumpkin's pretty iconic, I got to say.

399
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,000
Just a little question slash trivia.

400
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,760
It's a Calico cat, I think, so it should be a female.

401
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,920
And I think it was established as a female.

402
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,560
Was it in the episode?

403
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,760
Oh yeah, they call it a bit.

404
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,120
Yeah, they're like mature.

405
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Only like one in a thousand are male.

406
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,760
So hopefully it's not a special snowflake male Calico.

407
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,840
Hey, here's a crazy headcanon.

408
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Pumpkin grows really huge and he's got four legs too.

409
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,400
He will be Steven Universe's Palin Keen.

410
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,280
Right? Pretty good.

411
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,880
Well, like Cinderella?

412
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,400
Yeah, like Cinderella. It'll be a thing.

413
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,440
Did you just hear my joke?

414
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,000
No.

415
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,600
No, we don't want to hear it again.

416
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,960
Is Pumpkin Keen?

417
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,080
Oh, yeah.

418
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,120
Well, that was a big bingo.

419
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,400
He's knocked it out of the park.

420
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,480
Can we talk about the whole headspace scene?

421
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,600
I really, really loved it.

422
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,800
Sure, sure.

423
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,120
I was a little disappointed that we weren't seeing the fight anymore.

424
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,600
But I guess I was pretty happy with what we did get,

425
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
like with Blue Diamonds' cool boss battle,

426
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,240
like fucking bullet hell attacks.

427
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,880
I was actually kind of like,

428
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,120
I enjoyed the fact that you could see them fighting

429
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,440
and it wasn't like a lot of scenes like this,

430
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,440
you know, Steven would give them the courage to move on

431
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,240
or like he would say something in the midst of battle

432
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,200
and everyone would be like,

433
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,360
you know what, I will keep fighting.

434
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,640
But the way it happened in this is a very unique way

435
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,120
that I've never seen anything anyone do before,

436
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,000
like to have the battle going on inside.

437
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,840
Like you could traverse them in a weird head area

438
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
that I don't know what it is.

439
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,960
Was this a pink diamond power or something?

440
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
I think it must be.

441
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
It had to be.

442
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,160
Pink diamonds is all about...

443
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,000
What's the explanation of why this happened?

444
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,160
I love when Steven Universe just pulls out new superpowers

445
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,760
when necessary.

446
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,880
That is what this was.

447
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,560
To be fair though, this wasn't actually...

448
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,760
What he's done before is he's shown like dream

449
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,720
contact with like people's bad minds and stuff.

450
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,600
He's got new powers all of a sudden before,

451
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
like the whole healing period.

452
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,640
You can't just say because Steven Universe

453
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,000
just randomly gets new powers.

454
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,560
No, no, no, no, no.

455
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,400
Like him getting new powers is the whole thing he does.

456
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,280
No, that's not my point.

457
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,160
My point is the whole premise,

458
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,560
the beginning of Steven Universe is Steven,

459
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,200
you know, he doesn't know really what he is.

460
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,840
The gems are training him to become a crystal gem.

461
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,560
At the very beginning of the show,

462
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,320
he didn't really have any powers.

463
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,760
And through the course of the show,

464
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
he gains new powers all of a sudden.

465
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,080
Oh, okay, but that's probably unsatisfying.

466
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,400
The tears, and now this one.

467
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,840
So he's over the course of the show,

468
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,080
he's learning new powers.

469
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,000
I guess he has done this before,

470
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,480
like he fucking possessed Lars' body.

471
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah, I feel like this is a version of his dream powers.

472
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,280
I feel something like he was, he was...

473
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,360
Okay, earlier in the episode, you remember this,

474
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,040
he couldn't contact, remember this,

475
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,440
this actually would make me far more charitable to the scene.

476
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Remember when he has to go to sleep to contact...

477
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,840
He talks to the cluster, yeah.

478
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,120
The cluster, in almost the exact same sort of way,

479
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,040
seems to be what he's doing when he is unconscious,

480
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,880
because established, he has to be unconscious,

481
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,480
which is what happened, he got knocked out,

482
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,880
then he is able to contact the souls of these gem guys.

483
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,160
So I feel that they were going for a similar thing with those.

484
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,000
So I really, upon the second watch,

485
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,320
I was like, okay, I sort of see the connection here.

486
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,040
Yeah, and also pink diamond.

487
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,520
I mean, all the diamonds have a theme of powers.

488
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,760
Blue diamond's the most obvious, it's sadness,

489
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,320
it makes people emotions, and they cry.

490
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,760
Yellow is electricity.

491
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,840
Well, yellow is a big bird, and she is like tough and zappy.

492
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,880
I don't really know what her...

493
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,720
Hey, I have a head cannon, I have a head cannon,

494
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,200
that yellow diamonds, her electric powers,

495
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,680
are what are used to make those disrupter things

496
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
that they zap people with, because it looks the same.

497
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,240
Oh, definitely.

498
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,800
You think so?

499
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,840
Oh, definitely.

500
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,720
And pink diamond, through Steven,

501
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,120
we understand is all about healing and defense.

502
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,560
And so in this new power to commune with people,

503
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,360
and the fact that Steven loves talking,

504
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,080
it just makes sense that a pink diamond power

505
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,720
would be on this sort of like grand scale,

506
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,640
be able to talk to people through...

507
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,520
It was familiar.

508
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,480
Yeah, like to talk to people through the minds,

509
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,640
like to literally incept them from the hit movie Inception.

510
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,560
In the Captain Planet of Steven Universe,

511
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,240
he is the power of heart.

512
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,080
You know, I literally think that may have been like,

513
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
they thought that was a funny meme, but you know,

514
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,760
like, what if we actually made a show

515
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,200
where the main guy was that, and he wasn't a joke,

516
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,400
and then they did it?

517
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,200
Yeah, something like that, something like that.

518
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah, and then the bomb was over,

519
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
and that was the best part, the end.

520
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,760
Let's go on to questions.

521
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,720
Did you guys enjoy...

522
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,920
I just have to bring this up.

523
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,840
So like, there was a preview at the end of the episode

524
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,240
that showed like, they're gonna be talking to yellow

525
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,600
and blue next time, and the bomb...

526
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,480
Wait, there was a preview?

527
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,120
I've missed it.

528
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,960
Yeah, I mean, after the episode, there's like...

529
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,680
Okay, this is baffling to me.

530
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,800
Me and Michelle watched this, and we...

531
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,280
Our mouths were agape when we saw...

532
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,960
So this wasn't relevant to this particular Steven bomb.

533
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,840
It was relevant to...

534
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,000
It was a commercial for like, the last Steven bomb.

535
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,200
And this was a commercial running

536
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,560
all during the last Steven bomb,

537
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,760
and only on the last episode do we actually find out

538
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,760
that, you know, Pink Diamond is Rose Quartz.

539
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,960
The... I swear to God, this is true, but it is mind-boggling.

540
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,400
The preview that they put together

541
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,040
that aired at the end of each of the episodes

542
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,520
of the last Steven bomb.

543
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,920
So like, the first episode, this airs.

544
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,720
Second episode, this airs.

545
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,760
Before the last one, it starts off with the words,

546
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,880
Amethyst screaming,

547
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,960
Can you believe Pink Diamond?

548
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,320
It was Rose Quartz?

549
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,360
Haha, no way.

550
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,680
I swear to God, I swear to fucking God.

551
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,520
They spoiled in like, the preview for every episode

552
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,200
of the fucking thing that this was going to be revealed

553
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,640
in the final episode.

554
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,200
It's just like, what the fuck were they thinking?

555
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,080
That was a commercial before the last bomb?

556
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,840
That was the commercial that aired during the last bomb

557
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,480
in preparation for the final episode of that last bomb.

558
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,440
Are you fucking kidding me?

559
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,880
I'm 100% serious.

560
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,200
We did the research.

561
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,320
What the fuck?

562
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,040
It's real.

563
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,320
They really did that.

564
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,600
I remember something about this,

565
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,440
I think it must have been this on Twitter,

566
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,680
like people were pissed because there was a huge spoiler

567
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,680
and like, even like the Steven Universe team was like,

568
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,960
What the fuck, Sienna?

569
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,880
Yeah, because the cartoon network is so bad.

570
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,320
Put together this preview

571
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
without conferring with the Steven Universe guys,

572
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,600
obviously.

573
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,440
They just spoiled the hugest twist

574
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,800
in like the whole fucking series.

575
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,440
Well, that's pretty funny.

576
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,640
That's pretty fucking funny.

577
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,880
Just unbelievable.

578
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,640
I feel like whoever put the preview together

579
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,040
has never seen anything of Steven Universe.

580
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,880
I mean, no, I don't know.

581
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,600
They don't know that this is a fucking yes.

582
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,200
Look at this dramatic line.

583
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,280
This is a great way to cold open a commercial.

584
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,080
There's two things that matter to millennials.

585
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,280
Spoilers and feels.

586
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,560
You don't fuck with those.

587
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,520
That's right.

588
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,480
Fuck with both.

589
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,200
Hold on, hold on.

590
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,440
Wait, I got to make a joke,

591
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
but I got to look up some historical facts

592
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,240
before I can make it.

593
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,880
God damn it.

594
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,760
We'll get back to this joke, I guess.

595
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
Okay, imagine, imagine.

596
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,520
It's 1979.

597
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,080
Okay.

598
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,360
It's 1979.

599
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,560
You really enjoyed the first Star Wars movie

600
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,120
and you can't wait for George Lucas's second masterpiece,

601
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,320
The Empire Strikes Back.

602
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,360
A fucking commercial comes on TV.

603
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,560
Can you believe that?

604
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,880
Vader was Luke Skywalker's father?

605
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,240
That's exactly what it is.

606
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,560
That's exactly the kind of thing this was.

607
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,720
Unbelievable.

608
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,840
Unbelievable.

609
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,280
Fucking come see that revelation.

610
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,040
Imagine if that was like in the theater.

611
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,640
You watch the theater adverse

612
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,400
and then coming up next,

613
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,440
the Star Wars movie

614
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,120
that you just paid a ticket to see.

615
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,600
Yeah.

616
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,800
Can you believe?

617
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,560
Dark Vader was Luke's daddy.

618
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:50,840
Man.

619
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,680
Good.

620
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,880
Very, very fucking good.

621
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,480
I've never seen anything like it

622
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,960
in all my years of public broadcasting.

623
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,640
Speaking of weird stupid things

624
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,320
related to Steven Universe,

625
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,960
what do we think about the Steven Bombs

626
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,000
and how sometimes some of the Bombs

627
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,800
are just beach city people

628
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,440
that I could not kill us about?

629
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,720
Can we agree that like...

630
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,240
That we have Steven Bombs?

631
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,840
For all of the anime influence Steven Universe has,

632
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,800
why do they have to copy Shonen filler as well?

633
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,720
Like, like...

634
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,920
Okay, no, no, but like,

635
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,360
they say that Steven Universe has no filler quote unquote,

636
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,320
but it does.

637
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,640
No.

638
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,560
What they do is that they force you to watch the filler

639
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,760
because at the very end,

640
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,200
Steven learns a little bit.

641
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,520
That's right.

642
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,000
Like it has a little bit of character development

643
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,360
that you need to know going forward

644
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,400
because he'll reference it.

645
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,960
That's exactly how they do it.

646
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,600
I don't mind the Bombs format.

647
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,120
In fact, I think I like it,

648
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,000
but I do.

649
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,360
What I mind is just the glacial pace that episodes come out.

650
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,920
I think the biggest problem is that they,

651
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,040
Steven Universe starts like four or five different plot threads

652
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,840
at the same time

653
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,000
and then doesn't solve any of them

654
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,360
and lets a bunch hang.

655
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,200
And it's not like a regular show

656
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,480
where like a plot could hang around for like four or five weeks.

657
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,960
It just hangs out for like a year.

658
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,680
Years.

659
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:12,920
Yeah.

660
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,640
And it's just like,

661
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,480
I don't even care anymore at this point.

662
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:16,840
Yeah.

663
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,120
I guess it's not that bad

664
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
because in the last year,

665
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,200
24 episodes have come out.

666
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,520
About 20,

667
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,880
it's slightly over a year,

668
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,840
24 episodes,

669
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,960
half length episodes.

670
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,280
I don't know.

671
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,720
That's pretty fucking sweet.

672
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,280
That's terrible.

673
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,840
It's,

674
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,000
regardless of how slow it literally is,

675
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,680
even if it's like the normal amount

676
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,440
for like an anime or whatever,

677
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,120
it feels way slower because of the Bombs.

678
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,880
Like I don't like binging.

679
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,240
I think binging is stupid.

680
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,360
I like watching a couple episodes of anything.

681
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,840
Say if I want to like watch.

682
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,560
It's complete.

683
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:50,840
Yeah.

684
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:52,760
Even then,

685
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,160
I don't like it because like you get through it

686
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
and then you forget most of,

687
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,560
because it was just one long blur of stuff.

688
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,800
And like things that are supposed to resonate with you

689
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,880
because they come out weekly do not.

690
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,600
I like binging because I forget things over time.

691
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,720
And that's why I hate the Bombs

692
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,240
because I forget to care and no one's come out.

693
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,520
I watch like,

694
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,640
if I want to show like the Game of Thrones or whatever,

695
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,720
I watch like a couple episodes

696
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,600
or three episodes per day for a week.

697
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,320
I don't watch like 10 in a day.

698
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,640
I don't watch as many as I possibly can.

699
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,920
I mean, the maximum is three.

700
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,800
Usually it's just one.

701
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,240
Sometimes it's like one per week.

702
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,680
I don't like binging because it,

703
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,840
like I don't like waiting a long time,

704
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,800
but spreading it out is just sensible

705
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,600
because it allows you to appreciate what you've just seen.

706
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,480
So what did you freaks and geeks think

707
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,960
of the whole fucking Ruby and Sapphire marriage thing?

708
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,680
I just want to quickly say,

709
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,640
I really liked how in that one episode,

710
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,640
like Sapphire was trying to use future vision

711
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,800
and she was like, why is she a cowboy?

712
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,640
And that felt so random.

713
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,880
But then in the next episode, it makes sense.

714
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,480
Oh, but like, that would be a perfect reason.

715
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,280
I had seen the preview.

716
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,760
So when she said that I knew that it was a thing

717
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,840
that was going to come back and I was like, uh-huh.

718
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,200
Yeah, good job.

719
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,840
That was one of the things that I was thinking.

720
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,280
Like if they had spread that out,

721
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,720
that would have been way funnier

722
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,560
because you would remember, wait,

723
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,360
she did say like a couple of weeks ago that there was a cowboy

724
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,560
and I thought it was just a silly joke, but it was real.

725
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,160
Yeah, I sort of agree with that.

726
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,840
Though, I mean, there's like two,

727
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,440
there's two ways to like watch a show.

728
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,320
It's like being up to date and like currently aware of it.

729
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,160
But then I also always want to think about like,

730
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,080
well, what's it going to be like in a decade

731
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,960
when the show is all out

732
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,360
and somebody just watches all the episodes, you know, for fun?

733
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,720
I hate binging.

734
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,840
I will kill bingers, binge slay.

735
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,960
In whatever format they want.

736
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,920
You know, one episode a day.

737
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,880
I'll destroy it.

738
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,680
I respect you less if you binge.

739
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,520
You should, you couch potatoes.

740
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,960
You are, you should stand up to-

741
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,320
Well, binging, you're not binging.

742
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,920
Can we all agree that the whole bomb format is just bombs?

743
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,680
I mean, I like it.

744
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,840
So I kind of like it.

745
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,560
How do you-

746
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,040
I kind of like the mini binge thing.

747
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,360
I don't know.

748
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,080
It's so slow.

749
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,760
No, like maybe it would work if it came out more frequently.

750
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,480
Yeah.

751
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,160
I would prefer consistency.

752
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,640
I'd rather just come out once a week

753
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,160
and I could just like become part of my weekly routine and-

754
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:31,960
Well, you know what?

755
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,560
It doesn't necessarily have to come out like once a week.

756
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,120
I think a regular schedule, whatever,

757
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,760
like if they have a bomb every two months,

758
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,760
then you can get hyped for the next one.

759
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,680
But, you know, you're still waiting.

760
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,280
But you're not like waiting like there's no reason to think about it

761
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,360
because I have no idea when it's coming out.

762
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,720
And I'll never know anything.

763
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,400
So I'm just gonna forget about Steven.

764
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,080
Yeah, exactly.

765
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,560
That's how I feel because like when the bomb's over,

766
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,960
it's like, okay, time to wait another 300 years.

767
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,960
Because I wish I knew when's the next bomb coming out.

768
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,920
I hate the fact.

769
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,640
I hate this.

770
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,200
I hate.

771
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,200
Oh, man.

772
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,080
She just hates.

773
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,880
She just hates.

774
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,000
I just hate everything.

775
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,840
About to get a little violent up in here.

776
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,120
Hating everything.

777
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,560
Let's talk about this gay wedding.

778
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,680
Oh, yeah, I like how I have become enlightened

779
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,520
in that I didn't even realize,

780
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,000
I didn't even realize that it was like potentially

781
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,440
like a breakthrough in animation to have a gay wedding.

782
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,800
I was just like, yeah, cool.

783
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,680
Oh, yeah.

784
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,440
It's like, it's not even, well, you know, here's the thing

785
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,240
that I think I've said about Ruby and Sapphire specifically

786
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,000
is I feel like it's kind of cheating.

787
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,160
It doesn't feel that gay because, no, I'm serious.

788
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,280
Because this is their only option.

789
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,240
They got no choice here.

790
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,200
Well, okay, yeah.

791
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,920
For one thing, gems are only female.

792
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,000
So that's like, well, whatever.

793
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,960
And then second of all, Ruby is the most,

794
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,640
is like the most masculine gem.

795
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,720
She wasn't in the dress, so it's all okay.

796
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,520
I was surprised.

797
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,360
I was really surprised by that too.

798
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,480
That Ruby wore the dress and Sapphire wore the dress.

799
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,920
She looked really cool though.

800
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,080
I didn't like how Sapphire looked.

801
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,160
The little suit and her hair tied back.

802
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,880
It was adorable.

803
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,600
I loved it.

804
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,480
It was great.

805
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,800
I mean, Ruby looked terrible, but you know, whatever.

806
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,720
No, she looked adorable.

807
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,080
I thought she was really cute.

808
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,360
I thought she was really cute,

809
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,760
but I felt like her hair may have,

810
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,160
she could have done something about that cube hair.

811
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,320
She should have done, her hair is just terrible,

812
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,280
basically all the time.

813
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,200
Ruby looked great in the cowboy hat, in my opinion.

814
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,080
I was into it.

815
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,040
I was pretty into it.

816
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,160
I liked how the top, the top hair puff,

817
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,960
kind of fit right up into the 10 gallon region.

818
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,960
What is known as the 10 gallon region of the hat.

819
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,720
I guess I would just say on the subject of the wedding,

820
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,160
like I feel similar to Ben.

821
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,560
It's a little bit of cheating, but like, I don't know.

822
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:57,960
I feel no-

823
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,360
It's just never, Sapphire and Ruby,

824
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,520
and just the whole fusion that it's just never felt,

825
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,360
they try to be like, oh, I mean,

826
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,640
they don't come right out and say it,

827
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,760
but people talk about it like,

828
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,280
oh, it's groundbreaking because it's gay.

829
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,520
And I'm like, well, maybe it is technically.

830
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,040
It just doesn't feel that gay.

831
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,760
I don't know.

832
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,840
It doesn't feel like any ground has been broken here.

833
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,160
This male ciz cuck is projecting too much gayness

834
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,760
that he doesn't even understand.

835
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,000
And he doesn't know that they're just normal people.

836
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,800
I don't know.

837
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,880
I mean, if people, if people want to get excited about,

838
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,440
that's fine.

839
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,080
I guess, I just want to say that.

840
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,480
It doesn't seem like that, that noteworthy.

841
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,960
I feel like it's good on this note to just,

842
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,680
although now they actually had him kiss.

843
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,720
Because like, I feel like-

844
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,120
Yeah.

845
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,240
That was definitely like, oh, we can't do that usually.

846
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,040
That was such an anime kiss.

847
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,000
I don't think so.

848
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,960
I don't think so.

849
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,480
Okay, because it's been like, basically the whole time,

850
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,320
it's been really obvious that like,

851
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,400
a fusion is like a relationship.

852
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,280
Yeah.

853
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,200
But they've never, it's never, it's never-

854
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,120
They've never really been allowed to,

855
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,080
but now they've gone away with it.

856
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,280
It's never been like straight up fucking.

857
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,680
But like, that kiss was just straight up fucking.

858
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,720
Like, these tensions, but yeah.

859
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,840
You guys know what I'm saying.

860
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,080
Okay, Ruby has had her sordid kiss before,

861
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,720
but rather like, I think Ruby was kissing Sapphire's neck

862
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,200
or something.

863
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,800
So it wasn't like a lip kiss.

864
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,600
No, no.

865
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,280
Okay, but it's the first kiss on the lips when they fused.

866
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,800
Well, what I was going to say is,

867
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,480
I agree with all that sentiment,

868
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,800
but I feel like it's good,

869
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,280
even if this is possibly not satisfying.

870
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,560
Ben, let me finish, god damn it.

871
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:21,960
I'm sorry.

872
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,560
It's, even if it's a slightly less gay thing

873
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,920
than it could be, perhaps,

874
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,640
due to these various biological gem reasons,

875
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,640
I feel like it's kind of good and not too cheap in it.

876
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,640
It's good to like get it out of the way.

877
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,680
Because like, oh, okay.

878
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,000
Now we've got just like a children's cartoon, gay wedding.

879
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,880
Great. Okay.

880
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,560
Now here we are moving on with our lives.

881
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:39,960
You know?

882
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,680
Yeah.

883
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,320
And I'm not, I don't really care about this kind of stuff at all,

884
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,160
but it's just like an updated outfit outside her dress suit.

885
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,320
Well, she's got the rings now, right?

886
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,520
I hope the rings, I hope she keeps wearing them.

887
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,040
Hey, hey, you know what's going to happen, guys?

888
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:54,920
You know what's going to happen?

889
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,440
You know why it is that Lapis Lazuli and Peridot got poofed?

890
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,800
It's so that when they reform,

891
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,840
they can have stars on their uniforms instead of diamonds.

892
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,720
That's what it's for.

893
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,040
I'm telling you right now, that's what it's for.

894
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,000
They're going to look cool.

895
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,880
They're going to look different.

896
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,680
They're going to look better.

897
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,320
That's pretty good.

898
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,760
You better, you bet, that better happen.

899
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,520
So I'll be so disappointed if it doesn't.

900
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,160
Imagine if Peridot just reformed still

901
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,520
with a fucking yellow diamond.

902
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,880
Oh, but she'll be a little bitch.

903
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,320
I will kill her if she does that shit.

904
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:21,640
Oh my god.

905
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,960
Yeah.

906
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,440
She'll be destroyed.

907
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,160
She'll be quickly mentioned.

908
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,520
That'll ruin the whole show for me.

909
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,840
You've potentially ruined Steven Universe for me.

910
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,480
That would be awful, yeah.

911
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,600
Guys, Bismuth.

912
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:28,840
Yeah.

913
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,400
Oh, Bismuth did come back.

914
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,440
Yeah, she's going to be part of the group, I'm guessing.

915
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,240
Did she get poofed?

916
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,120
Did Bismuth poof?

917
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,160
No, no, she was fine.

918
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,880
No, she fight.

919
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,480
I liked her armor.

920
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,120
I thought it was cool.

921
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,680
Oh, yeah, me too.

922
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,880
I liked all the Bismuth puns.

923
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,320
Did you Bismuth me?

924
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,840
No, no, no, no.

925
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,960
Bad pun.

926
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,240
No, I love them.

927
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,280
I love puns.

928
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,840
Terrible.

929
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,400
The most they are the ones I love them.

930
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,320
I know the point was that they were terrible, but they're still.

931
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,040
What did you guys think of Steven's song at the beginning?

932
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,480
I loved it.

933
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,120
Loved it.

934
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,680
I loved it.

935
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,480
Was way into it.

936
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:01,880
I couldn't.

937
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,680
I wasn't sure.

938
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,680
I was like, sometimes I like it.

939
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:05,880
I don't know.

940
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,560
I usually don't like Steven Universe's songs with the exception of a few,

941
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,080
but this one was nice.

942
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,040
I like the part.

943
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,680
I think it just wasn't in the mood.

944
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,360
I think I wasn't in the mood to hear a song.

945
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,960
It was nice to hear Steven.

946
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,080
It was very, what was that one?

947
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,120
One where Twilight pushes out the door and she's like,

948
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,640
ah, everything's going to be fucking great.

949
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,280
It's a great day to be a gay horse.

950
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,800
Yeah, this day is going to glimmer.

951
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,880
Yeah, yeah.

952
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, I mean, I liked when he was like, you know,

953
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,680
he really embraced who he was and was like, this old Ruby rider.

954
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,000
That's me, Steven Universe, aka Ruby.

955
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No, I was just going to say that I really, really liked Ruby's song.

956
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,720
I loved that as well.

957
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,760
I mean, that was really cute.

958
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,720
That was really cute.

959
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,840
I really liked the whole episode of Ruby going off

960
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,440
on her own was like, it was a real like emotional journey for me

961
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,120
because I was like really excited.

962
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,080
Like when Ruby was getting excited about being his own,

963
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,240
sorry, her own person, I was like, I was like, cool.

964
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,080
Like, good for you.

965
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,840
The problem with that is that I not for one second

966
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
believed that was going to last or like, you know.

967
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

968
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,600
I didn't either.

969
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,080
Like I knew that of course Ruby's going to decide,

970
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,440
oh, I need Sapphire.

971
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,920
And I was almost like sad.

972
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,680
I was like, no, but Ruby, like, what's Ruby going to be like?

973
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,680
What's the new Ruby adventure?

974
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,720
Yeah, that's what I want.

975
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,000
Be your own gem.

976
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,120
But, you know, I don't know.

977
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,640
I guess they sold me on it.

978
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,040
You know, I feel attached to this very day.

979
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,360
Because when Steven, because when Steven talked to Ruby

980
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,080
and she was like, oh, you know, I just really love being with her.

981
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,160
Yeah.

982
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,480
And I like thinking about her.

983
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,680
Because I was gone.

984
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,880
Yeah, kind of, but I was sold and it was genuine enough

985
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,200
that when she finally went back, I wasn't that disappointed.

986
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,640
I was like, you know what, I'm happy for her.

987
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,240
I knew that they were going to get back together.

988
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,280
But like what really sort of like got to me a little bit

989
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,680
was the, just the thought of like garnet ceasing to exist.

990
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,280
Like if they actually split up and never came back together,

991
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,000
garnet just dies basically.

992
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,960
No, we can't.

993
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,320
Mage, we can't depict a negative homosexual relationship.

994
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,360
We can't do that.

995
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,920
Well, by the same token, if garnet does exist,

996
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,400
then Ruby and Sapphire pretty much die.

997
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,040
So, you've got to trade off here.

998
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,840
And he's just being, I know, I know, but it was like.

999
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,920
Why do you hate Ruby and Sapphire, Mage?

1000
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,720
Why?

1001
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,520
I don't.

1002
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,200
There's just like, what, they're together.

1003
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:24,840
Where's the giant woman?

1004
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,280
Like they're, like, garnet is the trench coat.

1005
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,200
And they're the two little lesbians in it.

1006
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,680
But when they're apart, there's no trench coat.

1007
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,280
But, well, the good news, that's true.

1008
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,840
The good news is when Ruby and Sapphire are apart,

1009
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,920
we can get cool different types of fusions with Rubies and Sapphires

1010
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,760
as opposed to a big old fucking garnet.

1011
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,640
I wouldn't be opposed to seeing those fusions.

1012
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,600
It's just like the idea of, like, garnet to stop existing.

1013
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,960
It's like losing a friend.

1014
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,320
A character's death in a way, and it's weird.

1015
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,440
It struck me as weird at that moment, the thought.

1016
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,160
I'm just saying, you know, the thought of it was kind of weird to me.

1017
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,600
Also, I don't like the Steven Universe.

1018
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,760
What if Ruby cheated on Sapphire by fusing with someone else?

1019
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,160
I was just going to say, I don't like Steven.

1020
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,000
The one thing I have with fusions,

1021
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,800
I don't like the, they try to have it both ways.

1022
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,360
The fusion is both like a romantic thing,

1023
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,000
and it's also just like a thing you do for utility.

1024
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,600
Like, I guess it's like, I don't know.

1025
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,160
Like, let's say...

1026
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,720
It is.

1027
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,520
It's muddied.

1028
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,240
It's like, it's like...

1029
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,280
It's like, it's basically like doing donkey raises at the gym with your gym, bro.

1030
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,240
Which is, here's what a donkey raise is.

1031
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,360
It's where you bend over 90 degrees forward at your waist.

1032
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,520
Your bro sits on your back with his legs spread wide,

1033
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,560
and then you do calf raises with him, you know, sitting on your back like so.

1034
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,280
Like, it's a very intimate act, but it is for utilitarian purposes, you know.

1035
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,440
I don't believe you, unless you're utilitarian being gay.

1036
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,400
It's an intimate act.

1037
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,880
It's an...

1038
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,640
Well, that's like, it's similar.

1039
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,160
Like, yeah, like...

1040
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,040
Well, like, yeah, you could do that, like, with your significant other,

1041
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,040
but like, okay, there's also reason to do it, you know, get sick calf gains, you know.

1042
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,760
It's so bizarre.

1043
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,520
These are equally valid things to do.

1044
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,160
Please draw this picture, everyone.

1045
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,800
This is too gay, even for the Steven Universe.

1046
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:23,240
My favorite thing about Ruby is that, is the voice and how it sounds just like

1047
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,840
the classic shitty character guy who doesn't know who Batman is.

1048
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,120
Yeah, I do love her voice.

1049
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,480
I mean, it's like, oh my god.

1050
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,440
It's the voice of all the other rubies.

1051
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:35,960
It's true.

1052
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
Does anybody remember that shitty character, though?

1053
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,040
Are you talking about Jimmy Olson?

1054
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,000
No, wait, that's...

1055
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,160
No, the man who doesn't know who Batman is.

1056
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,360
Oh, the big fat guy.

1057
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,520
Like that, the guy who works for the...

1058
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,560
No, it was a character Jesse invented on the Katamari stream at Redcon.

1059
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,920
I guess none of you were there.

1060
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,680
People who know are laughing their butts off, remembering it,

1061
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,440
because it's the funniest character in the world.

1062
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,160
Sapphire sucks, though.

1063
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,040
I could not be less interested in Sapphire's whole life.

1064
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,120
Yeah, that's how I feel.

1065
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,400
Yeah, I agree.

1066
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,880
Ruby's better.

1067
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,920
Oh my god, the web of possibilities, everything was...

1068
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,080
Okay, first of all, first of all, what the fuck was she even talking about?

1069
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,800
Like, there were no possibilities other than the set path until Ruby did like...

1070
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,920
What? Can you...

1071
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,880
Don't you read like the multiple pathways of the future?

1072
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,840
Here's the thing.

1073
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,200
It's that future vision.

1074
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,440
Future vision is Steven Universe is just literally exactly the same

1075
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,840
as thinking about what might possibly happen.

1076
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,840
No, because it's like...

1077
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,880
You're right, you're right.

1078
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,040
No, her future vision only works if like nothing has any possibility of going differently.

1079
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,000
If like everything...

1080
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,320
If like if there's any random elements, like an unpredictable person like Ruby,

1081
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,880
then it doesn't work anymore because it's not predictable.

1082
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,840
Well, that's right.

1083
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,440
It's just a way for smart people to say they're magical.

1084
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,600
Yeah, it sucks.

1085
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,800
So what you're saying is that Sapphire is a fraud and always has been?

1086
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:06,840
No.

1087
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,520
I'm saying was she...

1088
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,240
It just doesn't...

1089
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,200
It doesn't mean anything.

1090
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,440
It's all the fucking tricky double speeds.

1091
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,240
Okay, right now because of Steven and Ruby or they're being unearthed,

1092
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,840
there's so many possibilities that it is kind of a bit useless.

1093
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,880
But back then when she was, you know, a Sapphire of a diamond,

1094
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,160
diamond, like the whole gems and stuff, the...

1095
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,040
Everything was very strictly all.

1096
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,160
Everyone had a purpose.

1097
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,440
They had a place.

1098
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,280
And like there was not a lot of room for deviation.

1099
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,800
I guess thematically it does work.

1100
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,120
Like like even in this bomb, like it was...

1101
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:44,280
I think it was Pink who said like Earth is like full of possibilities where anything can happen.

1102
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,320
And that's kind of like been a through line throughout the entire series.

1103
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,800
Yeah, that's right.

1104
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,440
Remember that episode where Garnet acted so random?

1105
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
Dude, remember when she worked at the donut place?

1106
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,720
Oh man, that was planned.

1107
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,360
And then she like did a backflip over the counter or something?

1108
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:56,840
I don't know.

1109
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,400
Yeah, she ran out in the rain because it was so unpredictable.

1110
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,040
Damn, that was a good answer.

1111
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,240
Nobody would expect that.

1112
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,080
That episode was basically the monsters podcast.

1113
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,600
You're not wrong.

1114
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,560
You're not wrong.

1115
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,040
The best one.

1116
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,600
I like that the monsters podcast is now a meme.

1117
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,720
I love that it's a meme.

1118
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,960
Now everyone needs to go listen to it a thousand times.

1119
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,480
Be our most viewed episode.

1120
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,040
Personally, my least favorite Steven episode is the one about the rivalry between pizza and fry town.

1121
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,840
That one was a terrible chore.

1122
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,440
I'll tell you what my least favorite episode of Steven Universe is.

1123
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,240
And it wasn't in this Steven bomb, but it was a recent one.

1124
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:42,360
And it was the one where that fucking Saint Kevin does everything to repair Steven and Connie's relationship

1125
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,920
and gives great advice about life.

1126
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,000
And yet the narrative insists on mercilessly shitting on him

1127
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,560
as if he has zero value as a human being and is merely an object of pity,

1128
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,200
despite helping the characters and being a positive influence in their lives.

1129
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,080
Well, but Kevin was a big douchebag in previous episodes.

1130
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:05,080
And today it's time to, like, they gave him the charity of like,

1131
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,160
oh, he's only the worst person ever because he had his feelings hurt once

1132
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,640
by some relationship or something.

1133
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,360
And then, but then they proceed to Connie says like,

1134
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,840
yeah, he seems like he deserves it or something like that.

1135
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,200
It's like Jesus Christ.

1136
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,120
You can't even give him the slightest.

1137
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,360
I felt like that was a just, like,

1138
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,360
they hate him, they hate him.

1139
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,360
I wonder when they'll pick up the little

1140
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,440
guys even think here, uh,

1141
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,800
by the genocidal monster diamonds of space can be redeemed,

1142
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,480
but not Kevin, but Kevin, it's true.

1143
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:43,400
Kevin has to be shown, Kevin has to be shown to be wrong in all of his doing

1144
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,760
because he represents the idea of like,

1145
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,000
he represents like, like, you know, non genuineness or something.

1146
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,120
He's a guy.

1147
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,440
That's why he's like, he's like a corrupted,

1148
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,680
he's like a sort of older kid who's like,

1149
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,400
he's like, he's been corrupted by like the evils of the world,

1150
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,320
you know, like, like the pain of life has turned him into a monster.

1151
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,440
And like the show needs to.

1152
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Okay, guys, I mean, they redeemed Lars eventually.

1153
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,040
Maybe they'll redeem Kevin eventually.

1154
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,400
I will bet you right now.

1155
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,080
Kevin never gets redeemed ever.

1156
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,240
The reason the reason Kevin is now here.

1157
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,440
He's a straight right now.

1158
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,080
Because Lars is gone.

1159
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,440
The worst enemy of all of progressiveness, probably.

1160
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,400
I don't think he is white.

1161
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,240
Well, he's kind of like off.

1162
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,520
He's like reddish or something.

1163
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,720
I do think.

1164
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,800
But he's, he's characterized as bad.

1165
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,840
So he must be white.

1166
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,160
There's, there's, I mean, let's, let's just real quick run through the characteristics of Kevin.

1167
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,440
He's absolutely vain.

1168
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,880
He's absolutely superficial.

1169
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,160
He is absolutely willing to like use people and only cares about like societal status.

1170
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,960
He's, he's, he is also forward basically overall.

1171
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,480
And all of these things are depicted as inherently bad things to be.

1172
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,440
And Nate's personally insulted.

1173
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,480
I mean, I, I, I know this is a personal thing.

1174
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,200
You, you like him.

1175
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:56,520
Well, I like him too.

1176
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,720
That's a character.

1177
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,600
I like him too.

1178
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,480
I think he is absolutely not a good person.

1179
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,080
He is a damaged individual.

1180
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,640
I don't know.

1181
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,480
I don't know if we'll ever see him again.

1182
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,040
But I think that if we do, I think he can be redeemed.

1183
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,040
And I think the show will probably go out of its way.

1184
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,520
I want more Kevin and less Ronaldo.

1185
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,240
We've, we've seen, I mean, we've humanized him in that episode.

1186
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:15,640
Yeah, guys.

1187
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:15,960
Okay.

1188
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,960
My, my, here's a quick theory.

1189
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,320
I have absolutely no basis for this, but when they bring up the pink hair girl,

1190
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,120
the pearl heart crush on for episode two.

1191
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,840
Yeah.

1192
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,760
When, when, when they, when they bring her up, I think Kevin's going to cut Pearl.

1193
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,240
That's it.

1194
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1195
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:35,480
Like around the same time, I feel like they'll bring back Kevin for better or for worse.

1196
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,320
I have no basis.

1197
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,280
Are you aware, are you aware of the, girl?

1198
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,800
This is a theory I've heard once or twice.

1199
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,320
That girl is the girl that he mentioned who like broke his heart.

1200
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,600
I mean, there's no basis for that.

1201
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,600
Wait, wait, the girl he mentioned, he did what?

1202
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,600
Well, like in this, in the episode, he talks about like how he'll never let what happened

1203
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,320
to him with insert name of girl that I forget.

1204
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,840
Like he'll never let that happen again.

1205
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,960
So he'll be vain and superficial and winner back and blah.

1206
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,760
I hope so.

1207
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,120
I hope that's true.

1208
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,080
I hope it's her.

1209
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,120
Oh, dude, dude, imagine a Kevin Pearl love triangle.

1210
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,080
Imagine those two like having a conversation.

1211
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,120
The thing is, some of that is like, is, is, is fucking.

1212
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,600
Like that girl is clearly a lesbian with her funny hair.

1213
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,040
Yeah, that's an assumption.

1214
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,480
That's an assumption.

1215
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,640
And I mean, the pearl is a lesbian, but she might be bisexual.

1216
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,040
I don't know.

1217
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,000
They can't not be.

1218
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:28,360
Yeah.

1219
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,360
Like Kevin was shunned by her because he's a douchebag or whatever.

1220
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,600
Of course it was at least bisexual, by the way.

1221
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:41,720
But what if, what if they, they, they make Kevin into the first trans cartoon character

1222
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,640
where he goes through the motions and he's like, I'm a girl now.

1223
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,680
Now I feel better.

1224
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,960
Now, now I'm not a douchebag.

1225
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,880
Now that I'm not a filthy male, that's what they're going to do.

1226
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,840
I think that's what they're going to do.

1227
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,800
That's going to be very funny.

1228
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,440
Jesse Pearl making those bedroom eyes at the horse amethyst.

1229
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,080
Sure did.

1230
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:57,480
Sure did.

1231
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,080
I saw Zen Huxables tweet.

1232
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,760
You guys saw Zen Huxables tweet?

1233
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.

1234
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,720
It's like, yeah.

1235
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,280
I think it, did he say below that, what did they mean by this?

1236
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,400
It was something like that.

1237
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,360
He drew them.

1238
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,080
He redrew them.

1239
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:07,480
Oh, did he?

1240
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,440
Oh, I didn't see that.

1241
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1242
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,440
Cool, cool.

1243
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,360
Yeah, the show hates men.

1244
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,000
That's, you know, that's really all there is to say about it.

1245
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,320
You know?

1246
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,480
That's why, that's why Greg, I believe that Greg will be killed in the next

1247
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:22,840
God, I hope so.

1248
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,640
Set him free.

1249
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,440
Before being, before being symbolically, after being symbolically castrated and then literally castrated.

1250
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,880
I don't know, stuff.

1251
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,040
Well, I don't know.

1252
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,840
What else, what else?

1253
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,360
There's more to say here, I guess.

1254
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:45,560
Imagine, no, okay, I'm just going to imagine, imagine if Greg gets remarried to one of the other

1255
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,520
diamonds.

1256
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:46,840
Okay.

1257
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,040
Wait, no, he never married, he never married Pink River, but you know what I fucking mean.

1258
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,360
Sure.

1259
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,440
Um, imagine, what do you think?

1260
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,120
Like, like blue diamonds?

1261
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,360
How likely are we on a 10 out of 10 scale?

1262
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,160
On a what?

1263
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,520
On what?

1264
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,920
He's fucking gonna, he's gonna hook up with the diamonds.

1265
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:04,920
He's gonna hook up with blue diamond because, you know, he got with the diamonds before.

1266
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,000
Because why not?

1267
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,560
He is rich.

1268
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,440
Because why not?

1269
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:06,840
He is rich.

1270
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,880
Why not?

1271
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,600
Tell me why.

1272
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,400
Yeah, he's rich.

1273
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,680
Just give me one fucking good guy.

1274
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:14,440
I mean, she is a giant woman, so I wouldn't be surprised.

1275
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:14,760
Yeah.

1276
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,520
There we go.

1277
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,640
There we go.

1278
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:18,600
Yes.

1279
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,880
Please do this.

1280
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,160
I mean, there's a new Steven.

1281
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:21,480
What a great show.

1282
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,360
Blueven.

1283
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,280
Universe.

1284
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:25,560
No.

1285
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,800
Does, does, does, does Greg like giant women because he's a manlet?

1286
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,080
He's not a man.

1287
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,000
He's pretty, I mean, he's a decently sized guy.

1288
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,640
I think, no, he's, he's pretty short, I think.

1289
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,440
He's pretty short.

1290
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,240
No, he's just fat.

1291
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,680
He makes him look short.

1292
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:44,600
I mean, he's way shorter than, um, I feel like he's the shortest guy in, like, any scene that he's in.

1293
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,560
I'm going to check this right now.

1294
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,520
Steven Universe cast.

1295
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,240
I'm going to see how.

1296
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,920
You will never find, like, the heights are never consistent.

1297
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,480
You'll never find an image that actually confirms anything.

1298
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:57,160
Remember, remember when Amethyst and Steven were the same height when she was,

1299
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,640
when she was putting those flowers on the fucking thing?

1300
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,840
Exactly the same height.

1301
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,880
That was so weird.

1302
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,480
And I was like, is she transformed?

1303
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,080
Like, is she going to fucking grow again?

1304
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:05,720
And she didn't.

1305
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,440
And I was like, what?

1306
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,040
Steven was, like, knee-high for Garnet.

1307
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,960
I mean, Steven is, like, kind of like.

1308
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:18,440
So when she was, when Garnet was, like, messing around and doing random stuff,

1309
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,760
his size, like, changed eight times, I think.

1310
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:26,200
Like, in the wedding episode, Amethyst and Steven are, like, exactly the same size.

1311
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:26,680
Yeah.

1312
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,560
I didn't notice that.

1313
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,600
The one thing I can say about that is, like, they have been, like,

1314
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,000
there was a few episodes about, like, Steven is growing, but just really slowly,

1315
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,600
because he is getting older as a, and he should be taller than he is.

1316
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,160
The people who make the show are on record saying they do not use ref sheets

1317
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,880
for any of their characters, which I think is a huge mistake, and it pisses me off,

1318
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,080
and I don't like it.

1319
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:53,640
I mean, largely, largely, I don't really care.

1320
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,680
Like, it doesn't bother me while I'm watching the episode, but whenever I think,

1321
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:02,680
oh, yeah, that, that seems, I mean, that one bit where Amethyst is exactly the same height,

1322
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,880
that's a bit too obvious.

1323
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,560
She's a little bit taller, no matter how much taller.

1324
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,920
But it, but when I reflect on it, I'm like, what an utter lack of, like,

1325
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,680
professionalism and caring about your product, to just be like, I don't know.

1326
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,760
I guess they're just whatever.

1327
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:22,200
Tom, that is the white cis male in you that cares about these sorts of things.

1328
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,280
We care about expressing ourselves, feeling, feeling the drawings,

1329
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,760
feeling how big Steven is relative to Amethyst.

1330
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,400
I need to take, I need to take this opinion back to Prager, you where it belongs.

1331
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,800
As a purple female, I agree with Tom.

1332
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,560
Well, there you go, there you go.

1333
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,840
If a woman says it's a problem, then I can say whatever I want now.

1334
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,520
I have the shield.

1335
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,960
Blue Diamond is the best.

1336
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,280
Here's a, here's a hot take that everyone agrees with.

1337
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,160
Yellow Diamond looks like ass, and I hate how yellow her skin is.

1338
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:51,560
She looks terrible.

1339
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,400
Yellow Diamond looks better now.

1340
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,440
I mean, I didn't like her initial appearance because of that crazy neck.

1341
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:58,760
Yeah.

1342
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,280
Because of that top of that neck.

1343
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:00,840
Yeah.

1344
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,400
But it's been toned down in future appearances.

1345
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,480
I mean, I don't think she's anywhere near as cool as Blue Diamond.

1346
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,920
If they just turned down the saturation on her skin specifically,

1347
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,760
I think she would look 10 times better.

1348
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,480
On her what?

1349
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,760
Like on her face and skin.

1350
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,920
Like, you know, if you turned that saturation down.

1351
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:19,400
I do think they're a bit, she in particular is a bit too like one tone.

1352
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,280
Yeah, exactly.

1353
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,280
It's like, I agree with that.

1354
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,760
That's why, that's my problem with some silk months.

1355
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,320
Blue is better.

1356
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,440
That's why like Reshiram and Zekrom and like Ninetales and Vulpix,

1357
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,040
like they're cool and all, but they're a little too,

1358
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:34,120
I don't mind Yellow Diamond's color palette.

1359
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,560
And I think when Yellow and Blue Diamond are together,

1360
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,600
they compliment each other quite well and they look good together.

1361
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,480
I just don't like Yellow.

1362
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,200
I think Yellow looks worse when she's on her own.

1363
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,640
We've had our issues with Yellow on the show in the past.

1364
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,840
Story history.

1365
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,680
The cycle continues.

1366
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah.

1367
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,520
I didn't realize I still have fucking PTSD over that.

1368
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,160
Yeah, you do.

1369
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:57,560
Clearly.

1370
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,480
Clearly it's manifesting here.

1371
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,760
What do you think about Bismuth's redemption, such as it is?

1372
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,320
Steven really just went in there and was like, hey,

1373
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,760
remember when you tried to kill me?

1374
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,640
Let's knock that shit off and be friends.

1375
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,680
No, it's fine.

1376
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,360
Because he learned something new about Rose Quartz

1377
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,560
that recontextualized how he felt about the whole Bismuth thing.

1378
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,040
It was fast because they cut away from the explanation,

1379
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,920
but I think that was good.

1380
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,080
I didn't want to hear all that explained again.

1381
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:25,880
Yeah, for the third time.

1382
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,440
Yeah.

1383
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,000
Well, I mean.

1384
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,320
I feel like at any time if they had unbubbled Bismuth,

1385
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,120
like with all of them there and talked to her as a group,

1386
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,040
I feel like they could have resolved it earlier.

1387
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,000
I agree.

1388
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,480
I still think, though, she might have had her reservations emotionally in Bismuth.

1389
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:43,800
Yeah.

1390
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,320
And I mean, let's not forget Steven on his own,

1391
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,200
unbubbles and restores this murderous individual that attempted to kill him

1392
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,920
and only barely escaped with his life.

1393
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,640
It's just like he really should.

1394
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,760
Like, I know if the other guys had been there,

1395
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,680
they probably would have said, hey, maybe this isn't a good idea.

1396
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,200
But just, I don't know.

1397
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,040
I guess I'm just saying it seems like a bad idea,

1398
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,640
but he is a child, so whatever.

1399
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,200
Steven is a history of making bad ideas.

1400
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:10,520
Yeah.

1401
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,000
Question.

1402
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:19,000
Does the fact that Pink Diamond was not shattered mean that no diamonds were shattered in the Earth Rebellion?

1403
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:19,880
No.

1404
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,280
Yeah.

1405
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:20,840
Yeah, it does.

1406
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,240
No diamonds.

1407
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,520
But what about, no, it depends.

1408
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:25,880
Well, there's only four.

1409
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,760
Wait, what do you say, Mage?

1410
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,280
No, wait, you said diamonds, right?

1411
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,760
No, I made any gems.

1412
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,920
Yeah, I was talking about gems in general.

1413
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,120
Pearl has mentioned the friends who were shattered.

1414
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,080
It's been mentioned.

1415
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,160
Guys, we literally have the cluster, which is made out of shards of gems.

1416
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,440
That's true.

1417
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,120
Well, was that made from any more?

1418
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,600
Mage is the only one on top of the Steven Universe one.

1419
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,560
Well, no, I mean, hang on.

1420
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,040
Wasn't the cluster put there?

1421
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,480
The Steven Universe averse.

1422
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:57,640
The cluster was specifically put there before the war, because that was like how they were going to colonize the place.

1423
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:03,960
Well, okay, in the beginning of the few seasons, they were gathering shards of gems as well to bubble them,

1424
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,920
like the remnants, the remains of their friends as well.

1425
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,160
Well, some of those were corrupted specifically, right?

1426
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,840
Yeah, but some of them were shards.

1427
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:17,080
I think like in the episode where the little shards possessed like the pants, there was only a fraction of a gem.

1428
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,000
I think you're right about that.

1429
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,880
Yeah, yeah.

1430
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:27,160
And I think when Bismuth came back, she looked up and saw like shattered fragments of her friends.

1431
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:33,960
I think she mentioned like bubble because otherwise they would have like unbubbled them as well.

1432
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:40,200
It was pretty cool when the ground cracked and like other fucking ghost cloud came out.

1433
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,640
Oh, let's talk about that.

1434
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,400
The Lord of Ghosts.

1435
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,600
Okay, all right.

1436
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,280
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down.

1437
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:47,080
The cluster.

1438
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,680
Let's talk about the cluster.

1439
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,840
Because am I the only one who was peeved?

1440
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,640
The heavy pee.

1441
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,120
I was peeved though.

1442
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,640
The cluster is very ava.

1443
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:59,480
That it didn't like, so the cluster comes alive, the thing that we've all been trying to avoid,

1444
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,000
and it simply was not a problem and was in fact a great boon.

1445
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,480
Yeah, that was little.

1446
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,720
I think the reason that that was set up is because Stephen has already solved the problem of it

1447
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:18,040
potentially being an enemy by being a nice friend and saying, don't worry, you freak.

1448
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,160
I'm your friend.

1449
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:19,560
I mean, that is true.

1450
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,480
I'll give you a bubble and now you'll have no nightmares and they're like cool sick.

1451
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,880
I guess it's the same way as Bismuth that like they probably could have unbubbled it

1452
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,920
and it would have been all right.

1453
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:31,640
But yeah, no, no.

1454
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:35,720
Like at the end though, at the end, yeah, I think it did.

1455
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,880
I don't remember specifically in that episode, but I think the bubbling kind of helps it to

1456
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:45,080
keep calm and at the end when it helped was like, okay, do you want to go back into your bubble?

1457
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,000
I think that's what Stephen said or something like that.

1458
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,880
You're right about that.

1459
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:53,080
But he distinctly like we see the bubble pop when it is like coming out and he doesn't like

1460
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,840
reform the bubble or anything.

1461
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,720
Yeah, we do not see him reform the bubble, but he did ask about it.

1462
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,600
He did ask.

1463
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,520
So I guess he's going to later.

1464
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,120
Is he going to drill down to the center of the earth again like they did previously?

1465
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,680
Is that the plan?

1466
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,920
He's just going to do it with mind bubbling.

1467
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:07,720
You can't do that.

1468
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:08,440
That's not a thing.

1469
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,560
He's going to bubble the entire.

1470
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,360
He can pull that power right out of his hand.

1471
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,160
Okay, guys, one, there's already a giant hole leading to the cluster that the cluster made

1472
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:19,720
itself.

1473
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:23,480
Second, Stephen has floating power, so he could just probably just float down the bubble.

1474
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,280
Well, Stephen distinctly says, what about oxygen levels?

1475
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,040
I mean, he can dive.

1476
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,200
I mean, if the cluster, he can make a bubble around himself.

1477
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,400
He can survive in space.

1478
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,680
He can survive in space.

1479
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,720
Well, he does need to breathe.

1480
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,400
I refute that by disagreeing.

1481
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:42,520
Okay, Stephen specifically says, he specifically says to the cluster as it's retreating, like,

1482
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,760
do you want to go back in your bubble?

1483
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,440
Now, to me, the implication was, oh, the bubble isn't popped.

1484
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,080
We, like, poked through the bubble with our little arm here, which would just make no

1485
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,720
sense at all.

1486
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,240
It seemed like the bubble popped.

1487
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,680
And we saw an explosion.

1488
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,080
So, I don't know.

1489
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,160
I think he meant to re-bubble it, but, you know, that was.

1490
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,600
I mean, maybe he just did something.

1491
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,520
And maybe he just meant, like, do you want to go back into your shell?

1492
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,160
Like, do you want to just be alone for a while, buddy?

1493
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,600
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1494
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:19,640
Wouldn't a fucking giant cluster going from the core of the Earth all the way to the surface,

1495
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,200
like, cause damage significantly to the planet?

1496
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,560
No.

1497
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,760
No.

1498
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,280
Okay, to be fair, the Earth in Steven Universe is already massively fucked by, like, even

1499
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,400
having the cluster to begin with.

1500
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,080
So, I guess it's just, like, different.

1501
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:38,600
I was like, there's certain man masses missing in Steven Universe.

1502
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,120
Yeah, there is no center of the Earth.

1503
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,320
There is just the cluster.

1504
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,080
Did that arm extend all the way from the center of the planet?

1505
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,200
I mean, it must have, right?

1506
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,080
Well, for, I mean, for fuck's sake.

1507
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:53,160
Like, that's, like, I don't know how many miles that is, but that's like a lot,

1508
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,960
it's like, it's probably like thousands of miles to the center.

1509
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,960
And, but then, like, it gets up and the arm itself is like, you know,

1510
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,040
you know, maybe like mountain-sized, like.

1511
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,320
If you think about it, okay, I mean, well, I think, like, the United States is like a

1512
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,600
thousand miles across, I think, or maybe a couple thousand.

1513
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,800
I think it's more, yeah.

1514
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,560
Okay, you know what, whatever.

1515
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,240
So, it was definitely thousands of miles, like, to the center of the Earth, probably.

1516
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,520
I mean, it's a lot longer than the arm that we see.

1517
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,240
Yeah.

1518
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,560
So, I guess it's just a weird coincidence that the size of the arm that emerges from the Earth,

1519
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,440
of what is left to emerge from the Earth is just the same exact size.

1520
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah, I think they just decided not to go further than that, for some reason.

1521
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,960
I mean, I mean, it worked out, you know, that was an appropriate length to form.

1522
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,560
Yeah, maybe it just decided to match the other two, but like, why not be bigger?

1523
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,960
Because we had to have this cool arm wrestling scene.

1524
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,600
It was this fucking sick shit, dude.

1525
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,680
The rule of cool.

1526
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,040
You make comics, you know it.

1527
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,520
I, yeah, I get it.

1528
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,960
I mean, it was kind of cool.

1529
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,720
I like this, I like the ships.

1530
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,240
I didn't really like the weird arm cluster, but whatever.

1531
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:57,880
It looked like a muscle.

1532
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,840
It looked like muscles.

1533
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,880
It was, it was theming.

1534
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,000
It was organic.

1535
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,880
It represented the Earth.

1536
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,920
How was that theming?

1537
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:06,280
Because it represented the organic nature of Earth versus the clean.

1538
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:12,840
Oh, so it's incomplete, it's raw, it's bro, it's damaged.

1539
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,680
It's raw, it's mean.

1540
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,000
The cluster is hashtag our boy now.

1541
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,080
I mean, that's true.

1542
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,040
Yeah, it is, it is.

1543
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:26,360
I always, I still, I think I remember saying this in the previous Steven Universe podcast,

1544
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,720
but I want to see what happens when the cluster fuses with someone.

1545
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:30,360
Oh, that's.

1546
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,800
Specifically see, Steven.

1547
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,520
Becomes God.

1548
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,000
Steven fuses with the cluster to fight white diamond or something.

1549
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,400
He becomes like a giant, like big boy.

1550
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,200
No, the thing is.

1551
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,160
How convenient.

1552
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,880
The big bad is white diamond.

1553
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,600
Oh, yeah.

1554
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,960
Of course.

1555
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:51,960
Now, until we learn of the secret overlord, black diamond, which will be, you know, truly, truly powerful.

1556
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,560
I want there to be a black diamond.

1557
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,400
I mean, that sounds cool, you know.

1558
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,600
Black and red diamond.

1559
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,720
Black and red diamond.

1560
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,760
Black diamond.

1561
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,080
Uh, I want to learn lore about where the diamonds came from.

1562
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,080
Well, then I can make actual gems like on earth.

1563
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:05,640
Oh, yeah.

1564
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,440
Yeah.

1565
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:06,840
Yeah.

1566
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,960
Oh, you Google it.

1567
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,440
You see.

1568
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:09,720
Wait, what is this?

1569
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,520
I can't go over right now.

1570
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:11,720
Oh, okay.

1571
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,800
Are you asking if on earth there are black or red diamonds?

1572
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,200
Yeah, there is.

1573
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,720
There is such a thing as a black diamond.

1574
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,280
A black diamond.

1575
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:16,680
Okay.

1576
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:16,920
Yeah.

1577
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,120
I was just, just making sure.

1578
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,720
What about a, what about a trans diamond?

1579
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,560
What about a gay diamond?

1580
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,760
We need inclusion.

1581
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,680
No, black diamonds, black diamonds only exists on ski slopes.

1582
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,880
For when you gotta be the old champion skier.

1583
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,800
Black diamond is just a skiing champ.

1584
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,560
It's, it looks almost chrome.

1585
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,280
Well, fair enough.

1586
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,960
I can't, I'm, I'm finding Google images,

1587
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,320
but they all seem fake and dumb.

1588
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,280
Hey, here's a thought.

1589
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,000
I'm pretty sure.

1590
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,960
It doesn't mean anything.

1591
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:46,120
But remember how the, how, uh,

1592
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,760
Peridot showed up in a giant green hand?

1593
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,800
Is there a, is there a green diamond out there somewhere?

1594
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,800
I mean, there was a blue and a, you know, yellow.

1595
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,200
It is.

1596
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:54,520
Yeah, yeah.

1597
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,720
I was thinking about that.

1598
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,120
It's a hand as opposed to an arm.

1599
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,400
So I guess that like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1600
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,280
Peridot showed up in a hand and the diamonds show up in arms,

1601
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,600
but like the hand seemed like bigger.

1602
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,360
Well, the hand seemed about the same size

1603
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,280
as the, as the hand of the arm.

1604
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,200
Sizes are a little bit weird in Steven.

1605
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,040
I guess I can, I don't know.

1606
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,640
I really was hoping.

1607
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,360
Does each of these arms just command a fleet of hands?

1608
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:22,840
I don't know.

1609
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,400
I don't know.

1610
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,520
Um, I like it.

1611
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:25,160
Okay.

1612
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,360
Guys, color theory, blue plus yellow equals green.

1613
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,120
Wow.

1614
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,200
Yeah.

1615
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,640
Did you go to art school or something?

1616
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,080
Pretty impressive.

1617
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:36,840
Well, and what does the theory consist of?

1618
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,120
It's just like, I think that the implication might have been

1619
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,720
that like Peridot is just, you know,

1620
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,640
subservient to both of the diamonds, even though,

1621
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,720
I mean, she's definitely yellows, but.

1622
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,320
Yeah, Peridot is yellows, man.

1623
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,760
But like, they work together, like blue and yellow.

1624
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,480
So.

1625
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,280
It is strange and makes me wonder if there's some kind,

1626
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,160
if the green is some, like, I mean,

1627
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,760
there's only two things that make sense.

1628
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,680
And one is that the green is like some kind of coalition,

1629
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,760
like blue and yellow coalition color,

1630
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,200
or that this ship was made specifically for Peridot,

1631
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,200
or maybe for Peridot's plural.

1632
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
I mean, that's probably, I guess, what it is.

1633
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,120
I mean, you know, Peridot wasn't special at the time.

1634
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,120
They probably send Peridots on these kind of missions

1635
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,160
elsewhere as well.

1636
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,320
I think, I think if we're thinking of color theory,

1637
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,280
if we're thinking of color theory,

1638
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,120
we've got yellow, blue, and pink, which is like the red,

1639
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,880
which is like the three primary colors.

1640
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,400
So I don't know whether there would be any other diamonds

1641
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,720
aside from white diamond that are secret.

1642
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,840
I mean, I'm assuming not.

1643
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,640
I'm assuming not.

1644
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,200
By the way, guys, here's a conspiracy theory

1645
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,240
that a lot of people are bringing up that I think makes no sense,

1646
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,280
but you can weigh in on.

1647
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,880
There was, there, remember that, remember that time,

1648
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,000
when Greg, Steven, and Pearl went to the city,

1649
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:57,000
and that's when Pearl sang her song about Rose being gone,

1650
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,080
and she kind of got over her hatred of Greg.

1651
01:22:59,080 --> 01:22:59,880
With the top hat.

1652
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,600
With the top hat.

1653
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,160
That's the one.

1654
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:01,880
That's the one.

1655
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,920
Yeah, yeah.

1656
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,680
So in that song, Greg is depicted as yellow,

1657
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,760
and Pearl is depicted as blue.

1658
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:15,000
And people are making connections to blue and yellow diamond.

1659
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,400
I see zero connection here other than Pearl was sad about stuff,

1660
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,120
like blue.

1661
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,520
What kind of connections are being made?

1662
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,640
I have not even paid attention to what they are.

1663
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:29,240
I mean, secretly Greg is yellow diamond.

1664
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,560
How would Greg even be yellow diamond in any way?

1665
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,200
It's because Greg represents-

1666
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:32,760
No, dude.

1667
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,360
The white, he went into the house.

1668
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,720
He went into the house, and he hid,

1669
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,320
and he came out as yellow diamond,

1670
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,080
like the ends, as you've seen them together.

1671
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,080
It's in the same room.

1672
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,880
Yellow diamond represents toxic masculinity,

1673
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,280
which Greg is the human embodiment of,

1674
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,800
and that's how he stole Rose with his toxic masculinity.

1675
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,600
Yeah, you're right.

1676
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,320
You're right.

1677
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,600
Of course I'm right.

1678
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,760
I'm sold.

1679
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,400
I'm sold.

1680
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,760
I can't wait for white to be the only male gem.

1681
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,240
That would be interesting.

1682
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,520
That would actually be kind of cool and neat.

1683
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,520
It would literally be the patriarchy, is what that would be.

1684
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,960
Yeah, I mean, it would be.

1685
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,560
At least they'd be honest about it.

1686
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:12,440
Yeah, it won't be.

1687
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,560
Like on the surface.

1688
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,520
Men are banned.

1689
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:18,280
It will never stop frustrating me that the gems are all female,

1690
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,160
because if everyone is female, then no one is.

1691
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,360
It doesn't even make sense for gems to have a gender at all.

1692
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,440
It's just an artistic choice, really.

1693
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:26,920
Yeah.

1694
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,400
I mean, okay, I guess gender is performed.

1695
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,360
I don't know, whatever.

1696
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,160
Right, right.

1697
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,000
What does that even mean in a world where nobody has sex?

1698
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,720
But they all have girlish forms.

1699
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,880
Well, look at Ruby before example.

1700
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,040
Ruby is very real.

1701
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,200
Also proper amethysts, as well.

1702
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,640
Yeah, look at what's her face.

1703
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,440
Tansanite?

1704
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,000
No.

1705
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,880
Who's the orange one?

1706
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,880
I can't remember.

1707
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,440
Jasper.

1708
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,240
Yeah, Jasper.

1709
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:55,560
Jasper's very good.

1710
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,680
Where the fuck is she?

1711
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,120
What the heck happened?

1712
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,200
I mean, we've been told they're all female.

1713
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:05,320
Yeah, they're all female, but like, I don't know.

1714
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,520
It rings a bit hollow when you think about it.

1715
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,080
It's like, well, technically, they're not even female.

1716
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,880
They're genderless, but they use female pronouns.

1717
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,080
But like, why would they even use female pronouns in a society

1718
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,760
where there is no such thing as male or female?

1719
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,240
Well, they have to have some sort of pronouns,

1720
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,400
and I guess it's easy for the watchers to have.

1721
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,800
For some reason, the gems speak English, and in English,

1722
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,920
you have to have a pronoun.

1723
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,760
Well, yeah, that's the real reason.

1724
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,800
I guess that's very wrong.

1725
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,000
No, you don't.

1726
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,160
You don't have to have pronouns if you don't want to.

1727
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,640
Well, I think Rebecca Sugar just wanted to make them female,

1728
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,680
and so she came up with reasons.

1729
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,320
Well, sure.

1730
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:43,960
I mean, yeah.

1731
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,080
They just want the porn.

1732
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,040
They want the porn, they want the Rule 34, and so do I.

1733
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,280
But in the universe, I don't know, when it's like,

1734
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,520
all the gems are female, my question is,

1735
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,040
but what does that mean, really?

1736
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,560
Like, what does it, what does that mean?

1737
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,640
Rule 34 is what it means.

1738
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,120
In some cases, I think it makes more sense than others.

1739
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1740
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,120
It's a stylistic choice.

1741
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:02,680
I don't know.

1742
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,240
It's fine.

1743
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:03,640
It's fine.

1744
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,480
This is why I wonder, and this is why you gotta ask the deep questions.

1745
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,840
Like, is Sapphire and Ruby's marriage really a gay wedding?

1746
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,480
Nobody knows.

1747
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,600
Nobody knows.

1748
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,560
Nobody knows.

1749
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,120
Scholars debate for it endlessly.

1750
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,120
It's a very funny wedding.

1751
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,600
Kind of genderless and just reproducing.

1752
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,560
I mean, if you just saw a really sexy starfish,

1753
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:28,920
starfish are genderless, but like, if it looked kind of feminine.

1754
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,160
Patrick.

1755
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,000
Would you call it like, like Patrick?

1756
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,440
Just because Patrick has a rockin' bod,

1757
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,360
it does not make him female, you know?

1758
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:37,400
Yeah.

1759
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,120
Nor does it make him male.

1760
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,360
Rule 34, Patrick Star.

1761
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,800
Oh, God.

1762
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,880
Yes, this is good.

1763
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,840
Hey, well, who's your favorite gem?

1764
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,000
Mine was Ruby for a long time.

1765
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,120
I think I'm back on Pearl.

1766
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,160
I think I'm back on Pearl.

1767
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,800
I-

1768
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,880
Mine was Pearl for a while, but I think Amethyst.

1769
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,040
I think Garnet has always been a favorite,

1770
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,960
but Lapis Lazuli is second.

1771
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:02,680
I have been thinking since the beginning of this podcast,

1772
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,880
when I couldn't decide on what gem I liked the most.

1773
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,360
And I think I still can't decide.

1774
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,960
But maybe it's Lyon.

1775
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,120
Lyon's not a gem, but he thinks it's funny.

1776
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,160
My favorite gem is the gem that I made for the last even podcast,

1777
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,840
Stibnite, sweet precious Stibnite.

1778
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,560
Oh yeah, my favorite gem is me, Aquamarine.

1779
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,960
I miss, what's his face?

1780
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,640
Mexican, whatever the fuck his name was.

1781
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:30,440
The fusion guy.

1782
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:31,400
Whoa, God, yeah.

1783
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,520
Remember that guy?

1784
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,760
Is it Mexican cherry opal or fire opal?

1785
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,240
No.

1786
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,440
Something like, I'm gonna Google it.

1787
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,080
I'm gonna Google it.

1788
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,840
I think it was Mexican cherry opal.

1789
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,560
I think you're right.

1790
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,440
I think it was a fusion of two, you know,

1791
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,840
whatever's, and that was cool.

1792
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,600
Mexican cherry opal.

1793
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,720
Yeah, it was awesome.

1794
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,840
It's like everyone on Homeworld is like,

1795
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
what is a Mexican?

1796
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,960
What does your name mean?

1797
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,360
And I'm like, stop misgendering me.

1798
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,160
Even on Homeworld, they need to build the wall.

1799
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,800
Yeah, that's right.

1800
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,360
May I choose your favorite gem?

1801
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,320
I'm gonna find my old image.

1802
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,880
Where is my funny guy?

1803
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,440
Oh, you're your little, it's on my butt guy.

1804
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:12,840
Yeah.

1805
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,240
Right?

1806
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:13,720
Where is he?

1807
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:15,880
Oh, I don't think I have it.

1808
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,280
I mean, if you look at the PCP, Steven Universe,

1809
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,000
like we did edit them into the opening of that episode.

1810
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,720
We did.

1811
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,120
They are all there?

1812
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,520
Yeah.

1813
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,200
Here, I'll link for your pleasure, you know,

1814
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,320
which is people in this gem.

1815
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,280
Mexican cherry opal.

1816
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,720
Mexican, all right, thank you, thank you.

1817
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:27,960
Yep.

1818
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,640
They're all here.

1819
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,960
I mean, it was me, Jesse, Gib, Tom, and Ben.

1820
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,320
Why is it Mexican?

1821
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,600
Well, that's just the name of the opal,

1822
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,680
and it was so silly that I was like, well, that works.

1823
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,200
You know, it's funny.

1824
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:38,840
I'm laughing.

1825
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,560
Help me giggling.

1826
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,120
Yeah, I've had a good, I've had a good chuckle.

1827
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,720
Uh, oh, Mage can't hear us, but that's her problem.

1828
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,120
Where'd she go?

1829
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,640
I think she's just having audio issues.

1830
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,760
Oh, no.

1831
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,640
Fuck, and I'm...

1832
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,120
Well, I don't know.

1833
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,760
She'll, she can read, I mean, we're all doing the right thing

1834
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,400
in this call.

1835
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:55,960
Hopefully she can.

1836
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,560
You are, you are not the first person

1837
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,800
to make a Mexican cherry opal fan.

1838
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,200
What?

1839
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,920
A gem sona.

1840
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:01,640
Are you kidding me?

1841
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,840
Well, actually, actually, that's,

1842
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,760
I don't know if who's came first.

1843
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,560
I found one.

1844
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:06,840
Let me, let me see.

1845
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,480
This was January 10th, 2016,

1846
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,920
is when this episode came out.

1847
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:11,960
Okay, let's find out.

1848
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:12,840
Let's find out.

1849
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,920
I need to know so bad.

1850
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,280
See this one?

1851
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,960
Wait, there's several actually.

1852
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,080
What the fuck?

1853
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:19,960
What the fuck?

1854
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,640
Why would anyone else have such a retarded idea?

1855
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,960
Um, because they're fellow scholars,

1856
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,760
such as myself.

1857
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:28,120
All right.

1858
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,520
Oh, I heard you, Mage.

1859
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,560
What are you saying?

1860
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,040
Yeah, nothing.

1861
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,680
I couldn't hear you guys for a prolonged time.

1862
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:35,960
Yes.

1863
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:36,280
You missed.

1864
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,680
We would just talk about our gem sonas.

1865
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,040
Oh, I have a gem sona.

1866
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,080
I almost missed this.

1867
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:43,240
What is it?

1868
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,480
How do I find out when a tumblr post was made?

1869
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,080
Is there no date on the post?

1870
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,040
Oh, wait, this was,

1871
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,520
this was July 23rd, 2017.

1872
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,000
Ha, I win.

1873
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,800
It looks like you beat,

1874
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,160
looks like, yeah, okay, okay.

1875
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:53,960
Yep, yep, yep.

1876
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,800
Okay, what's the contest for?

1877
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,160
I'm looking, I'm looking at other people

1878
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,880
that have made Mexican cherry opal gem sonas.

1879
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:02,920
As was mine.

1880
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,040
Whether Bestie Boyz here was the first.

1881
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,040
Can I see Mexican cherry opal?

1882
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,240
Can you say it?

1883
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,160
Can you, can I see it?

1884
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,160
Oh, if you click the piece,

1885
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,360
the Steven Universe,

1886
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,880
just click play on that in the main chat.

1887
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,880
It's like, he's the first guy that shows up.

1888
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,240
We all made gem sonas for that episode.

1889
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,400
Remember when I used to make like effort

1890
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,160
in like the openings of these episodes?

1891
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,680
Yeah, no more, no more of that.

1892
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,400
This is, this is July 23rd, 2017.

1893
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,000
I'm still in the lead.

1894
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,040
No one can beat me.

1895
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,880
I mean, Jesse had a tiger's eye.

1896
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,240
I would bet there's some tiger's eye

1897
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,280
that go back a ways.

1898
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,840
Tiger's eye, tiger's eye is canon in the show now.

1899
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1900
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,600
Oh, fuck, that's right.

1901
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,600
Fismith said it, yeah.

1902
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,920
Isn't that like an actual crystal gem,

1903
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,880
tiger's eye or whatever?

1904
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,120
It was like one of their friends or something, right?

1905
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:50,600
Apparently it sounded like it.

1906
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,720
That's what they said, what's her name was saying,

1907
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,320
but like, yeah, that was like one of their buddies.

1908
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,080
So this monstrosity is in fact canon as fuck.

1909
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,600
This misshapen freak.

1910
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,280
This is actually the corrupted version,

1911
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,240
canonically, of tiger's eye.

1912
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,680
It looks like Jesse's OC.

1913
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:09,560
Well, this one, this one says it was one year ago.

1914
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,960
So I don't know if that might be rounding down.

1915
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,320
So this one, I can't tell.

1916
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:13,800
Okay.

1917
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,280
But it's really bad and seems to be colored with colored pencils.

1918
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,560
Oh, well discussed.

1919
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,760
Disregarded.

1920
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:21,960
Anyone who's interested, please Google Mexican Cherry Opal.

1921
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,840
Yeah, let us know.

1922
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,240
Mexican Cherry Opal and actually a disproportionate amount

1923
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,240
of the results are in fact gemstones.

1924
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,040
What, are you kidding?

1925
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,240
Oh, I'm going to Google this shit now.

1926
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,760
We're getting lost over here.

1927
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,200
Pretty shocked actually.

1928
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,720
You know, this is a rabbit hole, I'm glad.

1929
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,120
There actually are quite a few.

1930
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:40,840
This is shocking.

1931
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,520
Well, I see just some normal Cherry Opals as well.

1932
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,360
In fact, I see way more Cherry Opals.

1933
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,600
That's true.

1934
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,080
That's true.

1935
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,160
Okay.

1936
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,440
Oh my God, this one has a gun.

1937
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:50,840
Whoa.

1938
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,280
This one just has a gun.

1939
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:54,680
All right.

1940
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,000
All right.

1941
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,160
This is not good podcast content.

1942
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:57,640
Let's see.

1943
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,200
What is it?

1944
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,440
There's, they can't see the images.

1945
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,040
Fine.

1946
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,000
Let's fucking Google it.

1947
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,200
Yeah, just Google.

1948
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,200
Everyone, kids, kids at home.

1949
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,120
I mean, I don't even know what more I have to say

1950
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,400
on Steven Universe at the moment.

1951
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,600
No, these are really good.

1952
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,440
No, these are actually really good.

1953
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,760
I mean, please edit them in someone, I guess.

1954
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,360
I don't know.

1955
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:19,560
I guess that's the thing to do.

1956
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:19,720
No.

1957
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,520
Google it at home.

1958
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:20,760
Okay.

1959
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,320
Just Google it and just experience what I'm experiencing.

1960
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,120
Yeah, do that.

1961
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:24,760
Do that.

1962
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,160
Okay.

1963
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:25,400
All right.

1964
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:25,880
I'll shut up.

1965
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,240
Who's got anything else to say about Steven Universe?

1966
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,400
I mean, I forgot my feelings out there.

1967
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:40,440
I really liked, I really liked the one where Ruby was a cowboy

1968
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,840
and I liked the fight at the end.

1969
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,360
Huh?

1970
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:45,000
I'm sorry.

1971
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,440
I think my engine has been weird at 3 a.m. in the morning.

1972
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,040
Oh, yeah.

1973
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,240
Well, I liked, I really liked the cowboy episode.

1974
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,360
I liked the fight at the end.

1975
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:01,000
My overall feelings about this bomb were, it was all right.

1976
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,480
I liked it.

1977
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,400
I'm invested again.

1978
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,920
I'm cautiously optimistic because I'm almost certain

1979
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:10,360
that the next bomb is going to not be this good.

1980
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,680
It's going to be meandering again.

1981
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:17,640
I mean, the hook that the gems are like, they know now.

1982
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:21,240
Like everyone knows, it's pretty neat.

1983
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,200
And I'm interested to see what, I am interested to see what happens next.

1984
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,040
I am also interested to see what happens.

1985
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,000
It does kind of feel like we're reaching like the end of the storyline.

1986
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,800
I hope we are.

1987
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,640
I pray and I know that we are.

1988
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,720
I really hope that the next season is the last one

1989
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,480
of the tie up all the loosens.

1990
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:36,760
I like that.

1991
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,600
Frankly, they've answered every question except I just want to know

1992
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,360
who's white diamond and where does like gem society in general come from.

1993
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,640
But even that, I don't really care.

1994
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,120
I also want to know who the pink hair girl is.

1995
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,720
The pink hair girl.

1996
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:50,520
I don't, I don't care.

1997
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,480
Well, she's just a girl.

1998
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:52,200
She's just some.

1999
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,240
I mean, well, they introduced her and then like they whisked her away.

2000
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,320
I want to see something with her.

2001
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,680
Well, all right, fair enough.

2002
01:33:58,680 --> 01:33:59,880
I would like to see her again.

2003
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:00,840
Yeah, I do want to see her again.

2004
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,960
I want, I want Pearl to smash.

2005
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,600
Yeah, didn't she like give her number to Pearl or something?

2006
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,240
And Pearl has been steadily learning how to use a phone.

2007
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,920
I think that a fucking Pearl and Kevin love triangle sounds like great.

2008
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,160
The kind of filler episode that I totally want to watch.

2009
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:19,960
I'd like that.

2010
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,760
Because some of the, some of the Steven Universe filler is good.

2011
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,720
And I like it.

2012
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:28,840
Some of it is, but, you know, onion, get, get, get at it.

2013
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,320
The filler's biggest problem isn't even that it's bad.

2014
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,920
Well, I was going to say the reason the problem with Steven Universe filler is

2015
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,360
even that it's usually bad.

2016
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,800
It's just that it's usually like we're in the middle of this really interesting plot arc,

2017
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,000
but we're going to put it on pause for like the rest of the week.

2018
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,840
And then you're not going to know how it turns out for another like month and a half.

2019
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,080
The week for the rest of the six months.

2020
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:51,960
You have a Steven bomb.

2021
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:52,440
Right.

2022
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:52,920
Exactly.

2023
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,720
And it's like a string of episodes you don't care about.

2024
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,600
And then something right at the end.

2025
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,480
That's why it's so inferior.

2026
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,160
With like a weird new thing.

2027
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,920
And I'm like, well, fuck you.

2028
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,360
Remember that episode where, am I wrong about this?

2029
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,680
Where Sadie, Lars and Steven get trapped on an island and then Sadie,

2030
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:11,800
the angel herself, like just doesn't tell them how to get home.

2031
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,160
Remember that?

2032
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,880
That does happen.

2033
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,600
Why is she like good?

2034
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,200
Like she did, that's fucked up.

2035
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,560
Why are we like okay with that?

2036
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,200
She did that.

2037
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,960
Because of her feeling.

2038
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,040
She literally kidnapped two people.

2039
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,800
She kidnapped them is what she did.

2040
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,880
Because women get away with everything.

2041
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:30,200
Come on.

2042
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,280
Well, I guess so.

2043
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,960
She was she was upset.

2044
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,760
She was upset.

2045
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,120
So everything is justified.

2046
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,360
Okay, guys, this is this is hilarious.

2047
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,640
A double standard kind of.

2048
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,920
I mean, it's not about the same people.

2049
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,200
But like recently I was watching TV like a pub.

2050
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,320
And I saw we bear bears episode where like there were two people

2051
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,840
stranded on an island.

2052
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,320
And you know, the little bears washed up.

2053
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,840
They were children at that time.

2054
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,040
And like the two people was a guy and a girl.

2055
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:01,160
And the guy he had like provisions and like a raft and stuff hidden from her.

2056
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,360
A way to escape.

2057
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,680
And he was vilified in the episode.

2058
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,320
Poor hiding.

2059
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,280
As he should be.

2060
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,480
As she should be.

2061
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:09,880
As should Sadie for being a bad person.

2062
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,600
The reason he hid it because he liked the girl and he was like,

2063
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,080
Oh, we're going to.

2064
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,600
That's literal rate mage.

2065
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,720
That's literally rape.

2066
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,080
I was like, I'm going to reveal it as soon as she falls in love with me.

2067
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,080
And it's like, I don't remember the episode with Sadie and Lars, but wasn't like.

2068
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,520
That is pretty much the same thing.

2069
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,000
It's not too dissimilar.

2070
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,640
Yeah, I guess.

2071
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,640
She she just love being falling in love.

2072
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,120
It's like, like she was enjoying him to a pilot.

2073
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,480
Was she waiting for him to apologize?

2074
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,040
No, no, no, no.

2075
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:39,640
She was just enjoying being trapped in a place with the guy she's into.

2076
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,400
And so she was like, that's it.

2077
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,280
That's all it was.

2078
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,720
It's like the same shit.

2079
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,520
And when he finds out he fucking flipped shit as he should.

2080
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,120
Not enough though.

2081
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,000
Not enough.

2082
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,960
It was all just because she was like, she was like feeling underappreciated or something.

2083
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,640
So yeah, that means okay to kidnap someone.

2084
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:59,560
That's why I like as like, it feels so good to know that like as a father,

2085
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:04,920
like when I have kids and like my wife gets custody once we inevitably divorce,

2086
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,800
when I go and just take them from the house, that'll be allowed.

2087
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:08,840
Like no one will stop me.

2088
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,480
That'll be great.

2089
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,600
I really look forward to this.

2090
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,760
I can see you defending yourself as you would.

2091
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:13,880
You would not hire a lawyer in court.

2092
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,480
I'll bring up this Steven Universe episode.

2093
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:15,800
Look.

2094
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:19,080
I'd like to admit Steven Universe into evidence, please.

2095
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:29,560
And then the judge will pull off her wig and reveal that she's got like a bright teal

2096
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,000
side cut like Tumblr do.

2097
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,080
No.

2098
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,560
And she like cased his smiths.

2099
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,000
It is in fact Rebecca Sugar, my judge and jury.

2100
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,800
Are we done?

2101
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,800
I feel like we're pretty exhausted here.

2102
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:46,120
I am extra exhausted.

2103
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,560
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

2104
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,800
I feel like we've really run Steven Universe into the grave.

2105
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,360
Well, hey, we didn't.

2106
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:56,680
Well, you didn't mention a mage's lovely OC over here.

2107
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,280
Spirit courts looking good.

2108
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:58,760
Looking good.

2109
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,320
I do want to mention that I am a little disappointed that Sadie's music career did

2110
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,200
not get brought up.

2111
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,520
That is a side plot that I'm kind of invested in.

2112
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,400
I, yeah.

2113
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,080
I mean, I'm interested to see where that goes.

2114
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:09,720
I don't think it'll go anywhere fast.

2115
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,480
It's going to be brought up again, I'm sure.

2116
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:19,800
There was a little bit where they showed like the people in the town reacting to something

2117
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,200
and you could see Sadie hanging out with everyone.

2118
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:22,840
That's good.

2119
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,160
And Mayor Dewey at the donut show.

2120
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,920
I'm glad that she has quit.

2121
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,120
I'm like that she's done that.

2122
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,480
I remembered.

2123
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:31,240
I just remembered something neat.

2124
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,800
And I don't know if this is true, but I'm pretty sure this is the deal.

2125
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,880
When Ruby writes her goodbye note, she's her name.

2126
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,720
Like she writes Ruby, but before Ruby, there's like a little crossed outfit.

2127
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,760
I think what that is is that she started to write Garnet.

2128
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,840
And then remember that she's not Garnet.

2129
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,000
Yeah.

2130
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:49,560
I think so.

2131
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:49,640
Yeah.

2132
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,760
And I thought, yeah.

2133
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:52,040
I paused and went back.

2134
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:56,600
I couldn't see a G. It just looked like a little scribble, but I was like, it's gotta be.

2135
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,080
It's gotta be.

2136
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,760
Perhaps she's just retarded.

2137
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,000
She just wanted to.

2138
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,360
She just doesn't know how to write.

2139
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:02,840
She just doesn't know words.

2140
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,480
No, no.

2141
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,480
It can't be.

2142
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:06,680
Mage, Mage.

2143
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,960
I have a quick query about your RC.

2144
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,000
Where is her gem?

2145
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,960
Is it her hairband?

2146
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,840
Is that what it is?

2147
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:13,320
No, no, no, no.

2148
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,040
Her thumbs.

2149
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,760
She is a fusion and both of her thumbs are her gems.

2150
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,400
Oh, I see.

2151
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:17,800
Okay.

2152
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:18,120
Okay.

2153
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:18,680
That's cool.

2154
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:19,560
That's cool.

2155
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,520
And also the eyebrows are actually a pair of tiny eyes.

2156
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,800
Oh, that's kind of cool, actually.

2157
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,280
I like that.

2158
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:26,520
Yeah.

2159
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:26,920
That's good.

2160
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,400
I like that.

2161
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,520
That's like, I don't know.

2162
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,520
They remind me of like Geisha eyebrows a little bit.

2163
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:31,320
Yeah, they're whatever.

2164
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:31,720
They're cool.

2165
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,280
They're cool.

2166
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:33,400
Geisha.

2167
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,520
You said it, sister.

2168
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,680
The rest of us already have those series from the last episode.

2169
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:39,880
Yes, Stibnite.

2170
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,360
Stibnite.

2171
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:41,800
Stibnite's good.

2172
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:45,880
Go watch that episode if you want to see those guys in an animated little intro at the beginning.

2173
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,320
I mean, it's not much, but it's something.

2174
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,280
All right.

2175
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,640
Well, I guess we're done.

2176
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,600
Anything else?

2177
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,320
Anything else?

2178
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,120
Steven Universe?

2179
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,320
Are we going on the questions?

2180
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:53,880
Is that what we do now?

2181
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,920
Well, before questions, we have an announcement, everybody.

2182
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:57,880
We have an announcement.

2183
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,760
Uh, so the fan art, I think, is the next thing.

2184
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:05,240
But due to massive backlash on all-

2185
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,040
On all sides, Ben.

2186
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:12,920
We've decided that it just doesn't really seem like we want to do fan art in the show.

2187
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,360
So we're we're planning to retire.

2188
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,200
It's it's weird to do it in an audio podcast.

2189
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,160
Yeah, yeah.

2190
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:24,600
We just want to keep, I guess, that stuff to, you know, at most a show note sort of thing.

2191
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,800
Well, we might feature it elsewhere.

2192
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,120
Yeah.

2193
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,240
I mean, I don't know.

2194
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,200
Let us know what you think.

2195
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:33,240
Well, we always feature fan art that is tweeted at us.

2196
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:33,640
Oh, yeah.

2197
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,280
We'll happily retweet them all day.

2198
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:36,840
Those are great.

2199
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:37,880
We love those.

2200
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:38,840
And here's your warning.

2201
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,040
So because you didn't have warning for this, what we're going to do is,

2202
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,080
like, this is your warning.

2203
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:46,360
Next time is the last one is what we're doing.

2204
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:49,560
So, you know, you got one more chance.

2205
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:51,320
If you still want to make something, feel free.

2206
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,040
It'll be in there.

2207
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,880
If you still want to make something yourself.

2208
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,920
I mean, yeah, you still got a chance to hit the spotlight.

2209
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:58,280
Maybe this will want to be a contender.

2210
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,560
Maybe this will drive up massive amounts of fan art because people know.

2211
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,520
Like, it's now or never.

2212
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:03,880
It's now or never.

2213
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,280
Yeah.

2214
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,240
We should do that every single time.

2215
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,640
That was the plan for the entire podcast.

2216
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,120
Yeah.

2217
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,000
That's what it'll be.

2218
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,240
So, oh, but speaking of which, let's go look at the fan

2219
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,800
chart of the week.

2220
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,040
All right.

2221
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:20,520
Everyone go to the fucking fan art thing over there, the fan chart thing.

2222
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:21,960
First one.

2223
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:24,760
First one is from at HH Minaj.

2224
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,160
It's me and Ben.

2225
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,480
Oh, yes.

2226
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,600
It's me and you.

2227
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,760
It's the bros.

2228
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,320
What does he say?

2229
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,400
He says, it's also ugly and best guy ever.

2230
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:36,360
Here are the two best brothers as the true best brothers.

2231
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:36,840
Yes.

2232
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:38,200
And that's clever wordplay.

2233
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,200
Wow.

2234
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,080
I want to do them rest in time, but procrastination doesn't let me do it.

2235
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,840
Hashtag max revive t-bat.

2236
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,960
I fucking love this.

2237
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:46,920
It's great.

2238
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:47,880
And a 10 out of 10.

2239
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:48,280
Yeah.

2240
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,440
Well, you're describing it for audio listeners.

2241
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:54,680
It's just me as Sanji from One Piece and Ben as Zorro.

2242
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,320
There you go.

2243
01:41:55,320 --> 01:42:00,440
Just works really good with my fucking hat because he wears, he wore a hat for a while.

2244
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,040
I didn't even notice the poobah on the sheath.

2245
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:04,760
On the sheath thing.

2246
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:08,760
Yes, the little poobah, I don't know what you would call it.

2247
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:09,240
Charm?

2248
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:09,800
I guess.

2249
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,280
Charm.

2250
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:10,520
Yeah.

2251
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,320
Katana Decoro.

2252
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:18,760
Massive problem, though, that seems like it'd be unwieldy as he's walking around

2253
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,120
because those things will jostle, that Charm will be flying off in no time.

2254
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:27,320
What I would have done is put a poobah hanging from his ear, or perhaps three poobahs, you know.

2255
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:29,320
That would be way too small to see.

2256
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,800
Well, you know, put a little microscope.

2257
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:34,200
My eyes, my eyes are so small and beady.

2258
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,160
I look so, I look so guarded and sinister.

2259
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,520
Just like in real life.

2260
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:38,840
Yeah.

2261
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,760
That's true, that's true.

2262
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,840
And I look very confident and proud.

2263
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:46,440
Quickly before we move on to the next fanart, I just quickly want to say thank you for the

2264
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:49,960
fanarts that were featured in the last episode that were for me.

2265
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:56,440
You guys did a bad job at saying that they were nice and I like them and they're good and thank you.

2266
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,560
Well, I'm not you, I'm not going to speak for me.

2267
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,680
Fair enough.

2268
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,160
Fair enough.

2269
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:06,200
Yeah, but you were like, I think it was bad, mostly like, oh, there it is, so there it goes.

2270
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:06,680
Sort of.

2271
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:12,520
Well, it was a little bit after I spent like five minutes like trying to scroll through the chat

2272
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:16,600
and looking at it, and then by the time I found it, I was in because it was a funny

2273
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,720
punchline that you had seen it before and is like, oh, whatever.

2274
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,800
Well, I did like the editing, but yeah.

2275
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,600
No, no, no, the first two.

2276
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,800
I didn't see that part yet.

2277
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:31,160
The first two images that you showed were of me and you dismissed them and I'm sad about it.

2278
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:32,440
They were nice.

2279
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:34,360
So thank you for me personally.

2280
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:35,720
I definitely saw them.

2281
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:36,600
And there you go.

2282
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:42,200
And then speaking of mage fanart, next from at the Wolf Art, my boy Edward D. Al.

2283
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:43,240
Edward D. Al.

2284
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:47,240
Look at this incredible Tsukabon mage.

2285
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,760
It is absolutely gorgeous.

2286
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,800
Super good.

2287
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,160
I love it so much.

2288
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:51,960
It's fantastic.

2289
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:55,400
The only thing that I think could have improved it

2290
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,080
was if it was a bat with nails in it instead of a katana.

2291
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,160
Well, no, it's Japanese though.

2292
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,040
It's Japanese.

2293
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,240
Yeah, he's going for a thing.

2294
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,040
That's what's going for a thing.

2295
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:09,000
There's nothing more quintessentially Japanese than a bat with nails in it.

2296
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,920
It's literally a thing, isn't it?

2297
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,360
I mean, it is.

2298
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,000
Okay, okay.

2299
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,120
But I mean, this is also a true.

2300
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,200
He's going for a slightly softer form of delinquent than that, I think, which is appropriate,

2301
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,400
which I love this.

2302
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,280
I love this.

2303
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:25,160
I really like the petals and the little thing with the leaf

2304
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:25,960
in her mouth.

2305
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,480
It's just all so good.

2306
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:29,400
Isn't that like, okay.

2307
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:32,680
I haven't seen Kill a Kill in a while, but it's sort of familiar.

2308
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,160
That is a school uniform.

2309
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,440
That is not a Kill a Kill.

2310
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,720
Yeah, but like, I think it doesn't look kind of like the middle school uniform.

2311
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,200
I guess.

2312
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:44,760
Yeah, it's just like because the red, it just, the thing, the red one, it kind of reminded me.

2313
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:48,520
It's the kind of school uniform that the Kill a Kill outfit is like.

2314
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:49,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2315
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:49,720
What it's called.

2316
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,040
Saifuku.

2317
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:50,520
Based on.

2318
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:51,800
It's the Saifuku.

2319
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,120
Okay.

2320
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:52,440
Right.

2321
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,600
Well, in any case.

2322
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,960
You know, I actually have, I actually have a couple of Shinae in my room right now.

2323
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,280
Whoa.

2324
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,320
Hey, remember, we actually have two.

2325
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,200
I actually have two of them, so I'm stronger.

2326
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:11,240
You should, you should put like five in each hand like Zoro did for Maximum Sword.

2327
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,080
And then hold six and six in my teeth.

2328
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,320
Yeah, like he did for Maximum Power.

2329
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:15,960
Makes sense.

2330
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,800
More swords is more power.

2331
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,840
That's literally his reasoning as a child, and I absolutely love it.

2332
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:22,200
All right.

2333
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,320
Well, this one's great.

2334
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:24,120
Moving on.

2335
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:24,680
Yeah.

2336
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:25,880
Edward D'Al is.

2337
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,520
He's a legend.

2338
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,200
I mean, this guy makes some high quality shit.

2339
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,640
He's done really great work before.

2340
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,200
For sure.

2341
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,240
It's fucking sick.

2342
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:32,120
All right, here we go.

2343
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,040
Kind Overlord at Kind Overlord.

2344
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:35,960
I mean, we got a, we got a gift here.

2345
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,840
We got a gift here.

2346
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,240
This guy did want, he did a gift of me earlier in the week, and then he, he busts out this,

2347
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:42,520
this, this classic piece.

2348
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,840
It's, it's the, the Radcon Arena.

2349
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,160
It's the Dark Souls of Arena Shooters.

2350
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:48,760
Radcon 3 IRL.

2351
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:51,160
Radcon 3 Arena IRL.

2352
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:53,000
This, this, yeah, this guy's killing it.

2353
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,080
I really like the lighting, lighting effect.

2354
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:57,880
Yeah, the lighting is nuts, the glow moving around and stuff.

2355
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,000
This is so fucking cool.

2356
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:04,440
Someone, someone, someone get this guy on a, someone get this guy on the art team of an indie game or

2357
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:04,760
something.

2358
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,000
Yeah.

2359
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,480
I don't know.

2360
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,280
Yeah.

2361
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:06,760
For sure.

2362
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,960
Like the whole gif looks like an indie game sort of title.

2363
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,520
That's true.

2364
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:10,760
Yeah.

2365
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,000
That's true.

2366
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:17,240
I, I particularly like, I think, uh, bottom left, uh, the hair.

2367
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,160
Like the, the, the lighting on the hair is like kind of bubbly like the hair, and it's like,

2368
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:23,400
yeah, that's, they, they, they thought about that.

2369
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,040
He puts the work of his.

2370
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,000
I like the little tiny, tiny strands of hair as well.

2371
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:28,200
Yeah.

2372
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:28,600
I know.

2373
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:29,400
Those are nice.

2374
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,520
Oh, a lot of detail.

2375
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:31,000
A lot of love.

2376
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:32,760
Pixel art's always great.

2377
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:35,320
All right.

2378
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,760
I mean, we got one of Munchie here.

2379
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,040
Should we just skip this Munchie one?

2380
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,240
I mean, it's just Munchie.

2381
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,120
I mean, I don't know.

2382
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,800
The guy's talking at the last episode.

2383
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,320
Frankly, I'm sick of the guy.

2384
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:47,640
Okay, no, but like, luckily, uh, there's a reflection in his, uh, glasses.

2385
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,320
It could be just, yeah.

2386
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:49,960
Like, like.

2387
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,920
Oh, well, yeah, okay.

2388
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:55,880
Is it potentially, now I'm not, I'm not too sure, but it could potentially be like the

2389
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,880
setting for Red Con 3, like the house.

2390
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,240
Okay, well, we might as well put this one.

2391
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,680
Robert J. Lazarus one.

2392
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:01,880
I mean, here, here it is.

2393
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:02,920
There's Munchie.

2394
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,360
So you can join the discussion now.

2395
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,280
I mean, I think that's an actual painting.

2396
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,400
So I'm, I think it's pretty.

2397
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,120
I mean, I love this.

2398
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,280
I think this is, I think maybe this is him at Red Con 2.

2399
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,600
So maybe the reflection is the, is the classroom.

2400
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,720
Oh, it's like the lecture.

2401
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,280
That can be.

2402
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,160
It might be.

2403
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:17,960
It might be.

2404
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,480
That's my best guess.

2405
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:19,800
Right.

2406
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:22,200
Well, feel free to clarify in the comments below.

2407
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,360
This is a pretty, this is a pretty fucking good painting.

2408
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,280
If that's like physical paints, like.

2409
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,280
Yeah, I can see the bumpiness of it.

2410
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:33,080
The, you know, capturing something like a reflective surface is pretty difficult.

2411
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:36,360
And the fact that I can instantly tell that those are like mirrored shades,

2412
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,360
reflecting a room is sick.

2413
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,640
I like the little sort of the shape.

2414
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:43,240
It has like a little bounce to it.

2415
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,720
It's not like a flat surface on the glasses.

2416
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,560
You can see the little bend.

2417
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,320
The reflection of glasses would do, it's really good.

2418
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:54,360
Yeah.

2419
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:54,680
All right.

2420
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,240
Next one.

2421
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,120
Here we go.

2422
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,520
Mr. Upload at XG Upload.

2423
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,000
I saw this on Twitter before.

2424
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,080
Yes.

2425
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:03,880
Oh no.

2426
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,440
Oh, it's a weed guy.

2427
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,160
Oh no.

2428
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:10,600
With his, with his, I mean, it does, it's not an Ava.

2429
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,800
It's a Gundam, I think.

2430
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:12,280
I mean, it's got that look.

2431
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,040
It's a G with his weed Gundam.

2432
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,800
Maybe this is a like G Gundam style.

2433
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,440
It's definitely, it has such a G Gundam vibe.

2434
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:19,640
Yeah.

2435
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:20,280
Yeah.

2436
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:20,760
Yeah.

2437
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,800
I mean, um.

2438
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,600
We Gundam.

2439
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,480
And the perspective of it is really interesting.

2440
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,920
See what I, one thing I appreciate about this is that in this,

2441
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:32,360
this clearly takes place in New Los Angeles city,

2442
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,520
AKA Neo Milwaukee, AKA the location of ratty focused cop killers.

2443
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,680
And Digi is clearly a killer in this image.

2444
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:39,880
I think you're right about that.

2445
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,400
Yeah.

2446
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,240
I mean, like the slime green bandana,

2447
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,760
just the whole, the whole aesthetic.

2448
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,640
I would have, the Gundam is purple.

2449
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,400
It doesn't get more rowdy fuckers than this.

2450
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,280
But he's purple.

2451
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,000
But the Gundam is purple.

2452
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,640
Exactly.

2453
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,600
And killers own, killers own the color purple.

2454
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:52,760
Oh, okay.

2455
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:53,560
We copyrighted it.

2456
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,760
Okay, well what about green?

2457
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,360
Well, that's just slime.

2458
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,960
Green is, green is fair use.

2459
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:58,920
Green is fair use.

2460
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,720
I mean, uh, you know, this isn't me, so I don't care.

2461
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,520
So moving on.

2462
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,800
I mean, yeah, sure.

2463
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,720
I just want to, just the perspective,

2464
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,960
like the, the attempt of the perspective is really neat.

2465
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,080
I think.

2466
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,440
The perspective is.

2467
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh, sorry.

2468
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,880
Yeah, I think there's a little bit of a mistake there,

2469
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:18,200
but I don't have the time to describe it.

2470
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,680
How so, but like still the, it's really good.

2471
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:25,240
I think that the perspective is maybe a little too intense,

2472
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,600
because I think that the robot ends up looking not that big.

2473
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:33,160
He only looks maybe about like 10 to 15 feet tall, I say.

2474
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:34,760
You ain't wrong.

2475
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,080
Which I think would be small for a Gundam.

2476
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,960
I think like, well, let's actually,

2477
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,360
Digi should probably be in between his legs.

2478
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:43,400
No, no, sort of.

2479
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:46,760
No.

2480
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,760
Yeah, I think the scale is a bit,

2481
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,480
the robot doesn't seem that big.

2482
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,400
It's just like the way the arms,

2483
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:01,880
especially the one closest to us, it's right hand,

2484
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,280
the way the fist is sort of looking at us.

2485
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,440
It implies, yeah, it implies sort of like,

2486
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,840
Digi should really be like under the mech,

2487
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,840
but it's also in front of it.

2488
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:13,560
So it's a little bit odd.

2489
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,440
It's possible that Digi is way closer to the camera

2490
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,880
than the mech, you know.

2491
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,400
But look, that's still an issue.

2492
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,800
Yeah, I agree.

2493
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:22,280
I agree.

2494
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,560
The perspective is a bit.

2495
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,400
We need something in the background,

2496
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,160
like give us perspective in some way.

2497
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,280
Well, no, no, no, no, we would like really ruin it a lot more

2498
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,720
if there was a background to just like-

2499
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,000
I just realized that,

2500
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:36,920
I just realized that the things coming out of his shoulders

2501
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,320
are blunt.

2502
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,360
They're blunt, yeah.

2503
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:38,840
Yeah.

2504
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:39,240
How do you feel about that?

2505
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,440
I was wondering about that.

2506
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,480
Yeah, I thought they were like bat wings, but no.

2507
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,480
You know what, maybe those blunts like open up

2508
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,880
into big like weed leave wings,

2509
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,920
and he can just soar like a gazelle of the sky.

2510
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,920
I think that maybe he like, maybe,

2511
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,040
maybe, okay, imagine this.

2512
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:58,120
He puts his wrists fold back and exposed to flamethrowers.

2513
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:58,680
Yeah, right.

2514
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,440
With which he lights the two blunts.

2515
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,840
Which he then like, he expands his chest cavity

2516
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,160
to breathe it in, to like smoke the blunts down to his shoulders.

2517
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,560
But they also serve as fuses for dynamite.

2518
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,360
A round of explosives in his arm.

2519
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:17,320
You know G Gundam, you know burning finger.

2520
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,080
This would be blazing finger.

2521
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:19,720
That's true.

2522
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,320
Blazing finger.

2523
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:24,920
Which so, just defeating his enemies in one fell swoop

2524
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,920
and getting him majorly out.

2525
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,360
All right, fair enough.

2526
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,800
No more of this, thank you.

2527
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,320
Okay, moving on.

2528
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:38,280
At a sleepy guy, we got a little sketch

2529
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:43,080
of child bestie boy me, young Nate in the fighting episode.

2530
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,600
Mom, I'm busy.

2531
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,280
What are you holding?

2532
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,920
I'm holding various sticks attached to my body.

2533
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,480
Oh, okay.

2534
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,440
And pine cones and grenades.

2535
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,560
Yeah, you know.

2536
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,320
Oh, yes, from the story.

2537
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:56,280
Yeah, from the story.

2538
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,520
This art style is cute as hell.

2539
01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:59,640
Yeah, way into the style.

2540
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:00,200
I love it.

2541
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:00,680
I love it.

2542
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:01,720
Yeah.

2543
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,440
It's super great.

2544
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:03,320
It's super great.

2545
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:05,240
Wait, what was the story about sticks?

2546
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:07,000
Oh, I mean, I just told about how like,

2547
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,800
I didn't want to go to summer camp and then like,

2548
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,480
like mom would come back at the end of the day

2549
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:14,840
and I came back like decked out with many sticks and like

2550
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,640
grenade pine cones as described by me in my belt.

2551
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,920
And I'm like, mom, go away.

2552
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,120
I'm in the middle of something now.

2553
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,480
I mean, we're in a war.

2554
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,280
We're in a war.

2555
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:23,000
We're in a war.

2556
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:23,720
You need to leave.

2557
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,120
Yeah.

2558
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,400
There will be casualties if you stick around and they will be you.

2559
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:34,600
So here is captured for all time in digital scans of physical media.

2560
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:36,840
Excellent.

2561
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,120
And that's it.

2562
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:38,680
And that's it.

2563
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,880
Pretty, pretty painless, right?

2564
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,320
Dear friends, pretty painless.

2565
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:41,720
All right.

2566
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:42,280
Here we go.

2567
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,480
Moving on.

2568
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,720
Oh man.

2569
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:46,360
That was pretty good.

2570
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,320
That might be the best one yet.

2571
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:47,720
I think so.

2572
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,680
I mean, that made you wise.

2573
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,200
I feel, I feel extremely pain.

2574
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:51,640
Me too.

2575
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:52,120
Me too.

2576
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,080
I sprained my ankle watching this fan out.

2577
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:57,480
All right.

2578
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,040
Here we go.

2579
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:58,760
Moving on.

2580
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,760
It's time for those PCP themes people.

2581
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:03,000
Hey, don't forget when you're hearing this,

2582
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,440
it's going to be around the fucking 13th.

2583
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,400
You've got one, two.

2584
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,600
Yeah, we're doing questions last, I think, right?

2585
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,480
Oh, okay.

2586
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:11,720
Yes.

2587
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,920
You got three weeks left people to enter into the goddamn PCP theme contest.

2588
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,640
Let's, let's see what you got.

2589
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,040
Full disclosure, I have not listened to any of these.

2590
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,720
So these are all going to be a surprise.

2591
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,880
I probably shouldn't tell you that because then I,

2592
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,640
you'll know that I don't screen these.

2593
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:30,280
But regardless, here we go.

2594
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:31,240
Here we go.

2595
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:32,200
With the first one.

2596
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,320
Oh, and this is by...

2597
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:33,800
Wait, wait, wait.

2598
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,600
What's the first one?

2599
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:35,080
Okay.

2600
01:53:35,080 --> 01:53:38,840
The first one is this is from at Moe entrepreneur.

2601
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,200
Listen to PCP.

2602
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,520
It's immaculate on SoundCloud.

2603
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:42,680
Okay.

2604
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,200
So it's called it's PCP.

2605
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,880
It's immaculate is the name of this.

2606
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:47,400
Or is immaculate.

2607
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,360
PCP is immaculate.

2608
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:48,600
Yeah.

2609
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,880
In weird brackets.

2610
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:50,120
All right.

2611
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:50,760
So here we go.

2612
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,760
Begin fucking now.

2613
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:58,520
No matches.

2614
01:53:58,520 --> 01:53:58,760
Okay.

2615
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:58,920
Sorry.

2616
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,800
Hang on.

2617
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,600
Wait, I can see you.

2618
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,040
Wait, are you, are you playing this?

2619
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:02,840
Will I be able to hear this?

2620
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,600
It's going to be pushed through the thing.

2621
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,080
Don't worry.

2622
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:05,400
Don't worry.

2623
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:05,960
Okay.

2624
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:06,200
Okay.

2625
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,240
That's why I'm a robot.

2626
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,200
I don't know why that didn't work.

2627
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:08,680
Hang on.

2628
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:09,080
Hang on.

2629
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:11,480
Fucking is this right?

2630
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:11,640
Okay.

2631
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:12,040
Here we go.

2632
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:12,360
Okay.

2633
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:15,960
Okay.

2634
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,960
Play now.

2635
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,080
Is it, is it posh?

2636
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:25,560
Yeah.

2637
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:25,640
It's going.

2638
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,680
It's starting.

2639
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,560
Oh, slow and sharp.

2640
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:30,200
Here it is.

2641
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:30,760
I can't hear.

2642
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:31,960
Turn up the volume on the button.

2643
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,600
It's playing too much.

2644
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:36,680
On the bot?

2645
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:38,440
The rhythm bot.

2646
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:39,320
Oh.

2647
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,280
That's a little better.

2648
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,640
Oh, that's ASMR.

2649
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,120
I hate it.

2650
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,520
He's just what he's wishing for.

2651
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,000
Shut up.

2652
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:54,680
Sorry.

2653
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,440
When's the drop?

2654
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,120
I feel like one's coming.

2655
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,800
I like how sinister it sounds.

2656
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:09,480
Yeah.

2657
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:14,040
Oh.

2658
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,480
Oh.

2659
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:15,800
Okay.

2660
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:17,560
Well, there you go.

2661
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,360
ASMR opening.

2662
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:27,320
I mean, I'm just surprised after all our talk of like trying to set a hype mood for the podcast.

2663
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,960
This was the approach you chose to go with.

2664
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:30,840
I mean, don't get me wrong.

2665
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,760
I couldn't hear like any of the words.

2666
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,640
I'm sorry to say.

2667
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:34,200
Hopefully.

2668
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:34,920
I couldn't.

2669
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:35,240
Yeah.

2670
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:36,120
Hopefully our viewers.

2671
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,680
He said he was whispering the PCP.

2672
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,280
Oh, it's immaculate or something.

2673
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:40,520
Yeah.

2674
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:41,400
I heard that.

2675
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,280
I heard that much.

2676
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:42,600
It's kind of funny.

2677
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:43,960
I love the music.

2678
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,520
I really don't like ASMR.

2679
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,160
I'm sorry.

2680
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:47,560
I don't.

2681
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,120
I don't.

2682
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,600
I just.

2683
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:50,440
There you go.

2684
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,880
It's got the main veto.

2685
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:54,600
Well, here's an idea.

2686
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,000
Maybe this, maybe we don't use this as the theme song,

2687
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,040
but maybe we just play this subtly in the background of every episode all the time

2688
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,240
to subliminally influence the audience.

2689
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:10,360
They are signing all rights to the usage of this song forever by submitting it to this contest,

2690
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:13,800
as agreed previously at some point.

2691
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,040
So, yeah, I mean, this is all ours for the taking.

2692
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,720
Thank you very much for giving it to us.

2693
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,840
Remember the ASMR bonus episode?

2694
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,200
Oh, I sure do.

2695
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,600
Who could forget our best episode ever?

2696
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,760
Um, fantastic.

2697
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:27,400
Fantastic.

2698
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:27,640
Okay.

2699
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,120
Here we go.

2700
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:28,440
Next one.

2701
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,240
Next one.

2702
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,960
This is from at Slam Rarn.

2703
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:32,600
And here it is.

2704
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:33,880
What's it say?

2705
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:34,600
Oh, Sixten.

2706
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:37,160
Hope Jess is okay with me reworking his melody.

2707
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:39,720
You can credit me as Sixten Machado,

2708
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:43,080
since Slam Rarn is unpronounceable.

2709
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:43,800
Well, I mean, he's not wrong.

2710
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,080
That's not that unpronounceable.

2711
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,320
Yeah.

2712
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:46,520
I figured it out.

2713
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,080
But here we go.

2714
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:51,960
Oh, and it's called, apparently, it's called Four Exposure Crastinator,

2715
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,760
as opposed to Procrastinator.

2716
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,320
Oh, I like that.

2717
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:56,600
Oh, I don't.

2718
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:56,840
Okay.

2719
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:57,400
Here we go.

2720
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:58,840
Impress me.

2721
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:27,720
I mean, well, that was pretty juicy.

2722
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:29,560
That was very juicy.

2723
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:31,960
But was that Jesse's melody?

2724
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:32,920
I couldn't even detect it.

2725
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,560
He probably like took the main melody and like,

2726
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,560
I don't know, did something with it.

2727
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,760
I mean, it didn't sound like it.

2728
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:43,080
I think you changed it to a point where you can't recognize it, which is-

2729
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,560
So I'm sure Jesse will not mind, as a matter of fact.

2730
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,920
Yeah, that was juicy as well.

2731
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:49,960
I mean, that was really good.

2732
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,000
That was really good.

2733
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:51,960
I liked a lot of that.

2734
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,880
It's pretty sick.

2735
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:54,120
I don't know.

2736
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:55,480
But it didn't have any-

2737
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,560
It didn't have any fucking jokes in it, though.

2738
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,480
Yeah, I mean, you're not wrong.

2739
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:00,840
I'm not laughing.

2740
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:01,160
Yeah.

2741
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,720
The only joke was your submission of that song.

2742
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,120
Got him.

2743
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,080
Yeah, I know.

2744
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:11,480
That's why I said it.

2745
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:11,960
Sixten?

2746
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:12,760
Oh, that was Sixten.

2747
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:15,320
Well, I mean, thanks for the submission.

2748
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:15,640
I don't know.

2749
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:19,080
I'm going to add that to my ones in my brain of ones to review

2750
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,600
as we get closer to the finale here.

2751
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,680
I will put that on the serious consideration list.

2752
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:25,160
Yeah.

2753
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:25,480
Yeah.

2754
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:27,320
Man, I don't even have a list for that.

2755
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,800
It hits the-

2756
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm going to make it later.

2757
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,200
I don't have a physical list.

2758
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:31,400
I mean, it hits the tone.

2759
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:32,200
The tone is exactly right.

2760
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,320
Yeah, the tone is really good.

2761
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:33,960
The tone is really good.

2762
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:34,920
The tone is exactly right.

2763
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:37,240
Like, if there had been a voice over it singing about like,

2764
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:39,160
memes, memes, memes,

2765
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:42,200
hand voice, memes, memes, you know?

2766
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,200
Cut that clip of that audience.

2767
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,280
Just remix that on top.

2768
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,320
Remix that on top.

2769
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:52,760
Just have Nate saying memes.

2770
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:53,480
PCP.

2771
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:53,960
Memes.

2772
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:54,360
Memes.

2773
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:54,840
PCP.

2774
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,040
And just shift it.

2775
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,480
Yeah, there's some more for you.

2776
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:58,920
I don't even-

2777
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,480
Yeah.

2778
01:58:59,480 --> 01:58:59,960
Yeah, okay.

2779
01:58:59,960 --> 01:59:00,520
That'll work.

2780
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:01,480
Some combination of that.

2781
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:01,800
All right.

2782
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,920
Well, let's move on to the next one.

2783
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:03,960
Okay, here we go.

2784
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:08,600
This is at Alex with lots of A's and S's.

2785
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,880
Just listened to the recent episode,

2786
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,880
so here's a cover of Jesse's song.

2787
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,840
But with Eurobeat Sense and some PCP fan art

2788
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,600
for our boy, the PCP guy,

2789
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,800
having a good drift.

2790
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,040
Okay, so make sure this fan art's on screen

2791
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,240
because it's actually fucking dope.

2792
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:23,000
Do you guys see this?

2793
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:23,160
Can you-

2794
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:23,240
Yeah.

2795
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:24,280
Are you seeing this in the-

2796
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:24,920
Oh.

2797
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,040
In the PCB Themes channel?

2798
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:26,920
Oh, I'm seeing it.

2799
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:27,160
Oh, I'm seeing it.

2800
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:28,600
He's drifting like a motherfucker.

2801
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:31,880
He's Tokyo drifting everywhere.

2802
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:33,080
That looks fucking incredible.

2803
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,120
It looks fucking incredible.

2804
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:38,360
Max revived the PCP guy right now.

2805
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:40,440
All right, but let's play this.

2806
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:41,000
Here we go.

2807
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,440
I want to hear this tasty jam.

2808
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:43,080
Okay, here we go.

2809
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:43,960
Oh, I gotta do this weird thing

2810
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,960
where I have to like paste the thing into-

2811
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:47,800
Oh, it's on YouTube.

2812
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:48,360
Okay, hang on.

2813
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:51,320
And here I go.

2814
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:52,360
Play now.

2815
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:58,120
Oh, okay.

2816
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:04,520
Yeah.

2817
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:33,000
Oh, I like those sinks.

2818
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,640
Yeah, that's nice.

2819
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,120
It's nice.

2820
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:34,520
Yeah, yeah.

2821
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:53,320
I mean, can we use that?

2822
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,160
Well, the very end of that is like really good.

2823
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,600
Yeah, I really like the end.

2824
02:00:56,600 --> 02:01:00,120
Can we use that for our episode on the 80s?

2825
02:01:00,120 --> 02:01:01,080
Can we do that?

2826
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,880
I mean, all right, I guess the 90s, all right.

2827
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:04,520
I don't know.

2828
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,440
Anyway, that was really good.

2829
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:07,960
That was pretty tasty.

2830
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:08,120
Yeah.

2831
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,080
I really like the synth.

2832
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:10,200
It was pretty tasty.

2833
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,160
I mean, I like a lot of that.

2834
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:13,080
I really like, as soon as the synths kicked in.

2835
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:17,480
Is it cheap to use one that's just basically

2836
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,880
a synth remix of the old one?

2837
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,040
Not if it's good.

2838
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,760
Is that an anticlimactic conclusion?

2839
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:28,680
I would say that, okay, for me, it is.

2840
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,120
For me, it would be anticlimactic,

2841
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:33,400
which is why this would probably not be my choice.

2842
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,720
I would rather get something new.

2843
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:37,160
I have to admit it.

2844
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:37,320
Yeah.

2845
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:37,960
I have to admit it.

2846
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:41,880
Also, that was a little bit like more downbeat.

2847
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:45,480
You know, if that's the right word, you know, what I'm thinking of?

2848
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,320
Yeah, yeah, it was kind of chill.

2849
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:49,560
You know, these are all, these are my thoughts.

2850
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:56,920
Maybe not worth of a theme, but generally, I really like the sound of it.

2851
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,280
Yeah, I mean, I really liked it.

2852
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,000
I loved it so much.

2853
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:06,840
I wasn't much into the vocals, but I like the synths when they kicked in.

2854
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,440
Like the very end, when I did the,

2855
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:11,080
but in the synth.

2856
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:11,720
Yeah, that sounds great.

2857
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:12,760
But it was fading out.

2858
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:18,760
If you could like send me like a version that is just that without the fading out bit.

2859
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:19,560
Yeah, do it, Doug.

2860
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,240
So I can, so I can max gain it and put it on loop.

2861
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,560
By the way, you did some good work, person.

2862
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,680
Click on the main chat and look at like the way that the thing looks.

2863
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:30,600
Like this is like the image that went with it.

2864
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:32,280
It looks fucking sick.

2865
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,520
I've got a solution.

2866
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,800
I've got a solution to this whole quagmire.

2867
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,360
What if, okay, like we end, we end the contest, you know,

2868
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:48,600
we pick a winner and all that, what if, what if we, you know, aside from naming a winner,

2869
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:57,800
we, uh, we just take all like our favorites and just have them be outros like whenever we want

2870
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,760
this, or at least once, just do them in sequence.

2871
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:06,360
And then like, what if just like forever after, like anyone that wants to submit like a song,

2872
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:10,520
like if we listen to it and we like it, we can put it in the rotation and we can just,

2873
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:13,800
we can just close out episodes with like different people's songs all the time.

2874
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,120
I gotta tell you, I sure don't hate that idea.

2875
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:18,680
Say it, say it, fam.

2876
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:21,800
I'm interested in hearing what the fans think about that idea.

2877
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:24,600
Like, like, yeah, like what if it was just a continuous thing?

2878
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:28,520
Like, you know, you make a PCP fan song, we fucking play it as the outro to the episode.

2879
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:30,280
That sounds like a pretty good idea.

2880
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:31,960
Sounds like a pretty, I know.

2881
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:37,160
I personally, I mean, as is the purpose for this entire contest, I'm way into the idea of

2882
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:40,120
having a theme song that is the theme song.

2883
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,200
But for the outros, I'm way into that.

2884
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,160
I'm way into that.

2885
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:43,400
Yeah.

2886
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:47,080
All right, well, you know, keep talking about it.

2887
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:48,280
Let's, let's get to the next one here.

2888
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:50,680
This is from at Eric Seabase.

2889
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:56,440
This is his second submission and it's called, I believe it's called crazy.o or crazy.zero,

2890
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:57,000
one of the two.

2891
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:01,160
And it goes a little something like this.

2892
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:07,880
Oh, that bass.

2893
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:09,960
I can't say no to the beat.

2894
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,800
I can't say no to the beat.

2895
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:20,840
Yeah.

2896
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:21,320
Yeah.

2897
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,840
Oh, well, that is so good.

2898
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:31,240
That was just, that was just irresistible.

2899
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,120
Yeah, I love it.

2900
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:33,080
I love it so much.

2901
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:33,880
Oh my god.

2902
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:34,280
Yeah.

2903
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:36,440
Oh, it's like vaguely reminiscent.

2904
02:04:36,440 --> 02:04:40,200
I'm not saying it's copying, but vaguely reminiscent of that style of like,

2905
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:41,240
you guys know the song?

2906
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:43,560
Oh, now I forgot it.

2907
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:44,200
I just knew it.

2908
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:45,720
I'm so excited.

2909
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,360
I forgot everything.

2910
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:47,960
Darude sandstorm.

2911
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:50,760
It's a little long.

2912
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,520
It's a little longer than I would prefer.

2913
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,560
You were made for loving me.

2914
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:54,360
Yeah, that song.

2915
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:54,840
I don't know that one.

2916
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:55,880
Sort of like the beginning.

2917
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:56,520
I know that one.

2918
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:56,680
Yeah.

2919
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,800
It's a very old song.

2920
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,600
The beginning.

2921
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:01,000
Well, you know, man, I mean, if it's too long is the problem.

2922
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,840
We can't always like fade it out sooner.

2923
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:05,160
You know, I, that's not major.

2924
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:05,720
That's true.

2925
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:06,840
That's true.

2926
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:11,000
I mean, yeah, again, that's another one that hits the tone.

2927
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,200
Yeah, it really does.

2928
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:17,080
Right on, right, right where I'm looking, right where I'm looking at, Boyo.

2929
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:17,800
That's a good one.

2930
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,280
So good.

2931
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:21,160
Next song.

2932
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:21,880
What do you think, Gib?

2933
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:22,440
What do you think?

2934
02:05:24,040 --> 02:05:25,640
Oh, yeah, I liked it.

2935
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,920
It was very well produced.

2936
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,720
Yeah.

2937
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:31,800
I think it was this like a better version of the one he already made.

2938
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:32,280
It might have been.

2939
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:32,920
It sounded familiar.

2940
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:33,480
It might have been.

2941
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:34,840
This is a second submission.

2942
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:35,960
Yeah, I was going to say.

2943
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:36,280
You know what?

2944
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:38,440
Let me check his SoundCloud real quick.

2945
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:41,720
Oh, well, if it's a remake, then I take back everything.

2946
02:05:41,720 --> 02:05:42,600
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2947
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:43,400
He, you know what?

2948
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:44,840
He made one called Crazy.

2949
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:48,680
Oh, that is very similar, but not exactly the same.

2950
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:49,160
Yep.

2951
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:50,040
Yep, yep, yep.

2952
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,240
Throw him in the garbage.

2953
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,120
No, wait, no, this is another level.

2954
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:52,840
He's improving on his work.

2955
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,520
Destroy him.

2956
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:54,840
Ben.

2957
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,320
Mining his old work for new content.

2958
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,120
Kill him.

2959
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:02,200
Oh, he's improving on his work.

2960
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:05,080
Second drafts for checkers.

2961
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:07,000
You want to listen to his previous one just for comparison sake?

2962
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,120
Improving on his work.

2963
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,600
Yes, I do.

2964
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:11,480
You mean he wasn't as good as, you mean that he didn't have 10,

2965
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:12,600
he wasn't born with it?

2966
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,160
I know, that's offensive.

2967
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:13,640
Fuck.

2968
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:16,120
Yo, let's listen to his old one just for comparison sake,

2969
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:16,760
just for fun.

2970
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,360
Okay, here, here.

2971
02:06:19,560 --> 02:06:19,800
Go.

2972
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,920
Yeah, I remember this one.

2973
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,840
Okay, there was voices in it.

2974
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,680
I kind of like this part of it.

2975
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:40,040
Yeah, I miss this part of the other one.

2976
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:41,320
The other one doesn't have.

2977
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,160
And I like that one too.

2978
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:50,360
I kind of like that one.

2979
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
There's things I like about both of them, I guess.

2980
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:56,920
This guy, this dude, I like his style.

2981
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,800
This was the one, this, it was the super basic,

2982
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,720
was the newest first guy, the super basic.

2983
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:05,080
I mean, I really like, I really like the vocals and the haas.

2984
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:05,800
Yeah, I see.

2985
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:07,160
But I also, but I also really like the super basic.

2986
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:08,760
I mean, his name is Eric C. Bass.

2987
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:11,000
So of course, his bass is true, must be true.

2988
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,480
Oh, no.

2989
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:12,520
Hey, you know what I'll say, Eric?

2990
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:13,960
He's C. Bass, he plays.

2991
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:15,320
I think you have a winner here.

2992
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:18,920
If you make two changes, one, in some way add back those ooze

2993
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:20,360
and aahs because they're cool.

2994
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:23,960
And in two, put some sort of spoken word intro

2995
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:27,800
that is good in some way at like during the bass or something.

2996
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,440
You know, here's my thought about words.

2997
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:31,160
Yeah.

2998
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:36,440
Is that most people don't have like a good singing or like voice.

2999
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,080
And not to be mean or like,

3000
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,640
like, like if we have like words baked,

3001
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:44,840
I would just pay us to sing.

3002
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:45,880
Yeah, yeah.

3003
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:46,760
We're immaculate.

3004
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:51,400
It's, it's, it's not that we're better, but like, I don't know.

3005
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,400
The music is always like great.

3006
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,760
People are good at making the music,

3007
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,680
but not necessarily the singing.

3008
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:59,400
Yeah, I prefer the ones that don't have the things,

3009
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:02,120
unless it's like very funny.

3010
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:06,120
To me, making a music track like one of these is like

3011
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:10,280
very far beyond what I would know how to do.

3012
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:10,520
Yes.

3013
02:08:10,520 --> 02:08:14,280
I'm very, I'm very impressed and a little confused by all of these.

3014
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,120
That's how I always feel.

3015
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:17,960
Yep.

3016
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:20,440
You know, this is not my, this is not my wheelhouse.

3017
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:22,440
Well, all right.

3018
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:23,160
I mean, I don't know.

3019
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,160
Take that advice, do what the fuck you want with it.

3020
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,600
In the meantime.

3021
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,480
There's one more.

3022
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,680
Let's go to the next one.

3023
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:29,160
There's one more.

3024
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:29,640
There's one more.

3025
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:29,960
Yeah.

3026
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:30,920
Uh, let me see.

3027
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:34,360
This is from, uh, Doss Biggles at Doss Biggles.

3028
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:35,000
Oh, Doss Biggles.

3029
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,480
Yeah.

3030
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:38,440
A barrel roll violet intro cut.

3031
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:38,680
All right.

3032
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:39,160
Here we go.

3033
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:42,040
And a one and a two and a.

3034
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:45,400
Whoa.

3035
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,240
Oh, we're in the future.

3036
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,040
This is, this is like a glitchy Steven universe.

3037
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,440
He is.

3038
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:54,920
Whoa.

3039
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:04,440
Okay, it's fading out.

3040
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:05,240
That was neat.

3041
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:06,440
That was, that was.

3042
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:06,840
Wow.

3043
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:07,320
That was cool.

3044
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:10,040
Like today, today's submissions are just like killing it.

3045
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:12,600
I liked it and not necessarily maybe for the theme,

3046
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:14,920
but just overall that's like, that was amazing.

3047
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:15,160
Yeah.

3048
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,440
I was way into that too.

3049
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,880
That was really interesting.

3050
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,880
I was thinking, I've been playing some nuclear throne

3051
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:24,200
and that, that one brought me right to the crystal cave.

3052
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:25,000
Okay.

3053
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:27,640
I have, I have a small tiny question.

3054
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,160
If let's say I decide to do something for it,

3055
02:09:31,160 --> 02:09:32,760
for my channel, would that be okay?

3056
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:34,440
I guess you'd have to take it up.

3057
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,720
You'd have to ask, you know.

3058
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:35,960
Yeah.

3059
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:36,520
You know that.

3060
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,040
So ask him this guy.

3061
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,240
This is no guarantee.

3062
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:42,680
But I feel like you're your odds are good mage

3063
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:44,120
because in the description of the tweet,

3064
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,480
it says violets for life.

3065
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:48,520
I'm assuming that's a good sign.

3066
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,320
That's a good sign.

3067
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:50,440
I don't know.

3068
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:51,880
I don't want to make it.

3069
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,440
I wouldn't assume, but I'm saying

3070
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,640
the odds are good.

3071
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,440
We got his Twitter.

3072
02:09:56,440 --> 02:09:58,040
You know, you can tweet at him, whatever.

3073
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:58,360
All right.

3074
02:09:58,360 --> 02:09:59,080
Well, that's it.

3075
02:09:59,080 --> 02:09:59,560
That's all the...

3076
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,200
Tweeting your strangers.

3077
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:02,120
That's all.

3078
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:02,840
He's not a stranger.

3079
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:03,880
He's a violet for life.

3080
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:05,320
He's a violin violet for life.

3081
02:10:06,040 --> 02:10:08,200
Oh, also he says PS Play God Hand

3082
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,560
is his other note about the submission.

3083
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:11,800
So...

3084
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:14,360
No, I hate video games.

3085
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:15,560
Oh, no.

3086
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:15,880
Fair.

3087
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:17,000
All right.

3088
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,800
Well, that's done.

3089
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:18,600
That's done.

3090
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:18,920
All right.

3091
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,200
Let's go to the questions guys.

3092
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,400
We're all done with this shit.

3093
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:22,440
You got like three more weeks

3094
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:24,360
to get those, those themes in everybody.

3095
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:26,440
So, you know, get to it.

3096
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,800
I have a question.

3097
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:28,200
Oh, you do?

3098
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,320
Oh, that's good.

3099
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:29,800
What do you got?

3100
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:30,360
What do you got?

3101
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:32,280
It's by Chip Weisman.

3102
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,280
If you were all Sailor Scouts, like Sailor Moon,

3103
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,360
what celestial bodies would you represent?

3104
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:37,560
And why?

3105
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,800
That's great.

3106
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:42,840
Also note, not limited to moons slash planets.

3107
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,480
So...

3108
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,280
Okay, okay.

3109
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:47,480
Hold on, hold on.

3110
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,760
I'm trying to think of one that's good.

3111
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,360
I know exactly the one.

3112
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,120
Wait, what was the question?

3113
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:57,320
If you were a Sailor Scout, what sort of celestial body

3114
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:58,200
would you represent?

3115
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,280
I would represent the Pillars of Creation,

3116
02:11:00,280 --> 02:11:01,720
which is a nebula.

3117
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,120
All right.

3118
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:03,240
All right.

3119
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:03,720
All right.

3120
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:04,760
Settle it down, Ben.

3121
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:05,320
Settle it down over here.

3122
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:07,000
It's a fucking cool nebula.

3123
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,600
I want to be a cool nebula boy.

3124
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,160
Yeah, all right.

3125
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:09,640
All right.

3126
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:10,360
What is a nebula anyway?

3127
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,320
I'd be...

3128
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,200
No one knows.

3129
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,840
It's a cloud of fucking space gas.

3130
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,880
That's pretty gay.

3131
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:18,040
I was going to describe it as space gas.

3132
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:19,560
And I am actually right.

3133
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,360
That's what it is.

3134
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:21,720
Well, it does.

3135
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:22,120
Don't...

3136
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:23,000
Gas gas gas.

3137
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:23,720
Yeah.

3138
02:11:23,720 --> 02:11:25,960
Sometimes they congeal into suns.

3139
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:27,640
Gibba's saying something, right?

3140
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:28,440
What do you got?

3141
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:30,840
I don't know.

3142
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,480
What do I...

3143
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:32,680
What do you think I am?

3144
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:33,640
Planet World.

3145
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,280
You be a Sailor Moon.

3146
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,720
I don't think that one's taken yet.

3147
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:39,480
That's open for business.

3148
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,040
I have a...

3149
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,000
I'd be a Sailor...

3150
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,200
I'd be a pirate Moon.

3151
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:45,560
Look, you're a Sailor.

3152
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,360
Like, you just have the hat, you know, on a boat.

3153
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:48,920
Oh, yeah.

3154
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,120
You know, Sailor...

3155
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:50,840
I'm a pirate.

3156
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:51,880
I got...

3157
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,040
I got a space submarine.

3158
02:11:54,920 --> 02:12:00,120
I'm just going to Google cool ass celestial body.

3159
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:02,760
While you're googling, I would be Sailor Meteor

3160
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,920
because I want to destroy the planet.

3161
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:06,040
Whoa!

3162
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,160
Oh, there she goes.

3163
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,040
There she goes.

3164
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:11,320
On the other end of the spectrum, I would be Sailor Phobos,

3165
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,280
which is Mars Moon,

3166
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:13,720
because that's like on a trajectory

3167
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,880
to crash into something and destroy itself.

3168
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,360
And that's the...

3169
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:17,400
That's mine.

3170
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,440
Oh, damn.

3171
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,160
That's a good one.

3172
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:20,680
It is good, though.

3173
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:23,640
You know, I'll just go with Sailor Europa

3174
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:26,040
because it's the Moon where there might be life possibly

3175
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,160
orbiting around Jupiter,

3176
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:28,360
and that's pretty cool.

3177
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:28,840
I like that.

3178
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,880
I like Sun Europa.

3179
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:30,840
Sun...

3180
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,720
...Homely.

3181
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:32,280
European.

3182
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:35,480
Yeah?

3183
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,520
That was a joke.

3184
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:38,280
Fair enough.

3185
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:38,760
Fair enough.

3186
02:12:39,960 --> 02:12:41,160
One other question.

3187
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:42,200
I found it funny.

3188
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:44,120
Oh, Sailor Black Hole.

3189
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:44,920
Oh, that's a good one.

3190
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:46,840
Though super edgy.

3191
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,160
That's like if Shadow the Hedgehog were a Sailor Scout,

3192
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,760
he would definitely be Sailor White.

3193
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,360
No doubt.

3194
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,200
Also known as Ryuko Matori.

3195
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,080
Yeah, pretty much.

3196
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:56,360
Oh my god, you're absolutely right.

3197
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:57,720
She is Sailor Black Hole.

3198
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,840
Making Satsuki Sailor Sun?

3199
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:02,360
I guess.

3200
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:02,920
White Hole.

3201
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:03,160
Ooh.

3202
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:05,400
She's got a nice white hole,

3203
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:06,920
if you know what I'm talking about.

3204
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:08,520
What does that even mean?

3205
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:08,920
I don't know.

3206
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:11,880
All right, moving on.

3207
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,080
I guess I don't know what you mean.

3208
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,680
I don't know either.

3209
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,400
There's another thing.

3210
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:19,400
It just means it's well-lived, that's all.

3211
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:20,040
Yeah, okay.

3212
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:22,280
I'm just going to put out there.

3213
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:23,720
I'm talking bleached asshole.

3214
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,640
That's what I'm thinking is what, you know,

3215
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,520
just bringing it home.

3216
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:26,840
All right.

3217
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,960
Anyway, there you go.

3218
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:32,920
A quick question is like Batsling asks,

3219
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:35,080
how many mages does it take to screw in a lightbulb

3220
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:38,440
and has like four people with the emoji of shit?

3221
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:39,320
And I just thought it.

3222
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:42,200
Oh, no, mage.

3223
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,960
No, bad questions are banned.

3224
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,640
We're trying to elicit good questions.

3225
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,960
I see a pretty good question here on the Twitter,

3226
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,160
so this is going to be our pity question.

3227
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:51,800
By the way, Bats is one.

3228
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:52,840
One.

3229
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,320
There you go.

3230
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:58,760
By two Fry Mcguy, hashtag askpcp,

3231
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:01,720
have you guys ever been caught up in a fad or trend

3232
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:03,880
that you regret or are embarrassed about?

3233
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:05,400
Besides MLP, of course.

3234
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:07,000
That's funny.

3235
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,520
Well, I'm not embarrassed about that.

3236
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:09,880
That was very funny.

3237
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:12,440
Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way.

3238
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,040
I mean, I would never be embarrassed

3239
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:16,760
with that sweet T-Bap Patreon money

3240
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:19,000
rolling in week after week to this day.

3241
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,400
Proud ex-Brownie.

3242
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:23,080
Wait, no, no, never.

3243
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,600
I'm not ashamed or regretful.

3244
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,200
I never called myself a Brownie.

3245
02:14:26,200 --> 02:14:28,520
I'm just glad to put it behind me, I guess.

3246
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:31,480
Okay, well, aside from that.

3247
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,840
I mean, I was really into this movement

3248
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:34,840
called homosexuality for a while,

3249
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,880
but looking back on it may have been a poor choice.

3250
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,800
I was really big into Gamergate,

3251
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:42,040
and I think they made some good points in hindsight.

3252
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:43,000
That's a joke, by the way.

3253
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,200
It was not actually a Gamergate.

3254
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:45,080
Well, there you go.

3255
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:47,720
But I was into the Nazi party.

3256
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:51,080
It'd been World War II, we might have heard of it.

3257
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:52,280
Indeed.

3258
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:52,600
No.

3259
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:54,760
Anime.

3260
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:58,040
That was an embarrassing, terrible phase of my life.

3261
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,160
I liked anime.

3262
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:01,560
Liked video games for a little while,

3263
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:02,680
but that was a mistake.

3264
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:03,800
I guess I was...

3265
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:05,000
I don't know.

3266
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:06,760
I can't really think of anything.

3267
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:09,080
I mean, okay, I was just...

3268
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:09,720
Oh, sorry, sorry.

3269
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,080
No, here, go ahead.

3270
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:11,720
I'm stuck hanging.

3271
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:13,640
I was tweeting pictures.

3272
02:15:13,720 --> 02:15:15,160
I was at our parents' house,

3273
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:17,320
helping them get my shit out of there

3274
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:18,280
because they're moving.

3275
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:20,360
I tweeted some pictures of some of my old junk.

3276
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:22,840
I'm not really that...

3277
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:24,680
It probably should be embarrassed about it.

3278
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:26,440
Okay, some of it I don't think is that embarrassing,

3279
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:27,640
like my marble collection.

3280
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,080
Those are nice.

3281
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:29,720
Sure.

3282
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,880
But then some other stuff...

3283
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:34,120
Some of those are pretty cool, by the way.

3284
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:35,000
Got some lutses?

3285
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:35,400
Hell yeah.

3286
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:37,960
Hell yeah.

3287
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,720
Hell yeah.

3288
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:42,040
But then there's some other stuff

3289
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:44,040
that probably should be embarrassed about,

3290
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:47,320
like my collection of fucking goth jewelry from...

3291
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:48,520
Yeah, now we're talking.

3292
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:49,240
Now we're talking.

3293
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:51,640
Yeah, I got my sword with a dragon on it.

3294
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:52,760
Like, forget about it.

3295
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:57,240
And then Celtic Cross, fuck yeah.

3296
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:57,800
And the...

3297
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:01,160
Oh, and the big pile of fucking brightly colored,

3298
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:03,720
like many of them have like Japanese symbols on them,

3299
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,880
like nylon, Hawaiian...

3300
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,480
Oversized nylon, Hawaiian shirt.

3301
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:10,520
I had a bunch of those too, dude.

3302
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:11,480
Middles in high school.

3303
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:11,880
Yeah.

3304
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:12,440
Well, mostly Middles.

3305
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:13,800
That was my life in high school.

3306
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:14,680
I wore my shirt in high school as well.

3307
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:15,320
Yeah, yeah.

3308
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:16,360
Yep, yep.

3309
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:17,000
I was sad.

3310
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,200
I was sad to let them go,

3311
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:19,720
but I was like, I need...

3312
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:22,600
This needs to be in the past and stay there.

3313
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,720
Should have busted them out, dude.

3314
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:24,440
One more round.

3315
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:25,720
I had a...

3316
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:27,000
I almost wanted to.

3317
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:30,280
I had a phase myself.

3318
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,440
It was around the time where,

3319
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:33,880
like all these labels, like,

3320
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:35,640
oh, it's the golf prep,

3321
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:37,640
prep, emo, jock, yadda yadda,

3322
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:39,000
we're like hitting Lithuania.

3323
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,080
At least it was new to me,

3324
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,560
and my circle of friends, and whatnot.

3325
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:46,520
And, like, all the magazines that my friends bought,

3326
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:47,560
and I was too poor to buy,

3327
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,480
like, oh, they were talking about all these,

3328
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,400
you know, fashion, whatever.

3329
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:53,400
And, like, I sort of...

3330
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:54,520
For a short while,

3331
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,040
I considered myself golf,

3332
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:57,320
because I dressed in black.

3333
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:58,280
But, like...

3334
02:16:58,280 --> 02:16:59,080
Yeah!

3335
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,040
I wasn't...

3336
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,440
Like, it was, like, the fashion.

3337
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:03,880
After a while, I actually learned

3338
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:04,680
what a goth is,

3339
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,720
other than, like, you know,

3340
02:17:05,720 --> 02:17:07,480
it's not just dressing black.

3341
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:08,680
You know, there's a certain style

3342
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,440
of fashion and stuff like that.

3343
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:12,040
And after I learned it, it was like, oh,

3344
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,360
that's kind of silly.

3345
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:16,600
You know, I'm gonna be, like, a punk goth.

3346
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:20,600
Like, because, like, in those magazines and whatnot,

3347
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,640
it said, like, you know, like,

3348
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:22,840
a female goth had, like,

3349
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:24,760
all dresses or skirts, long skirts,

3350
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,600
and, you know, lots of makeup and whatnot.

3351
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:27,640
I was not about that.

3352
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:28,680
I liked dressing in black,

3353
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:29,480
and I was more, like,

3354
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,400
baggy trousers with, like,

3355
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,760
lots of pockets in them,

3356
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:36,440
and, like, a black shirt

3357
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,840
with an edgy-ass dragon on it.

3358
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:41,880
And, like, I dyed the tips of my hair red.

3359
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,800
I wanted a full black, but my mom didn't let me.

3360
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:44,600
Ooh, where do you go?

3361
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:47,240
I settled for the tips being red.

3362
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:49,640
This is after your feral period, right?

3363
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:50,680
Yeah.

3364
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:50,920
Yeah.

3365
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,480
I was in my teens.

3366
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:55,000
Like, I was a teen, a young teen,

3367
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,520
I think, 13 or so.

3368
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,440
And I also collected skulls.

3369
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:01,560
Well, rather, like, skull-related accessories.

3370
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:03,320
Oh, okay.

3371
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:04,760
I thought, like, like, literal things.

3372
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:07,000
I would go, I would punch through their eye-sock.

3373
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:08,760
So I'd see skulls out of their head.

3374
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:09,960
That I'd find in the streets.

3375
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:10,440
Yeah.

3376
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:13,080
That was the violent-violence finishing move.

3377
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,120
Yeah, exactly.

3378
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:16,120
At least I come back weeks later

3379
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:17,240
after some of my victims,

3380
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:19,000
after they've had time for the skin-to-blood off.

3381
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,920
Well, isn't it a Mortal Kombat finisher

3382
02:18:20,920 --> 02:18:22,680
where you rip the skull out of somebody's head?

3383
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:23,880
I think somebody has that.

3384
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:25,800
If Majors in Mortal Kombat,

3385
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:27,960
that would be her finishing move, for sure.

3386
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,560
Somebody mod Mortal Kombat 9

3387
02:18:29,560 --> 02:18:31,080
or whatever, get Majin there.

3388
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:32,520
Yeah, yeah, that'd be good.

3389
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:34,200
Take that, you know, there's that girl

3390
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:35,160
who already wears purple

3391
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:36,760
with the big, scary mouth, you know?

3392
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:38,760
Wouldn't be too hard, wouldn't be too hard.

3393
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:42,440
I was a, I was a goth.

3394
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:43,320
I was a big goth.

3395
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,120
Yeah.

3396
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:45,960
I had, I had all the things.

3397
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:48,680
The, the hair.

3398
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,960
The, the eyes, the things.

3399
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:57,160
Man, I was surely a goth back in the day.

3400
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,800
I wasn't a goth.

3401
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:00,680
I was boring.

3402
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,200
But I want people to draw me as a goth

3403
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:03,080
because it's really funny.

3404
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:05,000
That is really funny.

3405
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,840
Draw us all as goths, everybody.

3406
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,960
The most embarrassing, the,

3407
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:12,040
the most embarrassing thing about me

3408
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:15,800
is that I wasn't part of a stupid embarrassing thing

3409
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:17,400
and I don't have any funny stories.

3410
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:17,880
Oh, I know.

3411
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:21,400
I was just like kind, I've kind of shy and timid

3412
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:25,800
and I did as I was told and then school was over

3413
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:26,440
and I was like, oh.

3414
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,320
That's what I was like.

3415
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:29,640
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't have

3416
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:33,000
any funny silly things that I could look back on

3417
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
and be like, oh no cringe.

3418
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,320
Like I was just, I had brown hair and I didn't do anything.

3419
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:42,840
When I think about like my, what made me cringe as a youth,

3420
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:45,560
it was, it was like my attitude more than anything.

3421
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:49,720
Cause like, you know, like I liked like transformers

3422
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:51,240
and like, you know, like when I was like,

3423
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:53,080
when I was like eight or nine or something,

3424
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:54,360
I was really into like Power Rangers.

3425
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:56,120
I don't see anything to be embarrassed

3426
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:57,640
about being like a kindergartner

3427
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,400
who's into like Power Rangers or anything.

3428
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,080
And like I liked anime ever since I was like 10.

3429
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:04,760
I still do.

3430
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,520
So, you know, I mean, you know,

3431
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:09,240
you can be a mid-level ashamed about that just in general,

3432
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:12,520
but unironically, I'm just, I'm just not.

3433
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:14,280
So I'm totally over that.

3434
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:15,960
So I don't really know.

3435
02:20:15,960 --> 02:20:17,000
That sort of reminded me.

3436
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,360
I was a thing, I'm like, I'm not necessarily ashamed of now,

3437
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:21,720
but I used to be at that point.

3438
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:25,560
Like I was like, I know I was over eight years old

3439
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:27,000
and remember I was a tall boy.

3440
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,280
I used to really like coloring books

3441
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,600
and I was really embarrassed about buying coloring books

3442
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:36,360
at that age because I felt like I was too old

3443
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:39,880
or at least looked too old to buy coloring books for myself.

3444
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:40,200
So I was, I love it.

3445
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,400
That is so adorable.

3446
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:43,720
It's like, go to the store to buy coloring books

3447
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:45,640
for yourself to color in.

3448
02:20:45,640 --> 02:20:48,200
I would never, it's never crossed my mind

3449
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,960
that one would do such a thing,

3450
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,880
but that's super adorable.

3451
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:52,680
I love that.

3452
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:55,720
I mean, they have like legit coloring books that are like,

3453
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:56,200
you know.

3454
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,960
A type of coloring books I really liked.

3455
02:20:57,960 --> 02:20:59,560
There are adult coloring books, aren't they?

3456
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:00,200
Isn't that like a thing?

3457
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:01,240
Oh, but they're stupid.

3458
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:01,800
Yeah.

3459
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:02,280
Are they?

3460
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:02,680
Okay.

3461
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:03,160
All right.

3462
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:04,600
They're just like a bunch of shapes.

3463
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:07,400
Mage, did you color them all in purple?

3464
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:10,600
I was gonna say, like you would go from like the crayon box

3465
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:12,760
to the coloring pencil box to the markers

3466
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:14,200
and every purple color would be gone.

3467
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:17,240
You would get a whole thing of like 20 different colors,

3468
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:19,800
but you would throw them all away and keep the purple ones.

3469
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,800
My purple face started in my teen hood.

3470
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,960
No, like what I would buy,

3471
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,600
I did the favorite type of coloring books I used to like.

3472
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:29,400
Oh, they were like paper dolls and you could like put like,

3473
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:33,080
you cut them out like, and then there's clothes.

3474
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:35,880
You can cut them out and put them on them like for paper dolls,

3475
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:37,480
but you color them in yourself.

3476
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:41,000
And like, I was really into making paper dolls at that time.

3477
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,400
And like, I even made like Dragon Ball Z dolls.

3478
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:44,920
I remember I made one of the cheetahs.

3479
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:46,680
A who?

3480
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:47,640
A Vegeta.

3481
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:48,440
Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z.

3482
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,480
Oh, Vegeta.

3483
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:50,680
Dude, that's sick.

3484
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:51,000
Yeah.

3485
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,800
Like, uh, like me and my friends were like all about that

3486
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:56,840
making paper doll craze and we would make our own clothes

3487
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:58,360
and color them in and stuff like that.

3488
02:21:58,360 --> 02:22:00,920
And those paper dolls were like more official looking,

3489
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:03,000
of course, because, you know, we couldn't draw for shit.

3490
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,760
But it was real.

3491
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:05,560
It was real great.

3492
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:08,200
I was a big fan and it was embarrassing.

3493
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:11,160
Anybody else want to chime in on this?

3494
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:12,360
Or I got another question.

3495
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,000
I've got another question.

3496
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,480
Okay, yeah, go ahead.

3497
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:21,480
This is by Rugae in the progressionators lounge.

3498
02:22:21,480 --> 02:22:25,800
He says, let's say you want to have a specific character trait,

3499
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:26,280
traits.

3500
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:27,960
How do you do that?

3501
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,800
Do you force certain behavior in your everyday life or what?

3502
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,320
I thought this was really interesting because, like,

3503
02:22:35,320 --> 02:22:37,000
I have had similar thoughts.

3504
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:40,120
He's asking, like, if you want to be a certain way to have, like,

3505
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:46,040
to be a certain way in, like, normal life without trying,

3506
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:49,560
do you have to force it all the time and until it sticks?

3507
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:50,520
Yes.

3508
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:53,640
Because I've never managed to really do that.

3509
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,120
Yes, same.

3510
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:57,000
I think everything that is, like, accidental.

3511
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:01,320
The only time in my life I succeeded in this kind of a quest of

3512
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:05,160
consciously trying to change myself was with my, like,

3513
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:08,920
forcing myself to go out and, like, talk to girls in college.

3514
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:13,800
And I didn't even succeed anywhere near, like, the, like,

3515
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,320
the stuff I was, like, reading at the time about, like,

3516
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:18,040
how to be more, you know, social and stuff was, like, telling me to.

3517
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:23,720
But, like, it long-term manifested in a much larger degree of,

3518
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:26,840
like, willingness to, like, talk to people and, like,

3519
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:29,640
do things and, like, kind of take initiative in life.

3520
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:33,320
So even at the time, it wasn't, like, a huge change right then and there.

3521
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:37,560
But I did actively have to force myself to do things differently.

3522
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:42,920
And I do believe I changed majorly long-term as a result of taking those actions.

3523
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:47,720
I mean, I think if you force yourself, if you force yourself to

3524
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:53,960
regularly engage in a behavior that you were not, it, it, it will definitely have an effect.

3525
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:59,400
Okay, okay. Guys, I do agree with you, but I think it still takes a certain type of

3526
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:03,080
person to do that because for me personally, I had some personal experience with it.

3527
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:08,440
I tried forcing something and it's just, like, at some point I came to the conclusion,

3528
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:12,680
like, I was failing despite constantly trying, but at a certain point I came to the conclusion,

3529
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:19,000
like, like, I am trying this and I'm forcing myself to do this, but at what point am I living

3530
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,200
a lie because it was stressing me out and I know I'll never be this person that I'm trying to be

3531
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:29,480
despite all this attempts and, like, even if I was successful, then I'll have to go on being

3532
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:35,240
this person and I don't feel comfortable being this despite wanting to be this. So I stop.

3533
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:43,480
One is reminded of the adage of the oak tree that, that groweth tall and true.

3534
02:24:44,360 --> 02:24:49,800
And as it grows, you can shape it and kind of guide it along a certain path, but once it's

3535
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:55,560
grown too far, if you try to bend it in a certain way, as opposed to how it's already started to

3536
02:24:55,560 --> 02:25:00,920
grow, then it can bend to a degree, but eventually it will snap, or it could just not, you know,

3537
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:06,280
it just might not go that way. I think, like, certain things can be changed, for instance,

3538
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:12,040
like wanting to be able to speak more or speak up more or speak faster, something like those things.

3539
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:15,560
You can't definitely push yourself. Well, major, you're making this point about people or about

3540
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:20,920
yourself. And I know people. I mean, just general. I just, it's speaking because you were talking

3541
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:26,760
about how you're speaking to girls and stuff. Yeah. You know, you can force yourself to, you know,

3542
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:31,480
change certain things like that, but they're like. Because that was hell. That was absolute hell.

3543
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:36,760
Yeah, I mean, the change did happen eventually, some sort of, it did manifest in some way, but

3544
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:42,280
they're like some things that are more core to you, like core personality traits. Sure, I agree.

3545
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:48,680
I agree. That will, that linger to you. And it's like, maybe some people are managing to change it

3546
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:54,120
legitimately, but some people might end up living a lie. And you just have to notice, you know,

3547
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:58,040
which one are you? And at some point, and make the decision, do you want to keep living a lie,

3548
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:03,240
or do you just want to try and be yourself and see where that leads you? I agree. I agree.

3549
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:06,040
Anybody else?

3550
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:18,680
Trying to think, if I've ever, I mean, I feel like, I feel like I have done a lot of

3551
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:27,240
not doing that in the recent past, like a lot of like, meaning to like, oh, I'm gonna do this,

3552
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:31,880
I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna start being like that. And just, it's not, not even that it doesn't

3553
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:37,320
work. It doesn't, it's a total non-starter and doesn't happen. Yeah. That feels, that's, that's

3554
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:46,120
been, that's been my, that's been me for a long time now. I think certain people just tend to like

3555
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:53,000
be better doing things one at a time. Like, instead of regimenting their life in ways to,

3556
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:00,120
to improve it, they should just set up situ, like, set up situations where in the future,

3557
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:07,400
they know that they will likely do like, something in particular, like, I'm trying to think of an

3558
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:14,360
example, but like, instead of like, regimenting your diet, having someone else force you to like,

3559
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:20,520
or like, take, like, lock a certain cupboard so that you can't get something, and so you'll naturally

3560
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:28,040
do something else, like, to set up your life in a way that you do what you usually do, but in a

3561
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:33,240
way that benefits you rather than... That's kind of what I do. That's how I kind of get stuff done

3562
02:27:33,240 --> 02:27:39,640
with like deadlines, arbitrary, that are just like, like, for example, like today, I just promised

3563
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:44,840
my girlfriend, because I thought it would be helpful, and it is, that I would count all my

3564
02:27:44,840 --> 02:27:50,520
calories today. She doesn't care. She doesn't give a shit. But for some reason, when I promise

3565
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:55,640
someone that I will do something, it does get done. It's when I leave it kind of like, vague and up

3566
02:27:55,640 --> 02:28:00,040
in the air, like, yeah, like, I should definitely count my calories today. Then I just won't do it.

3567
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:06,440
And I, but you know, once I promise someone, it gets done, gets done. I don't know. So that's

3568
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:10,600
that kind of mechanism of tricking myself, kind of forcing myself to do it. But I just recognize

3569
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:17,160
that I need that. I think if I try, I think if I try to promise things to people, I will just

3570
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:18,920
avoid them.

3571
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:25,560
It will end up, well, yeah, well, I think I avoid making promises in the first place in,

3572
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:31,640
because I'm afraid that if I do mess up enough times, my promises will start to mean nothing.

3573
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,480
And then I can't do that anymore.

3574
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:35,000
That's kind of the motivating factor.

3575
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,320
That's the stakes. That's the stakes that keeps you from breaking said promise, right?

3576
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:39,880
Yeah.

3577
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:41,160
Or that's the idea anyway.

3578
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:43,160
For me, yeah.

3579
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:47,800
Because like, I could promise that I will make a video or something, but then

3580
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:53,960
I won't care about it at some point. And then I'm like, well, now I promised I would do it.

3581
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:56,360
I do it with stuff that's like, when's Rayman 2?

3582
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:56,760
Oh, no.

3583
02:28:56,760 --> 02:29:02,120
I do it with stuff like, like today, I promise I will go to the gym. Like, I've done that. And

3584
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:06,600
Michelle, like, doesn't give a shit. It's just, it's helpful for me. Once I've said I'm doing it,

3585
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:11,480
like, because this is something I want to do is not any more time than like, I wanted to spend

3586
02:29:11,560 --> 02:29:16,040
doing it anyway. And it's just like a regular thing. But it's just a helpful mental trick

3587
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:17,480
that I use on myself.

3588
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:22,200
Yeah. Like, people used to say like something similar, like back in school,

3589
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:24,760
like when people wanted to cheat and, you know, write down

3590
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:31,400
somewhere secretly, like the answers and stuff, like actually writing down those answers helps

3591
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:36,920
you memorize them. So it's just the power of like, you know, saying it out loud or writing it down

3592
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:41,320
is just like, makes it more official and it sticks with you a bit more than just thinking it.

3593
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:49,880
Sounds rice to me. I said, it sounds rice to me because I'm currently adding brown rice to my

3594
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:52,120
calorie calculator. Got them.

3595
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:57,880
What sort of calorie calculator do you have? Is it like a mine or something?

3596
02:29:57,880 --> 02:30:01,560
This is called, you can get on your phone. It's called My Fitness Pal. And there's also

3597
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:06,440
ones called Lose It and there's a bunch of them. But I like My Fitness Pal. And all it is, is it's

3598
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:10,200
just a thing. You can, you type in like how many calories you want to eat for that day. So like,

3599
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:13,560
that's, you know, you got to figure that out. But there's lots of tools to do that. And then you

3600
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:18,520
just, you go in and like, whenever you eat a food, you just pull up the like, the diary, the tracker

3601
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:22,920
and you type in, look, I had brown rice, chicken and broccoli for lunch today. So I'm typing in

3602
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:26,600
brown rice, going to add that, how much I had, like, I had like a cup and a half or something.

3603
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:32,680
That's like 150 calories chicken. It's like 200 calories and broccoli, you know, 20 calories,

3604
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:35,320
something like that. Sounds cool. I'll actually try it out because I need to.

3605
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:40,680
It is hugely helpful. Sounds. The issue with Lithuanian food, they don't actually list how

3606
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:45,560
many calories. Unlike in England that everything has, yeah, everything has listed how many calories

3607
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:50,360
the food has and like. Fuck them dog. Go outside the system and get this app. It's super helpful.

3608
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:58,360
Yeah. Everyone, someone called everyone Bobo asks, when is Ben going full homeless boy?

3609
02:30:58,360 --> 02:31:05,480
What a puss. What a, what a bust. What a, what a puss. Oh, what a puss. I don't know what he's

3610
02:31:05,480 --> 02:31:11,560
getting at. Never. I'm actually fucking iron. Could you have that confused with Tom, perhaps?

3611
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:17,480
I know. Maybe he's talking about me. I feel like maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Are you in, are you in,

3612
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:22,840
are you in Braintree? I'm in local homeless. Yeah, that's true. I'm probably leaving tomorrow.

3613
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:29,160
I think. That's what you said last week. Yeah. Things keep changing. I keep having to like,

3614
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:34,200
my orders that I keep ordering to get all the last stuff for the card keeps getting pushed

3615
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:40,280
back further and further. I'm like, oh, I guess not. Wait. Just be homeless, you coward. I know.

3616
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:44,840
Is the house, is the house actually, are you actually kicked out of the house or are you

3617
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:50,200
choosing? Like, are you just, are you staying until you get the car? Sounds like this is a downhill

3618
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:54,360
slope, but he's going to have to leave eventually or something, right? It's, it's, it's complicated.

3619
02:31:55,320 --> 02:32:00,200
Yeah. Well, fair enough. Okay. Okay. Hey, I got a question. I got a question here. It's a good one.

3620
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:09,160
Here it is. It's from Acid Biggie. And this is a deep one. Do you think the PCP is a good influence

3621
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:19,720
on people? No, no. I saw that. I think, I think podcasts in general are a waste of time. What

3622
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:24,280
if you do it? What if you do it while working out? That's true. That's true. What if you literally do

3623
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:29,320
it while working out? If you're doing while doing something else, yes, but a lot of people don't

3624
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:35,080
do that. Sure. Sure. I think that people are going to get whatever they're looking for out of it,

3625
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:41,080
you know, like, it's entertainment, like most entertainment is, is, you know, just, I think

3626
02:32:41,080 --> 02:32:45,960
we have our good and bad moments. Feels time and it's fun, but like, I wouldn't say we're changing

3627
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:52,600
people's lives in like, a profound way, except when they're depressed and they feel better. Like,

3628
02:32:52,600 --> 02:32:57,160
we're doing what entertainment is. Well, you know, one of my favorite things was this, this like fit

3629
02:32:57,160 --> 02:33:03,320
boy thing that we did recently with the fitness podcast and whatnot. And a bunch of people seem

3630
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:08,760
motivated. And even if they only tried it out a little bit, the handful of people who did that,

3631
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:13,240
I mean, it's pretty good. It's pretty good effect. Even if they just went for one job. Even if they

3632
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:17,880
went for one job, they now have the experience of what a jog is like under their belt, if they've

3633
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:23,000
never done it before, and they can build on that. You know, I think, you know, it's only one episode.

3634
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,560
I think that it is, I think that it is, you know, I think it's like, I think people are going to get

3635
02:33:29,560 --> 02:33:32,600
what they're going to get out of it. I pretty much agree with that. People are going to get what

3636
02:33:32,600 --> 02:33:38,520
they're looking for. Yeah. Like if you're an art guy and you listen to this for like inspiration to

3637
02:33:38,520 --> 02:33:46,280
do more art, then like that's what you're going to get. Am I making any fucking sense here?

3638
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:51,000
You are. You are. Like I think a lot of the people like, I don't know, would people who like, let's

3639
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,320
say, let's say just like an insane person who has like a crazy worldview is going to listen to this,

3640
02:33:57,320 --> 02:34:01,960
like what's more likely that they'll like be converted to like, ah, yes, rational discourse.

3641
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:06,520
Yes, everything's good. I mean, not that we even necessarily do that, but like if we did that,

3642
02:34:06,520 --> 02:34:09,560
versus, or they're just going to be like, well, I mean, I'm not going to listen to these guys.

3643
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:12,840
You know, I'm out. I'm going to go listen to whatever validates my opinion.

3644
02:34:14,600 --> 02:34:18,840
That's probably what's going to happen, you know, for the most part, but it's the people

3645
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:25,480
that you already got in your web that you can give positive messages to. Like our whole thing about

3646
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:31,880
school, we can be a little bit over the top about how evil school is, but I do think it's an actually

3647
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:37,960
good service to do to encourage people to be really critical of what they're going to get out of like

3648
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:44,040
investing in an education, like a post-secondary education and, you know, saving themselves money

3649
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:49,000
and, you know, try another stuff before committing on that, especially if they don't actually know

3650
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,400
what they want to do. And you know, there's like things like that. Like I would, everyone thinks

3651
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:58,600
they're a good guy in their own mind. I don't say anything except possibly as jokes, which I do a lot.

3652
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:03,320
I don't say anything that I don't think is going to make the world better, like is true or good.

3653
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:07,640
You know, again, unless it's like a joke, that's obviously for that purpose.

3654
02:35:07,640 --> 02:35:13,720
So like, I mean, I would argue that anyone who acts more like me is acting like in a more good way.

3655
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:18,200
So like in that sense, I definitely think it's like a positive influence for people who...

3656
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:20,520
You want people to be like you.

3657
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:25,880
And I think everyone wants people to be like, well, okay, some people don't want that, but yeah.

3658
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:29,960
Yeah. I see a question.

3659
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:35,960
How much truth do you think there is behind the notion? Oh, this is like Kajoro Bitterthorn.

3660
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:39,720
How much truth do you think there's behind the notion? You get more if you pay more.

3661
02:35:39,720 --> 02:35:43,160
What matters more to you? The objective or the experience around it?

3662
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:48,360
Example, tasty cheat meal versus the same thing and a fancy restaurant with great ambiance,

3663
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:55,160
presentation, etc. I think that you do not get more if you pay more.

3664
02:35:55,160 --> 02:36:02,040
Basically at all. You have to pay a small, a bit to get like good stuff,

3665
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:06,360
like food that is actually nutritious and not bullshit, for example.

3666
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:11,880
But beyond that very low requirement, I think that anything other than food,

3667
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:17,240
anything other than nutriment to sustain your body and four walls and a roof over your head

3668
02:36:17,240 --> 02:36:22,040
is an unnecessary luxury and pure vanity and totally unnecessary.

3669
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:25,640
And you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise.

3670
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:29,240
I mean, I think he's... Oh, and a computer, and a fucking internet.

3671
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:30,760
Of course. There you go. I did it.

3672
02:36:32,760 --> 02:36:40,360
The getting more doesn't necessarily mean like more bang for one's buck, but like more satisfaction.

3673
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:46,680
Like is it better to just sustain yourself with food or is it better to have a lovely meal?

3674
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:49,320
It really, I think it's a personal... That costs a lot.

3675
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:51,880
I personally don't care about a lovely meal hardly.

3676
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:53,160
Right. It depends on what you're looking for.

3677
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:56,680
If you're someone who gets enjoyment out of that atmosphere and stuff,

3678
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:59,000
and of course you're going to get more value out of that,

3679
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:00,600
but if it's someone like me who doesn't give a fuck,

3680
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:02,440
I'm just going to go there and feel uncomfortable and be like,

3681
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:04,120
I'm just wasting my money, you know?

3682
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:09,000
Yeah. Why did I spend $550 on this plate of asparagus?

3683
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,760
For one of my friend's birthdays.

3684
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:15,160
And I was disgusted over the fact that I have this dinky meal

3685
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:18,680
that I'm cooking myself I have to pay $150 for. This is retarded.

3686
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:21,880
Oh, like a Korean barbecue or something like that?

3687
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:24,600
It was... I don't know. I don't think it's... It's like they just have...

3688
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:25,560
Was it a fondue place?

3689
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:26,760
Something like that, yeah.

3690
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:27,800
Okay, okay.

3691
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:30,920
It was retarded and I never want to go back in my life.

3692
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:33,640
Yeah, I hear you.

3693
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:38,120
Yeah, I don't like... A lot of the time, especially with food,

3694
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:41,080
because you eat it and then you shit it and shit doesn't...

3695
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:43,800
It's shit's not good, so I've ruined it.

3696
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:46,040
I've ruined the stuff that I spent all this money on.

3697
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:47,240
Well, it's not ruined.

3698
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:48,280
Flush it down the toilet.

3699
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:50,680
It's sustaining your body.

3700
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:58,680
But like, I feel a lot of the time when I pay money that's expensive,

3701
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:03,720
I think about how much I was ripped off and how cheaper it could have been somewhere else,

3702
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:09,160
or like how if I went to the right shop where it's like a local family restaurant,

3703
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:12,760
where they just do things better because they're like, you know,

3704
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:16,920
the old lady with the Italian special recipe, she just,

3705
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:20,680
hey, I'm gonna do the specialist sauce and she does the thing and it's like,

3706
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:25,800
they do it cheaper because they're a small restaurant,

3707
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:27,880
but they do it better because they're good.

3708
02:38:27,880 --> 02:38:31,880
And I'm like, if only I found that restaurant instead of wherever I am,

3709
02:38:33,160 --> 02:38:40,280
then it would be... I'm always thinking, fuck, they got my money and, dang it, I don't like...

3710
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:41,880
You know, but there's something to be said.

3711
02:38:41,880 --> 02:38:42,360
It's a bad feeling.

3712
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:45,800
There's something to be said for rolling up to a fancy restaurant,

3713
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:51,080
you know, getting your tiny little slivers of meat in asparagus,

3714
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:55,000
sitting across from a beautiful dame and looking out the window at you,

3715
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,120
rabble, gazing in at me at this wonderful restaurant,

3716
02:38:58,120 --> 02:39:01,240
you know, just enjoying my superior, social superiority.

3717
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:01,800
That's the best thing.

3718
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:05,000
I'm looking through the window and I'm mocking you for being a fucking weed charge.

3719
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,080
And I'm mocking you for being a poor boy.

3720
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:08,600
Look at this child, look at this man.

3721
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:11,960
It's not the having the thing, it's the knowing that others don't have it.

3722
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:16,120
It works when you have, like, a significant other to take there to impress them.

3723
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:19,400
But going there alone is like, what am I fucking doing in a restaurant?

3724
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:22,680
Yeah, going alone is kind of... Okay, I want to...

3725
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:27,480
My employee, like, I generally sort of, like, like the idea of sort of a fancy restaurant

3726
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:31,560
and fancy meal, but at the same time, when I actually think about going to is like,

3727
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:34,440
nah, man, I don't want to pay that much for that little.

3728
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:37,160
And it's just like, I'm hungry, dude.

3729
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:41,400
I want to have a nice, nice meal, but like, not for that much.

3730
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:45,240
I like the aesthetics, I like the idea behind it,

3731
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:48,840
but it's like fancy restaurants are usually mega super expensive.

3732
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:50,440
So, no.

3733
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:56,760
The fucking thing I hate the most is when I'm traveling and I'm in the airport and I'm like,

3734
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:57,960
oh, I have to eat.

3735
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:02,040
How much are they gonna extort out of me?

3736
02:40:02,040 --> 02:40:04,840
And it's like the shittiest food as well.

3737
02:40:05,400 --> 02:40:08,600
It's like a fucking panini in a microwave.

3738
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:10,840
Five euros.

3739
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:17,560
I usually go to the convenience store if there is one and get a pre-made sandwich

3740
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:23,240
and a packet of crisps, and those are usually guaranteed to be normal and understandable

3741
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:24,280
and edible.

3742
02:40:24,280 --> 02:40:25,720
I gotta go to the convenience store.

3743
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:30,600
I gotta get me some of that zero calorie Arizona iced tea at Dollar Can.

3744
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:31,960
You know what's good, though?

3745
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:33,320
Guys, you know what's good, though?

3746
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:34,760
Oh, you can eat buffet.

3747
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:36,280
I love that.

3748
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:36,760
Well, sure.

3749
02:40:37,480 --> 02:40:38,200
I never been told.

3750
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:41,000
Oh, because he's a British boy, you know?

3751
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:41,720
No, I've been.

3752
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:43,160
Do they not have those in England?

3753
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:43,960
No, they do.

3754
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:44,520
I've never seen one.

3755
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:45,960
I've been in one.

3756
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:49,240
This is the first time I've been in an all-you-can-eat buffet was in England.

3757
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:54,040
I actually, me and my boyfriend later, we sometimes go to Pizza Hub.

3758
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:57,480
They have like all-you-can-eat pizza between 12 and like three or something.

3759
02:40:57,480 --> 02:40:59,400
No, from when they opened.

3760
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:00,040
Oh, my gosh.

3761
02:41:00,040 --> 02:41:00,840
How much did that cost?

3762
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:02,920
Just had the curiosity to get all-you-can-eat pizza.

3763
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:06,120
For one person, it's 750 pounds.

3764
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:08,280
So that's like, I don't know, $9, $10.

3765
02:41:08,280 --> 02:41:09,560
That doesn't sound bad.

3766
02:41:09,560 --> 02:41:10,840
That does not sound bad.

3767
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:13,880
Like, the pizza, one single pizza is more pricey than the other pizza.

3768
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:14,600
Yeah, exactly.

3769
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:15,960
Nate, did you know that they have that at Papageno's now?

3770
02:41:15,960 --> 02:41:18,680
And I could eat much more than a single pizza in the same thing.

3771
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:22,520
Nate, did you know they have all-you-can-eat buffet at Papageno's now?

3772
02:41:23,080 --> 02:41:23,960
They do?

3773
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:24,760
What the fuck?

3774
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:25,720
It's six bucks.

3775
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,480
Six bucks?

3776
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:28,200
Yeah.

3777
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:28,440
What?

3778
02:41:28,440 --> 02:41:29,720
That doesn't make any sense.

3779
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:31,800
Jesus, I have never been more happy back in New England.

3780
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:34,600
They give you the slice pie slices, too, so they're big ones.

3781
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:35,960
And you can also get pasta.

3782
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:36,680
You know what they do?

3783
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:37,640
You know what they're doing?

3784
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:37,960
I've got it.

3785
02:41:37,960 --> 02:41:40,360
They're expecting you to have social anxiety

3786
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:43,000
to prevent you from going up to ask for another pizza.

3787
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,920
Ben, go to Papageno's.

3788
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:45,880
Report back.

3789
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:47,880
But you know that's not a problem.

3790
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:48,120
Of course.

3791
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:48,920
I've done it before.

3792
02:41:48,920 --> 02:41:51,960
We've gotten entire slice pies and then some.

3793
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:52,760
That's great.

3794
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:53,560
You guys should go.

3795
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:55,400
The good thing about the Pizza Hut,

3796
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:57,160
you just go get the slices yourself.

3797
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,360
You don't have to bother anyone.

3798
02:41:58,360 --> 02:41:59,240
Well, see, I like that.

3799
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:00,040
I do like that.

3800
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:00,680
It is good.

3801
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:01,400
That is good, Ben.

3802
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:03,480
Less standing between me and my infinite pizza.

3803
02:42:03,480 --> 02:42:05,000
A lot of different pizzas as well.

3804
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:06,920
I like to vary it up.

3805
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:09,560
Biter just eats the one pepperoni pizza,

3806
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,480
maybe margarita if they have margarita.

3807
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:12,200
I like margarita.

3808
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:16,360
I think the reason I've never been to an all-you-can-eat

3809
02:42:16,360 --> 02:42:18,360
buffet is because I don't eat that much.

3810
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:20,040
And I don't think I would get.

3811
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:22,200
I think I would actually lose money

3812
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:23,560
by going to one of those things

3813
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:26,440
because I would eat less food than it costs to get in.

3814
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,720
It really depends on the buffet.

3815
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:30,120
Another buffet I've been to that closed down

3816
02:42:30,120 --> 02:42:32,040
was the actual first one I've been to

3817
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:34,120
when I came to live in England.

3818
02:42:34,120 --> 02:42:36,120
It was a Chinese food buffet.

3819
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:41,080
And I just sort of dug into the food they had,

3820
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:43,480
like what's it called, not snacks,

3821
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:45,080
but the food you have before the main dish.

3822
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:46,120
Appetizer?

3823
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:46,440
Appetizers.

3824
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:47,080
Appetizers.

3825
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:48,840
Yeah, I really love the appetizers so much

3826
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:50,840
I would just get my fill in appetizers.

3827
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,240
Oh, man.

3828
02:42:53,240 --> 02:42:53,560
I went to...

3829
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:54,440
But it was really cheap.

3830
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:54,520
I went to...

3831
02:42:54,520 --> 02:42:56,200
It was like $4.50, I think.

3832
02:42:57,320 --> 02:43:01,720
I went out for Pokemon Community Day catching squirtles.

3833
02:43:01,720 --> 02:43:04,760
I got my fucking purple shiny Blastoise

3834
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:06,760
with the sunglasses with the Kazi.

3835
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:08,120
It was out with Kazi and the Busty Coins.

3836
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:10,040
I got a bunch of squirts, but no shinies.

3837
02:43:11,960 --> 02:43:12,520
Yeah, they were...

3838
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,560
You had the request.

3839
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:15,320
The request that lets you do get like...

3840
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:16,760
Man, what the fuck?

3841
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:17,320
Son of a boss.

3842
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:18,840
Whatever, boys.

3843
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:20,600
Yeah, I got my fucking killer Blastoise.

3844
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,160
It's sick.

3845
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:23,080
Anyway, the point is I went to PF Chang's

3846
02:43:23,960 --> 02:43:25,320
and I just ate...

3847
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:27,720
Doing keto, just ate fucking ribs.

3848
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:31,560
I just got two orders of appetizer spare ribs.

3849
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:34,440
I ate one, I got one for six bucks and I ate it

3850
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:35,640
and I was like, that was great.

3851
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:37,720
I want more food, but I don't want a side dish.

3852
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:39,640
I'm just going to get a second set of ribs.

3853
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:42,200
It was only $12 for like a shit ton of fucking ribs.

3854
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:42,360
It was really great.

3855
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:42,920
Sounds pretty good.

3856
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:43,720
It was really great.

3857
02:43:43,720 --> 02:43:44,600
Highly recommended.

3858
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:47,240
All right, enough.

3859
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:48,040
This is almost three hours.

3860
02:43:48,040 --> 02:43:49,000
All right, he's right, he's right.

3861
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,400
Oh, I need to go to bed.

3862
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:52,360
That sounds good.

3863
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:52,760
Oh, God.

3864
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:54,600
And now I'm really hungry, but I have to go to bed.

3865
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:55,160
Me too.

3866
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:56,920
This is a terrible question to end on.

3867
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:59,960
I haven't fucking eaten all day, so thanks, guys.

3868
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:02,600
Let me end this episode on a prayer.

3869
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:05,720
I found this randomly on Twitter.

3870
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:08,360
It's from atchorpsaway.

3871
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:09,000
And here it is.

3872
02:44:09,800 --> 02:44:11,800
This is Squall from Final Fantasy VIII.

3873
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:14,200
And I quote, I just don't get it.

3874
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,600
You can't have a boneless chicken wing.

3875
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:18,760
It's just a saucy chicken nugget at that point.

3876
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:20,280
Thank you, everyone.

3877
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:24,040

Have a good day.

3879
02:44:25,960 --> 02:44:26,680
Have a good night.

3880
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:27,080
Good night, everyone.

3881
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:30,120

3882
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:32,040

And then the world's your oyster above that.

3885
02:44:38,920 --> 02:44:39,400
What else?

3886
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:40,760
A red bubble.

3887
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:41,720
There's some shirts.

3888
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:42,360
Go buy them.

3889
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:43,320
You know, that's cool.

3890
02:44:43,320 --> 02:44:47,240
You can buy that fucking bonus content from Radcon.

3891
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:48,760
Go check all the Radcon shit if you haven't.

3892
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:49,560
Watch the playlist.

3893
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:51,480
Don't be lame.

3894
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:52,440
Be cool.

3895
02:44:52,440 --> 02:44:54,600
That's my recommendation for you.

3896
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:55,880
All right, that's it.

3897
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:56,920
Thanks for listening, everybody.

3898
02:44:57,160 --> 02:45:00,760
We'll see you next time with an extra dank meme.

3899
02:45:02,600 --> 02:45:03,240
Yeah!

3900
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:04,840
Get ready to do that, everybody.

3901
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:05,960
All right, I'll see you later.

3902
02:45:05,960 --> 02:45:06,200
Bye-bye.

3903
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:06,760
Bye-bye.

3904
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:07,240
Good-bye.

3905
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:07,880
Good-bye.

3906
02:45:07,880 --> 02:45:08,360
Good-bye.

3907
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:08,920
Good-bye.

3908
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:10,280
Good-bye.

3909
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:10,760
Yeah.

3910
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:12,280
Oh, dude.

3911
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:17,640
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3912
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:23,320
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3913
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:26,040
But I'm not working.

3914
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:28,680
I'm doing nothing.

3915
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:31,320
My dick, I'm jerking.

3916
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:34,040
Myself, I'm sucking.

3917
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:36,760
I am an asshole.

3918
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:39,320
I am a stupid.

3919
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:42,040
I've got a deadline.

3920
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:52,040
Don't want to do it.
