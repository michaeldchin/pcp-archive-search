1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, there is a lot that goes into making these game reviews and there's actually so much that I could sit here for like three hours and still, you know, there could be more things to talk about that I forgot to mention.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I kind of just take for granted that there is a lot that goes into making these videos.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
See, for me, I don't really think about it that much because I've made over a hundred episodes and I've become very efficient at it.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So to me, it's like the same way I don't think about brushing my teeth. You know, I do it so many times.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Thanks for tuning in.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And today, actually, we're starting a special new thing. But before we get to that, let's just see who's here with us.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's of course me, the best guy ever. We have Digibro with us.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, what's up, y'all?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The Hippo Crit.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Add me in in post.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tom Oliver.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yo.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And The Davoo Collective.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Zap, zappy.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so here's our thing guys. We're doing a new thing. So as I'm sure everyone in the world knows, the new Twitter for the PCP is officially made and it's out there in the world.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At TP Crastinators. So go find it there. There'll be a link in the description. All that good stuff.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And what we did was that we asked people for suggestions for topics for the show.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And so today is the first time that we are taking someone's suggestion and it is at SpaceyFilmer.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It is their suggestion. I think that's a guy who was going to say his, but I don't know for sure.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And their suggestion was the writing slash editing process. And I think this was a separate suggestion, nitpicking slash overanalyzing.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But since that applies to my writing and editing process, I'm going to pretend it was part of the same thing.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So who wants to start us off talking about their writing and editing process?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Nate, why don't you, since you have the most complicated and intimate and deeply disturbing process of us all.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think yours is going to be the one that makes the rest of us look like we don't work.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think that's probably true. It was funny. Just before we started, Tom said,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
if editing a video takes more than one day, I want to kill myself.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And here I am, looking at my chart I've got here two weeks into this current project at 53% completion.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And yes, I've been calculating it and that's the exact percentage.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's your average hours per day you've been working on it?

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
About five hours per day.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Every day?

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Every day, that's right.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You see, these things are not practical, but I do them anyway.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And this whole project, I've been working on Ghost in the Shell,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but I decided to pick up this one just to get something out,

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
because it'd been a little while since I'd put out a big video.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Of course, I can't remember what the fuck the word is. It was a masterpiece,

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
but I thought I'd do something else a little more in tune with my regular content.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course, like everything, it's taken way too long.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But anyway, for this current video I'm working on, I just had an idea,

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and it was kind of similar to my process for making the first Gern Lagen,

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
best guy ever, whatever video it was, where I just had an idea,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and I just did whatever it took to make it real, whether or not it was practical or not.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But since that was the first video for the channel, that didn't matter.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But I think probably the process of making shit is more interesting

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
for things like the part two of the Gern Lagen one.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So for that, I also just, I had an idea.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It always starts with just the seed of an idea for the video to make, of course.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it was, the context of making that was just,

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've already got this initial kind of reaction to the show in this case,

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and now I want to expand on the reasons why I like it so much.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I always start with a thesis statement of that nature.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then the way that I made that into a video was, first, watch the whole thing twice.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So I watched the whole show through, and as I went through, I just took notes

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
on every single episode and everything I thought that was noteworthy.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I then took all those notes, having completed that,

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and organized them into a series of topics that were relevant for the thing I was trying to make.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I did that, and then I organized them into an order that made sense

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to get to the ultimate point I was trying to make,

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
which in this case was the stuff about how there's things to be learned from Gern Lagen,

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and all these practical lessons that it's trying to teach us.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And so everything was building to that point.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then I had to go through, and because the video was already,

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
because there were way too many topics, I had to cut a bunch of shit

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that wasn't directly related to what I was talking about.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That video only focuses on narrative stuff.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It doesn't talk at all about art or any of that stuff.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So all that stuff I just threw aside because it wasn't pertinent.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And then I then converted those notes into a script.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And this was probably the hardest step, turning them into actual senses and doing that shit.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I mean, that took a while.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And up to that point, it was probably like two to three months of work.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then at that point, it was just the three month more process of converting all those notes.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Or I did the voiceover, did the voice recording, that's fine.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And once I have the voice recording, I do that first.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I then go back over it.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I drop that shit in Vegas or Premiere or whatever.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then I just start from the beginning and just start editing all the way through.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, what's up?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sorry to cut off your momentum there.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No problem, no problem.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The what you're describing to me, this is in my mind the classical idea of how to go about.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I don't just mean that in the writing sense.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The whole concept of the video is like back when I started as an animate writer,

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
exactly what you're doing is what I sort of dreamed of.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I saw it as you've got your favorite shows and nothing in the world matters

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in the face of just talking about your favorite shows.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Everything else you talk about is because it's whatever, you're just interested for a week or so.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's just a little flight of fancy.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, here's an idea I had for a video.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But your favorite shows is these titans that you feel like you're never going to be able to sleep right until you've done it.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Until you've really sold everyone and why it's so special.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And for me, I had this thing I did starting in 2009 called The Epic Journey,

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because I was a fucking teenager and the word epic was the word back then that you used.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The Epic Journey, the idea was I was going to analyze or just talk about all of my favorite anime

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and first I would write about how I remembered them, then rewatch the show and then watch it again while writing about it.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I did this with FLCL, where that's the only one I ever actually did to completion,

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but I wrote about it beforehand, watched the commentaries, watched all the episodes,

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
wrote these in-depth analytical pieces about each episode.

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I covered all six episodes and then a final thoughts kind of piece.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So it was this big huge project, but then the prospect of doing that for every favorite show I have

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
is so much work just to do FLCL.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And for a long time I dreamed of doing things the way you're doing.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What finally got me past that was Evangelion, because I wanted to tackle Eva,

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but I felt like I have to say everything there is to say about it.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
There has to be no stone left unturned, because so many people have talked about it before,

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
it has to be the ultimate, it has to be the most thorough analysis of Eva possible.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And what I had planned to do was to do a podcast about every single episode,

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
half of them with guests, where I'd take people who I know have talked about the show,

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
like Demolition D, Go Jesus, Jesse, I had already told all of them about this.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This was going to happen, this huge project of podcasting every episode.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then I was going to take all of the ideas presented by everybody in all the podcasts

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and then write a book about Eva, like a full stop book and cover everything.

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And that project is just so huge that there was no way it would happen.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It was like, you know, I'd think about it and I'm just like,

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
if I start on this, this is going to be my life for half a year, you know,

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
which is exactly what your process has been.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, I mean it was never my goal, I see what you're saying,

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but it was never my goal to talk in depth about every aspect of the show.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And in my opinion, I only talked about a very narrow range of ideas.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I only talked about specifically like the scientific application

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and like the philosophical meaning behind the show.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, I would have loved to spend time talking about like the humor of the show,

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
which I think is nobody talks about like analyzing humor and stuff.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a huge problem in all of analysis.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No one's doing good analysis of comedy and humor.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's tough, it's a shame.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But yeah, I mean, I'm glad that you didn't cover absolutely everything

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
because when I finished your video, I like mental note,

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I still get to do cool character designs growing the gun,

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
which I'd planned for long before you ever made your video.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I had that plan, you know, that was always going to happen and it finally did.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But you know, that's, I just think that, sure, you didn't cover absolutely everything,

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but it's just that mindset of like, I have to say all that I have to say

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and make it this big, huge deal, you know.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And what finally got me past that was looking at Ava and just going,

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
all right, maybe one day I can write a book about Ava.

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But for now, what if I just like, every time I have a thought about the show,

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
let's make a video about it, you know, doesn't have to be the whole thing.

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just every single time I have some thought that hasn't been expressed,

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
let's make a video about it.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I sort of went with that approach and I've made like seven or eight Ava videos

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that people seem to really like.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, okay, okay, but I mean, this does tie into my, you know, video making process.

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean, at this point in my career, I guess you'd say,

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I feel that I need to do things to distinguish myself from, you know, everyone out there.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I think I'm definitely doing so.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And to be honest, I think I'm making some of the best content

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
when it actually comes out, which is rare.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And obviously that's a huge problem.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So, I mean, do you think that's a mistake?

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, obviously it's not the most efficient way of doing things,

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but it is the way I provide that.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think it's not a mistake because, I mean, you're getting more subscribers for less,

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
for less content because people really like the,

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the quality level.

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If they just wanted to, you know, I mean,

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the way I think about my videos is I could technically do the stuff you do

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and it would take probably a bit longer because I'm not used to doing that.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I just, I don't care so much about it being as flashy as possible

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because I just want things to be made.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And it's like, but as a result, I don't get quite as much clout

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
or whatever word I'm trying to think of.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah.

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Like I'm not seen as like the flashiest, coolest guy.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, I mean, I talked about this in my last decompression vlog

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that like people look at Nate or Jesse and they look at those big videos

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and those are videos that like they will always be coming back to

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and talking about and thinking about.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Like, I think for most people who've seen the Gurren Lagann analysis,

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that is now like intrinsically tied into Gurren Lagann for them.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Like, it's not like a YouTube video about the show.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's like a part of the show.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's part of how they recognize it now, you know?

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And you're sorted online.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And AstraScore, I'm sure, are similar for people.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, certainly, yeah.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Especially AstraScore because for most people, that's the only exposure they've had.

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, yeah, people didn't have much to say about it before that, I'm sure.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But yeah, I think it's great that you do those kinds of videos

182
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and I'd love for you to always have them come out, you know, once in a while.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I think that, well, here's what's going to save you,

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
is that you don't have that many favorites.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like, there's not that many shows I think you could cover this right.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You know?

187
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like, I mean, there's Ghost in the Shell.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's One Piece.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's, you know, Star Trek, TNG.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And like, once you've covered all those, there's not going to be a need

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
for a 50-minute best guy ever analysis about something

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
because you've covered the giants that you care about.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You know, it's a shame about this whole thing.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I think I can get away with continuing this sort of thing

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
with, like, you know, we're going to Ghost in the Shell now.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I've already, in my mind, come up with a solution to this,

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which is just basically just splitting up the fucking video.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then, like, by doing that, I can still talk in as much depth

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and crazy editing as I want.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But a video will come out maybe every month, possibly every two months,

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
just because they're all part of a series as opposed to, you know, one...

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was a big mistake to do all of Gern-Lagan one thing.

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's great. I love that it's a package, but, you know...

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's what I've been doing with my Rayman review.

205
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right, and it's perfect.

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like, the first part...

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Exactly the right way to go.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was really good.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was really good.

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thanks.

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But, like, the part one is 10 minutes long.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But if I had included the rest of the part one that I've written,

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
it would be maybe 40 minutes long.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Part two is going to be 20 minutes.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know how many parts it's going to have.

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I really wrote too much.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But having that little, you know, 10 minutes is, you know,

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
is decent enough for a...

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, it's important for guys like us, you know,

220
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
at our early stage of the YouTube game here,

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to be producing, you know, just shit as fast as possible

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and to get ourselves out there as best we can.

223
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And by the way, before we move on from the How Great I Am thing,

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
now's an appropriate time for me to put out the story about how yesterday,

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sy, a man with 150,000 subscribers,

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
came to me asking me for creative expertise

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
on how to edit something better.

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So I'm just saying, people out there are taking note of what I can do.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I mean, for the record, Nate, I have 250,000 subscribers.

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I would definitely come to you for editing.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, but I don't...

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You don't matter.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't matter.

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're nobody.

235
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If I wanted to know how to make a screen stretch and explode,

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I would ask you about it for sure.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Right.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But we're friends.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You know, I've known you for a long time.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I've known that thought of the splitting videos in parts.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And I want to touch on that, how that happens for me.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And it sounds like it's going this way for you guys as well.

243
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Because it used to be that you would write a video to be shorter

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
because YouTube audience retention was so low.

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
People's average three to five minutes watch time per video.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And it used to be that people tried to keep videos short

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
or tried to break them into parts so that more people would watch it.

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That is not a concern anymore.

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And YouTube length does not matter.

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You've got Matthew Matosis putting out six fucking hour-long

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
commentaries that have well over 100,000 views.

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The market's there.

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But what it's become now is it's really about money.

254
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I say that with as little cynicism as possible,

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but we need to be able to make enough money to make...

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If I make a video that's like Mob Psycho 100,

257
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the one I did on that, it's like seven minutes long.

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And it's like concept of completion in like a day.

259
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I watched the whole show.

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I already knew Victor had already given me an idea of something to say about it.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because Victor requested me to watch that show and do an analysis of it.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He kind of gave me the idea of what it was going to be like.

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I watched the show.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I already have in mind what I'm going to say about it.

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I write the video.

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I give it to Davoo.

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He edits it that night.

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's out within like 24 hours of being conceptualized.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's a beautiful thing.

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And that video...

271
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If I post it on YouTube and it gets...

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And that video has a shit ton of views because it was a popular show.

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But I can post that out and I can post it on Patreon.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And it's like considered one video.

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Then you've got Akiyuki Shinbo in the 90s,

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
which is months of watching anime.

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's tons and tons of shows that me and Davoo watched.

278
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And it's 40 minutes long in total between the two parts.

279
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And Davoo spent days editing that.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And the product, if it was one video, if it had just been one video,

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
it would have had like 50,000 views, much less than Mob Psycho had.

282
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And it would only be one post on Patreon.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So it makes just as much money as Mob Psycho did.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And if not less, because it depends on when it comes out in the month.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So for me, that video was written as one video.

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I just arbitrarily split it at a point where it could be split into two.

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And each one is substantial.

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There's no problem with splitting a video.

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I mean, who suffers when you split a video into two parts?

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Nobody. It just comes out a little later.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I think it's interesting that that's kind of the way we're having to do things

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
because YouTube rewards frequency.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It rewards multiple uploads.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It rewards people remaining on your channel for multiple videos.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's a huge part of how you get paid is when people go through your catalogue

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
or they go from your videos to another one.

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And longer videos are actually better for the YouTube algorithm.

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But multiple long videos in a string is even better still.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And each one will probably have better retention on its own

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
than the whole one would have had by itself.

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's crazy how fast you can get to 100k if you make videos for your niche every day.

302
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah. Oh my God.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You need to be frequent.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And even for the big channels, this is a huge concern.

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You saw how H3H3 had split between Ethan and Ela and H3H3

306
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and they were posting way more on Ethan and Ela

307
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and they were like, this is killing our main channel

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because we're only uploading once every two weeks

309
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
as opposed to once every two days, our fucking rates are just dropping.

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So we're fusing our channel so this won't happen.

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I mean, that's a channel with 2 million fucking subscribers

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
making crazy money and even they're worried about the frequency of their uploads and shit.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you want that growth, if you want that steady growth

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and if you want to keep making money, you got to have frequency and some regularity

315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and each individual splitting a 40 minute video in two.

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I mean, I could have split it into fucking four,

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but I like it to be in these big chunks.

318
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I wanted you to get enough of the narrative to get invested.

319
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Because with RoboPixels, I've been releasing one video every week, every two weeks

320
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
for like the last year and just the last two weeks

321
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I started doing vlogs and now there's two videos a week.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My subscriber growth month over month tripled

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and if you count, doubled and fucking earnings doubled.

324
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You know, that's why I was so happy with...

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I saw Gabe's video, I can't remember the fucking word, you know, whatever

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and I was just like, this is hilarious, I'd love to make something like this

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and just that night, like it came out in the morning, I watched it while I was at work

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that night I rushed home and in the span of like five hours

329
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I was able to get a video done and I was just so thrilled about that fact

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was able to get something done that I had to put it on the main channel

331
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
instead of BestieBoy, which it obviously belongs on

332
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
but I was just so thrilled to actually have something to post

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
with that level of speed that I couldn't help myself.

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a great video.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, but we should be talking about the process of making videos rather.

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Oh, there was only one thing, we can move on from me.

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There was only one other thing that I thought was interesting

338
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
that people might enjoy hearing about, about my editing style

339
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and it's that, so I talked a bunch before about how I get up to the point of

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I've now got my voice recording of the script

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and then I just start to edit through it

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but did you know, viewer, that the first thing I do

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
after I have the voice recording script, before I do any visual editing

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
is I go and I pick music for every section of the video

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and not only do I just put an appropriate sounding song behind it

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I attempt, it's amazing how well this usually works out

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I attempt to like sync important things with like relevant beats

348
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and drops in the audio

349
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and sometimes it works out astoundingly well

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like, remember in the end of the Gernlagen part 2 video

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm playing that song from Bravely Default, it's like the ending theme song

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and there's all this epic shit going on when I say personal fucking responsibility

353
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
like, the song just happened to drop exactly at the right time

354
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
for me to like put that explosion and be like pfft

355
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it was synchronicity of a fascinating degree

356
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
it was serendipity, that's right

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and then, so yeah, I do that and then I edit the visuals

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and I put a bunch of memes, all that shit

359
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
so there you go, that's an interesting insight into how I do things

360
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
so we can move on from me now if we want to talk about somebody else's

361
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
well, I guess I'll go

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because I'm speaking about the music

363
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I usually leave the music until after I have all the visuals in place

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
because I know it

365
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
well, I mean sometimes I think, oh, I've got to have a specific thing here

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but usually I just like having something vaguely relevant

367
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and, you know, a beat to keep it going smoothly

368
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but yeah, music is, I don't really think about it too much

369
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
even though I like music a lot

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I actually have several, I think about it way too much

371
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and I have a folder of songs that I think will evoke certain emotions

372
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
on my computer that I just have in place for when I'm going to use them

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I've already got like three picked out for Ghost of the Shell at various points

374
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
yeah, I tried to make a database of that

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
like collect songs I could possibly use as background

376
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and add tags to like label their aesthetic elements

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and I gave up

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't have an organized system or anything, anyway, sorry again

379
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
well, I guess I'll talk about my writing style

380
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
because it's quite regimented now

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
what I have, I have a Google Doc called Video Ideas

382
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and every time I have an idea for a game that I want to talk about at some point

383
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
or something, I go in there and I just write it down

384
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
in a big long list

385
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and whenever I start to write it

386
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I make another Google Doc and then link to that Google Doc in the Video Ideas document

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
so I have a big old thing where I can scroll through

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and see which, I highlight which ones I finished

389
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
which ones I've recorded the audio for

390
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and which ones I just need to edit

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and I've got a whole big thing of that

392
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
hey, can I ask you a question about your process?

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm just curious, if you're like me in this one aspect of

394
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
when I'm writing a script

395
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and I thought that you're more like this than anybody else I think

396
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
when I'm writing a script, I find it extremely hard to write anything

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that I think will actually be funny, like any real jokes

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
but when I'm editing and I have like my fairly serious voice

399
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
it's really easy for me to just put something retarded

400
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and it's hilarious, like juxtaposed against the fairly serious things I'm saying

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
do you do that too? Is that where you get most of your humor?

402
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I think, well I do write a lot of jokes into my scripts

403
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
like if I just look at a script now

404
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I would put in Asterix how I would edit something to be funny

405
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
like pause for effect, zoom in on this guy's face after I say

406
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
oh dear, I actually write that into the script as I'm going

407
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
like that'll sound good

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
sometimes the live action stuff that I record

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
doesn't actually work in the way that I intended it to

410
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
or the way I wanted it to

411
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
but when I am editing I can sometimes make it better

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
like some of the live action sections in that Rayman video

413
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't like them, but I added some weird effects and then they were funny

414
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
but you know, more funny than not

415
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
there's a lot of changing things as it goes along to make it flow better I experience

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
so the way I do the reviews, I mean it used to be different

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
for Dark Cloud I didn't play the game at all

418
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I just knew it so well that I wrote the entire thing

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and then played the game to get some footage

420
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
but nowadays obviously it's a better idea to play the game

421
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and take notes

422
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
if you've ever watched AVGN

423
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
he has a video where he goes through his editing process

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
called I think he does like a pixel just a random game

425
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and he goes through the entire process of playing the game

426
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
writing the review, editing it and all that

427
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and it's really interesting and really informative

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
so you should look at that AVGN

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
making of an AVGN episode

430
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and I based a lot of how I write scripts and take notes off of that

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
especially for GRPJ

432
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I think, no not GRPJ

433
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I can't remember what I do

434
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Or the miniscule review?

435
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No miniscule reviews are just sort of like I just write about it

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and I don't really

437
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
the thing about miniscule reviews is that there's no live action

438
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
there's no big skits

439
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
it's just sort of me being a goof and playing a game

440
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Those are probably the most like traditionally

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
probably would be successful YouTube videos

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If I could make loads of those all the time then I would

443
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm always trying to make a big hypocrite video

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
How hypocritical of you

445
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Not really

446
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You really are the best guy ever

447
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh no

448
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But yeah, I write down things

449
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, specifically regarding game footage

450
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
because making a video game review is harder than anime

451
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
in the fact that you have to get footage for everything you're talking about

452
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh yeah, yeah, totally

453
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So I would only try to write notes on stuff that I'm actually doing

454
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So I would play the game something like Rayman

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I would record like level one

456
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the whole level through and then stop recording

457
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
so that I have a file of that level and just name it that level

458
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and then continue playing

459
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and every time there's like something particularly like

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
if I need to look at a walkthrough

461
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
for a certain part that's hard

462
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I write down in my notes this part's really hard

463
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
this is the link to the walkthrough that I'm looking at

464
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
in case I need to take a screenshot and put that in

465
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Interesting, early on into me making video game related videos

466
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
especially back then when I didn't have a very powerful computer

467
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
where editing with files that were very long at all

468
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
just completely choked up the editing software

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's really annoying to scrub through a whole like two hour thing

470
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I always try to split it

471
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I was not very good at scrubbing either at the time

472
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
so I was just splitting the recording up every like two to five minutes

473
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
like every time it felt like I was doing a different thing

474
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I would break it up and make a new recording

475
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and then when I was done

476
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
after writing the video

477
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
think about the different dynamics of the game

478
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
that I'm going to talk about

479
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
and then look at each of the individual clips

480
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and put them into folders corresponding to the different things

481
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
like hey this clip shows off the level design pretty well

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
this clip shows off the main villain pretty well

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
put them in their respective folders

484
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and that's how I did that

485
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
but I haven't really made any video game videos in a long time

486
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I don't even know how I would do it now

487
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
see that's quite a clever thing to do

488
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
because what I do with just having a level

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
usually what I'm writing the script

490
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm like I go through level by level things that happen

491
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
so I'm sort of walking through the game as I analyze it and stuff

492
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but sometimes I can't find a particular moment in a thing

493
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
but I know it's in A level

494
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
so I just go to that level and I still have to scrub sometimes

495
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
quite a bit

496
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
if I had the patience to put things into specific folders

497
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
so I could just instantly grab them from there

498
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that would be pretty good

499
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to comment on this

500
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
because obviously I'm not as known for doing game videos as you

501
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
but I have done a number of them

502
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and it's funny because my process is like

503
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
almost entirely built out of desperation

504
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to do as little work on it as possible

505
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
because I hate editing

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
smart way to go

507
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and I hate capturing footage

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
because when I play through a game

509
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
it's usually like I don't usually play a game intending to analyze it

510
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
like most of the games that I have written about

511
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I had the idea after the game

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and then it's like there's no fucking way I'm going to play through the whole thing again

513
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
to capture the footage

514
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but I need enough

515
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I need enough to work with

516
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
so I'll use like

517
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'll use as much let's play footage as I can find

518
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
if I'm talking about specific moments

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
if it's like

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
this boss is super hard or whatever

521
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll just grab a let's play

522
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and it's kind of funny to me

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that gaming YouTubers

524
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
seem to be so

525
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
proud in particular about capturing their own footage

526
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and about having it be 60 frames, 1080p

527
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
which is a lot that I don't do

528
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I don't care about that

529
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean when it comes to the footage

530
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
me recording it

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
it's mostly just because I have done the whole

532
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
let's look at let's plays and get the footage

533
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
it's easier thing

534
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
but it's so frustrating when

535
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
they don't have the specific moment

536
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that I'm looking for

537
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
or like the videos

538
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
all the let's plays are like really bad quality

539
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
or like one of them is a low quality

540
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
but it has the bit you need

541
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and all the high quality footage

542
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
doesn't have what you need

543
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I've gone through that

544
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
but like for me

545
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I mean I don't fucking care

546
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
like if it's low quality for like 10 seconds

547
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I don't care

548
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
you know because the audience

549
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
isn't going to

550
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
they're not going to say anything

551
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
you know I've never had a complaint about it

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and I get why like for guys like

553
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
hyper bit hero and gaming Brit and stuff

554
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you know they want the 60 frames

555
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
because they really care about that stuff

556
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
those guys they're fucking 60 frames per second

557
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
they're so into the idea of

558
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
like all games have to be 60 frames

559
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and I have to prove it through my

560
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I hear that if you kill yourself in the name of video games

561
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you go to heaven in art

562
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and live in a giant bed with 60 virgin frames

563
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it's like they think that by

564
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
is a virgin frame a frame with no picture in it

565
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
they think that by like putting the 60 frame

566
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
1080p video on YouTube

567
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
that that's going to help like sell people

568
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
on that but the reality is

569
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
that fucking 99%

570
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
of everybody is watching it windowed

571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
in 720 you know

572
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
we're not fucking upscaling it

573
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
60 frames makes my fucking computer chug

574
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
even on you know because YouTube's horribly optimized

575
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
for it so like

576
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm not going to fucking watch a video in 60 frames

577
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm not even going to play the game in 60 frames

578
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but like when it comes to me

579
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
collecting footage for a video like when I did

580
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
the Bloodborne vs Dark Souls

581
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
player character one it was like

582
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
most of the Dark Souls footage was from

583
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
me and Victor's Let's Play of Dark Souls

584
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
which was shitty looking in itself

585
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
because I had bad encoding for a lot of it

586
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and then I like you know grabbed like

587
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
cutscene footage from different

588
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's Plays and stuff or just cutscene uploads

589
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
on YouTube and then like for Bloodborne

590
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I captured a bunch of me like

591
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
testing out all the weapons

592
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
so because I like really needed footage of like

593
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
somebody just using weapons and stuff

594
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but like it was just you know

595
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
maybe 10 minutes. Luckily the PS4 makes that

596
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
pretty easy with this whole recording thing

597
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
well that thing sucks

598
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
because you can only record 15 minutes at a time

599
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you get to start a video and it's fucking retarded

600
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but I have an Elgato so it doesn't matter

601
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
so yeah I recorded like probably

602
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
like 20 minutes worth of

603
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
my own footage for that and then you know

604
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
pulled again cutscene footage and stuff from

605
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
online so like for me it's just like

606
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
how can I possibly edit this

607
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
with as little of me recording

608
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and like as specific of me recording as possible

609
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
so I don't have to scrub through anything

610
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and you know I'm willing to show

611
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
really non-specific shit

612
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you know just like I'm because a lot of my videos

613
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
are like me rambling about broad concepts anyway

614
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
so it doesn't need to be like a specific boss

615
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
or something but like yeah

616
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
there's like a sense of when I edit

617
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
there's a sense of desperation to be like

618
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I just want this fucking thing to be

619
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
out I want I don't want to have to go through

620
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
you know a huge

621
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
part of why I have DeVoo edit my videos

622
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and we'll get to this when we talk about

623
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
his editing process as well

624
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
is that DeVoo will

625
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll have him watch an entire

626
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
show for a video you know

627
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it'll be like um here's

628
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mob Psycho we just watched the whole show together

629
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
he goes and edits it and he puts

630
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
all 13 episodes of the show

631
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
into a thing and then he

632
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
edits it what I do

633
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
is any episode

634
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that I mentioned something that

635
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
like from that episode I take

636
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
that like let's say I mentioned that there's

637
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
a certain bad guy who does this

638
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
so I'll download the episode where that guy's

639
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
from and I'll put that in there

640
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
everything else is episode one

641
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
like or episode two sure

642
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
it's just anything you don't need that

643
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
bit yeah that's totally anything that's not

644
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
specific is just gonna be from episode one

645
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
so that I don't have to edit every

646
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you know I don't have to go through every episode looking for

647
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
stuff but that I mean

648
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
clearly what DeVoo's doing makes a better

649
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
product you know like that's why I hire him

650
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
to do it because he pulls scenes

651
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that I would have forgotten about or just

652
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
not bothered with whereas for me

653
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
like often times by the time I'm done editing

654
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
an anime video I have used

655
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
all of the good parts from episode one

656
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
like I have gutted that thing to death

657
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
you know and

658
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
and probably there's like

659
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
some 30 second chunk of the episode

660
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that just isn't edited at all

661
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
somewhere in there you know like for me

662
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it's like how can I maximize

663
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
impact with minimal effort

664
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
but you know it's funny you

665
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
if you can see like the way my files

666
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
look I have you know in Vegas

667
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
how you can put those like orange lines

668
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
with like a message indicator of like

669
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or a tag or whatever I discovered

670
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
my talent is fucking full of like

671
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
specific things that need to go here

672
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
here here here here for a full fucking

673
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that's I discovered that kind

674
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
of Vegas note taking because

675
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
of Neil X when he was doing the

676
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
elements of Brony series

677
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I had to render those for him

678
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
because like his computer his laptop

679
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
was weak and he needed it for work

680
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and he was like rendering those on a fucking

681
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
laptop yeah and he was like

682
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you know rendering this will

683
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
literally seize up my laptop all day

684
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I won't like I won't even be able to use it

685
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
so he would send me all the files

686
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
on copy which is like a

687
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Dropbox alternative

688
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
that is dead now dude that was

689
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
my fucking the first

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Gern Langen video the music one

691
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I made that whole thing on a laptop too

692
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and that fucking thing like Vegas

693
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
it was too long I used like clips from

694
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
like fucking a hundred episodes like

695
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
two movies they were all in the timeline

696
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
all to be loaded every time I opened it

697
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
it was like a ten minute process just waiting for that thing to load

698
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and after a while the fucking thing would not

699
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
play in the fucking preview window

700
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
so my tests for editing were

701
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to render the section

702
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
see if it looked okay if not okay adjust it

703
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
render it again see if it looks better

704
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
that's why that video took six months

705
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
to fucking make

706
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
anyway I know what that's like

707
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
well sorry a point I was making about

708
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Neil is that he would send me

709
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
like all of his project files which is these

710
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
huge folders cause those

711
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
videos were the longest shit and they had tons and tons of sources

712
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and he would have just like

713
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
shit loads of like notation

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
markers with like you know full sentences

715
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
in them like huge descriptors

716
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
like everything cause

717
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Neil is a fucking lawyer you know he's

718
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
like a study guy

719
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
he knows how to take notes and shit

720
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and like you open up his book

721
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and it looks like fucking Twilight Sparkles

722
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
annotations on a

723
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
fucking book you know it's crazy

724
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
how much stuff was in there I was like I didn't know Vegas could

725
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
do this stuff and to me

726
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
it's also pointless cause I'm like

727
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't need this organization I can just

728
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
memorize what everything is you know

729
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
but I guess for some people it's

730
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
more necessary

731
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
yeah you're a genius did you

732
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
we're all just a bunch of fucking fuck boy

733
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
idiots that's alright I agree

734
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I agree I just have good memory

735
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
but um whatever

736
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
what was I saying oh yeah um

737
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
in relation to like

738
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
forgive the fucking ten minute tangent

739
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
yeah I fucking

740
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
oh yeah Nate the

741
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
thing you were saying about every

742
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
video about something you love having to

743
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
or whoever said it being

744
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
something you love you can't you have this feeling of

745
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
you have to talk about

746
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
everything properly and stuff

747
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that's how I think that

748
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the way I write and the way that the fact

749
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that I record the gameplay

750
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
is because I need to make sure

751
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
that I'm right about whatever I'm about to say

752
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
so if I do

753
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
my Ratchet and Clank video

754
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
like I played the whole game again

755
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
and I record it and you know while I'm playing it

756
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I might as well record it so I have the footage of what I want to talk about

757
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and I play

758
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
the whole thing again just to make sure that yes

759
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that is true what I'm saying

760
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
dude there is nothing more devastating

761
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
for every miniscule review any miniscule

762
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
review is like a game that I'm not that interested in

763
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and I can make a short video and I can leave

764
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
out a lot of analysis and it's mostly

765
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
just me just

766
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
talking about something very vaguely

767
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
but the hypocrite reviews

768
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
they're usually long because

769
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I want to make sure that everything I say

770
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
is real

771
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
there is nothing more devastating than putting

772
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
something in a video that turns out to be

773
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
wrong in any way and

774
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
this is also what I'm

775
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
bad about this because I judge people

776
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
extremely harshly if they get

777
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
anything wrong in their videos too

778
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
when I said that Nio was 14

779
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
or when I said Yoko was 14

780
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
people were like no she's not what are you talking

781
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
about dude and this consumed

782
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
me for like a month and I had to do

783
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
an in-depth research campaign because I realized

784
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I actually had not investigated this

785
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
thoroughly enough to make that claim but in

786
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
time I was proven out to be correct

787
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I believe I found the proof for you

788
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
it was on some website or something

789
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
some developers

790
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
you were looking for it and I got interested

791
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and what I found was the official

792
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
the official Gurren Lagann website

793
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
in Japanese

794
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
when you translated it

795
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
it said Yoko is Simon's age

796
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
it specifically says

797
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
something like that

798
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I remember we had a big argument

799
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
because there's two uploads for that Gurren

800
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Lagann video the first one that's in my

801
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
playlist of deleted videos or whatever

802
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
because it got fucked up by copyright

803
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
there's a comment thread in there

804
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that's like the full discussion about

805
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that

806
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
oh god yeah

807
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
in regards to being wrong about stuff

808
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and like playing through the whole game

809
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
to make sure you're not wrong about stuff

810
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
it's funny because

811
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
unlike Nate I play very fast

812
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
and loose with facts

813
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
and when people point out something wrong

814
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
like if it's something I agree

815
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
is wrong I just kind of like

816
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
upvote their comment and comment on it

817
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and I'm like oh yeah good point

818
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and if it's something that like

819
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
because I'm very obstinate about the idea

820
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
that like it doesn't matter to have everything

821
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
right as long as you get the point

822
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
you know as long as the overall video

823
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is not wrong then that's what matters

824
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
this is something I've disagreed with you

825
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
for a long time about Digi don't you feel

826
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
a sense of journalistic integrity

827
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to need to represent those correctly

828
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
there is a phrase there is a phrase in the

829
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
journalistic world called you don't get

830
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the facts you get the truth

831
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
now I don't know how many journalists follow

832
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
along with that but if I may speak on behalf

833
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of Digi's research process

834
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that seems to be something that he does

835
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
can you break that down for me

836
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
when you tell stories of things that happen

837
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you usually tell a fairly condensed

838
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
version where things are a little bit

839
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
flanderized well the reason they say that is because

840
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
you can't really know

841
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
all the facts about everything

842
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
like there's always going to be some detail

843
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that maybe like if you're trying to talk about

844
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
say you know what the messages is

845
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
of Gurren Lagann for instance

846
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
like unless the creator

847
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
outright says like that's what I intended

848
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
then it's not so much that

849
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you're saying like a fact about it

850
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
as you're you know talking about

851
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
what it makes you think and what

852
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
what you think it's about

853
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
it's not so much whether or not you're able to present

854
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
this overwhelming symphony

855
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
of evidence that makes you look infallible

856
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it's more important that no one

857
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
in the comments is able to

858
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
create this symphony rebuttal that makes you

859
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
well that's fine and all

860
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
the thing is like

861
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
if you're basing your opinion

862
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
on something that you say

863
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and it's actually incorrect

864
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
then people will call you on that

865
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but like if your point is

866
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
this show is good because of the action

867
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
but you said the name of a character wrong

868
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
this show is good because of climate change

869
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
but if you say the name of a character wrong

870
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
that's not devaluing your point

871
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
your point is still correct

872
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the point of that video was

873
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
obviously my interpretation of things

874
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but if I had said Nia was 14

875
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and Nia was just wrong

876
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
then that's a whole different thing

877
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
but the thing is that the reason

878
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
you were talking about her

879
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
whether or not she's literally 14

880
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
didn't matter

881
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
the point is that she's Simon's age

882
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
that she's around that age

883
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that she's you know

884
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
relatively 14

885
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
is like what matters

886
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
not that she's literally 14

887
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
the argument that follows is based on that fact being true

888
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I say she's closer to Simone's age

889
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
because it's a thematically relevant

890
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
because it's about her not being like Kamena

891
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
she's closer to Simone

892
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
she's like more mature

893
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and you know that would still be true

894
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
if she was like 16 or even 18

895
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I guess

896
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
but the things are predicated on getting your facts right

897
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and if you get your facts wrong

898
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and then you have faulty interpretations

899
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
then you're just misleading people

900
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and I'm not saying that you're evil

901
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'm just saying it's your responsibility

902
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I have definitely had

903
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
like frequently

904
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I have just like outright

905
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
incorrect facts in my video

906
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and people will point it out

907
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
but like usually

908
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I mean it never creates an uproar

909
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
it's never destroyed a video

910
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
at worst one guy gets mad

911
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and leaves a comment about it

912
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and I laugh at him for being a comment

913
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
this is actually a large motivating factor

914
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
for why I'm interested in making videos

915
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
in a series as opposed to one standalone obelisk

916
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
because if I get something wrong

917
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
like the first one like YMS did

918
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
in his review of

919
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Synecdoche New York I think

920
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
then like in the next video you can say oh by the way

921
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
maybe guys I saw you commenting about this

922
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I got this a little wrong or

923
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I just want to clarify this point

924
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
something like that is a very useful tool

925
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I did that in the SAO2 video

926
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I made this pretty glaring mistake

927
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
in the original and I corrected it in the sequel

928
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
but I also made the defense in that video

929
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
that like you know yeah I got this wrong

930
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and I shouldn't have got it wrong

931
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
but the point I was making

932
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
stands like

933
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
it didn't matter that I was wrong about that

934
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
in the grand scheme of what I was trying

935
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
to say about Kirito

936
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I just think it is such a valuable thing

937
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
to like to be able to say that to

938
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to be able to show like I have

939
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
seen your arguments on this particular point

940
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
and created you know a rebuttal to it

941
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
or an opinion and doing like a multi-part series

942
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
like that is the perfect way to handle it

943
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I really wish it was easier to like

944
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
on YouTube to keep

945
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
at it or something

946
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
like you can always do

947
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
a follow-up video but it's always

948
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
going to have way less attention

949
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
given to it and like

950
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I mean it's nice to be able

951
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I used to kind of like obsessively

952
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
want this but now I've just kind of given up

953
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
because I've gotten to that audience size where I just

954
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
it's unmanageable

955
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
where like if I make a video

956
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
that blows up and I make a small mistake

957
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
in it and then I were to make a follow-up

958
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
video where I correct that small mistake

959
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
it's cool that I've

960
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
recognized it and that it's out there

961
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and I have my conscience is clean

962
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but the number of people who are actually

963
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
going to go find that video

964
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
is so much less than the number of people who are just

965
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
going to keep commenting on the original about how I fucked up

966
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
you know it's like a newspaper retraction

967
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
like buried in like the depth of

968
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
whatever that says by the way that guy wasn't

969
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
the murderer it was the other guy sorry about that

970
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
please don't kill that guy to this day

971
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
new comments on my first

972
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
SAO video come out

973
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that criticized that mistake

974
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
you know like yeah of course nobody reads

975
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the comments so there's probably like several hundred

976
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
comments about that specific mistake

977
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
on that video even though I corrected it

978
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
two years ago you know

979
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
there's just no there's no victory

980
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
with that and so I've kind of given up

981
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
like I like to be able to address mistakes

982
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
but it's like you know

983
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
if you care that much read the fucking comments

984
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
cause yeah

985
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
yeah there's something to that argument I think

986
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
in that specific situation

987
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
there's probably just butthurt people who love SAO

988
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
so even if you did have a follow up

989
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
they wouldn't give you shit anyway so

990
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
yeah being butthurt doesn't make your argument invalid

991
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
but whatever this alright we've addressed this

992
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm sorry Gib we interrupted you

993
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
in a big way

994
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
oh yeah I guess we're still talking about my stuff

995
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
yeah

996
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I guess we could talk about

997
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I have a question that could springboard you into something you can talk about

998
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that we can't interrupt you on because I don't know the reason

999
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I think you've probably addressed this somewhere before

1000
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
but where did the

1001
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
idea for the green screen just sitting around

1002
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
on shit come from

1003
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
cause that is the fucking coolest

1004
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
idea

1005
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
oh hang on you cut out for the idea

1006
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
oh I think you said the green screen like effects

1007
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
for a GRPJ and shit

1008
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
where did you get the idea and just like I'm just gonna throw this on the ground

1009
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
in a pile

1010
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
it's fucking great

1011
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
well I just thought

1012
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I mean I wanted to have

1013
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
the whole thing with the GRPJ

1014
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
it was supposed to be the least amount of editing

1015
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
even though it's still quite intensive because I got to cut out all the stuff that I

1016
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
like you know

1017
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the pauses and stuff

1018
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
but I wanted it to be

1019
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
as least editing

1020
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
possible so I thought I'll just film myself

1021
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
doing the whole thing

1022
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
there but I thought that would be too boring

1023
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
so I thought I'll put a thing in the corner

1024
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
with the game footage

1025
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
but I also thought I don't want to have to

1026
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
edit the game footage to be that relevant

1027
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and

1028
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I didn't really care so I thought

1029
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
well I'll put a green screen up

1030
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
but I couldn't find a way to put the green screen up well

1031
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
so I just threw it in the background

1032
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and from then on it became a meme

1033
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm just now I'm gonna

1034
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
put things

1035
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
creative ways you've been using green screen since then

1036
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and like other videos

1037
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
is great

1038
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I would say it started before that

1039
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
because on the give and take channel

1040
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
then like there's been a long history

1041
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
of these weird green screen

1042
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
meme videos but originally

1043
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
on an actual green screen he would just

1044
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
remove all the green from

1045
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
the actual footage

1046
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
it'd be like him in the grass

1047
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
outside and then remove all the green from the grass

1048
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
and put another clip down there

1049
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
even your rayman video

1050
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
when you're like oh I'm gonna be rayman

1051
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
so I just wear green sleeves

1052
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and key out my arm

1053
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
it was fucking great

1054
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
that was great and not even just

1055
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
green screens but like your jump cut jack

1056
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
video is fucking great

1057
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
just you know it's actually

1058
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
green screens I actually had a moment

1059
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
where I watched jump cut jack back the other day

1060
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and like realized that

1061
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you created a sentence

1062
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
through all those jump cuts

1063
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
which means that like every position you got into

1064
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
you had to say a tiny fragment of a word

1065
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
right well what I did

1066
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I said the whole sentence and then

1067
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
moved a bit said the whole sentence and then I spliced it

1068
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
all together oh perfect still genius

1069
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I hadn't even thought about like

1070
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
hey guys jump cut jack

1071
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
back here with another fucking

1072
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
video

1073
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
it's genius

1074
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
but yeah speaking of

1075
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
live action we could talk about

1076
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
the process for that because that is quite a lot

1077
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
of extra bullshit though

1078
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I feel like I'm obliged to do

1079
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
but I also enjoy doing it because

1080
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I can pull funny faces and that's funny

1081
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but it's

1082
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
it's a lot of hassle having a camera and

1083
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
lighting and getting a

1084
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
no one understands how much fucking harder

1085
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
it is to do live action that it is

1086
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
to do footage and it seems

1087
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I mean like okay if it's a vlog that's

1088
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
easiest thing in the world right turn on some

1089
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
shitty lights and

1090
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
point a fucking phone at yourself and record

1091
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
but like if you're trying to make something look

1092
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
good then it's not

1093
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
just a matter of like

1094
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
lighting yourself you have to

1095
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
you have to basically become a director

1096
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
because the lighting also

1097
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
has to reflect the tone of what you're doing this is the huge

1098
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
this is the big fucking problem I have with

1099
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
John Tron like with his modern videos

1100
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
is that he has like the

1101
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
high budget set the high budget lighting the high

1102
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
budget cameras it's all like pristine

1103
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and clean and beautiful but the

1104
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
way that it's lit

1105
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
is not fun he's making fun

1106
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
videos with this like dour

1107
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
cold lighting set

1108
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that does not look like a place somebody lives

1109
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
and it's fucking weird

1110
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and like that's and that really detracts

1111
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
from the comedy because it just feels like what the fuck

1112
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
why are you on a set why aren't you in your house

1113
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
playing video games that's what the narrative

1114
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
is suggesting of the video

1115
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
you know it's a weird

1116
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
like it's not quite

1117
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
awkward enough to be awkward funny

1118
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and it's not quite funny enough it's not quite

1119
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
light-hearted enough to be a video game

1120
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
romp

1121
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
it's weird total garbage

1122
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and then you watch like hypocrites videos

1123
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and it's usually just like natural lighting it seems

1124
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
like you just open like a curtain yeah

1125
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it looks like you're in your room

1126
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
you know

1127
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
because I can't really film anywhere else

1128
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
but yeah the natural lighting

1129
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I always try to do that because I don't have

1130
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
a big old bunch of lights

1131
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
with stands and stuff so

1132
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I usually try to film during the day

1133
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
when I have the window open and stuff

1134
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
getting the light in

1135
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
but for this Rayman video I had

1136
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
a genius idea that nobody would have picked up on

1137
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
obviously because I didn't show it

1138
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
but you see my TV

1139
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
the big TV on the thing

1140
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you might see in certain shots

1141
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
in certain videos or whatever

1142
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and all I did was I got

1143
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
a 1920 by 1080

1144
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
picture of

1145
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
just white

1146
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
just ffffff white

1147
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
put it on a USB plug that into the TV

1148
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and then just had that be on the TV

1149
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
just a big white TV

1150
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
thing and that lit me from the front

1151
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
as I recorded

1152
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
hey good thinking I've done stuff like that with

1153
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
like when I'm recording a vlog I might turn up

1154
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
the brightness on my monitor all the way

1155
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and just have that be like lighting for me

1156
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
because

1157
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
my house, my room especially

1158
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
like even though my room has three windows

1159
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
getting ffffking like natural lighting

1160
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
is really hard because just the way the windows

1161
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
are angled and my room is huge

1162
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and I usually film at night

1163
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and like lighting this fffking

1164
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
room is impossible it just

1165
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
swallows light like we would

1166
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
do all this stuff and if you watch my older videos

1167
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
where I had like you know vlogs or had myself

1168
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
on camera in certain videos if you want to see the worst

1169
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
look at the lucky star video

1170
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
that's what happened when I tried to

1171
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
light myself because

1172
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
when Victor's around you know he does this

1173
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
professionally and he'll take three lights

1174
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
and he'll fffking set him up and he can make something

1175
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
presentable but like when it's

1176
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
me by myself trying to light myself

1177
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I can't see where the lights are pointing

1178
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
on me I can't see where I'm

1179
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
casting shadows I can't see

1180
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
where you know if the camera is pointing at me

1181
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
correctly I can't fffking adjust focus

1182
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
on a DSLR on myself

1183
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
because I have to lean forward

1184
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
to adjust the focus and then lean back

1185
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I'm doing all that right now

1186
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
it's fffking it's a huge pain in the ass

1187
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and

1188
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
it sucks ass because it's

1189
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
always gonna look shit

1190
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
you can never make it look great

1191
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it's just gonna look like acceptable enough

1192
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
that you can publish it but you can't make it look

1193
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
great that way

1194
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
and if you see that fffking lucky star

1195
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
video it's like every single shot

1196
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
the lighting is different and terrible

1197
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
it's all every single one is

1198
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
in a different bad way

1199
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
sometimes I'm too blown out sometimes

1200
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
the shadows are too harsh sometimes the casting shadows

1201
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
on my face the framing isn't quite right

1202
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I just had the camera just out of reach

1203
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and that was with shade helping me like I had

1204
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
someone helping but shade

1205
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
doesn't know what the fffking is doing you know

1206
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
so like if you don't have a crew

1207
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
to help you film live action

1208
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
segments then just don't

1209
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and that's why I don't you know

1210
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it's like something really brief or simple

1211
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
or easy and thankfully my new

1212
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
phone like can capture

1213
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
just enough light that like I did a little

1214
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
live action segment in my you know

1215
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
high school anime video where it's

1216
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
that was just filmed on my phone with just

1217
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
the lighting of my room and it looks fine

1218
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
because that phone could capture enough

1219
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
but even in that shot the framing is slightly

1220
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
off because I had to use the

1221
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
outward facing camera which I can't look

1222
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
at I can't see what it's filming

1223
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
so I just kind of pointed it as best I could

1224
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
to look at me but you know my chin's

1225
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
a little too low my head's not quite

1226
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
at the top of the frame and I'm a fffking

1227
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
stickler for that stuff so

1228
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
you know that fffking

1229
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
a fffking CWC

1230
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
lecture bended with

1231
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
you know Victor camera-ing

1232
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and doing all the light it looks great

1233
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
it looks wonderful you know

1234
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
that was a shot I mean you can see in the three

1235
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
if you watch the 360 version of that

1236
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
you can see there's a whole fffking light

1237
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
set up like there's like three or four lights

1238
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
professional lights and Victor is

1239
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
sitting up on a stool with this huge

1240
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
tripod and this giant fffking camera

1241
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
rig you know like it's it was

1242
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
shot professionally

1243
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
you gotta have a lot of patience to be a

1244
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
cameraman just fffking sit there and watch

1245
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that's why I can't even do it like

1246
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
nobody wants to watch you talk about

1247
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
anime for ten minutes in your room

1248
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
you know speaking of

1249
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
cameras

1250
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I film all my stuff

1251
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
on a camcorder and it's mostly

1252
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
because I can turn the screen around and flip

1253
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
so I can adjust myself see how I look

1254
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and I know I know Nate

1255
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
you have a problem with this because you use a DSLR

1256
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
dude let me just tell you I might the fffking

1257
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I can't remember the word again

1258
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I used my shitty DSLR doesn't

1259
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
have a flip around you should have seen the fffking

1260
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
process I went through like an hour of that

1261
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
time was just focusing getting back

1262
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
filming a little bit running back

1263
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
watching it see if it was focused adjusting

1264
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
doing it repeat that process for fffking hour

1265
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
but I got it eventually what camera

1266
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'll tell you afterward I don't know

1267
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
a piece of shit that I don't like

1268
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
it's like a rebel T2I right

1269
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I have a T2I right now

1270
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and I have found a way to solve this

1271
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
problem very simply it will cost you

1272
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
six dollars and you can fix this problem

1273
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
let a stand up mirror

1274
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
shop after this

1275
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
it's fffking great

1276
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
wait was it a stand up mirror

1277
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
is that the six dollars solution

1278
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I mean that's one you could do too but I have another

1279
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I'll talk about when I talk about my video stuff

1280
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
okay cool yeah great great

1281
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
but yeah the you can

1282
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
tell my camcorder quality camera

1283
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
is not that great and I

1284
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
could be using my dad's DSLR

1285
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
because he doesn't use it that much

1286
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
but you know I always choose

1287
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
practicality for shooting over

1288
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
the quality because when I record

1289
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
my camera my camcorder is really terrible

1290
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
for low light so when I usually

1291
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
try to record it's during the day

1292
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and I only have a few hours especially in winter

1293
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
when the days are shorter and I wake

1294
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
up late and I'm like okay I got to do all this

1295
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I got to set up my mic just out of shot

1296
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
so that it can pick up my audio

1297
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
because my camera audio is terrible

1298
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I have to have that there and I have to

1299
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
do the performances I have to do them over

1300
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and over again to get them right and I'm not

1301
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
ever entirely sure how good they

1302
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
are until I'm done oh and

1303
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
my computer fffking my computer fan

1304
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
is really loud you might be able to hear it

1305
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
in my audio right now but

1306
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
every time I record something

1307
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
either just voice over

1308
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
all my live action I have to turn my computer off

1309
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
get my laptop out and put it on the other

1310
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
side of the room and then plug in the things

1311
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
from there so that there's no noise

1312
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
and it's just like

1313
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
20-30 minutes of setting up just to do

1314
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
like 5 or 6 small takes and then move

1315
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
the camera do a few more

1316
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
it's a bitch I think your live

1317
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
action segments come out great

1318
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
because and that's what

1319
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I want to emphasize to the audience here is like

1320
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
yeah Gibbons using a shittier camera

1321
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
but you're using like Z optimal

1322
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
circumstances for it and that takes

1323
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
patience and time

1324
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
it's like you can only film

1325
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
during these hours of the day

1326
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
during this certain time and like and also you

1327
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
can't you know you couldn't film

1328
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
like multiple takes of the same like let's say

1329
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
you filmed uh like you saying

1330
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
half a sentence and then hour later said

1331
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
the other half the sun's in a different place

1332
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
it looks totally different you know like you can't

1333
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
fuck around too much with this stuff

1334
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
and like yeah so the reason

1335
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Hippo is able to have stuff that still

1336
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
looks good in spite of the equipment is

1337
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
that patience that I don't have

1338
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
because for me everything has to be like

1339
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
instantaneous I need this video Don it has to be

1340
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
on my desk by Tuesday I have to just

1341
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
film it in the shit conditions I have

1342
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
you know for all the videos

1343
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
that I film in my

1344
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
my cabin garage thing at the end

1345
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
of the gun where you can see the drumset and all

1346
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
that um that's

1347
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
all like I have to stay down there for

1348
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
2-3 hours because like

1349
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the Harry Potter one I do a lot of skits the

1350
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Jack and Daxter what all all those

1351
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
things I do a lot of skits as well as

1352
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
doing a lot of like talking to the camera

1353
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
which I don't do anymore I tried not to do

1354
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
any live action where I'm just speaking

1355
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
because there's no point it has to be

1356
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
either a skit or like a cutaway

1357
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
gag to a visual of me doing a funny face

1358
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
anything else is too

1359
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
is too like there's

1360
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
no reason for me to record that because it's just extra

1361
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
work right and the hardest

1362
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
thing is is not just

1363
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
getting it all done but like trying to get it all

1364
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
done at once because that's I can't

1365
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
really do it the next day and if I do

1366
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
it's sort of weird so I've got to do

1367
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
everything in one go

1368
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
and it's

1369
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
hard to keep your voice going and to keep

1370
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
energized and I'm like

1371
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
by the end god like trying to match

1372
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
a later voiceover with one you did

1373
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
oh yeah it's impossible

1374
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
that's that goes for voiceovers too I try

1375
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
to do them all in one go and sometimes

1376
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
my voice is not noticeably

1377
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
like

1378
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
haggard by the end of it and you might be able to

1379
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
tell in some videos where I'm like

1380
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
but I kept that in anyway because

1381
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I can't be bullet to do it again

1382
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
because you're a goddamn professional

1383
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
how many takes do you usually

1384
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
like do you have to do multiple

1385
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
takes on most lines or would you say it's like

1386
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
only occasionally like

1387
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
do you usually get through the whole thing in one sitting

1388
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
well I usually

1389
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
get through the whole thing in one sitting but I the

1390
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
sittings are very long and how much longer

1391
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
is the recording than what

1392
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
the video is

1393
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
let me think

1394
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I mean I do multiple takes

1395
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
for every line at least one other take

1396
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
just in case the first one wasn't bad

1397
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
was bad sometimes I don't do

1398
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
multiple takes and the take I thought was alright

1399
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
doesn't actually sound good

1400
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and I'm like I hate me

1401
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
but I mean I know Jesse

1402
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
records like hours for each of his

1403
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
yeah it's I mean for that

1404
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Rayman thing I'm trying to think

1405
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I mean the the session was like two and a half

1406
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
hours but that was for part two as well

1407
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
right so

1408
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
it's it's a lot of extra time like

1409
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
it's a ten minute video is probably like 45

1410
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
minutes to an hour of

1411
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
of doing the recording

1412
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Nate how about you

1413
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I definitely don't

1414
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
do every line like I feel

1415
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
like I have a pretty good sense for if I fucked up a line

1416
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and like if

1417
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm just going through I try to do the whole thing

1418
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
in just one take and don't really worry if I got it right

1419
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
if I did it wrong I'll just repeat the line

1420
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and then just place it in later and then like

1421
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I'm more inclined to try to get the thing

1422
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
done reasonably good and then if there's

1423
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
a problem after I put in Vegas and I'm editing

1424
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
then I'll just do it over yeah usually what I

1425
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
do is if I think the first

1426
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
half of a paragraph I say is okay

1427
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
and I find like I

1428
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
like I mess up the second half I find

1429
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I think of the area where I could

1430
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
splice in a second take of the second

1431
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
half and then I just say that part

1432
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
again instead of I do that too I

1433
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
mean I definitely don't think

1434
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
my method could work for Hippo because

1435
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
your comedy is so much

1436
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
about line delivery and it's like

1437
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
there's so many moments in that Rayman

1438
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
video where it's just the way you say a word

1439
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
makes me fucking laugh what's the

1440
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
eggplant but the other word for it

1441
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
aubergine

1442
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
what the fuck is an aubergine is that an eggplant

1443
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
yes

1444
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
well what the fuck why don't you say eggplant

1445
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
because I'm not an American you

1446
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
crazy boy

1447
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
the machine sounds way funnier when you're

1448
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
implying it also sounds French so

1449
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
it's just like the British word or like

1450
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
the European word for it or something

1451
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
it's just the word that non-Americans say I think

1452
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
man

1453
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
like for me you're an inferior

1454
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
race my recordings are usually

1455
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
at most like two to five minutes

1456
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
longer than the actual

1457
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
video like it's just any

1458
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
if I stumble over a line

1459
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I redo it but it's immediate it's just like

1460
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
this time I was

1461
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
wait this time I was

1462
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
you know like

1463
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
there are some lines that will stop me up

1464
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
for a good 30 seconds or something

1465
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
there's some little tongue twisters in my

1466
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
scripts but it's all one go

1467
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
and recently when I did

1468
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
because there's five videos I have coming out

1469
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
in November all of them being edited by DeVue

1470
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I've written them all before November started

1471
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
wait five are coming out in November it's already

1472
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
halfway through dog

1473
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
alright there's already two out

1474
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
oh I thought you meant they were all coming

1475
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
no no no five total and

1476
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I had written them all before November and

1477
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
like I had them all sitting there and I just

1478
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
literally went into my closet

1479
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
for two and a half hours and recorded all five

1480
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
of them in one session so

1481
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
if you listen to these five videos back to back

1482
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
you'll notice my voice sounds the same in all of them

1483
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
which is not normal usually I sound kind of

1484
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
different in each video this one is just like

1485
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I fucking just

1486
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
belted them out one after another and by the end

1487
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I was dead

1488
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
yeah I really wish I could do that

1489
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
yeah

1490
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
but I don't think it would work for you

1491
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
because it's the comedy would not

1492
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
come through you know unless you

1493
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I love doing the uh

1494
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I love doing the script recording I just

1495
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
wish that I produced scripts faster that I

1496
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
could record and then do shit with

1497
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
yeah it's always got it's always feels so good

1498
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
getting getting a script done

1499
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
is hell and I feel

1500
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
great when I put the video when I record it

1501
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
put it into Vegas and I start

1502
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
to edit I'm like yes this is what I

1503
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
was born to do being the editing process

1504
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and then of course a month later when I'm only

1505
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
halfway through editing the thing I wish I was dead but

1506
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
you know yeah

1507
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the way I do the editing

1508
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
usually like I said I don't do the music

1509
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
first I do the music last

1510
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
what I do is I get my audio put it in

1511
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
obviously and I put that that blue

1512
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
background on and I basically

1513
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I cut every section where there's a live

1514
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
action bit and you know

1515
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
space them out really far and then I

1516
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
just go through it

1517
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and then

1518
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
first I put like the game footage

1519
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and then I leave like editing bits with

1520
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
images and stuff for later

1521
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
so I've got all the game footage and then

1522
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
that's like the skeleton of everything the

1523
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
skeleton of the review that's the

1524
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
timings that it's going to be

1525
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
not always though

1526
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I can see why you like making videos if it

1527
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
involves skeletons

1528
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
yes

1529
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
the backbone

1530
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
rattle rattle

1531
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
first and then live action

1532
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and once everything is in place where

1533
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
it's like I can reasonably say

1534
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
this video is going to be a certain number of minutes long

1535
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
then I will start

1536
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
properly going over it I don't usually

1537
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
do that I've tried to start

1538
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
doing that like I'm usually I would

1539
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
just go and do the finished

1540
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
thing

1541
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
but now I'm trying to

1542
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
do like a first draft of the thing so

1543
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I go through it and I finish it

1544
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and then I know it's not done so I go over

1545
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
it again and all that

1546
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
yeah that's reasonable

1547
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
yeah you know this highlights I think

1548
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
a difference in the way I've seen Hippo

1549
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
and Nate's editing based

1550
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
on screenshots of their Vegas

1551
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
timelines is that you guys

1552
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I believe just put in the full

1553
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
recording of your narration and then

1554
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
edit the audio as you go

1555
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
true is that true yeah no I

1556
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
edit the thing in

1557
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
audacity and then if I need to

1558
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
add pauses or

1559
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
cut things out then I will edit

1560
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it in Vegas. I just remember seeing a screenshot

1561
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
of one of your timelines and

1562
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
the audio track had tons of cuts

1563
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
constantly was that just you adjusting

1564
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
for timing are you sure that was me

1565
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm not sure I saw one of you

1566
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
but maybe not maybe I just

1567
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I saw Nate I thought it was you for one time

1568
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I mean I know that

1569
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I do eventually cut

1570
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
the audio a lot but like

1571
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I just just to move

1572
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
it around a bit like if I feel like this

1573
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
this joke needs like

1574
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
half a second of

1575
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
quiet after it I will cut it there

1576
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
and maybe it looks like a lot

1577
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I don't know the way I remember

1578
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
ever posting my Vegas timeline

1579
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the way I do audio is like

1580
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
you know I recorded an audacity

1581
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
then I remove all the gaps and all the

1582
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
mistakes and then it's just like this tightly

1583
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
grouped thing that I put it in Vegas

1584
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and I add gaps back into it

1585
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
then I like once it's all perfectly

1586
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
formulated then I you know render that

1587
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and then put the full file in

1588
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
and the reason is that I

1589
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I have a tendency I want everything to be

1590
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
like as as unbroken as possible

1591
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
because it's so easy to fucking

1592
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
misplace things and move them around

1593
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
without realizing it and then

1594
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
you know then you've already made

1595
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
a hundred more edits and saved

1596
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and you don't know what happened to that

1597
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
audio file that was accidentally grouped

1598
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
with some clip you deleted

1599
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and did you know I gotta

1600
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
say you don't you use

1601
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Vegas still right yeah

1602
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
for the for things like that

1603
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
you could open a new Vegas

1604
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
file and then drag

1605
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
the old Vegas file into the new one

1606
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and then it will just be a continuous

1607
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
thing so you won't have to render it at all

1608
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
what do you mean exactly

1609
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
oh like if you do the audio

1610
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
editing adding the pauses in one Vegas file

1611
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
and you drag that file into another

1612
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
a new Vegas file it will become

1613
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
a street like a single chunk of audio

1614
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
yes in a premiere that is known

1615
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
as sub sequences and

1616
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
nested projects that is what I do as well

1617
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
yeah I know Davoo's way

1618
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
into sub sequences I need to do that

1619
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
shit with Vegas because like I you know

1620
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
what I do instead and this is retarded I should just

1621
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
be this is why I need to use premiere it just is not

1622
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
working with my fucking drivers I need to

1623
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
re-steal it from the internet instead

1624
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
of that I will like I'll take all the

1625
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I'll take the keyframes on like

1626
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
two different tracks and I will just have

1627
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
them be the exact same keyframes

1628
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
between all the tracks and then sometimes

1629
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
there's gonna be like ten fucking things

1630
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
moving and that need to like expand

1631
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
or like glide along a path

1632
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
it's retarded it's the worst idea

1633
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
okay well like if there's two things on the

1634
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
screen and they need to move in the same way

1635
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
what you should do is have them be part of

1636
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
the same sub sequence and then animate that

1637
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
sub sequence in a particular way

1638
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
but what I've been doing instead for the longest

1639
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
time just because Vegas doesn't make it easy

1640
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
to do it the other way is I just

1641
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
will keyframe those two with

1642
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
the exact same keyframes you know so

1643
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
moving together that you could make a sub

1644
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
sequence to do that

1645
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
well you know a Gibbs dad discovered it one day

1646
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I've recently learned

1647
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
the I don't

1648
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I don't know why they're called not called sub sequences

1649
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
maybe something else but nesting if you right

1650
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
click a bunch of video and premiere

1651
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and you right right click

1652
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and there's a menu and you click nest

1653
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
it flattens it all down into another

1654
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
sequence what you can

1655
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
holy shit yeah you just highlight it

1656
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
right click nest and it becomes

1657
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
its own video file that include

1658
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
if you double click on that it goes to

1659
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
all the files that you just squashed

1660
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and then you can move that

1661
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
it's probably the same

1662
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
thing but oh my god

1663
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
alright and then you can move that as its own

1664
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
thing what hippo just described is exactly

1665
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
like what subsequences already are

1666
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
so yeah you have

1667
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I know I know I've used premiere and I use

1668
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
subsequences I just didn't know that existed

1669
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
in Vegas but this is

1670
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm talking about premiere

1671
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
oh well fuck it never mind

1672
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
yeah no everything

1673
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
for me I don't do anything fancy

1674
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
within the events that I do

1675
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
edit but like the reason that subsequence

1676
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
thing with the audio wouldn't help me is that I

1677
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
send all my completed audio files to DeVoo

1678
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
and he edits it around

1679
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
so yeah and he

1680
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
usually doesn't do anything to the audio

1681
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
it's just like a purely the unbroken track

1682
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
unless I have to request something like

1683
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
with the Kuroko no Basket

1684
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
video where we later added in like chapter

1685
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
headers and just had to split

1686
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
all those up but I'm so fucking particular

1687
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
about audio and

1688
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I'm teaching myself

1689
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
to care less about audio

1690
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
but at the same time it keeps getting more

1691
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
complicated because like you know I've got

1692
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
all this fucking great audio equipment

1693
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
and I surround myself with it and I

1694
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
criticize people on their audio and I'm like

1695
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I really want it to be perfect because

1696
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I listen to everything through

1697
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
speakers through like a pretty good

1698
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
set of speakers and I can

1699
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
tell massively the difference

1700
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
between audio quality of different things

1701
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
but people who are on shitty speakers

1702
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
can't and like Ben

1703
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
had no idea

1704
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
that his audio was worse than everyone else's

1705
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
on the PCP he legitimately

1706
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
did not know really yeah he had no idea

1707
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
oh god so

1708
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
all this time I failed as a father you know

1709
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
he sounded like a tin can because he just

1710
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
listens to it there was laptop speakers you know

1711
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
or like the headphones he uses which are like

1712
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
fucking stock

1713
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
like iPod headphones

1714
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
so

1715
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
he's listening to it in garbage quality audio

1716
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
so everyone sounds just as shitty

1717
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and but that's how like most people

1718
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
do like most people don't have a nice

1719
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
set of studio monitors or a

1720
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
fucking $150 pair of headphones

1721
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
most people are either listening to it like

1722
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
on their cell phone or their laptop

1723
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and so like that's why so many people

1724
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
can get away with having such shitty audio

1725
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
like you know Jimquisition doesn't feel the need

1726
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
to update his fucking audio quality

1727
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
or movie Bob or something because

1728
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
it's never been a problem for enough people

1729
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and like I've kind of

1730
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
learned to accept that but then

1731
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
fucking god damn like

1732
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
because it used to be that

1733
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I wouldn't do vlogs because I had to set up

1734
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
my fucking microphone you know it's like such

1735
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
a pain in the ass to have the microphone just off screen

1736
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
and but like you don't want it to be

1737
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
intrusive in the video but then it's also

1738
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
just a pain to set it up and all that it's like I just want to be able

1739
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
to touch and go so I had my

1740
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Galaxy Note 3 and

1741
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
that thing I was using the

1742
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
inward-facing camera which looks like dog shit

1743
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
but the fucking microphone

1744
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
was on the inside so it sounded

1745
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
decent and it has pretty good

1746
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
like it kind of auto compresses

1747
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
the audio so it actually sounds

1748
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
pretty good comparatively

1749
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
so I used that for all these vlogs

1750
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
and stuff and then I upgraded

1751
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
to the

1752
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
you know first I had the Note 7 had to replace

1753
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that now I got the S7 Edge this

1754
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
thing has a much better front facing

1755
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
camera but the fucking microphone

1756
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
is on the outside

1757
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
and it records in stereo

1758
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and you can never whether you're recording

1759
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
inside or outside you can never

1760
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
have the audio levels of the left and right channel

1761
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
be equal so the left channel will be

1762
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
super loud and the right channel

1763
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
will be super quiet so what I've been

1764
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
having to do is then

1765
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
like I put the whole file into Vegas

1766
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and then I'll split it into left

1767
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
and right and then

1768
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
because you can't do that in Vegas so I have to

1769
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
render it as a WAV put it in audacity

1770
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
split the left and right track make the left track

1771
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
mono put that like render that

1772
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
put that into Vegas this doesn't

1773
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
take long it's just a pain in the ass

1774
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
are you sure there isn't a setting to record

1775
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
the audio in just mono

1776
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
there's nothing like that on the phone I mean that's not normal

1777
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
like mono recording

1778
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
is mostly for high-end devices

1779
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
it's not normal for stuff to even

1780
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
offer that so which is fucking

1781
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
sucks and it's just bizarre

1782
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
yeah well it's funny too because I always

1783
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
thought on the old phone I thought it was

1784
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
weird that the microphone was on the front

1785
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
facing camera because it seemed obvious

1786
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
that you're mostly going to be filming other stuff

1787
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
not yourself because most people are vloggers

1788
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
this is the selfie age my friend you're going to be

1789
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
filming yourself 100% of the time so now it's

1790
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
just weird they put it on the other side instead

1791
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
but like it sucks for me because

1792
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
that audio will sound like dog shit

1793
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
when I mix it that way like it you know

1794
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
it's even worse than it would have been so

1795
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
now I'm like well I guess I gotta

1796
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
fucking hook up the microphone every time I want to do a

1797
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
vlog again which thankfully I have a much longer

1798
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
XLR cable than I used to so that's not

1799
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
as much of a pain but

1800
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
yeah that's like

1801
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
it's just such a nightmare to do anything

1802
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
why is everything

1803
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
so hard

1804
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
yeah that's

1805
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
what it comes down to

1806
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
so where were we

1807
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I was gonna

1808
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
talk about

1809
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
because we know the process

1810
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
we have like what we do

1811
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but there's always that moment where we're like

1812
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1813
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I'm stuck I don't know what I don't

1814
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
feel like I know what I'm doing right now

1815
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and I try to alleviate that by writing

1816
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
in the script ahead of time how I should

1817
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
edit some parts or how I should

1818
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
record some live

1819
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
action bits like

1820
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
like extensive notes like so that there's

1821
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
no way that I could interpret it in

1822
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
properly like two weeks later

1823
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
when I'm actually doing stuff

1824
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
but

1825
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
there's always that moment where you're like

1826
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I

1827
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
like

1828
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
there's usually a process that you have to

1829
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
come up with to get out of that or to just

1830
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
keep going and for me

1831
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I don't really have one yet

1832
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
some people they can find out ways to

1833
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
like

1834
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
just do stuff

1835
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
when they don't know what they're doing

1836
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
the most dangerous thing you can do in a moment

1837
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
is like start a new video that you're interested

1838
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
in and then you got two and like oh no

1839
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I never start another

1840
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
well actually I do sometimes

1841
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
make like a video that

1842
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
hair thing that Voldemorty video

1843
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I made that because I just had an idea

1844
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
the best thing you've ever made it's a sensation

1845
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
it's got 11,000 views somehow

1846
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
holy shit

1847
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
yes

1848
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I just thought oh wouldn't it be

1849
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
cool if I could turn my head into my heads

1850
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
there while I was editing Rayman

1851
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
so I just put Rayman on hold

1852
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I filmed it in five minutes

1853
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I put it up and I'm like okay now

1854
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
back to editing I'm like wait a minute

1855
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
no I should do something else I should

1856
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
look at all my

1857
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
all the comments in every single thing I've ever

1858
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
ever made

1859
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
you go down that rabbit hole but

1860
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
why would you ever do that

1861
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm glad I have too many videos for that to even

1862
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
be slightly viable

1863
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
oh yeah every time I go to my

1864
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
notifications there's like oh

1865
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
there's a brand new comment on give and take

1866
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I better look at it

1867
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
we're not over that hill yet we will one day

1868
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
but right now

1869
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
two years gone on a notification bell

1870
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
but yeah

1871
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I really wish

1872
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
it was easy to just keep

1873
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
editing because sometimes you get on a roll

1874
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
and it's great but a lot of the time

1875
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm not on a roll I'm just sort of like

1876
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
forcing myself to get to a certain

1877
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
point before the end of the day like I've been

1878
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
writing on a pad of paper in front of me

1879
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
every time I get to

1880
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
today I was like okay

1881
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
get to the two minute mark

1882
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
of the Rayman part two and I'm almost there

1883
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
but things came up

1884
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
but every day I would

1885
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
like okay I did that cross it off

1886
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
now get to the five minute mark and I would just

1887
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
that's kind of

1888
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
helpful but sometimes I just

1889
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
don't do it

1890
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
with that whole getting stuck at parts

1891
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
that's the period where I'll

1892
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
just get up and go do something

1893
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I don't have a smoke or

1894
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
fucking just do anything

1895
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
to help me

1896
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
you know jog my brain

1897
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and think of something that'll go there

1898
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
what I usually do at the moment is

1899
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I've been going on pokemon go walks

1900
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
with my brother

1901
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
and it's been nice because it's autumn and the leaves

1902
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
are falling and it's really beautiful

1903
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
did you pokemon go to the poles

1904
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
but I can't because I'm English

1905
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I'm English I'd voted

1906
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
for trumpy spirit

1907
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
now

1908
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Hippo are you about wrapped up with yours

1909
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000

01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
a quick just say a problem I have

1912
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
to selfishly bring up a problem that's different

1913
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
from that that I have is that I constantly

1914
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
running up to it's the end of the night

1915
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I now need to stop my productive

1917
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000

1918
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
is people help me help me

1919
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000

okay moving on

1925
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Tom let's hear your writing and editing

1926
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
process

1927
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
if you can do debu first I'm like

1928
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
and speaking of wage slave jobs I had to start

1929
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
around to my job so all my audio is just going to echo

1930
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
like fuck on an old abandoned building

1931
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
it's fair enough

1932
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
if you're still even here

1933
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
yeah debu let's have you go for it

1934
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
okay well you know in order to make a good

1935
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
video you got to be at your computer

1936
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
in order to be at your computer you got to sit

1937
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
down or stand up or have some sort of pose

1938
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
right now it used to be

1939
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I had like an office chair

1940
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
that was like really old

1941
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
like it was an old office chair from like the early 90s

1942
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and it just got so much it turned

1943
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
them into such a concave

1944
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that my back was just hell

1945
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
sitting in it so I had this other more

1946
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
low-end office chair that

1947
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
was okay but as the years

1948
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
went on it just made my back

1949
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
ache so much and what

1950
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
a fascinating thing it is that you would interpret

1951
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
this question to be addressing your

1952
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
seating situation in terms of

1953
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
how you make videos I'm sorry but please

1954
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
go on yeah so

1955
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you know eventually I basically just gave up

1956
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
on chairs all together there's really no chair

1957
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
that's not going to make my

1958
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
back hurt eventually unless it's a

1959
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
$600 one like what did you

1960
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
has but I haven't even tried that one out extensively

1961
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
you know so like

1962
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
in my room where I am right now

1963
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
where I edit more

1964
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
all of my like Saturn videos

1965
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
or anything that's like easy

1966
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you know I just don't

1967
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
have a chair I just sit on the floor

1968
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
my computer is mounted on

1969
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
my computer like

1970
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
my monitor is on

1971
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
my computer tower with a couple

1972
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
of books stacked up to get it just

1973
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
at the right height relative to my head

1974
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
where's your keyboard though

1975
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
well the keyboards either on the floor

1976
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
or on my lap and I have a little

1977
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
box where I put the mouse on

1978
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
okay right now I have

1979
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
said box then with more

1980
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
boxes and then my microphone

1981
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
stand which my microphone

1982
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
is on in front of my face right now

1983
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
so I use

1984
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
boxes I don't use chairs or tables

1985
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I have one token

1986
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
table in this room

1987
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
that I put some things on but everything

1988
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
else is on the floor a token

1989
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
table in a room like cheese okay

1990
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
yeah alright he had to have a table

1991
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
in the room we all know that's a fucking

1992
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
unnecessary right

1993
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
watching all of this anime the weaveness

1994
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
has been slowly creeping up into my mind

1995
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and I've found myself just sitting on the floor

1996
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
yeah yeah like a fucking animal

1997
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
in the other room in the like

1998
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
living room area where the

1999
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
where the advanced computer is which is

2000
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
good for editing and has high power

2001
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
and such you know I

2002
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I messed around with different seating

2003
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
positions but then eventually

2004
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I I scooted

2005
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
up this one like piece

2006
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
of a couch how deep

2007
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
are we going down this rabbit hole

2008
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that belongs to

2009
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Digi's family like they

2010
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Digi's family has this awesome

2011
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
couch that has like 17 million

2012
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
parts to it all of them are

2013
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
excruciatingly comfortable right

2014
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
if you go to the

2015
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
the PCP 360 podcast

2016
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
we're sitting on all of that

2017
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
like Jesse and Nate and hippo

2018
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I believe all

2019
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
sorry bed is coming into my room

2020
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
fascinating they all

2021
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
slept on those couches

2022
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
right for a week

2023
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and it only started to get uncomfortable for them

2024
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
eventually

2025
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
so and I myself will sleep on that

2026
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
if I want to like if I

2027
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
am in the heat of editing a thing

2028
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
and don't want to feel like I can take a break

2029
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and go to my room I'll just sleep on that couch

2030
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
because it's close to

2031
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
to my computer to my advanced

2032
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
computer and

2033
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
there's one little wedge of that couch

2034
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
that was like in a totally different

2035
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
section of the room that was close

2036
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
to where my computer ended up being

2037
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and so I slided that little wedge

2038
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
over and I sat on

2039
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
that and you would think

2040
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
that a couch piece would be

2041
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
not good for editing video

2042
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
but the the fortitude

2043
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
of this material was such

2044
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
that I could just like sit like

2045
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
on the edge of it like a stool

2046
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
and it would always be pushing me forward

2047
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
and just such a way

2048
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
that it gives me like the perfect

2049
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
back position

2050
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
without having to like force it to do

2051
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I'm sorry to interrupt but I mean we've got to also cover

2052
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
like the floor situation like the table

2053
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
situation I mean can we spend all this

2054
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
time on chairs there's a lot of furniture

2055
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
we need to address before you're done

2056
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
let's chair

2057
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
well I understand that

2058
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I mean it is important to be comfortable

2059
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
it helps the process

2060
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
because for me I mean there's a reason

2061
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
why I've bought all this expensive

2062
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
fucking furniture like

2063
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I sit in a $500 chair

2064
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I have a nice like a mattress

2065
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
because when you

2066
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
when you have to edit for 8 hours

2067
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
in a day and your fucking

2068
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
back starts hurting it is

2069
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
just makes the whole process worse so

2070
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
yeah comfort is important

2071
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
right now I mean

2072
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I'm getting sort of the sense that this whole

2073
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
chair discussion is not

2074
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
like what you guys were expecting and I did

2075
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
have more to say about the wedge

2076
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
but if you want me to move on

2077
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
it's perfectly fine

2078
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
it's not a big deal

2079
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I mean it doesn't matter that this wedge has

2080
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
improved my life exponentially

2081
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
let's move on to like the more relevant thing

2082
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
of course

2083
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
so okay

2084
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I don't know what you guys are thinking about

2085
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
the creation of videos I could talk about

2086
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
the chime in on the whole audio recording

2087
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
thing I have always

2088
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
hated doing the audio recording

2089
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I mean I love the idea of doing it

2090
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
but it never comes out right

2091
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I always get very frustrated

2092
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
any amount of frustration I have

2093
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
will ruin my line delivery

2094
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
if I get too anxious

2095
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
and I get short of breath

2096
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
and it ruins it which just

2097
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
creates a downward snowball spiral

2098
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
in which it gets worse and worse

2099
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
in which I have to attain a zen like

2100
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
mental state to recover from it

2101
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
and if I do an attempt

2102
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
of a recording too many times

2103
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
it's going to be ruined forever

2104
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I'll never be able to deliver it naturally

2105
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
so I have a limited number of attempts available to me

2106
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I do not know how people like Jesse

2107
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
are able to do so many attempts

2108
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
and eventually come out with something perfect every time

2109
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
he always does

2110
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
he's able to channel his rage into these things I think

2111
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I guess so yeah

2112
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
he said that like usually it's just

2113
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
he kind of goes

2114
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
it's not that he goes until he gets the one he likes

2115
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
it's that he just goes and goes and goes until he's sick of it

2116
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and then often he'll pick like one of the first two takes

2117
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
yeah it only works

2118
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
with those two because you know you're about to do a hundred more

2119
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
so you're able to do it with such

2120
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
naturalistic motions

2121
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
and you know it's interesting for the last several

2122
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
videos I made that are like full on

2123
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
scripts

2124
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
it's pretty much always three attempts

2125
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
it's like the first attempt is just to

2126
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
start programming the rhythm

2127
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
and delivery into my mind

2128
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
then I listen to it and hate it and throw it away

2129
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
then do another one which is like

2130
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
too unnatural because I'm a little bit tensed up

2131
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
then

2132
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I snap myself

2133
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and I break

2134
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and then in that broken state

2135
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
with the broken brilliance rather as you might call it

2136
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I am able to do a third attempt which is

2137
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
more acceptable

2138
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
is that done for every line or like for the whole

2139
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
script? no no no I go through the whole thing

2140
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
once, twice, then the third time

2141
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
yeah important thing to talk about

2142
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
that me and DeVu sort of discovered

2143
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
once I started getting him to edit

2144
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
is that

2145
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
one of the things I've been having DeVu do is

2146
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
like edit these scripts that I wrote ages

2147
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
ago that like I just

2148
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
never got around to making the full video

2149
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
because either I thought it would be too much

2150
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
effort or I just like

2151
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I didn't finish it because I knew it would

2152
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
be too much effort so for instance

2153
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
like the Yakiuki Shinbo in the 90s video

2154
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
like most of part one was

2155
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
written last November

2156
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
or so and then like I kind

2157
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
of finished it up recently and what I found

2158
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
is that if I sit

2159
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
on a script for too long

2160
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I have no idea how to read it anymore

2161
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
because you're a different person

2162
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
well it's like when I'm writing

2163
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
a script I have a certain

2164
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
rhythm that I'm reading it back

2165
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
to myself in you know like I know

2166
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
the rhythm of the post as it's going

2167
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
and yeah it's based on

2168
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
whatever my writing voice is at the time

2169
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
whatever kind of thing

2170
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I do then and I

2171
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
don't know what that is anymore

2172
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
that's kind of what makes me think that

2173
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
he's got a backlog of tons of scripts but I don't

2174
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
think he's ever going to make any of them

2175
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
just because he's no longer the man who wrote them

2176
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
and doesn't care anymore

2177
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and I mean a lot of them are he rewrites

2178
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
you know in like insight doing a different

2179
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
video about the same subject I mean he's

2180
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
mentioned that he's written like 15 different

2181
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Evangelion videos over time

2182
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
he keeps trying to do it

2183
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
but never you know feeling right

2184
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
about it but yeah

2185
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I was going to say that

2186
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
the way I write

2187
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
it never really seems to

2188
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
to go that way

2189
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
if I write something months ago

2190
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
or if I start writing it like

2191
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
loads and loads of months and then I finally

2192
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
get to the part where it's finished and I can record it

2193
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
as long as I've written like

2194
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
like a little notes on how

2195
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I should inflect like

2196
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
if I'm going for a specific

2197
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
type of voice that I had

2198
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
in my head at the time like

2199
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
it's like John Tron from this particular video

2200
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
this particular scene like I would write that

2201
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
as a note next to the

2202
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
part where I say that so that I know oh yeah

2203
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
and then I can just I can

2204
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
you know it's always

2205
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
it never feels weird to come back to a script

2206
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
for a long time because of that

2207
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
for me it'll be like this whole

2208
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
like the whole cadence of the script doesn't

2209
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
make sense to me anymore sometimes like

2210
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
the worst example was this video that I was

2211
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
working on early last year

2212
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
that was supposed to be

2213
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
a movement in the Legend of Zelda

2214
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
franchise where I was going to do like a whole

2215
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
project where I played through every Zelda game

2216
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and like analyzed the way that the character

2217
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
moves the way you do all your attacks and stuff

2218
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
and I wrote part one which is like

2219
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
20 minutes long and it covers the first

2220
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
four games and

2221
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
like even at the time it was

2222
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
kind of a stilted and awkward script

2223
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
like it was a little too stiff but

2224
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
you know I had recorded it

2225
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I had uh

2226
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
delivered it or whatever but then I

2227
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
redid it again like like a year later I went

2228
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
through and I rewrote parts of it because I wasn't satisfied

2229
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
with the overall writing but then when I tried to

2230
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
voice this new version it just

2231
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
felt like this fucking Frankenstein monster

2232
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
of a script and like I came off as this weird

2233
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
like I was doing almost the Digibrony

2234
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
voice of like way too

2235
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
high pitched and like like a salesman kind

2236
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
of thing because I don't really know what I'm reading

2237
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I feel like I'm reading somebody else's lines

2238
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
that were written for me as opposed to a script

2239
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I wrote for myself and so

2240
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
and you can see this too in the Shinbo

2241
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
video and like you probably hold on for

2242
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
no we got to go on the record

2243
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
that the Shinbo video was where you learned to

2244
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
defeat this at least for

2245
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
temporarily you know you have a number of videos

2246
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
that you wrote then you read them

2247
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
like a year later and you sent them to me

2248
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
and often we just redid the audio

2249
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
for them we did another take to try and get more natural

2250
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
and the voice you were often doing was like

2251
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
you know Guts from Berserk

2252
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
is an interesting anime

2253
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
protagonist and it was like kind of awkward

2254
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
but the Shinbo one is where you

2255
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
created a new persona

2256
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
to match this confused state

2257
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
where like it's this weird like dub character voice

2258
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
like ah you can Shinbo in the 90s

2259
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
he has got this

2260
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
not intentionally I assure you

2261
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
it was unintentional but it was like

2262
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
it felt more right and natural

2263
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I'm sure you can defend it

2264
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
as not being a terrible read

2265
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
but like nonetheless it has this

2266
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
it has this issue whether it's like a problem

2267
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
or not that there's a definitive

2268
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
moment and you probably

2269
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
wouldn't be able to find it unless I told

2270
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
you like exactly where it was

2271
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
like I don't think it's so blatant

2272
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
but like after I talked about Hurricane Palomar

2273
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
the stuff after that is what I'd written

2274
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
later like and

2275
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
there's like if you listen to the

2276
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
early part of the script it's like I start off

2277
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
every second real or every sentence

2278
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
really high like Akiyuki Shinbo

2279
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
and then he went to this studio

2280
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and I know exactly what you're talking

2281
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
about Digi for some reason I always

2282
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
end up going into a sentence really loud

2283
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
the first time and I don't know why

2284
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and then like if you listen to later

2285
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
in the video it suddenly feels way

2286
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
more smooth and natural like the last

2287
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
five or six minutes are like totally different

2288
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and that's because those have been written more recently

2289
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
so yeah I really try now

2290
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
to like if I write a script

2291
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
let's try to get it voiced before too long

2292
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I mean it really takes a long time

2293
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
for it to be that awkward like these are both

2294
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
scripts that were a full year you know between

2295
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
writing and and and reading

2296
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
so I'm like a totally different writer

2297
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
at that point but um

2298
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
well you know aside from the whole

2299
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
voiceover aspect of it I often get

2300
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
because I'm working on projects for so long

2301
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
and I know that you've gotten over this

2302
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Digi by just working faster

2303
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
to like you get to a point

2304
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
where everything that you're saying

2305
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
in the video feels like of course

2306
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
like obviously all these things are true

2307
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
like why am I even making this

2308
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
like I have not gotten past that

2309
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
that's actually it's a big part

2310
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
of why I like

2311
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
handing things over to DeVoo

2312
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
because usually it's the moment

2313
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
when I've listened to it

2314
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
back like when I've edited the audio

2315
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and then I listen to the audio back

2316
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
that's the moment when that happens

2317
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
that's the moment where it's like I've internalized it so much

2318
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
that I no longer understand

2319
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
if this is actually interesting or not

2320
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
and like you know I'll be pacing around

2321
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
my room listening there's there's a lot of scripts of mine

2322
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
where I listen to it back and I'm just like

2323
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I don't even remember if this is good

2324
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
and then I'll send it to DeVoo and he'll be like

2325
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
this is the best thing I've ever heard and I'm like great

2326
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
edit it because like

2327
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
this project is really complicated

2328
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
that involves me personally going over the script

2329
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
several times like I always

2330
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
almost always read the

2331
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
post before I hear the audio

2332
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
so that I can like get more of a sense of the

2333
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
feeling of the pacing of the script

2334
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
then I listen to it in some videos

2335
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
are more complicated like aesthetic is

2336
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
narrative that's one where I listen to it

2337
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
a bajillion times over the course of making it

2338
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
and I never had this moment of

2339
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
maybe this isn't very good because

2340
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
it's not my ego on the line

2341
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I'm able to distance myself

2342
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
from the potential doubts

2343
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
that was definitely one of the videos where like

2344
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
every step of the way I was questioning it

2345
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
like even you know

2346
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
like up until people were commenting

2347
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
that they thought it was great

2348
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I was still like I have no idea if this is

2349
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
even comprehensible like the whole opening

2350
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
segment is so esoteric that I was just like

2351
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I don't know if anyone's going to get this

2352
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
if anyone's going to know where I'm coming from

2353
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
the video was way more successful than it had

2354
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
any right to be granted I put

2355
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
the thumbnail but I remember

2356
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
thinking like on the day I released

2357
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Girl Logging Part 2 like everyone is going

2358
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
to fucking hate this it's going to be so

2359
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
shit and no one's going to give a shit

2360
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
and yet that was that was not the case

2361
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
alright anyway let's let's move on

2362
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
well what else you got to do

2363
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
let's see um I could talk about

2364
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
the specific editing

2365
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
of doing a specific thing

2366
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
putting a specific item

2367
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
in a video how about that

2368
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
you want to hear that yes

2369
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
let's see we'll use the example

2370
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
of like having an image that pans

2371
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
into the screen during a couple of seconds

2372
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
so like you know imagine I go

2373
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
this game is almost as good as

2374
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
peanut butter jelly sandwiches

2375
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and I'll get a picture

2376
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
of a peanut butter jelly sandwich preferably one

2377
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
with a uh an alpha background

2378
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
meaning there's no background you know

2379
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
if I can't find one I'll just open up

2380
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Gimp and you know isolate the color

2381
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
white get rid of the white no background

2382
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
so I put the image

2383
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
into Premiere and

2384
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I then drop it from the library

2385
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
of Premiere onto the timeline

2386
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
now at the bottom of the timeline

2387
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
there's going to be footage of the video game

2388
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
and I'm going to put

2389
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
peanut butter jelly sandwich image above

2390
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
that so that way you see

2391
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
a peanut butter jelly sandwich image

2392
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
in front of you and the video game footage is behind

2393
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
you but I don't want the peanut butter jelly

2394
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
sandwich to just appear out of nowhere

2395
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
you know sometimes that's good

2396
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
sometimes you want the image to just snap it

2397
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
in the middle of the screen all at once

2398
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
sometimes you want a little bit more

2399
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
of a smooth delivery

2400
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
let me guess did you click

2401
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
opacity well I could do that

2402
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
but and for this example

2403
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I go to the X value

2404
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
which for people who don't know

2405
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
the X value is your horizontal position

2406
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
we're going deep

2407
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I'll drag it left

2408
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
words so that the peanut butter jelly sandwich

2409
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
careens off of the screen

2410
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
so it's no longer visible

2411
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
now I then decide

2412
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
a big mistake

2413
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
you're going to go off the right side

2414
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
with emotion like this I can tell you

2415
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
emotionally with the peanut butter sandwich

2416
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
it's always going to be from the right side

2417
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I will not question any specific details

2418
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
that you would want to iron out

2419
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
so take Nate's word on it for stuff like this

2420
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
you know so

2421
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I try to decide

2422
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
how long exactly

2423
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
at what point of my audio delivery

2424
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
do I want the peanut butter jelly sandwich

2425
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
to be involved right like do I want it

2426
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
to start scrolling in

2427
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
during the this game

2428
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
is almost as good as

2429
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
or do I want it to start scrolling in at

2430
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
peanut butter jelly sandwich

2431
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
right so

2432
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I'll arrange the image

2433
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
to be at exactly the point I want

2434
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
and then I do have an actual

2435
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
point about that is the timing

2436
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
about like you've got to

2437
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
take into consideration how

2438
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
long it will take people

2439
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
to process the image that's on screen

2440
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
because when you're editing something

2441
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and you cut it to like

2442
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
okay that's enough footage

2443
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
and then you cut to the next thing

2444
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
sometimes it's not enough time and you have to

2445
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
make sure you watch it over like

2446
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
oh yeah I can comprehend this and then

2447
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
people will know what it is

2448
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
before I move on

2449
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I was watching one

2450
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
of my earlier videos

2451
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
the mini clip one and there are certain parts

2452
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
where I just cut way too quick

2453
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
obviously because I didn't rewatch it properly

2454
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
now there were like what I'm just curious

2455
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
about what you think you did that with

2456
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
do you

2457
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
do you remember offhand anything that you thought was too

2458
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
fast

2459
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I mean there's a lot of

2460
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
parts in the mini clip video there's

2461
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
alright fair enough

2462
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
but it was just certain points where I was like

2463
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
there's even one part where I

2464
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
cut off the beginning

2465
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
of the next sentence by like

2466
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
half a syllable and it sounds a bit

2467
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
weird oh so you mean like audio wise

2468
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
well that's interesting audio and visual

2469
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I only ask because the current thing I'm editing

2470
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
right now like basically a hundred percent

2471
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
of it is exactly dealing with this

2472
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
issue of like I'm trying to convey

2473
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
these these ideas

2474
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
with these visuals like as

2475
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
as as efficiently as possible

2476
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
while being able to like get the entire

2477
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
like section

2478
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
of information and like this sounds confusing

2479
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
but like when you see the video in like two weeks

2480
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
it'll make perfect sense but it's really

2481
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
it's a struggle to manage like how long

2482
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
and at what point you remove

2483
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
an image or put it there so that they can digest

2484
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it and understand like what it means

2485
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
that's like when I when I edit

2486
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
with like images on screen that's like

2487
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
what I spend by far the most time on is

2488
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
like going back and watching it over

2489
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
and over again and trying to figure out the timing because

2490
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
the the other problem is you already

2491
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
know the information and this is

2492
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
the thing that's the thing with text

2493
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
that's the hardest because you can read the text

2494
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
faster when you already know what it says

2495
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
so like I always

2496
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I always kind of like read it

2497
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
like relatively slow like I like

2498
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
read every word to myself

2499
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
and then I I go like half a second

2500
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
more than that you know to account for

2501
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
like people who are slower readers than me and I'm

2502
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
not the fastest so you know

2503
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I feel pretty confident about my text

2504
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
speeds but I leave it for like just long enough

2505
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
that I'm confident you can read it but even

2506
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
then you know a lot of people aren't fucking

2507
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
really paying attention at the

2508
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
you know when when the text looks like they're not ready

2509
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
for text to start appearing and then have to have to

2510
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
have to read and engage in the video

2511
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
there was one moment in my Rayman

2512
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
video where I did the Paninkoic

2513
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
style thing with the music and

2514
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and I had the

2515
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
graph with Rayman and I had text on there

2516
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
but it didn't really tell you anything you didn't already know

2517
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
but I can tell like it's a bit too quick

2518
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
for people to not want to pause

2519
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
part of the joke

2520
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
yeah that's the thing and you know it's interesting

2521
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I've been watching a lot of like

2522
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Mr. Donut the Donut

2523
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and he does a lot of like Jojo

2524
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
and V's and I've been taking note

2525
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
of his technique where he'll

2526
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
he animates a lot of Jojo manga panels

2527
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
and I'll have a panel come in and he'll do things like

2528
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
just like have like

2529
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
there'll be a sentence in it but what he'll do is on the

2530
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
same side like on the opposite side of the screen from the panel

2531
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
he'll like just have the words

2532
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
like the crucial words like

2533
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
he attacked and they'll be like

2534
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
big and like ballooned out of the thing

2535
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
despite like the sentence on the

2536
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
right side had a sentence that included those words

2537
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
but he's like emphasizing them

2538
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
by showing them separately and it's an interesting technique

2539
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and I've been taking inspiration from it

2540
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
so okay you know the thing I was saying

2541
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
before about timeline positioning

2542
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
there was actually a useful point

2543
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I was trying to make there

2544
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
but then as I started making it I realized that

2545
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
it's only something that people who have

2546
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
edited lots of videos before or at least a couple

2547
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
will understand so I started

2548
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
like going into like exhaustive details

2549
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
so that you could follow along otherwise

2550
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
but I'm gonna give up on that alright

2551
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
so forget about it

2552
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
if you don't know video editing at all

2553
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
you're not gonna understand this

2554
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
so you know when I started making videos

2555
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
and like wanting to have a peanut butter jelly sandwich

2556
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
on the screen I would be like this constant

2557
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
back and forth of like trying to adjust things

2558
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
and move things around here and there to get the timing right

2559
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
to get the positioning right all that kind of stuff

2560
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
and it just felt like I was going back and forth

2561
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
so there's a very simple layered

2562
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
method of positioning things

2563
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
and getting down those keyframes

2564
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
so first I decide how long

2565
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
it's going to be in the timeline right

2566
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I decide when it's going to come into existence

2567
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and when it's going to lead from existence

2568
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and then

2569
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I decide when the keyframes

2570
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
will begin and end like

2571
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
you know this game is almost as good as

2572
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I know that it's going to begin

2573
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
moving at the

2574
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
and then it's going to end at the

2575
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
peanut butter jelly

2576
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
that's gonna be where

2577
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
it is done careening into the screen

2578
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
so I make two keyframes

2579
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
at the puh and the eh

2580
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
and then I decide how it's going to leave

2581
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
like sandwiches

2582
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
that's when it's going to begin leaving

2583
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
new keyframe then

2584
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
like a half second after the

2585
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
ends that's when it will be done

2586
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
leaving the screen so I now have the

2587
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
four keyframe positions and then

2588
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
that is when I decide

2589
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
where the thing is actually going to be positioned

2590
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
into like where it's actually going to be

2591
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
coming from and where it's going to be going

2592
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
oh so you sort out the timing

2593
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
before you sort out the position

2594
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I guess I will probably decide the default positioning

2595
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
that way I don't have to adjust

2596
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
every keyframe afterward you know

2597
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
and this is not a strict

2598
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
method but that's like hypothetically

2599
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
that's a way to do it I'm getting

2600
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
the truth not the facts here by the way

2601
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
like that's how I'm

2602
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
the best that's what I'm doing here

2603
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
so uh yeah

2604
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
all that aside I wanted to

2605
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
like I want to ask about this because

2606
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
when I watch Davoo edit

2607
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
even though I'm pretty sure he's ultimately

2608
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
doing something similar to what I do

2609
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
which is to pull a bunch of clips from a show

2610
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
and put them in a timeline

2611
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
the actual way of going about it

2612
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
is like radically different

2613
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
and it's fascinating

2614
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
because when I walk by and I see

2615
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
to be editing this is what it sounds like

2616
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
this is the sounds coming out of his computer

2617
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
it's a constant like

2618
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
and then I said to him

2619
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
and then I said

2620
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
like he has the audio

2621
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
coming out at all times

2622
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and he's like scrolling back

2623
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
through the timeline and you can hear the audio

2624
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
being like fast forward and re-winded

2625
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
interesting I just pause

2626
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and then I skip back and locate all the syllables

2627
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
peanut butter

2628
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
sandwiches you know

2629
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and then you also

2630
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
you do the same thing when you're looking for clips

2631
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
like you scroll through the footage

2632
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
well I would like it

2633
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
if it didn't happen then

2634
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
what Digi's referring to is

2635
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
maybe a 20 minute episode of THING

2636
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
and then I'll show

2637
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
some scene from 3 minutes in

2638
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
and I still have the other 17 minutes

2639
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
of the episode still sitting there

2640
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
on the timeline I gotta deal with

2641
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
so then maybe Digi's next sentence

2642
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
addresses something that happens 11 minutes in

2643
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
so I gotta go find the 11 minute mark

2644
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
so I'll scroll through

2645
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
and you know something like that

2646
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I wish it didn't make audio then

2647
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I wish there were a feature

2648
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
where the

2649
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
you can stop after like the first couple of like minutes or so

2650
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
um yeah

2651
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
wait DeVoo

2652
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
you use a premiere

2653
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
why don't you just

2654
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
double click the footage

2655
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
and have it be in the preview window

2656
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I do a variety of all of them

2657
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
so I never get tired of one or the other

2658
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
you know one thing I would love is if you could like

2659
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
punch in like a timeline code

2660
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
and you would skip to that position

2661
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
of the timeline of that specific item

2662
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
which I know you can but not very efficient

2663
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I use the preview

2664
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
box or whatever it's called

2665
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
because it has the whole thing in there

2666
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
from start to finish and you just say

2667
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
11 minutes in you can easily see where that is

2668
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I believe that's what I do most of the time

2669
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
but I believe it even then will do the max

2670
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
headroom audio even if you do it that way

2671
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
so what's funny to me about it

2672
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
is that like the way I select clips

2673
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
is I'll throw the whole episode into

2674
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Vegas like somewhere way down the timeline

2675
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
and then like

2676
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
if you grab the edge

2677
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
of a clip and drag it

2678
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
then that you know cuts into it

2679
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
and if you're looking at the preview window

2680
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
you can see everything you're

2681
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
cutting into it's like if you if you grab the edge

2682
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
and let's say you move it 30 seconds

2683
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
to the side you can watch those

2684
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
30 seconds in the preview when gosh

2685
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
that would be very useful so

2686
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
so yeah so that's what I do is I just

2687
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I just grab the edge of the clip and then I just

2688
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
keep scrolling until I find what I want

2689
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
and then I you know

2690
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
that works in Premiere as well

2691
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
yeah you don't need to hear the audio

2692
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
yeah and then I just I just take that that whole

2693
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
I take the whole like let's say

2694
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
we're not here to like correct Davoo's technique

2695
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I'm not describing my technique

2696
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
you're gonna have to show me what you mean

2697
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I may very well do that already

2698
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
yeah like I

2699
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
you know let's say the clip I want

2700
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
is two minutes into the episode so I throw the whole

2701
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
episode into Vegas I grab the edge

2702
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
of the clip and I just scroll until

2703
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I see that moment I want

2704
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
then I drag the entire episode you know

2705
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
into the timeline that I'm using

2706
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
you know hit play until it reaches the part

2707
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I don't want hit cut and then I just move

2708
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
that I move the entire rest of the episode back

2709
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
out to the far edge of the timeline

2710
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
and then I just keep doing that like I keep just

2711
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
scrolling through and finding the things I want

2712
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
but I absolute I

2713
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I cannot fucking stand

2714
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
to hear like any audio

2715
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
at all from anything happening in my timeline

2716
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I don't want to hear my voice I don't want to

2717
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
hear the clips I don't want to hear anything

2718
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
like you know I play music over all the editing

2719
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
so I just I don't want to hear it

2720
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
it drives me crazy it drives me crazy

2721
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
edit if you don't know what you're hearing

2722
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I mean I can like I just have it

2723
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
like you know I don't have music in my

2724
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
videos so it's just my voice

2725
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
so you know I just you can hear your voice

2726
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
over the music I have the music turn

2727
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
pretty low you know

2728
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
and then I just but everything

2729
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
is based around like I always edit based around

2730
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
the exact length of a sentence so it's just

2731
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
the clip starts when the sentence

2732
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
starts the clip ends when the sentence ends

2733
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
and that's how I do it so

2734
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
which is pretty simple

2735
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
and it just

2736
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
it's all about minimizing how much like

2737
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I have to hear it and stuff

2738
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
because I don't want to hear it

2739
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
it drives me crazy

2740
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I just want to explain the way that I select clips

2741
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
because it's very specific and it uses shortcuts

2742
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
that might be helpful for people

2743
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I have my videos in the side

2744
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
and you know for levels and stuff

2745
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I click on one when I know

2746
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
that I need a clip from that level

2747
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
and a lot of the time

2748
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
if I'm talking about something specific I would

2749
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
have written down in my scripts

2750
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
the timecode for when that happens

2751
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
in the video

2752
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
so I would go to that I would find the thing

2753
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
and I would press the I key which is the in button

2754
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
and then move a bit and press the O key

2755
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
which is the out button so that

2756
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
is the section that is being

2757
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
brought in when I drag it into the timeline

2758
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
then what I do is

2759
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I unlink it from the audio

2760
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
delete the audio because I never really need it

2761
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
etc

2762
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
couple times

2763
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
where I might

2764
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
so the audio is gone

2765
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
and then what I do is

2766
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I will have a

2767
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
way that all of the video game footage

2768
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
in that review

2769
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
has been cropped and resized

2770
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
to fit the frame because

2771
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
not always correct

2772
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
there's a way that is really handy

2773
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
if you just

2774
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
have like a certain

2775
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
thing set

2776
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
you right click on the video footage

2777
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
click copy and then right click

2778
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
on the new video footage

2779
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
and click paste

2780
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
stuff I can't remember

2781
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
exactly what it is but paste

2782
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
a tribute

2783
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
and you can basically paste the keyframes

2784
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
for the motion for the size

2785
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
for the opacity whatever it is

2786
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
and all the effects and you can just copy

2787
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
that into that new thing and you can do that

2788
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
by dragging a box as well

2789
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
so

2790
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
anytime I put a new clip in

2791
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I just copy all the information

2792
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
from the old clips

2793
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
and I put them into the new ones

2794
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
alright that's cool let's not get so bogged down

2795
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
of the weeds though

2796
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
it amuses me how

2797
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
technical everybody else gets because

2798
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I've said this before

2799
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
the reason I use Vegas is that I just think

2800
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
it's incredibly simple

2801
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
and what I mean by simple

2802
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
is not that like

2803
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
it's not all that advanced stuff

2804
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
but you can also just like

2805
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
manually do everything very easily

2806
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
and so like for me it's

2807
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
you know I could optimize everything

2808
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
and I could make it easier on myself

2809
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
but like it's easier for me to just parse it

2810
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
if I just do everything

2811
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
in order start to finish

2812
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I don't know why

2813
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
obviously it takes more time

2814
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
but I mean I edit fastest shit anyway

2815
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
so it doesn't matter that much

2816
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I'm not sitting on a project

2817
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
for days or anything

2818
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
or even months as Nate would be

2819
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
but yeah David was that

2820
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
about wrapped up with your writing and editing process

2821
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
please say yes

2822
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
depends on what you want to say

2823
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I don't really need to add anything additional

2824
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
okay Tom are you there yet

2825
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I'm back I'm here

2826
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
yeah you want to talk about your writing and editing process

2827
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
um yeah I mean

2828
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I hate editing

2829
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
a lot

2830
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
preach your brother

2831
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
knows that like I've questioned multiple times

2832
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
if I should even be making videos

2833
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
because I hate it so much

2834
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
like it drives me to suicide

2835
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
it's the worst it's awful

2836
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I hate it

2837
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
that being said I do a lot of it

2838
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
so I mean my writing

2839
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
you have some of the most pro looking videos

2840
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
of any of us

2841
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
your branding and stuff has always been

2842
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
totally on point

2843
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I remember just like in your end cards

2844
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
from the old you know brony curious videos

2845
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
those were right away very professional

2846
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I remember modeling myself after them at one point

2847
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
yeah I mean

2848
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I'm pretty good at the graphic stuff

2849
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
just because I've been doing that forever

2850
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
and like I don't it's funny because I don't mind doing

2851
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
like uh

2852
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
vfx stuff like the end cards

2853
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
and the animation stuff like that I find really interesting

2854
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
it's just the grind of like here's my

2855
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
fucking dumbass voice and my dumbass face

2856
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
and I'm gonna shoot all this fucking video

2857
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
and find all these stupid clips I don't even care

2858
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
but I've made my point I wrote it

2859
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
just read the text if you weren't also fucking lazy

2860
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
you goddamn millennials

2861
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and that's like my mindset the entire time I'm editing

2862
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
it's like if youtube is never invented

2863
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I'd be fine

2864
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
fuck everything so that's my mentality

2865
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
when I'm editing so it's just hellish and I don't like it

2866
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
um I don't think

2867
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I can probably I don't really

2868
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I can't get too much in the technical stuff because I use hitfilm

2869
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
which I don't think anybody else uses

2870
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
um

2871
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
it's free it's free there's also

2872
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
a paid version I don't have the paid version

2873
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
well I do now because they just emailed me

2874
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
they're like here's our $300 paid version

2875
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
do a video on it and I'm like okay

2876
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
so now I have the new version but what I like

2877
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
about hitfilm is that it's free number one

2878
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
if for the free express version

2879
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
which is still really good it's like way better than iMovie

2880
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
way better than windows movie maker

2881
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
and what's cool about it it's like it's a adobe premiere

2882
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and adobe after effects in one

2883
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
because you can do all the video editing

2884
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
but you can also have like all the vfx stuff

2885
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
if you want to do like animation and visual

2886
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
like stuff like that

2887
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
it's a lot of source or sloths than that too

2888
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
it's the same program

2889
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
because you can do everything which is pretty dope

2890
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
but um

2891
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
my writing process is pretty much like

2892
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
very similar to yours Nate where you just get the idea

2893
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
you have like the thesis concept

2894
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
and you kind of just go and write it out

2895
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
like I don't do a super fuck ton of research

2896
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
because a lot of the writing that I did back

2897
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
when I was doing reviews

2898
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
and stuff was very much like personal

2899
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
like my personal thing like that was the thing that I

2900
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
always thought was really funny it's like people give me shit

2901
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
like

2902
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
like this isn't true or whatever

2903
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
this isn't like true or what we want to hear

2904
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
this is just my personal views on it

2905
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
you know it's very much like a vlog style

2906
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
like I'm just talking about

2907
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
this is my interpretation if you don't like it

2908
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
like that's fine

2909
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
so I don't do too much research

2910
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
on videos unless

2911
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
like the point

2912
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I'm trying to make mandates like knowing the facts

2913
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I mean that's pretty crazy because you

2914
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
you talk a lot of techno jargon

2915
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
about all the fucking reviews you do

2916
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
and I guess you just know that shit

2917
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
well I mean

2918
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I don't do a lot of research on those either

2919
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
just because I'm doing research for fun essentially

2920
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
like I've read Engadget every day

2921
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
for the last I think 10 years now

2922
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
that's just part of my day

2923
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
is going and reading blogs about all this shit

2924
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
like that's just I wake up

2925
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
and like 10 minutes in like that's what I do

2926
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I'm just like oh I wonder what happened when I was asleep

2927
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
that'll do it

2928
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
so I know a lot of stuff about that

2929
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
but those

2930
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
it's two different processes

2931
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
like we're doing like a review versus doing a product review

2932
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
because there's like a lot more

2933
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
camera work and stuff involved with the product

2934
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
because it's a physical object that you have to get

2935
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
footage of and that's obviously different

2936
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
than you know

2937
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
tracking down a cartoon and getting the

2938
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
clips you need out of that

2939
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
so it's required a lot more like knowledge and learning about

2940
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
photography and cinematography

2941
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
and things like that

2942
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
the beginning videos I did were really bad

2943
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I didn't have any of that shit

2944
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
so it was all like handheld done with like

2945
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
a point and shoot camera which did not look very good

2946
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
yeah of course

2947
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
but now it's slowly starting to get better

2948
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
than

2949
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
the thing I was going to talk about with the camera

2950
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
because if you're using the same camera I am the T2i

2951
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
what I ended up doing because like

2952
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
it doesn't have a flip screen which sucks

2953
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
my old camera did have a flip screen

2954
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
but it was a point and shoot camera and I had to sell it

2955
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
because I needed money because I had to pay my bills

2956
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
so I had to let that camera go which sucks

2957
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
so now I'm using a T2i

2958
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
which is still a good camera but it doesn't have

2959
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
the flip screen it's like older

2960
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
it doesn't have a lot of modern features

2961
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
the no flip only now am I realizing

2962
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
what a fucking waste of money it was

2963
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
to get something without a flip screen

2964
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
you can't do it unless you have a guy with you

2965
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
but okay well this is

2966
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
my like ghetto tech solution

2967
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
which is not really ghetto tech at all but it's a good way

2968
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
the nice thing about those big DSLRs

2969
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
they have a ton of fucking ports

2970
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
and one of the ports on the side is mini

2971
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
hdmi so if you get

2972
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
a mini hdmi adapter on ebay

2973
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
for like a dollar take

2974
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
your hdmi cable from your monitor

2975
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
take it out of your computer put it in the adapter

2976
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
plug the adapter into the camera then turn it on

2977
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
and the screen is on your

2978
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
computer monitor oh my god that's perfect

2979
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I never fucking knew

2980
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
that is fucking

2981
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
amazing it's great and then

2982
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
what you need to do with the Canon firmware is there's

2983
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
an aftermarket firmware you can download called magic lantern

2984
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
and I put that on my T2i

2985
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
you put it on the SD card

2986
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and then you go into the Canon settings

2987
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
you hit update firmware and it will overwrite

2988
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
the stock firmware with the magic lantern

2989
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
firmware it adds a bunch

2990
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
of new cinematography features you can monitor

2991
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
your curves right on the screen you can monitor

2992
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
your white balance it adds what's called

2993
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
that's great because I swear to god the managing

2994
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
of like the white balance of the shadow of this computer

2995
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
is I mean this camera is fucking impossible

2996
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I can't navigate these

2997
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
the best thing that's gonna save your fucking life they have an option for

2998
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
focus peaking do you know what focus peaking is

2999
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
yeah so you

3000
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
put focus peaking on there and it'll

3001
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
have like red dots around whatever's

3002
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
in focus so when you go to stand

3003
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
back away if your face has like red dots

3004
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
on it you know you're in focus

3005
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I didn't even think this kind of shit was possible

3006
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
you've blown my mind to shit Tom

3007
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
like I'm about to go dig up

3008
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Victor's old fucking T4i

3009
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
that he won't use anymore because he's got a real

3010
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
camera now and I'm just gonna fucking steal it

3011
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
dude I would like sell

3012
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
my left nut for a T2i those things with magic lantern

3013
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
are great so

3014
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
my baby little T2i

3015
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
is like very jealous but yeah

3016
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
magic lantern like will save your fucking life

3017
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
and that's kind of like the last like

3018
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
seven videos I've shot were on the T2i

3019
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
and I'm slowly kind of trying to figure out

3020
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
how to make this dinosaur work for me

3021
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
you're fucking video quality

3022
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
like definitely jumped up in the last

3023
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
view like in terms of framing

3024
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
and being in focus and

3025
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
the lighting not being shit

3026
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
or the white balance not being shit like it's gotten

3027
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
a lot better

3028
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
on the one hand I'm doing a lot of the camera stuff

3029
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
on the other hand I'm looking into like post-production

3030
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
so like I'm not doing like color

3031
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
balance and white balance and

3032
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
crushing blacks and whites and getting like the contrast

3033
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
looking good I'm trying to make it look very filmic

3034
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
like everyone's like oh man 60fps I'm just like

3035
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I'm gonna do 24fps so it looks like a movie

3036
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
because that's the look I like

3037
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
so I'm like I'm going down when everyone else is going up

3038
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
so it's a lot of just like

3039
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
tweaking with things like that which

3040
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
all of that I find fascinating

3041
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
is the actual editing part that I want to like

3042
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
make someone else do because it's

3043
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
sucks and it makes

3044
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
something I want to know about

3045
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
is you still do this right

3046
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
you use a teleprompter

3047
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
for all your stuff

3048
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
like a makeshift one

3049
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
yeah so there is a video on YouTube

3050
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
by Film Riot they're a great channel

3051
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
for like DIY filmmaking and stuff and they had

3052
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I'm completely cut out

3053
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
am I alive?

3054
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
yeah so there's a channel

3055
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
called Film Riot which is great for

3056
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
DIY filmmaking and stuff and they have a tutorial

3057
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
on how to build a teleprompter

3058
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
so

3059
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
just like to build

3060
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
so what you do you take like a 2x4

3061
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
or like a piece of plywood

3062
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
and then you screw in like hinges on

3063
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
a picture frame and then prop that up

3064
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
at 90 degrees and

3065
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
you put your camera in there

3066
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
and you get like

3067
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
a screen or something you drop onto the plywood

3068
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
and reflect onto the picture frames glass

3069
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
and then you can read it

3070
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
so what I did is I took my old

3071
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
iPad that someone from Twitter

3072
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I actually went on Twitter like a couple years ago

3073
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
and was like I need an iPad

3074
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I will pay somebody and this guy was just like

3075
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I'll just give you this old iPad that I don't use anymore

3076
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
it's sitting in a box it's like super old and it's like cracked

3077
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
but it doesn't matter I'm like dude I don't care

3078
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I just need that so I got this old iPad

3079
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
and I used that and there's an application for the iPad

3080
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
called Prompt Smart

3081
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
and it saved my life because I was using

3082
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
other online

3083
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
teleprompter software but it auto scrolls

3084
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
so you have to like keep up with the

3085
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
prompt so if you fuck up

3086
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
like it's gone

3087
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
and so you're just like well I got to figure that out

3088
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Prompt Smart is great

3089
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
is because it uses the iPad's mic

3090
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
to track your voice so it only

3091
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
scrolls as you're talking so you can

3092
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
stop talking for like 15 minutes

3093
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
when someone comes downstairs and like

3094
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
bitches you out or something and then you can just

3095
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
go back and start right where you left off

3096
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and it'll just start scrolling again

3097
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
so whenever I do like reviews

3098
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
and stuff where I need to sound like an intelligent

3099
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
human being like I'll usually script it out

3100
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
and throw it on there and you just throw

3101
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
the camera behind it and you throw a piece of glass

3102
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
or a piece of cloth over it so it blocks out the light

3103
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
from the backside so

3104
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
the camera lens doesn't

3105
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
see the reflection that's on the glass

3106
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
it just looks like you're looking into the camera lens

3107
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
because the screen is right in front of it so you're

3108
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
reading but it looks like you're making eye contact

3109
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
so that's super handy and the only reason

3110
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I like it like

3111
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I watch your videos and like I can

3112
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
just barely see the subtle movement of

3113
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
your eyes and only because I know

3114
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
that it's teleprompter do I

3115
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
like you know detect it I don't think most people

3116
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
would ever realize

3117
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
it's getting more noticeable now because

3118
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I just got the t2i and it doesn't have the right lens

3119
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
to do video it has a 50 prime

3120
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
lens which is great for photos if you're going out

3121
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
on the street and doing photography because it has

3122
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
already a good amount of zoom built in

3123
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
but when I'm shooting now with this

3124
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
t2i it's like 4 or 5 feet away

3125
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
from me even though it looks like it's right in my face

3126
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
because the prime lens has so much zoom

3127
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
so I need to get like

3128
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
a $70 pancake lens or something

3129
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
that'll be work better for that but like I'm super

3130
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
getting into photography and like cinematography

3131
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
and color grading now because I have to like

3132
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
force myself to learn it so I'm like oh this is cool

3133
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
you can do this and you can change the colors

3134
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
of like the shadows and the highlights independently

3135
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
to get a more film look and I'm just like

3136
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
you know what I do I get a footage

3137
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
that's hopefully reasonably in focus

3138
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
and then I just throw that shit into Vegas

3139
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
and then I open color corrector and I just

3140
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
fuck with the knobs until things look

3141
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
reasonably okay and it works

3142
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
amazing it's awesome

3143
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I mean it does but I can always tell that you've

3144
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
color corrected your videos you know like it doesn't

3145
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
look natural you can't tell shit

3146
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
you don't know nobody fucking knows

3147
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I can always tell that you've color corrected your videos

3148
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
that's kind of what's nice about Hillfilm

3149
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
is that you're feeling lazy they have like under the

3150
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
presets it's like auto color auto contrast

3151
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
auto lighting it's like do-do-do and then it fixes

3152
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
like 90% of the things

3153
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
great for saving cell phone footage

3154
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
like every time I shoot with my iPhone

3155
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
cause I'll do that sometimes

3156
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
it always comes out like Duke

3157
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
and then I'll just like throw that on there and it'll

3158
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
magically look like it was shot with like a $100

3159
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
better camera just from doing the color correction

3160
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
that's like

3161
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I'm fascinated Tom that like cause I feel like

3162
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
the rest of us we encounter a problem

3163
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
and then we're just like trying to solve it

3164
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
through like

3165
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
you know it coming up with something

3166
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
and you actually just like find a technology

3167
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
that can do that

3168
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
you know you're like surely something out there

3169
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
is built to fix this problem that I can somehow

3170
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
get for free and you'll find that thing

3171
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
and the rest of us are sitting here like

3172
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
trying to fucking like reinvent the wheel

3173
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
or something just to have a

3174
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
image score across the screen

3175
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I don't know I just I just don't want to spend any money

3176
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I'll spend a little bit of money

3177
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
just say that you're an internet reviewer

3178
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
and please send me your product so I can do a

3179
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Tom is amazing at finding

3180
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
like he said he uses fucking HitFilm

3181
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
to edit like it's a free program that

3182
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
you know that's as powerful as

3183
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
like a real fucking

3184
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
big boys program you know

3185
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
that we're all stealing and barely

3186
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
know how to use

3187
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
it's it's pretty good

3188
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
and they're probably they usually come out with a new version

3189
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
every

3190
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Wizard of Vegas bitch

3191
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
in the next few months which will probably be even better

3192
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
but it's really good

3193
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
works great

3194
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I like it

3195
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I don't know

3196
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
when my editing process itself

3197
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
though is usually just like lots of cursing

3198
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
lots of swearing

3199
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
lots of racial slurs that I regret later

3200
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
because I really couldn't be saying those things

3201
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
and just getting the supremely fucking

3202
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
pissed off at shit not working

3203
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Tom I heard a tweet recently

3204
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
that you discovered my

3205
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
ancient method

3206
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
for dealing with editing

3207
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
which is the good old fashioned

3208
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
alcohol method

3209
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
yeah I mean at this point

3210
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I'm just like getting

3211
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
lots of rum and I'll get

3212
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
and I'll just have that by me while I'm

3213
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
editing and every time something happens

3214
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I'll just take another drink

3215
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
the reason I started doing it is because

3216
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I don't know if anybody else has this problem

3217
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
but the reason I hate editing so much

3218
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
is because editing hates me

3219
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I've been doing YouTube for almost five years now

3220
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
and every single video has fucked up

3221
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
somehow I've never had a video where it's just like

3222
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I started and ended and nothing

3223
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
happened footage will always get corrupted

3224
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
if the camera will always fuck up

3225
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
the audio will always die on me

3226
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
every week something happens

3227
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
and I just want to blow my brain down

3228
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I mean it's like you've been forced to adapt

3229
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
to learn all these advanced technological solutions

3230
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
because it's trying to fuck with you

3231
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
well just last week I recorded that video

3232
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
on the Artistle D10

3233
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
and I had to shoot it three times

3234
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
because the first time the camera died

3235
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
and I found out the camera died because my SD card was too

3236
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
low tech to use with this new camera

3237
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
my $30 SD card

3238
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
the second time I did it

3239
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
the framing wasn't right

3240
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
and then the other time I did it

3241
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I've had everything right and I was like

3242
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
oh man this video actually went

3243
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
like this recording was great

3244
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
no problems I didn't even stutter as much as I usually did

3245
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I put it into my computer

3246
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
or sorry your memory card has been corrupted

3247
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
so all the files were lost

3248
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
so I had to record the video of me talking again

3249
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
and all the B-roll I had shot

3250
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
the three previous hours

3251
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
it was like a two hour project

3252
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
because everything fucking hates me

3253
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
and it's just like oh my god

3254
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I really think god is up there

3255
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
you should just be blogging

3256
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I'm going to make your life hell until you quit video

3257
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
and just blog like a normal person

3258
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I've definitely experienced some of that shit

3259
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
but it sounds brutal

3260
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I've experienced a lot of it

3261
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
but it doesn't happen as much lately

3262
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
and this is going to make everybody mad to say

3263
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
but I just bought

3264
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
better equipment

3265
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
the way I fought my way around it is like

3266
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I don't want to have these problems

3267
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I'm just going to buy all the best shit

3268
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
and the best shit doesn't fail as much

3269
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
like when you've got a computer

3270
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
that can just crunch through

3271
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
you know I mean I can be

3272
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
too past rendering something

3273
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
and recording a podcast and listening to

3274
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
well I wouldn't be listening to this

3275
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
I remember watching your video

3276
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
yesterday or today

3277
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
about the whatever

3278
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
the new guru thing or whatever

3279
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
on the screen you were rendering a video

3280
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
while you were recording this and I was like

3281
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
what is this nigga doing right now

3282
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I was recording

3283
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
the screen capturing

3284
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
in 1080p with open broadcaster

3285
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
and I was rendering a let's play

3286
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
at the same time a two pass render

3287
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
at 720p I think

3288
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
so

3289
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I didn't have audacity open

3290
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
at the time because I was recording through the program

3291
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I fucking closed Vegas before starting this call

3292
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
because I was afraid it was going to fuck my shit up

3293
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
consider this

3294
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
after that after I had finished

3295
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
that recording I edited

3296
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
that video and I rendered it

3297
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
at the same time as the other render was going

3298
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
well that's just stupid I just rendered two videos at once

3299
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
it worked perfectly fine

3300
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
comment on the alcohol method by the way

3301
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I want to say the alcohol I do that too

3302
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
sometimes like if I had enough alcohol

3303
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
around me I would do it probably a lot

3304
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
because if it's a video

3305
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
where it's basic stuff that I

3306
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
know how to do sufficiently really well

3307
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
without having to double think it

3308
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
there's that level of drunkenness

3309
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
of mildly moderate drunkenness

3310
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
where you can do things you're really used to

3311
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
you don't want to get actual drunk

3312
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
because then you just have a headache

3313
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
but if you just buzz

3314
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
that makes

3315
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
that dulls the pain of like

3316
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
repetitiveness

3317
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
it's quite useful

3318
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
not to cut you off too soon

3319
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
but perhaps we should just move on to Digi

3320
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
so we can wrap this thing up

3321
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Digi, holy damn

3322
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I always see

3323
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
you might have noticed that every time we do one of these podcasts

3324
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
where we round Robin I always make myself go last

3325
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
so that because I know

3326
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I'm gonna piggyback on what everyone else says

3327
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
throughout the podcast and that'll get out half

3328
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
of what I wanted to say so that it's not

3329
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
like an unbroken hour of me talking

3330
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
but yeah

3331
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
so okay

3332
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
writing process

3333
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
because for me writing and editing

3334
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
process are like two totally different worlds now

3335
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,000
because the videos I actually write are edited by somebody else

3336
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
and the videos I edit are usually not written

3337
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
so it's like

3338
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I've got two whole different schools going on

3339
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
you know and

3340
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
the writing process is totally different

3341
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
depending on what kind of video it is

3342
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
if it's one that's like

3343
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
let's say

3344
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
ten cool directing tricks in Evangelion

3345
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
you know that involves like having to watch

3346
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Evangelion and like take notes

3347
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
and find episodes where

3348
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
those things happen and stuff like that

3349
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
or

3350
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I just did one on the scene from Shirobako

3351
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I had to go rewatch that scene

3352
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
make sure I had all my facts straight and even then

3353
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm helped by having

3354
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
an unbelievably good memory

3355
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I can usually remember most of what happens

3356
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
in shows that I've seen

3357
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
usually I can remember down to what episode it was

3358
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
sometimes even where in the episode it happened

3359
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
so

3360
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I don't struggle too much with having to take notes on things

3361
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
and I only really

3362
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
have to go and recheck

3363
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
and rewatch stuff if it's a show I hate

3364
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
those are the ones where I probably

3365
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
wasn't paying the most attention

3366
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
like the asterisk war

3367
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I've seen all of it like three times

3368
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
in total

3369
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
because I had to watch the whole thing

3370
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
take notes then watch it

3371
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
and then pause

3372
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
every minute

3373
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
when I dissect the first episode

3374
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
it's like I'll watch 30 seconds of it

3375
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
and then hit pause and then write a page

3376
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
about those 30 seconds I just watched

3377
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
probably have to rewatch them a couple more times

3378
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
while writing it

3379
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
when I do

3380
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
watch stuff for a video

3381
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
it's never like I watched it

3382
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
and took notes and then wrote

3383
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
it's usually I just keep going back

3384
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
to the show like I have it open in another tab

3385
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
and I'm like you know

3386
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
write a paragraph then watch

3387
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
the clip back and make sure

3388
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
the Shirobako one

3389
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
you list yourself as having rewatched

3390
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
the asterisk war on Mal for that reason

3391
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I've rewatched it three times according to Mal

3392
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
okay well I'm going to go and mark myself as having

3393
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
rewatched it six times

3394
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
that's probably it

3395
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
so yeah

3396
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I'll go through

3397
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
for stuff like that but then a lot of it is just from

3398
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
memory and it really depends on how much

3399
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I can get away with like cool character designs

3400
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Gurren Lagann I've seen Gurren Lagann three times

3401
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
in the past the last time I watched it was

3402
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
early

3403
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
last year so almost two years ago

3404
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
didn't matter I was able to write it without rewatching

3405
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
the show I was afraid I would have to

3406
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
rewatch the show but I was like I fucking know

3407
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
the character designs in Gurren Lagann you know

3408
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
it's not going to be a problem but I have

3409
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
this excellent failsafe

3410
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
which is the Deveu because

3411
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
usually when I write a video

3412
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
you know he's going to have to watch the whole

3413
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
show in order to edit it because he has to know

3414
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
everything that's going to go in he has to find all the clips

3415
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
so

3416
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
I'll send stuff to him and like if there's

3417
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
something I say that outright is wrong

3418
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
he'll usually tell me like hey I wasn't able

3419
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
to find a scene like that you know

3420
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
and I'll be like well I guess I have to

3421
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
rewrite it or I'll tell him well this

3422
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
scene's kind of like it so use that one

3423
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
you know like this is close enough

3424
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
this will make it look like I'm correct

3425
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
so yeah

3426
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I kind of like I use the fact

3427
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
that Deveu is going to watch the show like

3428
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
with Gurren Lagann you know I had him

3429
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
go back through and there is there was

3430
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
one thing that like in that

3431
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
video in particular

3432
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Deveu was editing it down to the

3433
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
fucking wire on the deadline with it like it was

3434
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
due by midnight

3435
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
and it was uploaded

3436
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
like at 11.30 you know because we had to

3437
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
get it out by the end of the month and I

3438
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
would have probably had him

3439
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
cut out the part where I say that the beast men

3440
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
all have sketchy outlines

3441
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
yeah was not proven

3442
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
visually like the stuff you

3443
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
show didn't prove that at all and I would have

3444
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
totally no believe me I looked

3445
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
extremely thoroughly and I could not

3446
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
really find it. Well that's the kind of thing where

3447
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
if I had rewatched the show I would have just

3448
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
cut that line out because it's obviously not true

3449
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I don't know I feel like the fact that

3450
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
the art direction did something

3451
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
to give you that impression

3452
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
means that there's something going on with

3453
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
the art there. Well there is such a thing as fucking up so

3454
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
you know. I mean I think I just should have

3455
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
the sentence is

3456
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
factually inaccurate they do not have

3457
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
sketchy outlines consistently across the

3458
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
characters and like

3459
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
you know Davoo showed footage which clearly

3460
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
proved me wrong so I was like

3461
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
okay this should have been cut but at that

3462
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
stage it was too late. I picked the clips

3463
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
that prove you the least wrong possible

3464
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
yeah that's fair. Which is sad because I watched them

3465
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
and I went oh well I guess I was wrong.

3466
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
You know what I believe I was going to tell you about that

3467
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
like when I was at that part but you were like a sleep

3468
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
yeah well that's the problem. A sleep at the

3469
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
wheel more like making these fucking videos. Editing down to the fucking

3470
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
literal last minute because I noticed it and I

3471
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
was just like we can't do anything about it it's too late

3472
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
this video has to come out by the end of the month

3473
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
you know. And thus that corporate

3474
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
shill influence starts to take the

3475
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
art here we go down the fucking

3476
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
rabbit hole. More importantly has anyone

3477
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
complained about that. Right now

3478
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
fuck you guys.

3479
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
You know I was like

3480
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
when me and Ben were watching it back I was like

3481
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
oh that's clearly like a point I didn't

3482
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
make and Ben's like yeah you

3483
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
you know that not proven. Yeah but

3484
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
then you'd have to cut out the part where you say

3485
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
that Lord Genome has the most

3486
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
crazy out. Now and I mean

3487
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
the other problem would be that by cutting

3488
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
out time the video because the video is exactly

3489
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
ten minutes and one second long

3490
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
and it's over ten minutes that means you get

3491
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
the double on the advertising at the end of

3492
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
the video so you know like how

3493
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
what am I going to cut out twenty seconds

3494
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
worth of the video because I was kind of wrong

3495
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
and then like lose half the ad revenue

3496
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I could have on it in retention you know. You fucking

3497
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
shill bitch. You

3498
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
don't fucking lie and say

3499
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
things are intentionally wrong. I feel like

3500
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
in this case it was a mistake. Maybe you could

3501
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
just alter the line. Throw money at it.

3502
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
No you can get the better equipment

3503
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
but you deserve to be shit on it. Throw the

3504
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
shackles at everybody and you win.

3505
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Well think of it. That's what I've learned today.

3506
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Think of it this way I mean if the

3507
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
on-screen footage is actively proving

3508
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
me wrong then everyone can observe

3509
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
that I was wrong. You know I don't

3510
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
have to make a correction. What is that excuse

3511
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
like oh I don't need to be right because they'll just prove

3512
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
me wrong later it's totally not on me guys it's everyone

3513
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
else's fault. No no no I'm saying

3514
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
everyone you could have. Everyone can look at the

3515
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
screen and go well he clearly was wrong about

3516
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
that. His editor found that out you

3517
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
know. So

3518
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I don't know. I feel like most

3519
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
people would probably be like

3520
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I guess those lines are sketchy. Maybe

3521
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
they just didn't show the sketchy part. Yeah

3522
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I think most people would doubt

3523
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
themselves. You know you could have the line

3524
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
could have just been altered to the beast

3525
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
men are drawn in a subtly

3526
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
different manner. Yeah no

3527
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
it could have been fixed but we didn't have

3528
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
time because the fucking true

3529
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I mean Viral looks the same I mean you know

3530
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
he's weird but yeah

3531
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
whatever I don't care. Point being

3532
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
it was it was a mistake and

3533
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
but anyways

3534
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
the writing process you know for something like

3535
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Shinbo in the 90s is like we

3536
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
like me and DeVoo would watch through the OVA

3537
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I'd note down all the things that happened

3538
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
in that OVA and then I'd

3539
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
write three paragraphs about that OVA

3540
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
you know and contain all the information so

3541
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
some of it's written like that then some of it

3542
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
is just like me just pulling from

3543
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
my wealth of anime knowledge and

3544
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
the way that my writing usually works

3545
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
is that it starts

3546
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
with the first sentence like I

3547
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I have an idea I'm thinking

3548
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
alright

3549
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
anime there's too much anime about

3550
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
high school and my theory is that

3551
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
it's because high school is secretly the most

3552
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
interesting part of a Japanese person's life

3553
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
how do I start this post

3554
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
and I'll go outside and I'll be walking around

3555
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
and I'll just think like it's

3556
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
usually just a catchy sentence like something fun

3557
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
like god whatever

3558
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I say at the start anime and high school

3559
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
are practically inseparable

3560
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
you know like that's how I'd present this idea

3561
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
and then from there it just

3562
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
it just goes like as soon as I figure out

3563
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
that first sentence the rest of the thing is

3564
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
pretty much locked in place and I just sit

3565
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
down and fucking go

3566
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
and it's rare I don't know how many of you guys

3567
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
like know Digi's writing history

3568
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
but for those who don't like he just

3569
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
has always I guess he said he always just

3570
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
writes in a stream of consciousness

3571
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
most of the time and he just did it so much

3572
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
for so long and I'm just so that he would

3573
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
actually be really good and I mean yeah you can go

3574
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
through my whole writing history on my

3575
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
blog and see everything I've written and in the early days

3576
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
it's a lot of it's barely

3577
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
comprehensible and there's so many

3578
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
extraneous details like

3579
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
the way I used to write is just

3580
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I mean it's always been just whatever comes into

3581
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
my head but as a result of that

3582
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
like I used to just not cut anything

3583
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
and it was just like I

3584
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
hadn't I wouldn't think about it enough

3585
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
for writing it you know like

3586
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I don't take notes but I think on the thing

3587
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
like if I have an idea for a video I walk

3588
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
around I consider it I think

3589
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
what's the angle I'm going to approach it from

3590
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
and then I write it all at once back then

3591
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
it would just be like there's all these personal

3592
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
anecdotes in there that don't belong or just like

3593
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
notations on like how

3594
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
hot this character is totally

3595
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
out of nowhere and not in the funny

3596
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
way I do it now where it's like you know and

3597
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
by the way dairy's got the best body in the

3598
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
series just saying you know like it's kind of a little

3599
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
tricky thing but but also something I did

3600
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
want to be in the video

3601
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
like how can idiots

3602
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
like you say that when Nia there

3603
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
and I'm talking about little baby Nia little baby

3604
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Nia's got the best body in the series that's a

3605
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
close second I mean I'm like not even

3606
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
joking that like child Nia 14 year old

3607
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Nia is one of the most attractive characters

3608
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
ever in an anime I agree

3609
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I don't think she's less attractive

3610
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
than dairy I just think dairy has the

3611
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
best bod like

3612
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
damn maybe she's got that fucking ass well she's

3613
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
one who was in the tight fitting outfits

3614
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
you can't really compare

3615
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Nia's got kind of a banana body

3616
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
you know she's she ain't got

3617
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
no ass dairy's got that

3618
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
she really she's

3619
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
not much better dairy it's

3620
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
whatever I'll study it later

3621
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
please do

3622
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
but anyways

3623
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
yeah like my old

3624
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
writing was just a total chaotic mess

3625
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
and I've talked about this before how like what

3626
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I what I

3627
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
had this revelation where I had this teacher in college

3628
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
who told me like

3629
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
I had to write something for him and he wanted it to be like 500

3630
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
words and of course I way overshot

3631
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
went for like 700 because back in high

3632
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
school that impresses a teacher

3633
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
if you go over the word count

3634
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
yeah for sure and college this was not impressive

3635
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
he was like this is too long I asked for 500

3636
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
words and he's like you know cut

3637
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
out all these extraneous details and stuff so I start

3638
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
removing shit and I give it to him again it's like

3639
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
550 words and he's like look you really

3640
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
he was like I think you you have like a great

3641
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
written voice but you need to learn how to simplify

3642
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
he said he's specifically said simplify

3643
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
simplify simplify and I was like

3644
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
okay now I gotta get serious

3645
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
so I start like running through this thing with a fine

3646
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
tooth comb and like making every sentence

3647
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
perfect and like it was so satisfying

3648
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
to do that that I then

3649
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
totally changed my anime

3650
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
blogging style and like started

3651
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
just like obsessing over

3652
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
every script and like perfecting all the sentences

3653
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
until that came naturally

3654
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
and then I switched back to this more conversational

3655
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
freeform style but now I

3656
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
can just condense information well I

3657
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
just know how to do that

3658
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
so yeah it was just like this learning process

3659
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
of if you yeah again if you go back

3660
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
through read like my stuff from 2010

3661
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
and read the stuff

3662
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
in the summer of 2010 because you'll see this

3663
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
moment where

3664
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I think the last post I'd written in my sprawling

3665
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
style was

3666
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
being an anime

3667
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
lifer or like being a Yu-Gi-Oh

3668
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
life or something like that where it was it was

3669
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
me observing how different people have

3670
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
called themselves like there's certain shows

3671
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
that they're just obsessed with for their whole lives

3672
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
and I never really had something like that and I was like

3673
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I guess Yu-Gi-Oh is a show

3674
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I've always been into but like I'm not like

3675
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
way into it or anything that's the point of the post

3676
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
it's like 1300 words

3677
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
and half of it is totally extraneous

3678
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
it could have been cut and so after

3679
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
like I you know got this simplification

3680
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
simplification lesson

3681
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I looked at that post and I was like god this is awful

3682
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
like why did I write all this extra stuff in here

3683
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
this is not what I should be doing and so the very

3684
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
next like three posts are like spartan

3685
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
it's like 500 word tight little

3686
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
posts and then it like expands back out

3687
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
from there so you know that's sort of the

3688
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
development of my style and now it's

3689
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
just the ideas in my head

3690
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
write it all out and it's very

3691
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
fast very instantaneous

3692
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
unless it's a huge

3693
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
project in which case there's a lot of getting

3694
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
up going outside smoking thinking of

3695
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
the next sentence like you know

3696
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
my favorite example would be the

3697
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
psychopaths video because there's

3698
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
you know it's broken up into five parts

3699
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
and I remember distinctly when I

3700
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
was working through the part where I was comparing

3701
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Makishima to the villain from season

3702
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
two Kamui and I'm just

3703
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
comparing these villains and like every paragraph

3704
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I had to like

3705
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
go out think about it for a while

3706
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
and like think of the perfect sentence

3707
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
and then start the next paragraph and I just kept doing

3708
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
that I just kept getting up and going out and thinking of the

3709
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
next perfect sentence and then writing the next paragraph

3710
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
and it was so fun time

3711
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
you know out of all the videos I've written

3712
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
and made there's only one where I think

3713
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
I had kind of a pretty interesting to describe

3714
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
writing process which was roller coaster

3715
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
tycoon 3 where I

3716
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
basically this was my method

3717
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I start talking about something that annoys

3718
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
me or yeah something about that annoys

3719
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
me about roller coaster tycoon 3

3720
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and any time I use the word

3721
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
just as in

3722
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
this is just annoying as in just fuck my

3723
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
shit up fam as in

3724
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
this is just ugly or like that right there is

3725
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
just annoying any time

3726
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I felt the need to use the word just

3727
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I then blew up the just

3728
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
into a whole paragraph of explaining

3729
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
of justification and that

3730
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
was how the whole thing eventually became

3731
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
really long that's like just did

3732
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
evolved into that's really interesting

3733
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
actually

3734
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I was actually on a huge anti-just

3735
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
kick I was super opposed

3736
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
to the word just at the time

3737
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
for that copier aware that just

3738
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
just the all caps word just

3739
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
is a big meme

3740
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
it's a big meme so

3741
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
yeah so

3742
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
most of my writing happens like that

3743
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
in these violent spurts

3744
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
and it's also about figuring out what kind

3745
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
of video is this gonna be it's like

3746
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
the most important thing because

3747
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
most other youtubers have a

3748
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
defined structure like Nate you have

3749
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
best anime ever it's always

3750
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
kind of following this formula

3751
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
where there's gonna be some kind of intro joke

3752
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
there's gonna be and

3753
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
as well you know there's gonna be

3754
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
introductory sort of comedic scenario

3755
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
then you're gonna introduce the topic

3756
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
of the the the media

3757
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
you know go through this and that all of mine

3758
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
are so different that each one is like

3759
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
it's really mostly about what

3760
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
is the what is this video

3761
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
like what is even is it is

3762
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
it a retrospective

3763
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
is it me like talking about

3764
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
just cinematic techniques is it gonna be more

3765
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
emotional is this gonna be personal

3766
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
you know and the

3767
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
hardest video ever to write

3768
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
in that regard was aesthetic

3769
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
is narrative because I had like

3770
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
10 different ways I could have approached it

3771
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
that were all totally different like some of

3772
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
them were let's take one

3773
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
picture and analyze that

3774
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
picture in depth and that'll prove that aesthetic

3775
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
is narrative and some of it was like well what if we

3776
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
made it really broad and talked about it in the

3777
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
way that like art can mean all these different

3778
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
things and I just kind of ended up

3779
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
combining all of them in the video it's like

3780
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
20 minutes and it's broken up into like

3781
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
all these different 5 minute sections of

3782
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
just like exploring these different concepts

3783
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
and it took forever to write

3784
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
well I don't know how Gib feels about it

3785
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
but I think it's a little bit inaccurate

3786
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
to say that things are always the same

3787
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
in our vids and rears are always

3788
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
a totally different format because I mean they

3789
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
follow the formula of you know converting

3790
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
this text piece into video

3791
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
like aesthetically they're very similar

3792
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
in the way that they're done well sure and

3793
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I mean sure the topics are different I just

3794
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
mean the approach

3795
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
like yeah the approach I take is always the same

3796
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
it's write it out all at once

3797
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and you can clearly tell my written voice

3798
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
and you can tell it's me you know but

3799
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
it's just that the most

3800
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
important part of the whole writing process

3801
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
is figuring out what it is

3802
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
you know it's not about

3803
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
like if you know you're gonna do like an

3804
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
intro then it's about how am I

3805
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
gonna do the intro you know what is

3806
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
the joke gonna be how am I gonna stage

3807
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
this introduction to

3808
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
the video for me the

3809
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
entire thing is

3810
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
what the fuck is this video you know

3811
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
is it an analysis is it not

3812
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
is it a review is it

3813
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
does it contain information about

3814
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
the thing because I don't like to summarize

3815
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
you know so something like the mob psycho 100

3816
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
video is like

3817
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
just analysis like it's

3818
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
just a very bare bones here's

3819
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
what's interesting about mob psycho

3820
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
no real plot description except for where

3821
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
it like you know where I can work it into

3822
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
talking about the show but it kind of just starts

3823
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
off like you know this is

3824
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
this is what mob's character is like

3825
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
and here's what Reagan's character is like

3826
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
and that's that's cool you know

3827
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
and so

3828
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
figuring out what the video is gonna be

3829
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
is like how that came together as opposed

3830
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
to you know

3831
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
where's the plot description gonna go where

3832
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
am I gonna talk about characters and stuff like that

3833
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
which I feel is more what a normal

3834
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
review is like you know what

3835
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I think most people go into it like

3836
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
there's gonna be a

3837
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
description of the thing in there somewhere

3838
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I spent a lot of time

3839
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
wondering about how I'm gonna work in my

3840
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
x out of 10 you know at the end of the video

3841
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
that's really important you gotta get that right

3842
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
without that execution the whole video is pointless

3843
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
yeah um I'm sure there's

3844
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
a lot of people who for that is

3845
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
entirely accurate

3846
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I'm sure it is

3847
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
yeah so so that's how the

3848
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
writing comes together for the ones that do

3849
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
edits and then I just fucking I do the

3850
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
audio I ship it off to him and it's done

3851
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
and those are very much like

3852
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
they're just in my mind they're just

3853
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
text posts that are set to video

3854
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
they're not videos in the

3855
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
like strictest sense of the word they're not

3856
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
constructed like with the

3857
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
idea that they will be a video first

3858
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
and I mean I incorporate a lot of elements

3859
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
that I couldn't do in text you know

3860
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
where there'll be unscripted segments like in

3861
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
that high too many

3862
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
anime high schoolers or whatever

3863
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
you know there's a segment where it's just me in front of my

3864
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
collection and I just use that

3865
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
as an example I mean you do you have

3866
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
evolved your writing style a lot

3867
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
knowing that it's going to be

3868
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
in the audio video format right like I

3869
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
write but what did you mean

3870
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
is he's not like thinking about like

3871
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
how the video will be formatted like

3872
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
with things that can only be done with

3873
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
video with like live action segments

3874
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
it's it's you know back in the

3875
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
text blogging days you would have to

3876
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
if you wanted to describe like

3877
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
the way a scene plays out you

3878
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
would have to like literally

3879
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
describe what happens in the scene because

3880
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
you can't show it I mean we would usually use

3881
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
images and stuff and you know ghost

3882
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
lightning innovated and you slide shows and stuff

3883
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
like that but like you had to go into a

3884
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
lot more description whereas now I can say

3885
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
a sentence like you know

3886
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
when animator Yutaka Nakamura

3887
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
does a scene like this

3888
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
and I say this and like in the

3889
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
text post that is totally

3890
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
unhelpful but in video

3891
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
it's on screen so that's what I mean by this

3892
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
course so like I do make

3893
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
illustrations like that but for the most part

3894
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
it's written like a blog post

3895
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
that is being adapted into video

3896
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
and I love that because I always wanted

3897
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
back in the anime blogger days like we were

3898
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
always saying wouldn't it be so much more helpful

3899
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
if we could show you what the fuck we're talking about

3900
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
you know like wouldn't it be so much more

3901
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
helpful if I could just like when I say

3902
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
you know Shinbo has

3903
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
a weird aesthetic if I could actually

3904
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
show the aesthetic you would get

3905
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
it way more easily and like

3906
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
that was something you know that me and ghost

3907
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
lighting we're always saying like oh if only we could do

3908
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
video and then suddenly we could do video

3909
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
yeah not that he could exceed enough time

3910
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
so like that's sort of where I come from

3911
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
as opposed to coming from it like

3912
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
like I feel like you guys more

3913
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
come from I want to make a funny

3914
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
video and you know the review

3915
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
is more of a like

3916
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
like a vehicle to make an entertaining

3917
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
video I think of myself as

3918
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
a film director personally yeah

3919
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
exactly and I don't at all

3920
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
but then the funny thing is

3921
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
that I actually do take that

3922
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
approach to all the other shit

3923
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I edit because I actually

3924
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
it's funny I hate

3925
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
editing as much as Tom but I only hate editing

3926
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
when it's the scripts

3927
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
that I'm doing when it's a video about

3928
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
like what I'm you know giving to DeVoo

3929
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I enjoy editing when it's all just

3930
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
making shit up on the fly when it's

3931
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
like just finding solutions

3932
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
when like the video is being created in the

3933
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
editing because then it's about

3934
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
of course creatively that makes it more

3935
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
making something up so like my

3936
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
vlogs there's a reason that

3937
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
you know you might get a few more

3938
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
random musical interludes or just like

3939
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
weird things that pop up in the middle

3940
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
of a vlog or something because it's like

3941
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
it's a lot more fun to

3942
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
problem solve there and

3943
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
and you know I don't do a lot

3944
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I'm a big fan of the idea that

3945
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
like even the smallest edit can change

3946
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
things massively and I really picked that up from Jesse

3947
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
where Jesse will do a video that's

3948
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
ostensibly just a vlog

3949
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
but then like there's one moment

3950
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
where just the camera zooms in on his

3951
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
face right when he drops something

3952
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
and it's fucking hilarious you know

3953
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
and it just totally changes the nature of

3954
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
it even though it's such a minor edit in the

3955
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
middle of what could be a 15 minute vlog

3956
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
you know I mean

3957
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Plebe and the Weave is kind of edited that way

3958
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
like most of it's just us talking but then he zooms

3959
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
in on our faces at funny moments and puts

3960
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
text on screen here and there and it totally

3961
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
changes it into a much funnier product

3962
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
or just those weird explosions

3963
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
of things happening at parts and so

3964
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
that's sort of the approach I take to like after

3965
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
dark and to any more experimental

3966
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
stuff I have is just I

3967
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
take a bunch of footage and

3968
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
just if there's anything I can do to it

3969
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I do it if there's not anything I don't care

3970
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I don't go into it like I don't go

3971
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
into filming thinking this will

3972
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
be edited into a joke later

3973
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I just film what I have and then when I'm watching

3974
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
it back if there's something that I'm like oh that

3975
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
would be hilarious you know then I'll put

3976
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
it in there and so that's why it's very

3977
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
inconsistent if you watch all the after dark

3978
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
vlogs most of them are me talking into a camera

3979
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
and then some of them suddenly have like all

3980
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
this weird stuff happening and it's like

3981
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
where did this come from

3982
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
or suddenly it's a a work out

3983
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
vlog where you know I have Victor filming

3984
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
me working out and I've got like

3985
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
I've got the anime playing on a

3986
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
monitor that's sitting next to me on

3987
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
a stool and then I've got

3988
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
like three cameras set up in like

3989
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
weird locations like to capture different

3990
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
angles on it and you know

3991
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
microphones like barely hidden out of

3992
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
camera so like sometimes

3993
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
one random video will

3994
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
be like a totally new setup

3995
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
it's nothing I've ever done before it's just like

3996
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
completely inventing the

3997
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
style of a new video just

3998
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
for this one video and that's when editing is fun

3999
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
that's when it's like all just

4000
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
cool stuff and like how am I gonna make this

4001
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
vision I have come together that's like

4002
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
nothing I've ever done before

4003
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
but none of it's ever too complicated

4004
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I'm more about that's right you know

4005
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
all the all the like regular videos

4006
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
that I make for the didgy bro channel

4007
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
almost all the time it is

4008
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
in as little

4009
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
time as possible as efficiently as possible

4010
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
getting to a normal acceptable

4011
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
quality because that is the most

4012
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
efficient for like being successful

4013
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and actually getting statements out there

4014
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
but in the event that there is a video

4015
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
that is like this mess

4016
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
of different information lying

4017
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
on the floor that you need to staple together

4018
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
improvisationally

4019
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
as you go which I only have

4020
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
one big video like that which is my

4021
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
debate with a commenter the story of Dow

4022
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
which is like this video with like seven

4023
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
different parts which I was writing

4024
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
and recording and editing like as I

4025
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
went through it out of order like I

4026
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
completely did it out of order and I just

4027
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
did it all in one hectic 24

4028
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
hour editing writing

4029
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
recording session in which I didn't sleep

4030
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
and I barely ate because it was so

4031
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
exciting like I feel like Nate for as much

4032
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
work as you put into your videos

4033
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I feel like the percentage of time that you

4034
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
spend being like tedious

4035
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
out and just being like it's probably

4036
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
lower than most people because

4037
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
you give me the sense that you put a lot

4038
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
of fun creativity into every moment of

4039
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
it that's true it's certainly true yeah

4040
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I mean that's anytime it's more

4041
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
a sense of despair looking at the timeline

4042
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
and seeing like how much I accomplish today

4043
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
and being like just let it right that's why

4044
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I eventually didn't go with that style like the

4045
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
first like main like originally that is how

4046
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
I went into videos whether or not I was good at the time

4047
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I did that whole every detail

4048
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
of something I've poured over

4049
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
style and if I got paid a million

4050
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
dollars every time for that I would have never

4051
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
broken away from it but

4052
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
I mean but then I would love

4053
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
to see what Nate would do if

4054
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
you just made more stuff

4055
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
like I can't fucking think of the

4056
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
word or like what what Gibbon takes

4057
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
whole channel is where it's like

4058
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
it's just you have an idea

4059
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
and you just like violently go

4060
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
about it messily and you just

4061
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
make it a thing and like that's because

4062
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
the Dow video I can see where there's

4063
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
lots of like weird inventive tricks

4064
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
in there like the way you do text where like

4065
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
there's these like these reveals

4066
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
of text on the screen

4067
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
and it's like all these slow

4068
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
wipes like I can tell you had to time all that

4069
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
out and think of how the text was going

4070
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
to appear and I thought it was really cool and

4071
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
it was like something that you know that's a technique

4072
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
you just kind of came up with for that

4073
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
video haven't really had to use again

4074
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
but that's where it's the most

4075
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
fun and I've done stuff like

4076
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
the anime is getting lazy

4077
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
with its meta video is like one of the last

4078
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
ones that I edited that I like

4079
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
really put effort into and it's

4080
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
dirty as hell it is way grungy

4081
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
images are just like flying

4082
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
in and out of the screen at random there's all these

4083
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
like weird low res things because

4084
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I love like the most fun to

4085
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
me is when I do like really multimedia

4086
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
visuals when I grab like

4087
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
you know footage

4088
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
from real life and then footage from

4089
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
anime and then images and then like

4090
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
weird pictures and like it all kind of

4091
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
coalesces in this like maelstrom and

4092
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
it's ugly but it's a lot of fun

4093
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
to do to have like weird

4094
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
footage and my favorite

4095
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
and this is this is the most

4096
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
like ever that I had an idea that way

4097
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
outstripped my ability to execute it

4098
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
is where I'm trying to say

4099
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
a tidal wave of light novels

4100
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
crashes over and I just

4101
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I took footage of a

4102
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
tidal wave like you know crashing over

4103
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Japan which is not as easy to find

4104
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
as you would think like to have one that was

4105
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
like actually at the shore like most

4106
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
of it's in city so I wanted one that was

4107
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
like the waves actually coming onto the beach

4108
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
and

4109
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
the problem with it is that the camera

4110
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
moves in this shot so

4111
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
like you know if it was just a stationary

4112
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
shot of waves coming in it would be really easy to keyframe

4113
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
and animate a bunch of light novels

4114
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
you know surfing up over the shore

4115
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
but unfortunately the cameras moving

4116
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
so I have to constantly change the

4117
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
perspective of all the light novels and

4118
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
like each one has to be like

4119
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
halfway poking out of the water

4120
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
and they have to be moving on like

4121
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
the same kind of speed it was

4122
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
a nightmare like it was way beyond

4123
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
what I could do way way way

4124
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
beyond like trying to measure out every

4125
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
keyframe to match the camera movement was

4126
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
fucking impossible even if that was

4127
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
like five seconds long doing every

4128
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
frame for like I don't know exactly

4129
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
it took too much it took like

4130
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I think it was ten

4131
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
seconds of clip and it took like

4132
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
two hours to do and it looks

4133
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
like shit you know like two that's

4134
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
two hours to get it to even the

4135
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
level that I was willing to go

4136
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
and you can clearly see everything looks

4137
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
like a fucking mess and it's ugly as

4138
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
hell but it was a lot of fun

4139
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
like to have that idea and

4140
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
to just go and do it you know

4141
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
and I'm sure if Nate had done the same idea

4142
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
he would have executed it all the way

4143
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
and edited that for two fucking days

4144
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
until it was perfect it is what I do

4145
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
like there that it's definitely

4146
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
that's when editing is the most fun

4147
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
is when you have this vision of something

4148
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
that you have to like completely invent

4149
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
how it's going to be made and

4150
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
you know even if it looks like

4151
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
shit at least it was fun to do

4152
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
like with the whole girl login

4153
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
part one I just came up with that whole

4154
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
motion thing and yeah

4155
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
I think the only time I actually had fun

4156
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
editing was

4157
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
editing tale the smartest pony man

4158
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
it was when

4159
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
everyone was proven wrong and edited all

4160
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
the comments oh right yeah

4161
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
you were so right about that yeah it was awesome

4162
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
that was the best video ever

4163
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
that was the one time I edited with a smile on my face

4164
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
because the fuck you I've been waiting years

4165
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
for

4166
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
I forget what was the event that transpired

4167
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
just reminds me it was when

4168
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
the little princess bitch was born

4169
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
and she was born in Alicorn and they were both

4170
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
we don't fucking know how that shit happened

4171
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
and for like three years I've been

4172
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
heckled for my position on that

4173
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
completely contradicts other things we've

4174
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
learned in the series but it's all

4175
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
out the window so whatever

4176
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
it was a good

4177
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
a lot of the time when I'm

4178
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
and then it was a bad day

4179
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
fuck off everybody

4180
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
I only really like editing

4181
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
when

4182
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I can make myself laugh by a joke

4183
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
like if I've got a joke going

4184
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
and I play it back and it's like yeah

4185
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
yeah then I have

4186
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
the power to continue for the day

4187
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
but a lot of the time it's just like

4188
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
oh it didn't work I did all that

4189
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
preparation the recording the live action

4190
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
the putting all the things in there and it

4191
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
just falls flat so sometimes I just have to

4192
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
delete it it's really annoying

4193
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
the joke you did recently give that I really liked

4194
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
was in the Rayman video was when

4195
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
you're talking about the game and then you

4196
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
you stop and you turn and it goes

4197
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
with the other camera angle you make your next point

4198
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
then you just stare at the camera for a while

4199
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
and you're like that was a joke

4200
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
that's why I changed the angle

4201
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
you just you hold on that and like

4202
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
spell it all out and it takes like

4203
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
20 seconds to do

4204
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I'm gonna be honest

4205
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
didn't care for that joke

4206
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
thought it went on way too long

4207
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
that's what made it funny was that it was

4208
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
awkwardly long

4209
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
so I went through the like giggle initially

4210
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
and then the like okay let's move on

4211
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
and then the like secondary oh okay he's doing it too

4212
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
and then it just kept going

4213
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
I laughed harder the longer it went

4214
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
alright sure enough

4215
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
so you know what I was gonna say about the whole uh getting bored thing

4216
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
um the great thing about

4217
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
having uh like doing things the way

4218
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I do where I put my my music down

4219
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
and then I edit uh

4220
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
visuals after I've got that laid in

4221
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
um like the like the video I'm currently doing

4222
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
like I already know

4223
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
where all like the emotional

4224
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
uh fucking hits are gonna come

4225
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
and I've got it all mapped out

4226
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
so like at the end of the day I have a ritual I sort of do

4227
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
at the beginning of editing at the end of editing

4228
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I just watch everything I've done from the very start

4229
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
and like I can see it starting to develop

4230
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
and it feels so good

4231
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
funny thing about that because

4232
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Davoo was saying that like with

4233
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
the current stream of videos he's been editing

4234
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
for me he has not been watching them

4235
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
back at all like at no point

4236
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
in the editing because he knows that

4237
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm gonna watch it. It's half the time

4238
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
half the time I just I'm already

4239
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
tired of it before I even watch it back

4240
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
but the other half like the shinbo ones those are more

4241
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
complicated I do need to watch those back

4242
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
well like yeah with the uh like

4243
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
the girl in the gun and shiro bako

4244
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
and anime and high school ones

4245
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
like he finished and then he called me over

4246
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
and like I sat down and watched it he just fucked off

4247
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
to another room like and I just

4248
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
watched the video like you know if I didn't have any

4249
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
complaints then then what does it matter

4250
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
to him you know like because he's editing it for me

4251
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I'm the client so like uh

4252
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
you know and I usually have like one or two things I want

4253
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
him to change he changes those things doesn't even

4254
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
watch it back which fascinates me because

4255
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I watch back what I'm editing

4256
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
constantly like

4257
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
every time I do like

4258
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
even if it's a long video I'll watch

4259
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
back like the whole fucking

4260
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
right now I'm in the middle of a

4261
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
fairly inventive editing

4262
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
not well I won't say it's inventive but it's different

4263
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
for what I usually do

4264
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
for like this kind of unscripted

4265
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
um vlog thing

4266
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
where I'm splicing in lots of stuff and like

4267
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
just to check the flow I'll like

4268
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
watch like 20 minutes

4269
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
of an hour long video back just to see like

4270
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
do I think this feels right

4271
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
you know like do I like how these clips

4272
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
are cutting in or like you know or

4273
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
do I just like the rhythm of how I talk

4274
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
even like my totally unedited vlogs

4275
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I usually watch a few times before I post

4276
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
them um and so

4277
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
like yeah I just I really want to know

4278
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I want to know exactly what I'm posting

4279
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I want to know it

4280
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
down to the core so that

4281
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
you know if I look back at it I'll

4282
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
immediately recognize it and not have to like

4283
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
especially for comments and discussion

4284
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
because when there's a video I haven't

4285
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
seen as much then like people will

4286
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
bring it up and I'll be like what I don't

4287
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
even fucking remember saying that you know

4288
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
yeah yeah so

4289
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
I want to have a good grasp of what I've been talking

4290
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
about recently it makes sense though that

4291
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Davoo doesn't I mean since he knows

4292
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
someone else is going to be reviewing he has the luxury

4293
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
of you know just not worrying about as much

4294
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I remember

4295
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
something I was going to say about the

4296
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
being happy when you're editing

4297
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
whenever I'm editing like a

4298
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
stupid joke video for give and take like

4299
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
um the one I did

4300
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
about the you should

4301
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
why you should vote thing I had the

4302
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
idea of like the thumbnail is just boring

4303
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
but the video itself is weird

4304
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
and that that I made that

4305
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
like real quick before the election

4306
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
was over because the election was going on at the time

4307
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
and I was like my

4308
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I was smiling the whole way through it was like

4309
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
yeah yeah it was so cool

4310
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
and that's that's why

4311
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I wish give and take was the most popular

4312
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
channel ever because

4313
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I would get so much money

4314
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I have moments where I'm like

4315
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
should I just start putting

4316
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
better thumbnails on Digibra after dark

4317
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
and just try like part of

4318
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
me doesn't want the channel to grow because

4319
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I like that I can do whatever I want

4320
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
there's no expectations and the comments

4321
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
aren't total shit most of the time

4322
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
but like you know

4323
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
all I'd have to do is like give it nice

4324
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
thumbnails and that channel would

4325
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
would blow up and it already has 50,000 subscribers

4326
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
but like it could be

4327
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
it could be like Ethan and Hila where like

4328
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
they their side channel became as big as

4329
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
the main one eventually

4330
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
there's always a temptation because I'm like

4331
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
man wouldn't it be fun to switch to

4332
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
just being this like fucking

4333
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
unhinged oboe vlogger

4334
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
you know

4335
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
but um you know I kind of value

4336
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
the the main channel

4337
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
and I like having a place

4338
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
where I can dump literally whatever

4339
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
the fuck I want and nobody

4340
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
will question it too hard

4341
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
yeah that's pretty important

4342
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
to have I mean because if you did that

4343
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I'm sure you would just make another channel

4344
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
where you could post things that you really don't give a shit about

4345
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
and it would just go on forever

4346
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I even had like I've had a few times

4347
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
where like I actually

4348
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
had to debate like is this

4349
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
so shit that it shouldn't even go

4350
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
on Digibra after dark

4351
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
should just be on

4352
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Modal Soul you know

4353
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I love these tier lists of like

4354
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
I mean it actually was like because originally

4355
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
originally after dark was not

4356
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
just anything it was like

4357
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
just stuff that wasn't for the main channel

4358
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
so like I did have my old channel

4359
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Modal Soul Productions where I'd post like weird music videos

4360
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
and stuff but then eventually I was like

4361
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
you know what like I want these

4362
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
weird music videos to actually have some audience

4363
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
so fuck it fuck everyone

4364
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
who subscribes to Digibra after dark

4365
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
if they can't take it you know like this this channel

4366
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
is for the powerful it's not for

4367
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
people who are going to meekly unsubscribe

4368
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
because a weird rap video that says

4369
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
nigger 200 times showed up you know

4370
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
agreed

4371
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
so uh are we done here

4372
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
are we all wrapped up? yeah I think so

4373
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
he's been going for quite a while

4374
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I guess I should have known

4375
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
yeah I suppose

4376
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
any time that we do one that's like each of us talk

4377
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
about a thing on our own

4378
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
it always ends up being too long

4379
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
well we didn't know Davoo was going to be here until

4380
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
like the last minute so like I had kind of thought

4381
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
we're short we only have four people

4382
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
and I demanded to go on because this is the first time

4383
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
in like 20 episodes

4384
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
I really cared to be on an episode

4385
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
because god damn it my couch

4386
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
is so cool I need people to know

4387
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
well I'm glad

4388
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000

I'm supposed to

4426
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
be making money

4427
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
I'm supposed to

4428
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
be creating

4429
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
funny things that

4430
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
the people

4431
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
gladly will pay

4432
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
for artistic

4433
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
genius

4434
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
that's what they came for

4435
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
instead I'm tweeting

4436
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
hashtag repeating

4437
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
that's why

4438
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
there's no heat

4439
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
and holes in the ceiling

4440
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
yeah

4441
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
it's quite the burden

4442
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
it's a hard knock life

4443
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
being

4444
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
a genius
