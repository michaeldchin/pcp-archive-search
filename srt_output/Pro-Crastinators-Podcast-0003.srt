00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey everybody, welcome to episode 3 of the PCP Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best guy ever guy here once again to talk about stuff that interests us.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Everybody, let's say who you are, and I'm going to organize this so that we go along smoothly. Jesse, who are you?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Haha! I'm me. There you go, Tom.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm Tommy Oliver and I make videos about art stuff and I'll do a comic or something someday.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, Gibbon. I mean Hippocrit.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I am... I am the...

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You said it, Ben.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
SaintComics.com, Patreon.com slash Ben Saint.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Always getting that patron plug. That's my boy.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And together we are the procrastinators. We're here to save the day.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Together we are... We'll always do it anyway. That's why the people of this world donate to our YouTube fund.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They give us money there. We're crustal friends. We suck a lot of dick. It never ends.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And if you haven't guessed by now, the subject of today's episode is Steven Universe.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And we're going to talk about a whole bunch of stuff regarding it, all our favorite things, things we don't like if there is any.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I'm interested in talking about the way the show is produced as well.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to write off the bat and let everyone know that even though Steven Universe is great and the way the steam bomb was great,

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't care because I'm in a shitty mood. I'm going to complain about it. I'm going to tell you all how much it sucks.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's the worst show ever. And how you're all gay for liking it.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fucking SJWs. SJWs all of you.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, it's true.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm glad at least someone is here to object to us because all of us love the show. We're all super into it.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't think many of us have much bad to say about it in general.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Who doesn't love the show?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know. You have to be a Dumbo.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is there some grinch up on Mount Crumpet somewhere just like sneering down at the rest of us?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I mean, it is true. The show has progressive values in general. If you're looking for them, you'll find them.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And if you just hate those, then sure, the show probably won't do it for you.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You don't matter and go away.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because the way the show does it is super acceptable. It's never beaten you over the head.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It made me, I'll just tell you right now, my favorite thing about the show has to do with gem culture and garnet and fusion and all that stuff related to that.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And the way that the show presented it in real life made me more accepting of people who have weird life choices or different from normal.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And it's the strength of the storytelling of the show that I think it evoked that out of me.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, there you go, guy. You've just admitted to having been indoctrinated by its SJW agenda.

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's true. I'm hanging up my Gamergate hat. You're no longer objective. Your opinion is no longer valid.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's true. Who's saying something, Gib? Was that you?

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now that you've seen all the gems, you're willing to accept real people?

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What are your stance on the Jews?

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not the biggest fan of the Jews, but I am down with the trans.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nothing's changed.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Jews are not gems. I don't have to like them.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's true. It's only applies to gem people.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Aren't the Jews the gem people? No, that's the gypsies who are the gem people, right?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Those were those headbands with gems in them. They're IRL gems.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They do adorn themselves with gems.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Me thinks you all protest too much to the Jews. Me thinks that maybe you don't hate the Jews quite as much as you pretend to.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's not correct. I'll never admit it.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We are the Crystal Jews. Ben's certainly a Crystal Jew wrapping his patron every episode.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's true. We're trying to fund his cluster building operation.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me just say, I just got cut up with Steven Universe a couple weeks ago, and then this Steven Bomb happened to happen right then.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That short period of waiting was already agonizing. It was horrible.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Get ready for a whole lot more of it.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know. Steven Universe has so much continuity, more than any show I've ever seen, maybe.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know, maybe Breaking Bad or something, but the way it does it is beautiful.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That was already extremely painful. Now, after this fucking Steven Bomb, it's going to be like what?

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Six months? Four months?

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's going to be months. You're measuring your weight.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brutal. It's brutal. They put these five episodes right back to back in one week.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's the nature of the Steven Bomb.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I guess let's just talk about that. What do you guys think about it? Because I hate it.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I hate it. I detest it.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's great. You love it? Really?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's the best thing. I would rather wait a couple months in one go than have to wait a week between every single episode.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's interesting.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I hate that shit. I hate space-bound content. It's artificial and stupid and dumb and it doesn't work and it's bad and it diminishes the viewing experience.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm really glad that they've gone in this direction with it. I think more shows should do it.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh no. I know you. We both read one piece in general, but you definitely do this with one piece.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You wait a year and then just catch up on all of it.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's way better. Reading Homestuck was way better when I had a million updates to go through.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Once it started coming out every couple days, it was bad. It was way, way worse and it's the same with everything.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe you're right, but I think there's a difference between a couple pages of Homestuck versus an episode of Steven Universe or a chapter of One Piece.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I just want to say that I think this would be different. In the case of Homestuck, I kind of agree, maybe, but definitely don't with One Piece or Steven Universe.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What do you guys think? Jesse, I know you have strong feelings.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm kind of in the middle, I guess, just kind of bringing another perspective is that I think Steven Bombs can be really good if they're kind of, the episodes are designed to be viewed one day after another.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Because the first Steven Bombs I thought was really disjointed because it was clearly just like we have some episodes put them out and they really had nothing to do with each other.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But the last couple ones and even this one clearly like each episode kind of built upon the last one.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There was that two-parter in there, but even aside from that, yeah, it was like Paradot the Bomb.

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This was the Paradot Redemption Arc.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, so they're clearly designing the show to be viewed like this now.

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It did succeed in, you know, doing that Paradot Redemption Arc. I think it did. A lot of people were, you know, kind of upset about the plot not moving along that far.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who was upset about that?

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, maybe I'm exaggerating how many people this was, but in like the Steven Universe Generals, there's like two camps.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I know, there's generally two camps of like lore fags and character progression fags and the lore fags were upset.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Even though we got to meet Yellow Diamond, which was...

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What the fuck? We had the bet.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
There was a ton of fucking lore in this Bomb.

86
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't know, maybe I'm exaggerating about how many.

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The first episode was so fucking dense.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It was like the biggest lore episode ever.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, with the answer, right?

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know what? I shouldn't get too mad because honestly, Guy, probably you're just explaining it badly.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Probably the reality of the situation is fine and you're just filtering it through a lens designed to make me angry and I'm not gonna fall for it.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I do try to do that as much as possible.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, I have heard just about all that I can take. I have never disagreed with Ben more strongly in my life.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He's wrong. The Steven Bomb is a disaster. It's garbage. You are wrong and you are garbage and you belong in a zoo, my friend.

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You belong in a zoo with smelly apes who've played with their own shit.

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The Steven Bomb negatively affects my viewing of the episodes because while I'm watching the episodes during the Steven Bomb,

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
all that I can think about in the back of my mind is the days of the week ticking by and I know that eventually it's gonna be over.

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It negatively peppers my perception of everything I'm watching.

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is that really so different from like a weekly format?

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's how I feel about it.

101
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because with a weekly format, if you release the episodes once a week like a normal fucking show, you would have very little cause to go on hiatus.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It wouldn't happen as much.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Every week is a little hiatus.

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, but it's a hiatus that you can digest and get used to as opposed to this wonky up and down bullshit.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It is more manageable.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bullshit definitely gives you a routine and it's more expected.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Like right now we have no idea when the next Steven's gonna be.

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I just went on a huge rant about this.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Just this morning on my award-winning show Serialize, the greatest show of all time.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It was a good point.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
When you're watching...

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
On Manchild Incorporated.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I was watching the last episode of the Steven Bomb, which was a great episode.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's an episode about Peridot and Garnet fucking around.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just fucking around and it was great.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But because of the nature of the way the Steven Bomb is set up, all I could think of was, well this isn't a very good way.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It forces you to view it as a season finale as opposed to just a regular episode.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is kind of true.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's unfair to the episode.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It was not written to be a season finale.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You shouldn't have to...

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know what?

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know what?

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I totally feel you when I agree on many of those points.

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But really, just after Tom and Ben talked about it more as like its own little compartmentalized section that this was like the Peridot Bomb,

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I kind of like it more.

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm kind of willing to forgive it.

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Honestly, the way I see it is, it's kind of like how I used to view YouTube channels.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah.

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because like say someone like Egoraptor when he used to be an animator,

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you would come up with a thing and it was cool and you would go watch it and then it would take, I don't know,

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how many months, like eight months for a new thing.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
People used to go onto his comment section and his description and his YouTube page and they say,

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
why the fuck's the new thing?

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm unsubscribing because you haven't made content in a long time.

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I saw them and I'm just like, that doesn't make much sense because all you need to do is just go about your life normally

139
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and then eventually it'll just pop up and it'll be like, oh, that's a nice surprise.

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why would you unsubscribe?

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay, but the difference is that Steven is so dependent on continuity

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and there's the risk of not giving a shit when it comes back, which is something I've suffered many times.

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I wish they would go even further in this direction.

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I wish they would just, I wish they would just bite the bullet and release five new episodes in one day

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
instead of spacing them out over a week.

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That would be way better.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, you know, I was going to, it brings up an interesting point because I wanted to mention that like,

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the Steven bombs to me, I feel like they're just movies.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Like you're just watching a movie over the course of a week.

150
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Uh-huh.

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You know, because like you don't, you don't usually complain about the hiatus between films.

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like, you know, the new Star Wars just came out.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I'll be like, oh, fuck, I have to wait two years for another Star Wars.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You know, I'm just like, you want, you kind of accept that because the medium is like kind of,

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
well, you know what, I feel that way.

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Exactly what I said in the theater when the movie ended.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Steven Universe.

159
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I stood up.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Ah, fuck, I have to wait two years.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Uh, with, with Star Wars, that definitely felt like one, actually, I don't know, I kind of,

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I have my issues with Star Wars, but it felt generally like one condensed adventure.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But when you release them in these little bundles, like, like, I like how normal shows really do it.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, like how MLP does it.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You got one episode a week.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You got your season.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's there.

168
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not going anywhere.

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There's no speculation.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like the story is being told and you know exactly when it's going to hit.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Even knowing that, I think is, is better than, you know, being up in the air.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not sure when, when you're going to get the answers you crave.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't actually mind when, like, if I don't know when the next thing's coming.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm not constantly, like, sitting in my chair, like, waiting for something to be announced

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and then, then I'll get all hyped for it.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I just, when something arrives, it's just like, oh, that's a nice surprise.

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Cool.

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I guess the best thing that means you're not, you don't like Steven Universe as much as the rest of the world.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We found the treasure.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's true.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The phone.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Fuck.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That the reason I don't like it is not enough waifu material.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What?

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Paradise Ultimate Waifu.

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't, I'm not into any of them.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh, my God.

189
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, my God, sir.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You know what?

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You know what?

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to agree.

193
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not, I'm not attracted to any of them.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm attracted to Pearl.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think Pearl is really cool.

196
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not even about attractiveness.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's just about pure fucking wind.

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Parodot was fucking awesome this week.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Dude, when Parodot pulled those boxes over her ass, that was pretty great.

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That was pretty awesome.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Sexually.

202
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They're awesome characters, but they're not waifu material.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As far as I'm concerned.

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, that's in the eye of the beholder, man.

205
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I know, I know.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, well, I know what you mean, I guess.

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But you know what?

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Maybe you guys should stop fucking objectifying women

209
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and treat them as actual individuals, you know?

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Man, they're not even after poisons.

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Funny you should say that because they literally are objects.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They're fucking rocks.

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, you're projecting your hatred of women.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, they're projecting a hard light,

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
projection barrier of themselves out of their fucking rock body.

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They are pure projection.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Can you guys imagine the hot, sloppy, disgusting amethyst sex?

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Just nasty, sweaty, filthy.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She's gonna make a shit halfway through.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Jesse, you make a strong case.

222
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, she's gonna do that Castanza shit of melding food and sex.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's gonna be, you know, yeah.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait, what happens to amethyst when she eats something and then shape shifts?

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think it...

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Does it go somewhere?

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Probably just shifts.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Her stomach probably just shifts around.

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sure she's got some kind of crepes inside of her somewhere.

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know, but she definitely poops.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was confirmed that it comes out the other end, so...

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
She was way into pooping.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Probably pooping is great.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Combined with sex.

235
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why are Gems even capable of digesting?

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you think it just comes out the other side completely undigested?

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, I do, pretty much.

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, that's horrible.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No way, they have to poop.

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We're asking the important questions now.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's true.

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They have to poop because otherwise Pearl would not find it so distasteful.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Alright, here's my prediction.

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think...

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Normally, Gems probably don't have digestive systems, but you can probably adapt their

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
form to do it, because Rose obviously adapted her body to be able to bear it.

248
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
To have that vagoo.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's true.

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's true.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think amethyst just makes some guts and then makes it work.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
On that topic, I want to get deep into this.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So did Greg fuck Rose?

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Did she shapeshift a vagina and his sperm combined with her somehow to make...

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, as fucking yes.

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How is that even a question?

257
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If anyone tries to tell me that anyone didn't have sex, I'll throw a fucking tantrum, the

258
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
likes of which have never been seen.

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, there was some definite fucking going on.

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean, Greg was all over Rose.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's true.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They even said he had like a fat girl fetish.

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He has a tall eight foot tall woman fetish, which is awesome.

265
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's all about it.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's Stephen does as well, as it turns out.

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Really?

268
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, you know, he sang a whole song about wanting to see a giant woman.

269
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, that's your head cannons.

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He probably does.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't accept them.

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Get them out of here.

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's fucking true.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, he just...

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He only has eyes for Connie.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He's going to be the first boy.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's talk about that for a second, the music, because Giant Woman was by far the best thing

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
in the series until the return or whatever jailbreak happened.

279
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Man, fucking...

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm such a great episode.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It took me a while for the music to grow on me.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, me too.

283
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's quirky.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But what I really like about it now is that it's so...

285
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I like the simplicity when before is really turned off by it, because I felt like they

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
weren't trying.

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And maybe that's because the MLP music that I came from was so overproduced.

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, man.

290
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's really good because the music is being performed in-universe by a kid with a ukulele.

291
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Exactly.

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's what I didn't understand until a while later.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So it's so good.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And now it's so much fucking cool.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In-universe?

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, like how we sang Giant Woman or whatever?

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Was that Canon?

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I guess it was.

301
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I guess it was.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, he himself is singing the song.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And he's like playing the...

304
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's happening.

305
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
A kid is playing a ukulele and singing along with it, so the song should be simple.

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's what's so cool about it.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's like real.

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's not like...

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It is.

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
A big production.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's not always true.

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, it's not always true.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah.

314
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like Pearl songs, I don't think are diagetic really.

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But like half of the time.

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, don't...

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Di...

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Dilute this conversation with diagetic bullshit.

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I agree.

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Just hearing you say that word made me wretch a little bit.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's...

323
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to talk about...

324
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Unnecessary memories.

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want to talk about...

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because this is my favorite thing about the show.

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Everything having to do with gem culture and the social implications.

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And to just talk about...

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to talk about the things I love about it.

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And why it's so great and why the answer was such a fantastic episode.

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Snore.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And the diamonds.

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's go through every episode one at a time in the new Steven Baum and give it a ranking

334
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
out of ten.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, we could do that.

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, I don't know.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's just talk about the answer and the lore that came with it.

338
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Because man, that was the tightest fucking shit.

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And even like...

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Okay, how about blue pearl, right?

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And now yellow pearl?

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So cool.

343
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There was a blue...

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, right.

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, right.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Blue...

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The hair over her eyes.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So good.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now, she was probably the best waifu in terms of physique in the show.

351
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't fucking know what you're talking about.

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
She looked exactly like Pearl with a different haircut.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hair...

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If you watch anime bad, hair is all that makes the difference.

355
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's all about that hair.

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah.

357
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's like Japanese shit.

358
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, man.

359
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want to say that...

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I can't wait for Pearl to simultaneously beat the shit out of blue and yellow pearl.

361
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They confuse together.

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,500
She'll still kick the crap out of them, thereby symbolizing her development and growth as

363
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,000
an individual human being kicking the crap.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And you know what she'll say as she delivers the killing blow?

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
They'll be like, oh, you can't beat us.

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You'll be like, shut up.

367
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're just a pearl.

368
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's what she'll say.

369
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Dude.

370
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because she's not just a pearl.

371
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Pearl is the real pearl.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Pearl would never say you're just a pearl to another pearl.

373
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That kind of defeats her arc of overcoming.

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, no.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The way I see it, that illustrates her arc.

376
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Get out of here.

377
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What do you mean get out of here?

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Arcs are the most important part of the thing.

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, no, no.

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not an arc.

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm saying guys over here are being like, oh, that would totally destroy her arc.

382
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Fuck you.

383
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Her arc is not about overcoming the social stigma against her.

384
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's all in the past.

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's overcoming genetics, which she already did before the series started.

386
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, yeah.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's all in the past.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's not her arc.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Have you heard the theories that Pearl, the one, the renegade pearl, is like white diamond's

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
pearl?

391
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think she would be pink diamond's pearl, would she?

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

393
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well, the idea is like if pink diamond is Rose or like Rose is like a high ranking someone,

394
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
like renegade pearl would like go from white diamonds with Rose, like I don't know.

395
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That would save her from the white diamond's grasp or something like that.

396
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's possible.

397
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a cool idea.

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I was going to assume she was pink's pearl, but yeah, sure.

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well, let's flush that out a little bit, what you said there in case people haven't heard

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
this, because I think it's really interesting.

401
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I want to talk about this theory about pink diamond and all.

402
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
By now, everybody knows that the diamond authority or whatever the official name is, is yellow

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
diamond, blue diamond, white diamond, and they're in charge of everybody.

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you look at the old architecture in places like the battlefield where pearl trained Connie

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,360
and swordsmanship, you'll see a diamond shape which has yellow, blue, white, and there's

406
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,860
also a pink one.

407
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,000
The theory basically is, if you look at newer structures like in the battlefield where that

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,160
big tomb was, where they got the big white diamond from, emblazoned on that thing is

409
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,360
a symbol that only has a blue, yellow, and white diamond with the pink one suspiciously

410
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
gone.

411
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,520
The theory is that a row is possibly is pink diamond or maybe a fusion involving pink diamond

412
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
somehow.

413
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
She's not a fusion.

414
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
She only has one gem.

415
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
All right.

416
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
But she's a quartz, so it could be something going on with there.

417
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
It's also kind of interesting.

418
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,160
But anyway, the point is she was pink diamond, she left, and that's so her faction was excommunicated.

419
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Maybe quartz is like a title for a fallen diamond or something.

420
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, but there's a real quartz with amethyst.

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,040
Well, that's not what she's called either, I guess.

422
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,640
My personal theory is the diamond is a title that you get by being a hierarchy gem.

423
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Yeah, so I'm saying maybe quartz is a title too.

424
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
I guess.

425
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
If you've noticed the...

426
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Maybe she was rose diamond before.

427
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
God damn architecture.

428
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Sorry, I'm sorry.

429
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Go on.

430
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,560
Like all the, on the moon episode, whatever it was called.

431
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:51,560
They had the yellow, blue, and white, and the white diamond has her diamond on her forehead.

432
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,680
Yellow and blue have their diamonds under their neck, and rose has it on her stomach.

433
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Yeah.

434
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,000
So it's sort of like a hierarchy there.

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,720
The white diamond's the big bad.

436
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Possibly.

437
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,280
I think that's how it's going to go, because we've met the yellow diamond already.

438
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,680
If you look at the symbol with the four diamonds, they're in the identical locations.

439
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,720
The white diamond's on top, the pink diamond's on the bottom, and then the blue and yellow

440
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
diamonds are on the side.

441
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,680
So like their gem locations are identical to where they are located on the symbols.

442
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,640
So people are saying that's like a hierarchy.

443
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
So that's interesting.

444
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Pink diamond would be the lowest rank.

446
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,840
Pink diamond was the bottom pyramid in the pyramid of them.

447
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,360
Why would there be one top rank, two middle rank, and then one bottom rank?

448
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,840
Because it makes a bigger diamond, and because of graphic design.

449
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
I don't fucking know.

450
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Yeah, because of graphic design.

451
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,120
But that doesn't make any sense from like an administrative perspective.

452
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,120
We need to consult a geologist, only he can deliver the final verdict.

453
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,800
We need to find Bill Nye.

454
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,080
We're getting off track a little bit.

455
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,120
Let's talk about the gem culture and what we've learned recently, because the answer

456
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,440
was the coolest episode ever, and went into all about that shit.

457
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,980
I'm really stoked about the fact that we now know that if multiple kinds of the same gem

458
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,840
fuse, they just become a bigger version of themselves.

459
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,400
That's really interesting, and kind of raises deep concerns within me, because everything

460
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,200
in the show has been about how you're more than your gem.

461
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
That's what Pearl's all about.

462
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,120
And then when Ruby fused with the other rubies, this was thousands of years ago, but still,

463
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,160
she still just felt like herself, but bigger.

464
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,120
But then in that very episode, goes on to lead, take a whole divergent path from the

465
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
other rubies.

466
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,280
Well, it's gotta be that all of the rubies had such similar life experiences.

467
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,760
At that point in history, they were basically the same person, there was nothing distinguishing

468
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
them.

469
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,120
Well, I feel like it's kind of like all rubies are cut from the same big ruby or something,

470
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,400
and then that's why they feel all connected.

471
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
It could be something like that.

472
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Obviously, they're very related.

473
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,600
I don't even know if it's an actual connection thing.

474
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
I didn't think it was like literal, like, oh, I just felt like the same thing.

475
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,480
I think it's just like cultural conditioning, because Ruby makes that statement that when

476
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Savart's like, you were going to be shattered, it's like, who cares?

477
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
There's a bunch of me.

478
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,920
Man, I love how little care Ruby cares about herself compared to Savart.

479
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,080
Even today, even she still got this thing about like, man, fuck me, Sapphire is the

480
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
one that's important.

481
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
Exactly.

482
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
We gotta like help her.

483
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Man, it's the best.

484
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,480
Ruby and Sapphire, and therefore Garnet, best character in the series, bar, none, the

485
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
best.

486
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,760
Nate, Nate, Nate, how much did you fucking flip your shit with that ending song, and

487
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,040
then they bring back the fucking progression from stronger than you?

488
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
Oh, dude, I lost my shit.

489
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Did you buy?

490
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Oh my god.

491
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Wait, wait, wait.

492
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I fucking lost it.

493
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,200
And then Sapphire and Ruby sing to each other, you know, that like, oh, I did you whenever.

494
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,360
In that song, as they begin to dance, a little thing comes in, it's like, which is the stronger

495
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
than you, like Melody.

496
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Shit, I missed it.

497
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
They brought that into the song.

498
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
And holy shit.

499
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
But you know, I fucking...

500
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,560
And then that was genius, Tom.

501
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,920
But you know, I didn't like stronger than you as much as everyone else did.

502
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,640
You're a goofball dog.

503
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,560
That is by far the high point of the entire series up to this point.

504
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,880
Dude, that was such a hype fucking moment.

505
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
It was insane.

506
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,080
Maybe if I rewatched it, I'd appreciate it more.

507
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,880
I've watched that episode a bunch of times.

508
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
It's, yeah, it's good stuff.

509
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
I mean, I liked the moment.

510
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
I liked the moment.

511
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
Except for yesterday, so I haven't gone around to rewatch it yet.

512
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,000
I liked that scene a lot.

513
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
I just didn't care for the song itself.

514
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Well, whatever.

515
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
That's fine.

516
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
That's fine.

517
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,000
So I guess I just want to extrapolate you guys who are listening.

518
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,760
You guys, you guys get it about Garnet, how Ruby's, it was okay to fuse, but when she

519
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,840
fused with Sapphire, everyone was like, oh gross.

520
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
That's not allowed.

521
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,120
That's gay dog.

522
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,480
And clearly it's a combination.

523
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,000
It looks like Garnet's whole existence, like being a shameless display, just being fused

524
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,960
all the time as Jasper put it, is seems like a parallel to being either gay or trans.

525
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,240
That's the vibes I get from it.

526
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,200
Well, I mean, you gotta shoehorn your goddamn liberal agenda into my car too.

527
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm saying I get out of here.

528
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
No, no, I'm just saying.

529
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
That's what it looks like to me.

530
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,920
Okay, you could definitely draw that parallel.

531
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,760
Yeah.

532
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,920
But it's not explicitly that.

533
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,760
No, I know.

534
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,280
What it is, now maybe this is a headcanon,

535
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,600
but I think it's pretty solid.

536
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,640
Yeah.

537
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,560
What it is, is I think we can safely say

538
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,000
that a fusion between two different gem classes

539
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,920
represents basically like a perversion

540
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,040
of the social hierarchy that gem society is based on.

541
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,400
It's based on Uptown Girl by Billy Joel.

542
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,720
That's pretty much what Steven Eurebs is all about.

543
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,280
When Blue Diamond flips her shit at Ruby,

544
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,480
it's not like you fuse with a sapphire.

545
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,440
It's like you fuse with a member of my court.

546
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
Right, that's true.

547
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,200
That's true.

548
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah.

549
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,840
Yeah.

550
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,920
I mean, yeah, so I think in universe,

551
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,960
it's a class social power dynamic.

552
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,920
But I mean, from a thematic standpoint,

553
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,560
Garnet clearly represents social deviancy.

554
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,400
Absolutely.

555
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Absolutely.

556
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,080
Things are unaccepted in culture.

557
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,560
Well, I think on another level,

558
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,720
it's just a culture that generally looks down

559
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,400
on individualism.

560
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,480
Oh, definitely.

561
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,320
That's definitely.

562
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Why would they deliberately,

563
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,360
because I mean, they deliberately group Rubies together

564
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,200
to fuse because their personalities

565
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,040
aren't gonna change, they're just fucking guys.

566
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,680
It's just utilitarian.

567
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,880
And they're not naturally lacking in individualism clearly,

568
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
as we've seen from the characters.

569
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,160
It's something that is clearly imposed upon gems

570
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,480
by the Rubies class.

571
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,320
And that's why.

572
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,280
They grow gems in like big factory things.

573
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,120
Right, right.

574
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,280
And it was, sorry, I was just gonna say,

575
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,960
it's so great to have Peridot here

576
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,680
as the reflection of gem society

577
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,120
and like to see the way she interprets Garnet and her,

578
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
I mean, and it's the best in that her arc

579
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,800
is her like coming to terms with it,

580
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,240
trying to understand Garnet

581
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
and like getting over her hangups,

582
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,520
or the stuff that had, you know,

583
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
made her weirded out by Garnet.

584
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,080
That arc is super endearing

585
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
and she happens to be super cute.

586
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,760
And it's just couldn't be happier with it.

587
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Here's a question I have.

588
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,600
Yeah.

589
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,280
Okay.

590
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,880
I wonder if fusion between similar gems

591
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,240
is always acceptable,

592
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,800
or if like Rubies are expected to do it

593
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,080
because they're grunt soldiers and they're just whatever.

594
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,320
But I wonder if it's a thing

595
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,080
that higher class gems don't engage with at all,

596
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
even among their own class.

597
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
There's a lot of information about that.

598
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,080
Like how Garnet said, it's something that,

599
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,200
sorry, how Jasper said,

600
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,280
it's just something weak gems do to be strong.

601
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,000
And she was looked on down for that reason.

602
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Yeah, that's a good point.

603
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,440
And then there was also, you know,

604
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,480
all these things Peridot have said,

605
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
I was like, you're not even doing anything.

606
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,400
And in the last episode, when they fused into Opal,

607
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,440
she's like, okay, see, that makes sense to me.

608
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,760
They're doing it for a purpose.

609
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
You're just fused for no reason.

610
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,400
Get the fuck out of here with that shit.

611
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
Do you think that the reason

612
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,520
that there's only one of each of the diamonds

613
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,200
and also the reason they're so big

614
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,060
is because say all the blue diamonds

615
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,440
are combined into one blue diamond?

616
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,280
That, you know, was a thought that I'd had.

617
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,520
I personally don't think so.

618
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,400
I think they're just one big ass super gem.

619
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,160
That's just, you know.

620
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,800
They're just a fucking diamond, you know?

621
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,360
Diamonds are fucking legit.

622
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,320
Pretty cool.

623
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,480
I see no reason to assume that they're a fusion,

624
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
but, you know, that might turn out to be the case.

625
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I see no reason to not assume it.

626
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
I mean, it could go either way.

627
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,040
I feel like, I feel like if they did that,

628
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,240
there'd be like a hypocrisy to their whole like,

629
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
that's true.

630
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
Cultural structure.

631
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,760
Well, there'd be a utility

632
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,060
to fusing into like your supreme overlord.

633
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,780
Like he's got a job to do pretty much all the time.

634
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,980
I mean, maybe, but at the same time,

635
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,540
would Jasper be shitting on fusion?

636
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,260
If like, the person you're serving is a fucking ooper.

637
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,340
Well, Peridot's the same way

638
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,420
and Peridot's not retarded.

639
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,260
Like she loves-

640
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,100
It's a combination of things, you know?

641
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,020
She loved the yellow diamond,

642
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,420
but hated the concept of fusion.

643
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,900
If you're like, person you're serving is a massive fusion,

644
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,740
like would you be?

645
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,580
Yeah.

646
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,400
I don't know.

647
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,940
It just feels like it's a little contradictory,

648
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,340
but it'd be an interesting kind of twist.

649
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,820
Well, no, but if the diamonds are-

650
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,580
It could be something that only is allowed

651
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,420
for the top fuses.

652
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,860
Diamond is a fusion of all of a single sort of diamond gem.

653
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,940
Then it wouldn't be weird because that sort of thing

654
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,780
is okay under certain conditions in gem society.

655
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,620
I don't know.

656
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,460
I don't like it.

657
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,300
I feel like it would weaken.

658
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,140
Here's a thought.

659
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,060
They are some sort of fusion thing

660
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,540
and have made a social stigma against it slash outlawed it

661
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,140
in an attempt to keep power

662
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,980
so that no one can shout at them.

663
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,140
I just gotta say, I really don't believe that theory

664
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,060
because they only have one gem on them.

665
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,020
Well, we only saw one.

666
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,860
It could be, you know.

667
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
Oh, that's true.

668
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,540
I guess their whole body is.

669
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,540
Maybe under their dresses,

670
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,700
they just got gems everywhere for nipples and gems.

671
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,540
Yeah, maybe.

672
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,380
Okay, well, you know what?

673
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,220
I forget that.

674
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,540
Let's talk about yellow diamond

675
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,060
and how shit her design is.

676
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,460
Can we address that?

677
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,580
Yeah, no problem.

678
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,620
Her neck was three times the length it should have been.

679
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,460
And her shoulders were dumb.

680
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
Yellow diamond.

681
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,140
It should have been though.

682
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,340
I didn't remember what she was supposedly-

683
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
Right, we're all basing this on that one image

684
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,180
in the extended opening.

685
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,260
So when I saw her face and neck, I was like,

686
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,540
oh, cool, she's like a weirdo.

687
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,500
But she looks, I just,

688
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,340
when I think back to how she looked at first,

689
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,180
I'm just like, why?

690
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,700
Yellow diamond looks ridiculous.

691
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,260
She looks laughable.

692
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
The thing that threw me off about it

693
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,260
was just the saturation of the yellow to such a degree.

694
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,180
Yes.

695
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,020
Because she looks cool and still a wedge.

696
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,860
And it's all one color.

697
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,700
She's got a great shape to her.

698
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,540
But then you see her,

699
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,980
and it's like someone just urinated

700
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,020
inside her fucking mouth.

701
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,860
Yeah.

702
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,300
And it took over her skin tone.

703
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,660
Her design is boring.

704
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,580
Yep.

705
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,660
Silly drab.

706
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,860
It's all the same color.

707
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,580
It's like her shapes.

708
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,980
Her shapes are so dumb.

709
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,140
She's just got this stupid breastplate torso

710
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,740
with these stupid big giant shoulder jangles

711
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,940
jabbing out of the sides

712
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,900
with these two little stick arms coming out.

713
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,260
I'm so angry, I'm so angry that they disappointed me.

714
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,100
It is drab.

715
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,260
It is droll and I find it rather pedantic.

716
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,380
It's the proportions are bad.

717
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,980
The proportions are what's bad.

718
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,060
I disagree with anything except the neck.

719
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,620
I think the neck's cool.

720
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,940
Yeah, that's because you love those long necks.

721
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,780
The neck should be longer.

722
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,300
She should be called yellow giraffe.

723
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,940
Yeah, you nailed it dog.

724
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,300
But you know, I thought Blue Diamond looked fucking sick.

725
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,140
She was awesome.

726
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,020
Yeah, Blue Diamond looks fucking sick.

727
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
Why?

728
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,820
She was a cloth.

729
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,340
Yeah, but cloths are cool, you know?

730
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,260
She's got that whole, I don't know.

731
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,780
But you don't know exactly what a neck or face looks like.

732
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,620
When I see that neck,

733
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,100
I'm gonna be getting out my ruler.

734
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,260
Maybe they all have long necks.

735
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm just saying, I've seen so much great fan art

736
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,620
of Yellow Diamond, and then the real one

737
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,180
was just like a million times worse.

738
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,260
Rose Quartz was ostracized from the long neck guild

739
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,220
for having a normal neck of fat, short neck.

740
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,340
She was like, what's with these fucking necks?

741
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,060
I've got a fucking head cannon.

742
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,540
In the one where Stephen stretches himself out,

743
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,460
Amethyst is like, Stephen, your neck, you have one.

744
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,340
So clearly neck length in Gem Society

745
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,060
is a strong status indicator.

746
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,540
Kind of like height and invader zoom.

747
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,980
Yes, exactly the same.

748
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,820
We've done it.

749
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,660
Definitely it's the same.

750
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,500
Well, this is great news.

751
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,060
Amethyst is like, whoa, Stephen, you've got a neck.

752
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,900
You're the champion now.

753
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,300
She was about to bow down to that neck.

754
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Dude, remember that time?

755
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,140
You're the new gardener.

756
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,260
Remember that one episode where Amethyst

757
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,900
is falling apart and her head gets stretched

758
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,180
like a million feet from her body

759
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,540
and that big, noodley neck?

760
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,980
She was so OP right then.

761
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,420
She would have been like king.

762
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,380
All right, anyway.

763
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,220
Let's move on.

764
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Let's talk about the best episode of the Stephen Bong,

765
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,980
which was Stephen's birthday.

766
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,580
It was the most beautiful thing that I've ever.

767
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,420
What do you mean?

768
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,220
You're saying you're being all dismissive.

769
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,500
It was beautiful, buddy.

770
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,340
The problem was which one was Stephen's birthday?

771
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,860
It was the one where you find out

772
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,540
that he's not eating good.

773
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,860
It's the one where they rehash the whole aging

774
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,700
out of his control thing.

775
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,660
Whoa, whoa, rehash.

776
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,420
You are too hung up on things rehashing

777
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,140
and being similar to other things.

778
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,620
Who cares if it's similar?

779
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,660
It was done better, in my opinion.

780
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,380
In fact, forget the original old guy episode.

781
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,660
Throw that one in the garbage,

782
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,300
throw it in the trash compactor.

783
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,860
I liked that episode because it made me real sad

784
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,220
because Connie really liked it when he was tall.

785
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,820
And in the end, he's just not.

786
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,540
Do when she's bare in her face, it was chess.

787
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,580
So that's just not a thing that's gonna happen.

788
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,020
I mean, eventually maybe he'll get taller.

789
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,220
I'm sure it'll happen someday.

790
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,140
The thing that I love about it is that

791
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,900
it starts out with this revelation about Stephen

792
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,660
that's really interesting,

793
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,860
but also kind of concerning and scary.

794
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,940
That makes it 14.

795
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,780
He looks eight.

796
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,300
And those are kind of the best little things to,

797
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,140
shock people.

798
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,020
He's like, wow, that's cool, but also what?

799
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,580
He's gonna be a baby for that.

800
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,620
But then, when he turns into a baby,

801
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,340
you have Stephen and Connie's relationship

802
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,180
throughout the whole series.

803
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
And it's just like, yeah, whatever, they're friends.

804
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,020
They like each other.

805
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,860
They're probably gonna grow up

806
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,700
and blow each other or some shit.

807
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,260
But then it gets taken all the way to the next level

808
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,740
because Stephen becomes a baby.

809
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
What are they gonna do?

810
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,060
He's gonna be a baby for every now.

811
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,900
What do we do?

812
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,740
But Connie, her love and devotion,

813
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,860
her true love for Stephen, it comes through

814
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,980
and that's what allows him to get his mojo back.

815
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,820
And it's just...

816
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,660
That's true.

817
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,480
It's beautiful.

818
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,320
That was a good moment.

819
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,240
It warms my heart.

820
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,740
Yeah, Connie's a good character.

821
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,900
I like her a lot.

822
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,740
She's really endearing.

823
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,580
I think Stephen, I don't know.

824
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,500
Her relationship in this episode was great.

825
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,540
I thought this was probably the weakest episode of the bomb,

826
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,380
but I thought...

827
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,220
I agree.

828
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,700
The relationship was great.

829
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,260
The moment when Connie gets super thirsty

830
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,420
with tall Stephen was fucking awesome.

831
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,500
I love the line where he's just like...

832
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,620
In Stephen's mind, they're already gonna get married

833
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,140
because he's like, I'm gonna be the first boy

834
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,260
when she's president because I'm never gonna get older.

835
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,100
Yeah, that was so cute.

836
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,060
I think the romance between Stephen and Connie

837
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,060
is the best romance in any current cartoon by far.

838
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,540
No, you're forgetting about Flash Sentry

839
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,380
and Twilight Sparkle.

840
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,740
Get the fuck away!

841
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
Get the fuck away!

842
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,580
No, it's good.

843
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,020
Now listen, I'm gonna say,

844
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,220
and now this isn't necessarily a criticism of the show,

845
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,900
but I'm not that impressed with Connie's devotion to Stephen.

846
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,800
It doesn't stand out to me as something

847
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,860
that's very noble.

848
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,340
I kind of agree with that, actually.

849
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,700
Because I mean, yeah, she's friends with this guy

850
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,020
who has this great magical destiny.

851
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,260
Through her involvement with him,

852
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,300
she's come into contact with these three fucking gods,

853
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,380
these living gods who decide the fate of the universe.

854
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,460
She's become entangled in a web of causality

855
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,860
that is way farther, way beyond anything

856
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
she could have hoped for as a mere human.

857
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,780
Yep, yep.

858
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,820
So of course she's gonna fucking stick by Stephen.

859
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,020
She has gotten so much out of her relationship with Stephen.

860
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,500
Look at what she's gotten out of him.

861
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,940
Well, Ben, I guess if you're just a complete cynic

862
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,260
and a pessimist, you can break down people's motivations

863
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,380
and find the selfishness behind what everyone does

864
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,220
all the time.

865
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,620
But yeah, no, see, that's why it was good in that episode.

866
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,460
Yeah, that's exactly right.

867
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,020
To see why Connie was still, you know,

868
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,820
she didn't get frustrated. I don't care if it's right,

869
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,420
it's poopy.

870
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,260
Hey, speaking of poopy,

871
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,100
remember when Stephen pooped on Amethyst's face

872
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,940
as a car seat?

873
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,140
I mentioned that in my video.

874
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,340
He took a big shit right on her face and she loved it.

875
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
She wasn't face at all.

876
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,020
She probably ate it, dude.

877
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,820
She probably ate it and thought it was fantastic.

878
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,660
That's what she does.

879
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,620
I had no idea that that was Amethyst

880
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,460
until she talked.

881
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,300
Well, yeah, please not.

882
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,140
Well, it wasn't supposed to.

883
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,980
You weren't supposed to.

884
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,820
Do you think that Amethyst was?

885
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,980
I thought I just missed it and I loved it a lot.

886
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,820
No, that was a joke.

887
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,740
I didn't, I did not like that scene

888
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,020
when it suddenly reveals it to be Amethyst.

889
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,860
I was like, what?

890
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,680
Why?

891
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,520
Okay, they didn't have,

892
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,360
the devil's advocate,

893
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,020
they didn't have a car seat if they needed one.

894
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,180
They didn't have a car seat.

895
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,940
And if they didn't have a car seat,

896
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
why would they have diapers?

897
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,220
So do you think Amethyst was also the diaper?

898
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,740
Oh, yes, definitely.

899
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,500
That was her mouth around his ass

900
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,900
just consuming whatever came out.

901
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,220
I mean, she does like pooping.

902
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,420
The most important headcanon of all time.

903
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,460
Amethyst is Stephen's diaper and she got pooped in.

904
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,500
So Stephen is gonna live forever

905
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
and Connie's gonna die someday, right?

906
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,260
That's gonna happen.

907
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,300
It wasn't set in state views.

908
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

909
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,340
What if Stephen and Connie fuse

910
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,540
and they stay fused forever?

911
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,180
That was my thought.

912
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,260
Okay, it's time to reveal my theory.

913
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,100
Here's my theory.

914
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,940
This is what I think.

915
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,780
I've got one too, but okay, you go.

916
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,620
Are you ready?

917
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,740
This is my theory of how this is all gonna fucking go down.

918
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,700
It's gonna tie in what we're talking about.

919
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,380
I wonder if it's the same as mine, but yeah, let's hear it.

920
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,340
Rose Quartz is Pink Diamond.

921
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,420
Okay, I'm with you.

922
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,260
And she...

923
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,740
What?

924
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,580
Shut up, Ben.

925
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,420
I'm getting it.

926
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,940
Rose Quartz is Pink Diamond.

927
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,900
And that was the reason the whole kind of revolt happened.

928
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,660
She was like a big part of the culture

929
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,860
and she's like, you fuck your shit

930
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,580
and that caused a hole to do and that happened.

931
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,580
But that means that now Stephen is Pink Diamond.

932
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,380
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

933
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,220
Well, sure.

934
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,060
Okay.

935
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,900
It's the same gem.

936
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
It's the same gem.

937
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,580
It's the same gem.

938
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,380
He's like the big fucking head honcho

939
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,820
without even realizing it.

940
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,340
So what's gonna fucking happen?

941
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,460
Because what's the big conflict going on right now

942
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
that they keep referring to?

943
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,340
The fact that fusion is utilitarian on Homeworld

944
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,620
versus fusion with the crystal gems

945
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,060
is something emotional to do with love

946
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,380
and relationships and all that stuff.

947
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,580
And that's something that's what really binds

948
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,180
Garnet's kind of character and conflict.

949
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,380
It's something that all the crystal gems

950
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,500
have kind of come to understand

951
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
and they've learned that and reinforced that

952
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,060
because Rose and Greg's relationship

953
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,700
and how relationships kind of like a big thing in this show.

954
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,340
Yeah, sure, sure.

955
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,220
So that's something that like the Homeworld gems

956
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,220
need to figure out

957
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,940
because they're still like collectivists in mentality.

958
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,260
So what's gonna happen?

959
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,220
Fucking Stephen and Connie are gonna fuse into Stavati

960
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,540
and fucking be the new Pink Diamond

961
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,060
and they're gonna fucking teach the Homeworld

962
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,940
that fusion is good.

963
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,220
Garnet's gonna be like, you did good kid

964
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,500
and then they're gonna fucking blow everyone's minds

965
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,380
on Homeworld and rule as the new fucking leader

966
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,140
and like Connie's gonna be president of the fucking galaxy.

967
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,660
No, that's crazy.

968
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,100
You know, call me old fashion.

969
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,620
It'll be a permafusion.

970
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,980
Yeah, we'll go to fascism

971
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,260
which is the logical progression of all society.

972
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,460
Call me old fashion, but I would much prefer

973
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,300
rather than being a permafusion of Stavati

974
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
that they just fuck like animals

975
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,900
like normal teenage human babies

976
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,780
the way that God intended.

977
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,620
What I want to happen.

978
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,740
Would their babies be a quarter gem?

979
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,580
How would that work?

980
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,740
There's no, who knows, man, who knows?

981
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,500
I think their babies would just be human.

982
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,380
I agree, I guess.

983
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,660
I don't fucking know.

984
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,100
But here's- Maybe with like some very minor-

985
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,260
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

986
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,100
What if when Connie and Steven go at it,

987
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Steven then disappears and then there's another baby

988
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,420
and then- Oh, God.

989
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,980
And it starts all over again.

990
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,820
That's kind of what I thought might happen.

991
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,260
It's the worst, the worst.

992
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
All right, here's a thought.

993
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,380
Steven can fuse with Connie, right?

994
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,860
That means he can fuse with humans

995
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,060
and maybe gems too.

996
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,500
One day, why doesn't Steven just fuse

997
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,660
with every single human being on the planet

998
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,100
and go full God mode?

999
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,420
And then just kill animals.

1000
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,660
What I was about to say is-

1001
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,900
Why doesn't every gem just fuse?

1002
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,740
I don't know, I don't know.

1003
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,860
Steven can be the ark floating in space,

1004
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,420
preserving humanity's memory for all time,

1005
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,780
like Ava Unit 1.

1006
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
The way I was imagining-

1007
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,260
Just be giant ball arms?

1008
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,100
Yes.

1009
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,780
The way I was imagining a way it could end really cool

1010
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,820
or there'd be a big climax is like all the diamonds

1011
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,300
aside from, you know, Pink Diamond,

1012
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,580
they fuse together into this giant thing.

1013
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,420
And then Steven fuses with the cluster or something

1014
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,820
and becomes a giant robot space gem.

1015
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,980
Ew, the cluster's gross though.

1016
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,220
No, but think about, I mean, it could be a cluster.

1017
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
It could be just some other thing.

1018
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,060
I don't know.

1019
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,060
Just like a huge giant space battle with gem people

1020
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,940
punching each other, throwing planets.

1021
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,380
It's gonna go full ground login, hopefully.

1022
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,940
So you want the end of ground login?

1023
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,500
Yeah, if that happens with Steven Universe,

1024
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,340
that'd be something.

1025
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,380
It'll be the best cartoon.

1026
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,860
I think what's really gonna happen

1027
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,580
is that Steven's gonna change gem society

1028
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,900
in some major way.

1029
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,740
They'll all just be friends.

1030
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,580
I wanna blow shit up, I wanna throw-

1031
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,420
Let me change-

1032
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,020
He's gonna do it by blowing shit up first.

1033
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,860
Yeah, all right.

1034
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,180
Let me change gears for a second.

1035
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
In, I forget which episode,

1036
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,820
the one where they go to the moon.

1037
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,980
There's that terminal and it shows the map of the earth,

1038
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,820
right?

1039
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,180
Which was an awesome episode with all that more.

1040
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,020
Everyone's really bent out of shape

1041
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,260
about the big hole in Russia.

1042
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,420
And that is a big deal.

1043
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,700
But that's not the only difference.

1044
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,380
And in the center of it was a gem construct of some kind.

1045
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,180
Yeah, yeah, but there's more than that.

1046
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,460
Like, Africa is like cut in half

1047
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,260
and South America has a big chunk on.

1048
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,180
And I think Australia is like kind of messed up too.

1049
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,140
It's like half gone, yeah.

1050
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,820
Yeah, so there's all kinds of weird stuff.

1051
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,660
It was just that those could have been explained

1052
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,020
by a shitty map version,

1053
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,980
whereas the Russia one seemed a little more overt.

1054
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,540
No, no, no, no, no, I disagree.

1055
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,020
They were definitely their intention.

1056
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,700
I mean, the Russia one was the most obvious.

1057
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,540
That's right.

1058
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,380
What are you fucking saying?

1059
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,220
What are you talking about?

1060
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,060
What about Russia?

1061
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,900
People are bitching about the countries

1062
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,220
being deformed on the map.

1063
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,180
Is that a thing?

1064
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,020
Yeah, yeah.

1065
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,460
Are people that fucking retarded?

1066
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,580
Oh, I hate to tell you the entire fucking planet's dead.

1067
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,180
Well, Tom, what are you talking about?

1068
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,020
The planet's fine.

1069
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,060
It was gonna be dead later, but it didn't, you know.

1070
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,580
I have to say that Ben completely lost me.

1071
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,500
What about Russia?

1072
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,100
Who gives a shit life?

1073
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,140
Okay, this, all right, you're gonna have to go look it up.

1074
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,100
But if you look at the map that Peridot

1075
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,940
brings up on the moon terminal,

1076
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,940
the map has a few changes from our world and their world

1077
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,660
and the most noticeable is that Russia

1078
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,180
has like a huge hole blown in it.

1079
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,020
Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,860
Wait.

1081
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
And there's a gem construct located right

1082
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
at the center of the crater.

1083
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,700
Yep.

1084
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,460
Yeah, whatever.

1085
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,380
I know, it's blinking, you missed it.

1086
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,460
Like it goes by in a second, but it's definitely there.

1087
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,300
Yep.

1088
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,380
And so I guess, so I'm thinking what it must mean

1089
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,940
is probably that their world is our world

1090
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,460
except that, you know, however many thousands of years

1091
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,380
ago, some cataclysm happened where the gems showed up

1092
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,420
and it changed the world

1093
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,220
and it's like an alternate timeline of our world.

1094
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,700
Yeah, I pretty much agree.

1095
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,940
It's what our world would be if the gem.

1096
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Does that really even need to be clarified?

1097
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,260
I mean, it's a cartoon, I already assume that it's not real.

1098
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,860
Yeah, like why are people giving a fuck?

1099
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,460
Well, whatever, he's just saying, it makes sense.

1100
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,220
Fuck you guys, I'm giving a fuck because it's interesting.

1101
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,140
Oh, no, no, okay, I assumed from what you were saying

1102
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,900
that people were like offended that Russia was fucked up.

1103
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,500
Oh, no, I don't think so.

1104
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,820
No, it's fucking awesome.

1105
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,580
Okay, okay, I thought you were implying that like

1106
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,980
people were like, what the fuck?

1107
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,220
No, truly, that is the brightest possible timeline

1108
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,180
in which Russia was blown the fuck out.

1109
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,540
No, because it's not just Russia.

1110
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,740
Africa is Africa and Australia and South America are all different.

1111
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,420
I'm just kidding, Russia, I love you guys.

1112
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,820
You make cool things.

1113
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,700
Yeah, that was a lot of lore in there.

1114
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,060
Hey, do you guys think that in that,

1115
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,860
what people call the tomb of white diamond,

1116
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,580
that thing in the, where they got trapped,

1117
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,540
that they all just split up,

1118
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,900
that gem that Steven pulls out of that thing,

1119
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,180
it's in that field with all the strawberries,

1120
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,340
the battlefield with the big war happened.

1121
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,300
Was that white diamond?

1122
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,700
Do you think she's dead and that's her

1123
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,380
powering that entire thing?

1124
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

1125
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,140
It was too long ago.

1126
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,900
Well, whatever, never mind.

1127
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,020
No, fucking explain.

1128
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,620
I'm just gonna say yes.

1129
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,780
In that, you know that one episode

1130
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,460
where they go to the strawberry battlefield

1131
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,380
and they go into that upside down pyramid

1132
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
where they get trapped and like it turns out

1133
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,460
the place is rotating, you know what I'm talking about?

1134
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1135
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,940
At the end of that, they break through the floor

1136
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,620
and go down and Steven, out of like the central core,

1137
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,700
he pulls out a big white diamond looking shape.

1138
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,220
Does he take it with him?

1139
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,060
Yeah, they bubble it, they bubble it.

1140
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,900
But the thing is, the whole place was built from that gem

1141
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,100
and disappears afterward.

1142
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,500
And a lot of people are thinking that it's supposed

1143
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,060
to be the tomb of white diamond

1144
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,180
and that she was killed during the battle for Earth

1145
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,900
and this is her, you know, I don't know.

1146
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,180
Maybe, well maybe my question is that.

1147
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,700
White diamond ever evolved in the world before?

1148
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,820
We don't know, we don't know, no idea.

1149
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,900
Well the whole thing is like gems don't die.

1150
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,620
Like if you die, you just like get reformed later.

1151
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,500
Like wouldn't the gem have to be destroyed completely?

1152
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,100
Well, that's the thing, it was trapped in this thing

1153
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,940
like in a construct, you know.

1154
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,220
Yeah, well they did bubble it.

1155
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,060
So maybe, yeah, maybe now that it's been removed,

1156
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,980
it could reform into white diamond.

1157
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,820
Wouldn't that be something?

1158
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,900
I mean, possibly?

1159
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,740
I don't know.

1160
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,260
But you'd think they would recognize.

1161
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,220
Yeah, like they've been there,

1162
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,580
they fought that battle, right?

1163
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,940
I feel like they should've known themselves.

1164
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,660
I mean, they just like saw yellow diamond on communicator

1165
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,860
and all like piss themselves.

1166
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,380
Yeah, you know what else was interesting though

1167
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,740
and I wanna talk about this a little bit.

1168
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,300
In the answer, okay, so it's been confirmed

1169
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,220
that Rose led at least some kind of big army

1170
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,380
against the forces of the homeworld gems, right?

1171
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,340
She definitely had an army, that's been said.

1172
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,780
And yet in the answer, like she and Pearl show up

1173
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,820
by themselves to do a mission,

1174
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,700
which doesn't necessarily mean a lot.

1175
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,540
But what it does mean is that every single other gem

1176
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,460
that fought on her side was killed in that fight,

1177
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,100
except for like five of them.

1178
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
That's pretty crazy.

1179
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,620
Isn't that, I'm wondering, I'm afraid it's gonna turn out.

1180
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,620
No, it doesn't necessarily mean that.

1181
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,660
We don't know, the rest of them could've been taken prisoner

1182
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,180
or like been granted a pardon after the battle

1183
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,020
for whatever reason and gone home.

1184
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,500
But no, it's said that Rose won the war, right?

1185
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,700
I mean, is it winning if like all of your forces

1186
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,540
are captured, why don't they just?

1187
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,700
Winning would be the earth not being destroyed.

1188
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,060
And that's kind of why Peridot was like,

1189
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,620
well, you didn't fucking really win anything

1190
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,500
if the cluster's still gonna fuck it up.

1191
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,540
You know, that was kind of her point.

1192
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,780
Who's to say for sure that she did have a big army,

1193
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,620
maybe it was.

1194
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,940
She says many times that she had an army,

1195
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,180
but did she mean her and like her four friends?

1196
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,260
Was that her fucking army?

1197
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,100
Well, that's the whole thing,

1198
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,420
because like, you know, fucking like,

1199
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,020
it's just Rose and Pearl in the answer.

1200
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,100
And like, on the one hand, maybe it's just kind of like

1201
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,380
a representation, because like all the background characters

1202
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,500
weren't even like fully drawn,

1203
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,540
so maybe it was just kind of taking

1204
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,220
some artistic liberties there.

1205
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,820
But on the other hand, like we don't know

1206
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,620
any of the other ones, like they did mention

1207
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,900
in like one of the earlier episodes

1208
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,500
that like all the monsters that they were bubbling

1209
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,020
used to be gems, and I'm assuming those are probably

1210
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,940
like maybe gems, like their comrades

1211
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
that they've been connected or something.

1212
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,780
Yeah, possibly, possibly.

1213
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,740
Like that's kind of what it seems like it was implying.

1214
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,380
And like on the battlefield, where that, you know,

1215
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,740
they say the Tomb of White Diamond was,

1216
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,660
which wasn't necessarily that, like that's full of swords

1217
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,060
and like weapons, that was clearly a huge battlefield.

1218
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,780
They say it was a gem war was fought there.

1219
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,740
It couldn't have been fought by just five fucking dudes.

1220
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,900
Unless like it was just them versus everybody

1221
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,940
and they're just fucking OP Neo.

1222
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,780
Okay, Pearl is super OP.

1223
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,620
She beat like a triple fusion by herself.

1224
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,180
She is super duper strong.

1225
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,020
That's true.

1226
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,140
True, but that took a lot out of her.

1227
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,980
It did, she only barely did it.

1228
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,900
But at the same time, when you think about it,

1229
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,380
like, you know, we saw the rubies

1230
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,740
and they're all kind of like crap.

1231
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,940
Yeah, like they're ass beaten and like Pearl

1232
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,780
didn't even break a sweat.

1233
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,140
And that was like, I'm assuming probably early rebellion Pearl.

1234
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,100
Because like Garnet hadn't even showed up yet.

1235
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,820
So I don't know how OP are they, we really don't know.

1236
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,660
Well, that's the thing.

1237
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
If they're not super OP,

1238
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,980
then how the fuck did they fight this whole war on their own?

1239
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,820
It wouldn't make sense.

1240
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,860
So they must have had forces.

1241
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,740
Because they had swords, man.

1242
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,580
They, other guys had swords.

1243
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,820
Yeah, but they had swords and they know how to use them.

1244
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,460
Hey, you know what would be cool speaking to using swords

1245
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,460
if Steven fused with Connie

1246
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,220
and they use the sword and shield together.

1247
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,140
They definitely do, because that's what Rose added.

1248
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,460
Oh, it just made me come.

1249
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,300
I know it's gonna happen.

1250
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,140
That's what I'm saying.

1251
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,500
They're gonna fuse together.

1252
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,660
They're gonna be the new pink diamond.

1253
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,500
They're gonna fucking retrain at the end of the series.

1254
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,820
And they're gonna ride lion through space.

1255
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,060
And it's gonna be glorious.

1256
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,900
It's gonna be glorious.

1257
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,740
That's for sure.

1258
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,580
I'm so ready.

1259
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,700
Yeah, that's how it's looking.

1260
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,580
Boy.

1261
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,740
I love cartoons.

1262
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,060
I do.

1263
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,660
Me too.

1264
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,460
Let's talk about how Steven Universe

1265
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,620
is clearly better than other cartoons in many ways.

1266
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,420
That's dumb.

1267
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,260
No, it's true though.

1268
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,100
It's true.

1269
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,940
Wow.

1270
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,140
The continuity is just my trigger.

1271
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,020
It makes me feel good all over my body.

1272
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,020
Well, that's dumb.

1273
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,060
That's dumb not every cartoon needs to be like that.

1274
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:25,900
It's not only that.

1275
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,580
The way it's built its world,

1276
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,860
like gem culture is so cool.

1277
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,900
And the way it's set up with all these other social problems

1278
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,340
that we can't exactly relate to,

1279
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,420
but understand what it would mean if it was in our society.

1280
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,020
And how Gem Fusion is a taboo that we,

1281
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,660
and how Fusion itself is something that we can get

1282
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,060
on a referential level,

1283
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,100
but can't specifically experience,

1284
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,180
but still understand how cool it is.

1285
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,020
Oh, I love it.

1286
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,860
Oh, very impressive.

1287
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,860
It's great.

1288
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,860
But, you really glue me away

1289
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,780
with your description of the show right there.

1290
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,620
You know what?

1291
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,060
Get the fuck out of here with that sarcasm.

1292
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,740
I don't even need it.

1293
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,660
I know, right?

1294
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,180
I'm just saying, like, so what?

1295
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,900
It's all of these things you like.

1296
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,180
Big fucking deal.

1297
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,020
I don't know.

1298
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,940
We're doing a podcast about things that we like.

1299
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,780
No, no.

1300
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,540
Okay, okay, okay.

1301
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,380
I'm being an asshole.

1302
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,940
Honestly, no, like, for real though,

1303
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,180
like what show, at least like what Western animation

1304
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,940
right now is anywhere near as good.

1305
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,100
I mean, I think the closest is probably Gravity Falls,

1306
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,780
but Gravity Falls isn't nearly as complex.

1307
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,700
No, okay, okay.

1308
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,540
It's true.

1309
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,380
Steven is my favorite show.

1310
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,220
There you go.

1311
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,060
All right.

1312
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,500
But it still sucks.

1313
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,180
Yeah, that's true.

1314
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,460
Not as much as your opinion sucks.

1315
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,300
Oh, fine.

1316
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
He's got you beat there.

1317
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,380
So guys, let's, I guess, I don't know, feels like.

1318
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,540
But I'm just saying, not every show needs to be

1319
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,100
what Steven is, which is, you know,

1320
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,900
like a dramatic, you know, heavily continuity based,

1321
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,900
you know, action comedy, like mishmash genre,

1322
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,980
fucking feel-

1323
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,300
It's just a cool thing that we like because we're cool.

1324
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,660
I just, I agree with what Jesse said in his video though,

1325
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,180
that there's not a bad episode of Steven Universe.

1326
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,500
Like, that's pretty, pretty much true.

1327
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,260
You run the gamut of good.

1328
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,100
Wait, are we sure about that?

1329
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,660
Some of the episodes involving the citizens of Beach City,

1330
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,020
I really do not give much of a shit about,

1331
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,140
but they're generally okay.

1332
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,740
Honestly, I'm tempted to call the one with the yellow diamond

1333
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,420
a bad episode because of how fucking angry it makes me.

1334
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,900
Are you kidding me?

1335
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,740
You are a moron.

1336
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,540
You are such a fool if you let her design blind you

1337
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,500
to all the amazing shit that happened in that episode.

1338
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,380
I think it was in orbit with that episode.

1339
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,220
Yeah.

1340
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,420
It's so important and it's so,

1341
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,780
and they botched it so bad.

1342
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,300
They botched one tiny aspect of it.

1343
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,580
It's not even that big a deal.

1344
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,660
You are blinded.

1345
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,980
Dude, when Peridot yelled at her and overcame her, you know.

1346
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,700
Can we talk about Peridot and how she's fucking perfect?

1347
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,540
Yes, yes, she is perfect.

1348
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,380
Yeah, let's talk about it.

1349
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,300
Let me criticize that because I thought that her change,

1350
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,940
I thought that her change at the end was a rush

1351
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,300
and I didn't call her rush.

1352
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,660
It wasn't even rush, it's not like she changed then.

1353
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,100
That was the, that was the,

1354
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,780
when she expressed the new feelings

1355
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,780
that had been developing over the season.

1356
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,020
The very, the previous episode,

1357
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:07,220
she showed absolutely no remorse or misgivings at all

1358
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,740
at the thought of the entire planet

1359
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,820
and everyone on it being destroyed.

1360
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,180
The very next episode,

1361
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,580
she fucking goes against everything she believes in

1362
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,540
to, you know, prevent that from happening.

1363
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,380
That is not true.

1364
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,340
She clearly is forming a connection with the earth.

1365
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,980
Even if she herself doesn't immediately realize it,

1366
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,940
people can have contradictions in their own mind.

1367
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,900
Dude, the whole thing, Ben,

1368
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,740
her interpretation of how best to use the earth

1369
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,620
was just different, but they explain it to her.

1370
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,220
And she's like, okay, I love the earth.

1371
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,060
Let's, you know, monopolize it for resources.

1372
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,900
That'd be cool.

1373
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,740
And then they're like, no, that's not how we do things here.

1374
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,580
We like life.

1375
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,500
We want it to stay alive.

1376
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,420
And she's like, oh, I hadn't really thought about it that way.

1377
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,500
I guess a planet can be useful in that way too.

1378
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,620
She's growing as a character.

1379
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,380
She's learning new experiences about the world.

1380
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,060
And that's what makes it so cool.

1381
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:46,900
Yeah.

1382
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,140
Dude, it's even, it's more than that

1383
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,420
because Peridot, it's not like she goes into this,

1384
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,660
like saying like, I'm going to call Yellow Diamond.

1385
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,420
I'm going to like say sorry

1386
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,180
and have her come down and fucking wreck this planet.

1387
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,260
No, what happened was that

1388
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,100
she had realized that the earth was valuable.

1389
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,060
But she'd also realized like in that conversation

1390
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,060
in the truck with Steven,

1391
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:11,020
that like she thinks that Yellow Diamond is the fucking best.

1392
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,780
Like she believes that the diamonds

1393
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,500
are inherently superior to everybody.

1394
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,780
And she also knows from the map and the shit

1395
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,460
and like how the cluster, like the gems,

1396
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,940
the crystal gems haven't really accomplished

1397
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,780
what they set out to do.

1398
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,540
Because like they're still kind of on like a crash course

1399
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,100
with like fucking everything up.

1400
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,140
That like they can't fucking solve it.

1401
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,780
But she believes that Yellow Diamond could.

1402
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,900
And she says, the reason she idolizes Yellow Diamond

1403
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,340
is so much is because she's logical.

1404
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,580
That's what she loves about her so much,

1405
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,820
which makes sense because Peridot tries to be logical,

1406
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,980
but she's shown throughout this entire time at the barn

1407
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,340
that she's quick tempered.

1408
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,780
Like she blows her top over everything.

1409
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,980
So she's like, I need to go contact Yellow Diamond

1410
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,580
and plead my case because she'll listen to me.

1411
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,620
I have this new perspective that none of us have

1412
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,660
that I've been taught by these people

1413
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,820
that I'm going to explain to her and she'll listen to me.

1414
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,660
That's exactly right.

1415
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,500
She goes to do that and when she does,

1416
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,620
she finds out that her idea of what Yellow Diamond was

1417
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,180
was a complete crock of shit.

1418
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,820
Because Yellow Diamond is fucking pissed

1419
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,780
that Rose tried to defend that planet.

1420
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,620
And that emotional bias is why she wants

1421
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,020
to fucking blow the place up.

1422
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,580
And when Peridot realizes that Yellow Diamond

1423
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,100
isn't an actuality how she thought she was,

1424
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,780
that's when she lets her temper again,

1425
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,580
get the better of her and blows her stack.

1426
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,420
And that's what causes her to reverse like that.

1427
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,260
That's right.

1428
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,380
So it's fucking natural, it's completely logical,

1429
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,460
it's fucking amazing.

1430
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,220
Peridot, wife, who tier, awesome.

1431
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,860
She reached out to Yellow Diamond,

1432
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,500
thinking that Yellow Diamond would be able

1433
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
to solve the problem.

1434
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,660
Everyone's like, no, don't call her.

1435
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,100
But she's like, I'm just gonna fix shit.

1436
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,100
But wait, there's something, I think you lost me there.

1437
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:45,940
Maybe I missed it.

1438
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,940
But where along the line did, okay, two things.

1439
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,900
When did Peridot decide that, oh yeah,

1440
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,780
maybe life on Earth is precious

1441
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,780
and we should save it.

1442
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,100
And more damningly, why would she think

1443
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,260
that the logical thing for Yellow Diamond to do

1444
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,420
would be to agree with her?

1445
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,940
I think that in that moment, confronted with the reality

1446
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,620
of ultimate destruction of all life on Earth,

1447
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,820
she had a minor change of heart in that moment.

1448
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,100
No, I disagree, I don't think it really.

1449
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,340
I can believe that, I can believe that.

1450
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,300
But what specifically was it that convinced her

1451
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,900
that she was wrong about Yellow Diamond

1452
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,740
and that she wasn't?

1453
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,420
Okay, well, probably also the fact

1454
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,700
that Yellow Diamond was that moment.

1455
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,420
Was talking down to her and insulting her

1456
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,900
and she is a hothead.

1457
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,740
Well, that's the thing,

1458
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,060
Peridot had come to understand.

1459
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,980
And she realized that there was that lack of logic

1460
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,380
that what she thought she idolized in her.

1461
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,260
But I think, you're right.

1462
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,500
What lack of logic?

1463
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,540
What lack of logic?

1464
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,860
Because she was trying to present a case

1465
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,060
and Yellow Diamond wouldn't even listen to it

1466
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,620
because she was so emotionally blinded by her hatred

1467
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,940
for what the Earth represented that she wanted it destroyed

1468
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,580
and wouldn't even listen to an alternate perspective.

1469
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,660
Well, okay.

1470
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,060
So what you're saying is that Peridot decided

1471
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,860
that Yellow Diamond must not be perfectly logical

1472
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,980
because she disagreed with her?

1473
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,820
Yeah, pretty much.

1474
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,300
Because Peridot knows that the Earth is valuable.

1475
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,820
That's pretty darn illogical.

1476
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,140
God, not even close.

1477
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,500
She just changed.

1478
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,180
People change, Ben.

1479
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,540
People can change.

1480
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,060
It's real, it's really, really simple.

1481
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,220
It's fine because I know, as we've said before,

1482
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,420
she isn't as logical as she thinks she is

1483
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,260
because she's hot-tempered.

1484
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,100
I don't even think it's that.

1485
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,940
She blew up, Ben.

1486
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,780
So she didn't just say like,

1487
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,860
okay, well, now I'm not listening to you.

1488
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,940
She got frustrated because this person that she idolized

1489
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,140
wasn't reacting in the way that she had

1490
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,020
internally convinced herself that she would.

1491
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,500
Okay, I guess what it comes down to is that

1492
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,260
I don't remember any moment before the phone call

1493
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,700
where I was like, oh, now Peridot has come around

1494
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,220
to the idea that life on Earth has value.

1495
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,220
I don't remember that happening.

1496
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,980
That's the point of the next episode

1497
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,660
is when you see her entire progression

1498
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,500
during that three month period

1499
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,420
where she learns about fusion,

1500
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,180
where she almost fuses with Garnet.

1501
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,820
Right, during that phone call,

1502
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,780
during that phone call, we are clearly set up

1503
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,220
to expect her to like betray us,

1504
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
but when she actually makes a case for the Earth.

1505
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,460
Because we've seen that episode that came after first,

1506
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,980
we would know she was no way in hell,

1507
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,820
she was gonna fucking do it.

1508
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,180
It was intended to be a surprise

1509
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,020
that she was on Earth's side.

1510
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,660
By keeping us in the dark, we were able to like

1511
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,620
be more caught up in the drama of that moment.

1512
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,460
Right, exactly.

1513
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,300
It was awesome.

1514
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,300
It was awesome, it was great.

1515
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,540
I can kind of buy that, okay.

1516
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,980
But if she'd had this ongoing thing

1517
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,020
where she was learning to love Garnet and whatever,

1518
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
then why, when she saw on the terminal

1519
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,780
the image of the entire Earth destroyed,

1520
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,180
was she like, heck yeah, that would've been great, right guys?

1521
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,020
I mean, that was a big moment when she learned that,

1522
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,340
you know, because she still thought

1523
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,900
that using the Earth for resources

1524
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,860
was a good way to use it.

1525
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,060
She didn't really make a connection.

1526
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,140
Despite her growth, she was still in that moment.

1527
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,300
A tad naive and had different values instilled in her.

1528
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,580
I think she was just caught up

1529
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,180
in like her admiration for the diamond.

1530
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,540
She was like fapping downstairs

1531
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,620
about how great they were.

1532
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,660
Even during that episode with Garnet,

1533
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,580
even then she isn't able to fuse with Earth.

1534
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,500
It's not like she's completed her transition

1535
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,900
into becoming a crystal gem.

1536
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,300
It's like all part of it, you know.

1537
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,740
She's shown to be trying to understand this perspective,

1538
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,220
but she doesn't get it yet.

1539
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,060
Yeah.

1540
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,180
It's gonna see how she grows and continues to grow.

1541
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,580
And I think her conversation with Yellow Diamond

1542
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:10,220
is the moment the catalyst that makes her finally get it.

1543
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,700
She's been trying to get it.

1544
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,540
Agreed.

1545
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,380
She doesn't quite get it.

1546
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,340
But then when she sees Yellow Diamond up,

1547
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,500
Yellow Diamond is just being a snobbish,

1548
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,940
a snooty cunt.

1549
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,620
She's like, you know what?

1550
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,620
She's a snooty cunt.

1551
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,900
And that's what she says.

1552
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,660
She says, you, Yellow Diamond, are a cunt.

1553
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,140
And that's how it ended.

1554
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,900
I agree that that's the moment when,

1555
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,460
I agree that's the moment when she decides

1556
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,540
that she can't stick with the diamond authority.

1557
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,220
You guys have made a pretty respectable case.

1558
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,180
All right.

1559
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,100
So that's fine.

1560
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,300
I'm glad.

1561
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm glad you were able to help you.

1562
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,140
We saved every, we saved the world.

1563
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,980
We did.

1564
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,460
We changed Ben's mind about something.

1565
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,900
Ben, you've known it out.

1566
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,700
Ben, like Parodot, has been introduced to a new opinion.

1567
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,020
Oh, he's an arch.

1568
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,900
What an arch he's had.

1569
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,140
Amazing.

1570
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,140
Yeah, what an arch.

1571
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,100
What a day.

1572
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:03,700
Oh, look at him.

1573
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,220
He's easy.

1574
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,620
He's being all sundry now.

1575
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,660
Like, oh, yeah, I've learned a lot, guys.

1576
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,540
It's not like I like Stephen or anything.

1577
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,380
Well, it's been an hour.

1578
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,900
I guess that's a pretty good thorough discussion.

1579
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,380
Oh, man, I feel like we have any,

1580
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,180
I feel like we could go all day on this bullshit.

1581
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,180
Yeah, we could talk about specifics, but I don't know.

1582
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,980
We could have another Stephen podcast later.

1583
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,980
Yeah, we could maybe do that.

1584
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
I don't know.

1585
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,180
Maybe after that bomb.

1586
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,700
Leave in the comments if you want more of this, I guess,

1587
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,060
you know, or whatever.

1588
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,700
See what people have to say about it.

1589
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,740
All right, well, thanks for watching, guys.

1590
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,940
It's been a good conversation.

1591
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
Glad we had it.

1592
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,460
We'll see you guys in the next one next week.

1593
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,620
Everybody say bye.

1594
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,620
Bye.

1595
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,620
Bye.

1596
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,820
Bye.

1597
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,660
See ya.
