1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
You just don't get it. I could serve Earth from some alien attack I could pretend my life had meaning.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,240
Meaningless objects can't give meaning or purpose to other meaningless objects.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,640
Meaning and purpose. Ha ha. It would only be in your head, just like a god. It doesn't exist.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,880
There is no free will love purpose meaning or reason to live.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,120
I guess when I think about it, you're right. Love is just a result of hormones in our brains

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,320
and all other actions are determined by our brain. I guess everything is meaningless.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,200
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I am the best guy ever

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,040
leader of a tribe called Quest. Welcome to the podcast with Digibro.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,040
in Hippocrite. In Hippocrite.

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Uh, I, you know, I have a Patreon, but it just doesn't matter.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
But it would be nice if it would be nice if some coins fell in.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
You know, it's pointless overall. We're all gonna die in the universe.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
But you know, patreon.com slash my wrist.

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
That's the one. That's the one.

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Pledge me one measly bitcoin per month on Patreon.

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
A bitcoin is worth like $67 or something.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Dude, I thought it was worth like hundreds.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,040
I don't know if it's a bitcoin. You can only buy a car or maybe a HIV positive blood vessel.

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Oh, this, I like where this meme is going. HIV.

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Oh, what a good meme. I like HIV.

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
He never heard that one before.

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Let's get right down to it. We're talking about how nihilism.

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Nothing matters. Nothing matters.

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm just gonna go, I'm just gonna go right out on record and say that it's true.

26
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,040
And there's no room for argument on this topic.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,040
No, babe. I don't know what nihilism is. Nate, is there any way you have me know what nihilism is?

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
I didn't prepare this podcast at all. Please.

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm rubbing my chakra nodes at such high speed together to elicit an answer from the cosmos.

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
And I'm getting something from UrbanDictionary.com slash go.

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,040
It's nihilism. Definition. It's useless to define it.

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Oh, they got...

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Oh, what a good one.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I'm pretty sure it has really gotten me.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,040
I know. There's a really long one, but I'll just read like the beginning of it.

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Okay, nihilism.

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,040
A philosophy based on extreme skepticism in its most basic form before it was clouded by...

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Oh, God. Fuck this.

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Yeah, that was going downhill.

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
It's a pretty high IQ to be a nihilist.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,040
It says in parentheses, before it was clouded by ideas involving politics, social rhetoric, sex, drugs, rock and roll, etc.

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Oh, my God.

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Which we can refer to as epistemological nihilism.

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Okay, that's fair because it's about the existence.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,040
No, no, no. Well, that's bullshit because now he's defining nihilism as just one kind of nihilism.

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
What about the other kinds?

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Well, okay. The next part is simply denies the possibility of knowledge of truth, which I think is relatively succinct.

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,040
The Catholic Church has really gone downhill ever since Pope Urban made his own dictionary.

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
It's true, it's true.

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Hey, hey, before we get into any of the discussion, we should probably have like a blatant statement for like what each of us are.

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Like, like, there's optimists, there's realists, there's pragmatists, there's dentists, there's abolitionists, there's Marxists,

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,040
or even the dreaded Beatlejuice, which is a spiritual anomaly trained in the dark arts of Spookradi and Guljitsu.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm a dentist in that I will put dents in your fucking skull, bitch.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Oh, shit, dude.

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
That's awesome.

56
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
That's sick.

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Ben, what are you? How would you define yourself in this way?

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,040
I guess I'm a nihilist. I guess I'm a nihilist and I believe in nothing and I'm real cool.

59
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Yeah, you can say I'm a nihilist.

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm vaping and tilting my fedora and in my in my sick flame print Hawaiian shirt over here.

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Fedora tipping for atheists. Us proud nihilists are more of the cluster punk variety.

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
We don't believe in fashion or anything for that matter.

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Let me tell you how much of a nihilist I am.

64
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I was torn. I was torn on, you know, you can be a religious guy and that sucks.

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,040
And you can be an atheist and that sucks, too.

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Because, like, as spirit science teaches us, you don't pick just one.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,040
You can't pick being an atheist or being religious.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Don't restrict yourself.

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
This is just boxes of belief and you're not supposed to be limited to one.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
But then there's the middle ground.

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
There's the, like, oh, well, who fucking knows?

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
The being agnostic. But that wasn't good enough for me.

73
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
I needed to go one step further.

74
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:12,040
So I dug a little deep and I discovered something that's even more nihilistic than all three of those,

75
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,040
which is a theological non-cognitivist, which is what I am.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Hang on.

77
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay, define that.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Well, okay, agnosticism says that we cannot know for sure whether there is a God or not.

79
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Theological non-cognitivism is the statement that the question of whether or not God exists

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
is ill-formed and does not have any meaning.

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,040
The concept of God is ill-defined in language to the point that even asking the question

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,040
of whether he exists is not actually asking anything at all and therefore there is no question.

83
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Well, I'm with you on there.

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,040
That's the level of nihilism you all are dealing with right here.

85
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Yeah, I guess so.

86
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I would just, like, it depends on what version of God you mean, I guess.

87
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Like, some people believe it's like a literal entity.

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

89
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
This is saying about God?

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Yeah, I know, I know.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
You would have to rigorously define your terms in order to ask the question in the first place.

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
But the point is that it's not well-defined on a broad enough level.

93
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Oh, boy, I'm reading the definition of nihilism on Wikipedia, getting so excited.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
See, there's different types.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,040
There's existential nihilism means that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.

96
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
True.

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Obviously true.

98
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Of course.

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality and accepted moral values are abstractly contrived.

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Even more obvious.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Definitely.

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Even more obvious.

103
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
But this is my favorite.

104
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning, respectively,

105
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,040
that in some aspect, knowledge is not possible or reality does not actually exist.

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Hell yeah.

107
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
The first one is true.

108
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Oh, that's the real, that's the core nihilism.

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Also, the second one is not true.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Well, yeah, I'll be okay, we'll see.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Incidentally, I would define a lot of those just aren't easily applied.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey, everyone, I just solved the existence.

113
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I just solved the riddle of existence right here for you.

114
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
I laid it all out.

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
There's the answer.

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Because I just picked which nihilisms are true and which nihilisms are false.

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
And there's no room for debate.

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Dude, my favorite thing about this is that the little box on the side on Wikipedia is

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
part of a series on certainty.

120
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Something about seeing these incredibly large concepts, like just thrown around, you know,

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I love it.

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm a label nihilist and that I don't believe labels are important and I don't care to

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
know what they mean, so I will just make one up.

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,040
How will you tell your fluffernutter from your mayonnaise without these labels?

125
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
You're fucked.

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
I just look at them and then I see.

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,040
When you're a young restauranteer and you don't label your fucking food, you're going

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,040
to go belly up quick before that little brrrr Scottish boy comes in and he slaps you by

129
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
the ear.

130
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,040
Well here, when I was younger, I used to define myself as a hedonist and I still do to some

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:08,040
degree, which is a hedonist is just one who believes that the purpose of life is defined

132
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,040
by obtaining pleasure and positive affirmation in this world.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,040
I still, to a large extent, think that's true because the only concrete system we have to

134
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,040
operate along is positive and negative feedback as perceived by our brain.

135
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
In a sense, I still sort of agree with that, but I would call myself sort of like a pragmatic

136
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
hedonist.

137
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Jesus Christ.

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Jesus Christ.

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,040
That's the funny thing about all these terms is that whether or not they contradict each

140
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,040
other is so vague because I would say the idea that there's no objective moral value.

141
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:51,040
That seems obvious, but at the same time, it's very easy to find and describe a functional

142
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
moral value.

143
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:59,040
To me, morality is obviously like anything that brings life is good and brings death is

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
bad.

145
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I mean, sure, most people would agree with that, but that doesn't make it objective in

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
any sense.

147
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Right.

148
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Cancer is literally like just mutants and it's, and I don't like X-Men.

149
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Sells are alive.

150
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I don't like X-Men.

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
I think X-Men should die.

152
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,040
If something promotes death or marvels in the Mackey universe, then it's objectively

153
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
bad.

154
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I guess to ask Nate about his pragmatic hedonism.

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Do you think that it is in any way contradictory of being nihilistic?

156
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Do you think that there is inherently value in being hedonistic or do you think it's more

157
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,040
like you appreciate that, but it doesn't inherently have meaning?

158
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Well, I'm sort of jacking myself off a little bit by using a term like pragmatic hedonism.

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
We know.

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
We know.

161
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Right.

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,040
This whole thing is fucking jack us off with big fancy words.

163
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
The fact that we're even using these.

164
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,040
It's really annoying me because like saying, oh yeah, this has no meaning.

165
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Nothing has meaning.

166
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Well, there you go.

167
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
That's nihilism.

168
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,040
But yeah, but like there's no different, like nothing, everything is, we ascribe things

169
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
to everything.

170
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
There is nothing inherent.

171
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Right.

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Inherency doesn't exist.

173
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
That's nihilism, hippo.

174
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes.

175
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Right, nihilism.

176
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I know that we're all on board with that.

177
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,040
But the fact that there's so many different types is like, it's like no shit.

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,040
No shit that there's what there doesn't have.

179
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Inherency in various different aspects of the universe.

180
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,040
But to answer Digi's question, though, so like the actual definition, I think it's just

181
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,040
like makes more sense is it's like this, whatever, pragmatic hedonism is just basically humanism.

182
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,040
So it's like, is human, like what is the, is, does that conflict with nihilism?

183
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,040
And I would argue absolutely not because my approach stems all from, at least I think

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
people try to say this.

185
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,040
I try to start with what seems to be the truth and then try to, from that foundation of things

186
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,040
that, as far as I can tell, are true, try to get to like the philosophy that seems like

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
it'll most get things the way I want them to go.

188
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Now when you say true, you mean true like observable truth.

189
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Not like a-

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Because there is no other kind that we have.

191
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Right.

192
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
There is no-

193
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
All we have is-

194
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Object, there is no truth with a capital T.

195
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Fucking observable truth is as good as truth.

196
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
So I don't-

197
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Yeah, I completely agree with that view.

198
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,040
You know that thing where like you said, oh yeah, you can never actually touch anything

199
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
because your atoms are like pushing against the atoms of a thing.

200
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah, true.

201
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
They don't actually touch, you know.

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I mean like there's no reason for that knowledge to-

203
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah, it's like you know what I mean.

204
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
I know you guys-

205
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
It could be helpful.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Like there is a reason for it, for that knowledge to exist and it's simply because without it-

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
To make you feel smooth, feel smart.

208
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Without it we have like okay, if you're a religious person, then everything we're saying is blasphemy.

209
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
You know?

210
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Like just to merely raise these ideas and like it's to make people understand that they're

211
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
like you believing in God doesn't make you right.

212
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
You know?

213
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Like that's-

214
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
So you can feel smarter for not believing in God.

215
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Well, so you can feel safe for not believing in God.

216
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Busted.

217
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
So you can not be killed for not believing in God, you know?

218
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,040
It's to bust out all this science.

219
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,040
In casual conversation it makes you an asshole.

220
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
You know?

221
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Like to just say this stuff apropos of nothing.

222
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Yeah, if you're like you don't really-

223
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
If you're like oh I'm touching you and someone's like oh you don't really touching anything.

224
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
It's like a fuck you.

225
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Yeah.

226
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
You know?

227
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
But like if you're trying to explain this to someone so that they can just like wrap their

228
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,040
head around the idea that you know there is no absolute truth in the universe therefore

229
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,040
we cannot have a religious society because it's based in nothing.

230
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
You know?

231
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
I guess I do see the purpose of nihilism to come up.

232
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
No.

233
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Not in general like just like for once.

234
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Like once.

235
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Like every teenager should have a little pamphlet and says nothing exists you fucking idiot.

236
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
And then they read it and they're like okay they never have to talk about it again but

237
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,040
now they know and then they can do real human being things.

238
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,040
There's only a certain degree of like practical application that this knowledge has on your

239
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,040
life because like you're still gonna basically live everything the same way.

240
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Even if you're somebody like me who doesn't believe that like consciousness or free will

241
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
are real.

242
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Like you still operate in basically the exact same way and it changes nothing about your

243
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
day to day life.

244
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,040
That's why it's so funny to me that there's like 80 terms you know that's why it's hilarious.

245
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
I'm a fucking din of lions.

246
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm surrounded by fucking medusas and ghouls and fucking monsters.

247
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I am 100% an optimist and I will.

248
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm an optimist.

249
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
That is not.

250
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
I'm an optimist.

251
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Oh okay.

252
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I gotta fight you on this Nate.

253
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Consciousness is the only thing that is real.

254
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
You know that is true.

255
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I guess I wouldn't say that consciousness isn't real but I would argue that it's very different

256
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,040
from the way it's generally perceived.

257
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Because everything in the world we experience second hand but our consciousness and our

258
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:09,040
experiences are they are the only thing that is objectively observable and truth with a

259
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
capital T exist in my humble.

260
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
In this faggot's humble opinion.

261
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
I hear you're coming from that.

262
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Well then you're not nihilistic anymore Ben.

263
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
You believe in an objective thing.

264
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeah yeah well okay yeah that's what I said.

265
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,040
That's why I said that the ontological nihilism is clearly not true because we can fuck there

266
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,040
are fucking things we can there are things that we can observe are true.

267
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
What if they're all a simulation.

268
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,040
But the mind experiencing that simulation can't also be a simulation.

269
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,040
I think okay that's a fair point and to just cloudy the waters as much as possible at the

270
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,040
very beginning of this discussion before you go any further.

271
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,040
I just want to explain to anyone who doesn't know of the simulation theory that it is entirely

272
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,040
possible that the entire universe that you live in right now is in complete fabrication

273
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
because think about it.

274
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
Which affects nothing.

275
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
There's no like even if that is true that has no bearing on you whatsoever.

276
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
None of this affects anything.

277
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,040
To even talk about nihilism at all is like the most privileged conversation you can possibly

278
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
have.

279
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Like it is it is the realm of we have got we have accomplished our base needs so well

280
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
that now we can just think about concepts that mean nothing.

281
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It's pretty funny like no matter how unreal no matter how much of a simulation the world

282
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,040
is if I cut myself right now it's going to hurt and I'll need a bandaid you know it doesn't

283
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
matter how unreal it is.

284
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
It could matter though.

285
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
It could matter.

286
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
It fucking could matter.

287
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I would I would argue that that knowledge just like the whole thing about how like pushing

288
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,040
your finger against your other finger technically no matter is touching any other matter.

289
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,040
But then again what exactly is matter is it the is it the potential cloud of electrons

290
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
What the fuck is that shit.

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
We don't know.

292
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Right.

293
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I just wanted to say that I thought it was really funny that nihilism like nihilists

294
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,040
have the least reason to discuss nihilism because of how pointless it is to discuss nihilism

295
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,040
because they're nihilists and yet the Wikipedia article is huge and there's so many different

296
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
types.

297
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Checkmate nihilists.

298
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Yeah well hey go look at the Christianity Wikipedia page though.

299
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I bet it dwarfs this.

300
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
You mean the Bible.

301
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Oh my god.

302
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
The original Wikipedia.

303
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:33,040
God's been editing that shit since 6000 BC though.

304
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,040
But yeah I guess it can be fun to speculate on stuff like that I guess.

305
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I want to hear Munchie's position because it sounds like he's coming from a different

306
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
position than a lot of us in this.

307
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Oh completely.

308
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Okay.

309
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,040
I think you basically have to be retarded and like low functioning like you don't have

310
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
brain cells like an extra chromosome.

311
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Hey man I went to college.

312
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,040
You have to go to college to be this dumb to get a nihilism.

313
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Exactly.

314
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:09,040
As plankton famously said in SpongeBob the Musical I went to college so you know it's clever.

315
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Sinusism and nihilism are just like coping methods for people who have an Hercules the

316
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,040
snake of depression in their crib like I did when I was a wee boy.

317
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Sinusism doesn't have to be linked to nihilism but okay.

318
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I just want to Munchie I think you'd appreciate this.

319
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,040
My favorite explanation of nihilism ever was a wholesome meme that Jesse posted one time.

320
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:37,040
Where on the left it was how people think nihilists are and it was a guy like crying in the rain

321
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,040
and going nothing matters and then on the right it was.

322
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
It was actually the little rad kid from the 90s.

323
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah rad 90s dude on a surfboard thumbs up and he's like nothing matters yeah and that's

324
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
how I feel all the time.

325
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,040
For me it's the most it is optimism is nihilism is to be like oh yeah none of this shit actually

326
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,040
matters and I really want to reiterate that like the foundation of this whole thing and

327
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
I generally agree with that almost entirely.

328
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I think we might use different words but I think all of us agree on things probably the

329
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,040
vast majority of it except maybe Munchie but like all this comes from foundation of observed

330
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,040
truths that I have then been forced to construct a worldview from so I'm just trying to be as

331
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,040
accurate as possible and I'm generally also a pretty positive person so even though I think

332
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,040
that like the universe is doomed and that there's like no hope of anything that's in it right

333
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,040
now surviving in a few billion years and therefore my existence is objectively meaningless and

334
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
pointless like that doesn't matter.

335
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I mean maybe we'll just make you know I was hoping to do that.

336
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,040
You described meaning to things by being alive.

337
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Yeah yeah I mean to say that it's meaningless is to like is to place it within a framework

338
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
of like of thing of value.

339
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Well it's just objectively meaningless but it's meaningful within the subjective experience

340
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
and I do value the subjective experience.

341
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Well here's the like yeah like for something to matter like what does it mean for something to

342
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
matter and it's like well that means that like someone cares about it so it's like so if you

343
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
care about something then it matters.

344
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,040
But see I wouldn't I don't quite agree with that.

345
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
I do believe that consciousness is a valuable thing and worth you know like respecting and

346
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,040
protecting but like I don't know if like human like if there's if it all ends one day then

347
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:24,040
that all was cool for the people who experienced it but there was no real point to it.

348
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Well no no no you're missing you're missing the point because the point is that like you you're

349
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,040
saying oh it doesn't matter because in the end it will all go away and like that's fine but like it

350
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
doesn't there's there's no objective standard for whether things matter that you can compare to

351
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,040
whether something matters or not is a matter of opinion you know.

352
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
The universe does not work on a scale of is it worth it or not.

353
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
It just exists and it is and eventually it will die.

354
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I make it my goal to care about the universe so that it does matter.

355
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I want to put it okay.

356
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I think that okay yeah like the like the nothing matters like that's like that like epic like like

357
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,040
like like law sick skill streak is you know nice and whatever.

358
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,040
However I like it when things are I like it when I care about things I like it when things matter

359
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:18,040
and when things matter I don't necessarily like I of course I am like I I prepare for the worst

360
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
and hope for the best.

361
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I know nothing actually matters and I know that there is no real and like you know tangible

362
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
like spirit or ghosts or anything.

363
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,040
But you know I just like it when I prescribe mean things because I'm a human and I like to

364
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,040
that's the best part is that for something it doesn't take anything all it takes for

365
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,040
something to matter is just that you care about it and then it matters.

366
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I think the main thing that this is all like based on is that when you're a kid you don't

367
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,040
understand that things might not matter because you think the universe is centered around you.

368
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Everybody's talking to you you're the main character which I would argue it basically is.

369
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah I mean when you're a kid.

370
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Only for Monty though.

371
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Yeah true but then like as you get a bit older you realize that you're just one of many human

372
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,040
beings and you're not actually that special but and you think oh maybe nothing matters

373
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:17,040
and you learn to be a nihilist but then I think it's sort of like a like a maturing of that idea

374
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,040
in your brain that makes you you know once you think that nothing matters then you can

375
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,040
care about things because there's nothing in your brain telling you oh you should be doing this

376
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,040
because you know other people say that you should do it or your parents or you know some other

377
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,040
higher power or like there's no rules in the universe so you feel better and it's really just

378
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:47,040
like a like a transitioning period away from thinking that things matter in terms of like

379
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,040
you know stuff that you don't like like you know parents telling you to go to college

380
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,040
and you don't want to go and but you think you have to because it matters and once you realize

381
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,040
that it doesn't then you can care about real things.

382
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
But to say nothing matters in that context.

383
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Like the question of things don't matter so why would I go to college that that's that's where

384
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,040
the pragmatic side of this comes in because there's no point in like like if nothing matters

385
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
why don't I just lay down and die.

386
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah that's the middle point.

387
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,040
What I was trying to get at is like the middle point is like why don't I just kill myself.

388
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Like I mean some people do that but some people don't and it's like parents say go to college

389
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,040
and you think that matters intrinsically and it's like the thing and then you realize that

390
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,040
nothing matters but then you may come you may come to think I want to go to college anyway

391
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
because I think it matters and then that that is that's a good point like it's like there's

392
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,040
an intrinsic truth being told to us and I think probably all of us except maybe Munch when

393
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,040
we were young certainly got fed the college will be the answer to all your problems and

394
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,040
life and what you do and you did OK OK and then like you know it certainly can help in

395
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,040
some ways but like we have all grown up and learned that college is in fact not actually

396
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
a magical solution to all your problems economic and otherwise in fact it's a magical problem

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
that will ruin your life.

398
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,040
I am currently saddled with quite a bit of fucking debt that I'm slowly working my way

399
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,040
out of and in fact I'm not too far away from but like it has been a burden on me for years

400
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,040
and then like all my goal in life now is just to quickly get away from the you know you

401
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,040
know you don't have to pay off that debt because when your parents die then you'll inherit

402
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,040
all of their money and so their money is basically your money so well my parents are going to live

403
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
for at least a while.

404
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,040
I don't want to have to pay a student loan every month.

405
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,040
I was just quoting Ben's argument for why he's the last student of us.

406
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:51,040
I'd like to distance myself from that quote as much as possible actually.

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,040
So you've taken it back now I should stop.

408
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,040
I should stop explaining to people that this is Ben's fault.

409
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I felt so shitty as soon as that came out of my mouth.

410
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,040
I was like oh god no come on.

411
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
That's an appropriate feeling to have.

412
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,040
It's one of my favorite things anyone's ever said to be perfectly honest.

413
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
It's very Ben.

414
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Ben St. you know a stitches head out of the dumpster he's currently in and just spouts

415
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
off a one liner like that I don't want to know why.

416
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I hate you.

417
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I hate you.

418
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,040
That's all I have to say.

419
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Oh fuck I completely forgot what I was going to bring up earlier.

420
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Oh yeah.

421
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,040
So time.

422
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Time's not real right?

423
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Hang on.

424
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
I saw gun buster.

425
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Well it's like another dimension right?

426
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,040
It's not that it's not real.

427
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:48,040
It's real because we can come up with a definition of what it means when we talk about time.

428
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,040
I spent a long time thinking that time was in fact not real and it was just a way that

429
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
we accounted for it.

430
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,040
This stuff was this way at one point and then things move and now they're this way.

431
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
It turns out that is in fact not true because time is a measurable phenomenon in the universe

432
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
that can be accounted for.

433
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Time is like something that stuff in the universe experiences but it's not like there's like

434
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
an outside of time right?

435
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
What are you guys talking about?

436
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Is it time obviously exists?

437
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Is it or is it not true that all time exists at once?

438
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
All of the time of the universe's existence.

439
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Are you smoking from the outside at all?

440
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,340
That's a fucked up question because you can't say that it all exists at once because by

441
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,040
saying at once you're referencing the concept of time.

442
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
Shit.

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
How can we get away?

444
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Is there a time when time began?

445
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I think they're probably what?

446
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
8.50pm.

447
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Yeah.

448
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Today.

449
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
You know what?

450
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I really feel like...

451
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Does the concept of beginning exist outside of what we...

452
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Dude.

453
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
I really feel bad.

454
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Doesn't matter at all though.

455
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
I really feel bad.

456
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I feel like I should be the expert on this question because I have like a physics degree

457
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,040
but like I really don't fucking know what to say about this shit.

458
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I fucking have it.

459
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
I fucking have it.

460
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Time has just started.

461
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Before that that was just like a memory, like a made up...

462
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
We just thought that all of our entire lives just happened.

463
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Like that was just a joke as a meme.

464
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
It started now.

465
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,040
What you're referring to is a very common...

466
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, go ahead.

467
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Sorry.

468
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,040
I'm just trying to get at that like the end of the universe is already...

469
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,040
When it happens it will always be in the now, right?

470
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Kind of like what CGP Grey was saying about how you don't die in the future.

471
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
You always die right now.

472
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
It's just not necessarily...

473
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,040
The thing about that isn't quite accurate.

474
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
It's not quite accurate to say that like...

475
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
It's not accurate.

476
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,040
It's just that we use the word future to mean a thing.

477
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,040
We know the future doesn't exist because it can never exist.

478
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
This is all some slippery language.

479
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
This is all some slippery language shenanigans.

480
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,040
I'm just saying that the universe has already ended.

481
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Like it's already there.

482
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
That's not true.

483
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
But it's not here now. It's in the future.

484
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
It's in the future. There's time between now and then.

485
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
In this moment that I'm speaking.

486
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Digi, are you just talking about the...

487
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,040
I forgot what the term is.

488
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Like it's...

489
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Time is...

490
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Deterministic.

491
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
That's the word I'm looking for.

492
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Maybe the universe is fully deterministic

493
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
and the end is already written into the beginning.

494
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
It's all in a set path.

495
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Actually, you know what?

496
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
That's a great topic to bring up because I literally believe

497
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,040
that there is no reason to not think that the universe is 100% deterministic

498
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,040
because the only way that you could object to that

499
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
is to argue that free will exists

500
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
in some way or that the age is within the universe.

501
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
That argument makes no sense at all.

502
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
The existence of free will makes no sense.

503
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Exactly.

504
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,040
You don't have to argue for free will to argue against determinism

505
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
because there could still be randomness.

506
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
That's true.

507
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,040
But the only way you can make that argument

508
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,040
is that you have to say that there is some force that acts on the universe

509
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
outside of just physics.

510
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
No, that's not true.

511
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Randomness operates.

512
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Some things can just be random. Why not?

513
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Randomness isn't actually real as I understand it.

514
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Is there any evidence for randomness?

515
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Yes.

516
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
What is the evidence for randomness?

517
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,040
What I'm saying is that there are only

518
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
the types of forces that exist that we know of

519
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
in terms of physics as we understand it now.

520
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Things happen the way they would have happened

521
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
based on cause and effect.

522
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
No.

523
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
There's randomness.

524
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
No, no, no.

525
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I see the argument for not randomness is

526
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,040
say if everybody does the exact same muscle movement

527
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
throughout the entire history of the universe.

528
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Anything that can move moves in exactly the same way

529
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
every single time.

530
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Physics would follow, I think,

531
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
is the idea.

532
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,040
The whole universe would fall because

533
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
a person stepped on it twice.

534
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
And if they step on it,

535
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
the exact history of them

536
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
getting to that place with that particular shoe

537
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
and stepping on it exactly the same way

538
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,040
twice in another version of the same universe,

539
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,040
it would fall at the exact same time in the exact same way.

540
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Let me just get this out there

541
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
so we can proceed with this knowledge.

542
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,040
The most fundamental physical things and events

543
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
happen at a small enough scale,

544
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
and at that scale things are determined randomly.

545
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
The best understanding of the universe

546
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
is that things literally are entirely built

547
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
on probabilities.

548
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Isn't that just our best understanding?

549
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Well, it might be.

550
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
If it's your best understanding,

551
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
it might just be our best understanding.

552
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
There could be something underlying it

553
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,040
that is deterministic, but we don't know that.

554
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
And why would we think that there necessarily has to be?

555
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
It just doesn't seem like it makes any sense

556
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
for anything to be banned back.

557
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Oh, that's a great fucking argument.

558
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Oh, it doesn't feel right.

559
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,040
Well, that's our best knowledge.

560
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Our best knowledge, and it gets that quick.

561
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Is it the absolute truth?

562
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
I don't know, but it's the best we've got.

563
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I would say there's a difference between

564
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
functionally random and truly random.

565
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
This is truly random.

566
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Our best understanding is based on true randomness.

567
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge.

568
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Here we go.

569
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Here's some knowledge.

570
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Photons.

571
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
They're like, what do you call them?

572
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Paradoxical.

573
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
They can exist in two places at once, provably.

574
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
They did like...

575
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I can't remember what it was called.

576
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
There's an experiment where they fire a single photon

577
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
in a thing.

578
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
And instead of like it being like a dot

579
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
that hits one, like there's this sheet,

580
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
a sheet of something that

581
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
detects photons, it was like

582
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
they shot it and it like

583
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
appeared in multiple places

584
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
even though it was just one thing and it didn't split.

585
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Yeah, it's Young's double slit experiment.

586
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Yeah.

587
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
It's not that the photons are...

588
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,040
I don't want to get into it.

589
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Hang on, hang on.

590
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
It's possible that something could exist

591
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
in two places at once, but that's different from random.

592
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It's not...

593
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Since we're on this topic,

594
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
I'll flex my nuts a little bit more

595
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
and say that it's not so much

596
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
that they exist at multiple places at once.

597
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
It's that their existence is

598
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
spread across a continuum

599
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
of probabilities of location.

600
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
And that those probabilities...

601
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Okay, so like the existence is a wave

602
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
form of probability that it like

603
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
undulates

604
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
through space, and that the measurement,

605
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
a measurement of the photon's location

606
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
will determine

607
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
and determine that it's actually located

608
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
at just one of those places,

609
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
but until the measurement is made,

610
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,040
it is not localized.

611
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,040
It is a spread of probabilities.

612
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Okay, but here's my question.

613
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
If under the exact same circumstances

614
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
we were able to like...

615
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
form this experiment again,

616
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,040
and the first time that we did it before we reset the universe,

617
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
we got X result.

618
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
If we did that experiment again,

619
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,040
would we get the same result?

620
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Or would it be somewhere else?

621
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
Our best understanding

622
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
of the phenomenon is that no,

623
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
we would not necessarily get the same result.

624
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Okay, well that's important.

625
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I think that's important to understand.

626
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I think...

627
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
If I just have the floor here,

628
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I think that all of this has been

629
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,040
the worst experience of my life

630
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
with all the reasons.

631
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
All of these...

632
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
All of these vague,

633
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
you know...

634
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Disgusting, smart,

635
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
smart terms such as

636
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,040
slice of life, time...

637
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
All of these...

638
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
All of these terms, like words

639
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
and beliefs...

640
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Munchie dropped out of Clown College,

641
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
so we wouldn't have to hear these kind of arguments anymore.

642
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
He was sick of all this fancy

643
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
and that's why he became a street juggalo

644
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
where the world should happen.

645
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
He dropped out of ICPU.

646
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Yeah, exactly.

647
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Here's my political

648
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
and philosophical beliefs.

649
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
It's a new thing that I've just admitted.

650
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
It's called real meatism,

651
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
where I believe in real meat only.

652
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Which means...

653
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
All of these things,

654
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,040
like, okay, time.

655
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
You can argue all you want about

656
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
shit that doesn't matter, like time,

657
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
is there a beginning of time?

658
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Sure, it's nice to know that

659
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
for textbooks and so we can know more about the world

660
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
so we can conquer it.

661
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,040
But that's the thing, I only care about that

662
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,040
because it will benefit me to know that

663
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
so I can destroy other civilizations

664
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
in my future.

665
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I only care about

666
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
things that will impact me.

667
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
And I only care...

668
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
There's no reason for me

669
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
to care

670
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
about the highfalutin

671
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
concepts in life.

672
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
There's no reason to get bogged down

673
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
in the minutiae.

674
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
This isn't exactly what we were just talking about,

675
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
but I bring this topic up a lot

676
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
and I don't go into it too often,

677
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
but I would argue to you

678
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
I think there is an excellent case to be made

679
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
that you in fact have

680
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
literally no control

681
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
over your life.

682
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
You have zero control.

683
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
You are simply an automaton acting upon biological

684
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
impulses that are just physical

685
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
reactions to things.

686
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Everything you think you're doing in your life

687
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
is not actually you. You're not accomplishing

688
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
anything.

689
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
You are a witness to the events happening

690
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
in your body.

691
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Are you talking about free will or what are you saying here?

692
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Free will. This is about free will.

693
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
Yeah.

694
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Sure, I agree.

695
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,040
All of our actions are based on

696
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
what we have learned.

697
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
But here's the thing about real metism.

698
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Basically,

699
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I operate on

700
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
a language

701
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
I don't know how to describe it.

702
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,040
I operate on good enough.

703
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Like JavaScript language or Python?

704
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I run on C++ actually.

705
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm looking for a degree here.

706
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
It's good enough

707
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
to say that there is free will.

708
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Because everyone will know

709
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
what you mean by free will.

710
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I can move my arm.

711
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I'm not limited by a government

712
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
kind of robot.

713
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I can do that.

714
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Me and Victor have been on this weird

715
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Cold War argument across our different

716
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Digi Bros. playthroughs about free will.

717
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
Where he's trying to argue that free will

718
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
is real and I'm trying to argue that it's not.

719
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
But we're really arguing two different layers

720
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
of the problem.

721
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
I'm arguing it on a

722
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
metaphysical or whatever level.

723
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
What's the word I'm looking for?

724
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Philosophical level.

725
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,040
He's arguing it on a

726
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
everyday life.

727
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Oh my god, let's decide

728
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
what your life is level.

729
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
The only thing that you can

730
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
The only thing that can be

731
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
determined by

732
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
free will, yes, no,

733
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
is what happens when time

734
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
travel is invented. If you go back

735
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
and there's no free will.

736
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
When?

737
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Can you change the future

738
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,040
and do timeline offshoots exist?

739
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
If free will will determine

740
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
whether that is how time travel works

741
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
or if it's the other way

742
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
it'll be a different way.

743
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
It will settle that question.

744
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
When you say

745
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
your atoms will not go together

746
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
and when you're touching something

747
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
you're not really touching it.

748
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
It's good enough to say that you are touching it.

749
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
That works for you because

750
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
you are a human and your eyes can't zoom

751
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
in that big.

752
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
You don't have that big telescope

753
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
in your brain.

754
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
That question could be useful.

755
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
I'm not saying that it doesn't

756
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
deserve to exist or that we shouldn't

757
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
research the sciences. I'm just saying

758
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
for all intents and purposes

759
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
for my daily life

760
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I don't need to know that.

761
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
I need to know that in case I am a physicist.

762
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
In order to live a human life

763
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
I want to say that things matter

764
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
and the only

765
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
things that do matter to me are the things

766
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
that I can observe as a human.

767
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
That's such a limited amount of information.

768
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
No, but that's what I'm saying.

769
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
You don't need to understand anything

770
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
in order to determine whether something matters

771
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
or not because it's totally a matter of opinion.

772
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Let's get over that.

773
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Matters of opinion are only things that

774
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,040
are human.

775
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Imagine you're at a party

776
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
or at some place and you're talking to a guy

777
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
and you don't know who he is

778
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
and

779
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
there's conversations that come up and you're like

780
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
did you know I'm touching this?

781
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
He's like yeah, that's true.

782
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
I like that one.

783
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Because it's not annoying.

784
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
But if he starts going

785
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I will actually atom some bullshit

786
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
and I'm like I just don't like you now.

787
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
You've ruined this friendship.

788
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I want to state by the way

789
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
while this has been going on

790
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I still like you hippo, so there.

791
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
While this has been going on I decided

792
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,040
I'm not a nihilist.

793
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
I am actually an absurdist

794
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
and I don't think that's actually

795
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
a thing people call themselves.

796
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
It's actually just a genre of fiction

797
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
but it's a better description because

798
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
I feel like nihilism

799
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
believes that

800
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
there just is no meaning

801
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
but absurdism is about

802
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
how humans can't find meaning.

803
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Like that maybe there's meaning

804
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
but there's no

805
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
possible way that humans could ever understand it.

806
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
There can't be meaning

807
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
outside of a conscious

808
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
being that determines me.

809
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
That's just nihilism with a clown afro.

810
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Why can there not be meaning outside of

811
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Well, because like I've been saying

812
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
like I've been saying this whole time

813
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
meaning is just an opinion

814
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
You need to be a living thinking thing

815
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
in order to have such an opinion.

816
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Are you telling me that if a tree falls

817
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
in the forest and no one's around to hear it

818
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
it does not make a sound?

819
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Well, I mean

820
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
I see what you're saying

821
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
and I think it depends on what you mean by sound.

822
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
If you mean the physical

823
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
sensation of hearing a thing

824
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
then no, but if you mean

825
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
the concussion of the airwaves then yes.

826
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah, the

827
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,040
the vibrations of the tree

828
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
falling down will damage the tree

829
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
and then that will be

830
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
like you go and record it

831
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
like oh this tree has like sound wave

832
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
damage we can tell

833
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
use this new technology

834
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
to hear how this tree fell.

835
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Has it not reached the sound until it's been observed?

836
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Well, if there's a way in the future

837
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
there's like a special gadget

838
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
that can like scan

839
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
the vibration thing

840
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
of like a tree.

841
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I don't know, I want to go here

842
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
alright?

843
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
If there's a gadget that can like scan

844
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
a tree to see how

845
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
like the vibrations have affected it

846
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
we can hear the trees like

847
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
ear, like what it heard

848
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
we can hear

849
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
what the tree is

850
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
and that would be fucking sick.

851
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Yeah, like you're saying we could measure

852
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
the effects, the past effects

853
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
of a tree having fall.

854
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
If a tree fell through a vacuum

855
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
and made a sound.

856
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
How does it benefit the universe to have meaning?

857
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
There's no reason for the universe to have meaning.

858
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Yeah, no, there's no reason.

859
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
Meaning is for humans to want things.

860
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
We don't know that, what if there's something beyond

861
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
the universe that has its own

862
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
why would you assume that?

863
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Possibly know what that is though.

864
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
That's what I'm saying

865
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
like absurdism, it's where you can't

866
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,040
you just can't possibly know

867
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
because it's hard.

868
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,040
You have no reason to believe exists

869
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
if you're asserting that that's real.

870
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
I mean are you talking about some

871
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
like extra dimensional aliens basically?

872
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Possibly or anything

873
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
like it's beyond

874
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
beyond my ability to imagine

875
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
is what I'm saying. Well I think that

876
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
yeah, well they might be different

877
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
I think like fundamentally they have to be

878
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
similar to us and that they have to be conscious

879
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
of thinking beings in order to have meaning.

880
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Why? Why? I don't agree with that.

881
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Because meaning itself is a concept

882
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
we have made up for a thing that we decided

883
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
that we wanted so like meaning as we

884
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,040
understand it can only arise from like

885
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,040
a similar consciousness.

886
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
I can believe

887
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
I can believe and agree with the idea

888
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
that we can't know where the homestuck is real

889
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
but I would like to know.

890
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
So the term meaning

891
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
is it accurate to say the term meaning

892
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
is really defined in sort of like

893
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
as the biological organisms are

894
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
we have biological imperatives

895
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
and we've sort of defined the word meaning

896
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
based on our desires and urges

897
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
as the creatures that we are

898
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
and like what we want to accomplish.

899
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Is there anything beyond like what else could there be?

900
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
How else could you define what that means?

901
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
To change the subject slightly

902
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
I want to know if anybody else has this experience.

903
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Do you ever have moments

904
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
where you like you're having

905
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
too good of a time

906
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
and you start to wonder

907
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
if you are actually

908
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
like this is all hallucination

909
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
like you actually lost your mind a couple years ago

910
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
and you're

911
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
you're sure.

912
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
No, I'm not quite that drastic.

913
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
Sometimes when I'm

914
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,040
with my girlfriend

915
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I wonder if she's just a real doll

916
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
that I've convinced myself is human.

917
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
That's adorable.

918
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
And true.

919
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
What if

920
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
everyone's just humoring me

921
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
like

922
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
What if I'm convincing

923
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
ventriloquist.

924
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
That's where

925
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Occam's razor is easy to

926
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
utilize.

927
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
It's be a lot of work for everyone to like

928
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
placate you and make you think.

929
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
What if I'm just an insane person hallucinating

930
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
everything in insane detail.

931
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
What if I'm just in a mental

932
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
facility.

933
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Occam's razor is a useful tool

934
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
for deciding what's like

935
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,040
helpful, but it's not

936
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
a way to arrive at truth.

937
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
You don't determine anything

938
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
objective by applying Occam's razor to it.

939
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
But technically we could all be

940
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
we could all be aliens

941
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
playing different versions of Roy at the moment

942
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
is the idea.

943
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
That's correct.

944
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I hope that that's true so bad.

945
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Because then I can wake up and be like oh yeah

946
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
a blurb blarp.

947
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
In the event that we are all a simulation

948
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
would you still say that we think therefore

949
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
at least on a functional

950
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
level.

951
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
In this scenario

952
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
where you're just an insane person like begging your head

953
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
against a wall in an insane asylum.

954
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
And none of you are real.

955
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
For all intents and purposes this is real.

956
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
This is the same thing with the simulation

957
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
like Matrix World.

958
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Does it matter that it's not real because you're

959
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
experiencing all these emotions and feelings

960
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
in real life.

961
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Functionally and for all intents and purposes real.

962
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
You know what this touches on.

963
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
It really matters.

964
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Objectivity doesn't exist.

965
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
That is true.

966
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
Let's talk about this for a second.

967
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
There are some things that are objective.

968
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Just throw that out there.

969
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
When it comes to what we experience

970
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
our whole perception of the universe

971
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
and everything we know just comes

972
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
through the crude matter of our

973
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
senses and what we can observe

974
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
and what we can process into our brain through our eyes

975
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
our taste buds

976
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
our nose. Most importantly our dicks.

977
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
All these things.

978
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,040
None of them are perfectly reliable

979
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,040
ever. All the time we hear stories

980
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
of people who are hallucinating

981
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
so none of these are 100% reliable.

982
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
So all of this shit

983
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,040
could totally be fake.

984
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Sure.

985
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Ben you say some things are objective.

986
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
Approve it.

987
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
The existence of your mind.

988
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
2 equals 4?

989
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
That's objectively true

990
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,040
because we've defined those terms

991
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,040
into each other in a way that's just

992
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
a function of the system of math that we've created.

993
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
So that's definitionally true.

994
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
But outside of definitions

995
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,040
and things like that

996
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,040
like fucking

997
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,040
Descartes and all that shit.

998
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
The existence of the self.

999
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Descartes and all that shit.

1000
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
It's a fucking old hat at this point.

1001
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
I want that as an overheard conversation

1002
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
in the background of a party

1003
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
in Rick and Morty or something.

1004
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,040
Descartes and all that shit.

1005
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
So for you could be being fooled

1006
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
and all the things you believe are true could be false

1007
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
but for you to believe those false things

1008
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
you have to exist in some form

1009
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
in order to believe them.

1010
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
The existence of the self

1011
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
even if the things that you think you're experiencing

1012
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
are not as you believe they are

1013
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,040
the experiences themselves are real.

1014
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,040
But it's only true from

1015
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,040
only you can prove to yourself

1016
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
that you are experienced.

1017
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
We are currently proving to everyone

1018
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
other than ourselves that they are real

1019
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,040
but to us we are proving we are real.

1020
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
I would argue that if you all are in fact real

1021
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,040
which I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt

1022
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,040
and assume that you are.

1023
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
But if you are real and experiencing consciousnesses

1024
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
then your consciousnesses

1025
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,040
and your experiences are objectively real

1026
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
if they are indeed occurring.

1027
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
If I write a character

1028
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,040
and I write them in such a depth

1029
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
as though they had full

1030
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,040
conscious thought

1031
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
like what if we are just

1032
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
characters

1033
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
I write down that with the Japanese Juggalo

1034
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
and he is living with me right now

1035
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040
I can look at him right now

1036
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,040
so I proved your point.

1037
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
I don't see how you can get around the idea that you have to be real

1038
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
you have to exist to experience something.

1039
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
You could program a cyber brain

1040
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,040
right?

1041
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
Like what if we're all just going

1042
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
through all the subroutines we've been programmed with?

1043
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Which we are.

1044
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
That's what a mind is

1045
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
that's what a brain is

1046
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
that would be

1047
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
we're all made of stuff.

1048
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
The constant

1049
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
with all of this

1050
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
the thing that is always true

1051
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,040
and the most objective thing

1052
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,040
it is the biggest

1053
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
waste of time ever

1054
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,040
to talk and think and ponder about this

1055
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
because it always comes back to

1056
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,040
well I guess it might be

1057
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
That's what you think until now we discover

1058
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
like they didn't gun buster how to use dolphins

1059
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,040
to travel through space

1060
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,040
to travel through space

1061
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,040
to travel through space

1062
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
when we get them dolphins hooked up boy

1063
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
but how can mirrors be real

1064
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
if our eyes aren't real

1065
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
on that exact quote

1066
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,040
the objective truth shouldn't be pursued

1067
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
just for normal instances it's retarded

1068
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
this is what I was trying to get to before

1069
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
I talk about how

1070
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
the things that we observe we can't guarantee

1071
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
that any of that is real or true

1072
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
like is my color blue the same as what you see as the color blue

1073
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
what the fuck knows there's no way to prove it

1074
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
what I would say is that I believe

1075
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
dude hold on real quick

1076
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
you brought up that Vsauce thing

1077
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
and I didn't even need to bring up Vsauce

1078
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
Vsauce doesn't have a patent on that

1079
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,040
Munchy said Vsauce

1080
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,040
and when I saw that Vsauce video

1081
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
it had pissed me off so much

1082
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,040
because they presented that like it was this really mind blowing

1083
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
concept and I literally

1084
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
just thought that on my own when I was 10

1085
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
I mean I think everyone does

1086
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
what if your blue's not my blue

1087
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
and I was like dude what if your blue

1088
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,040
isn't my blue

1089
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
and I was like are you fucking serious

1090
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,040
oh that blue is in my mind

1091
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,040
and that was why I never watched Vsauce again

1092
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Vsauce is just for babies

1093
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,040
it is

1094
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
I was thinking that as a baby

1095
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
I was thinking that as a baby

1096
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,040
it's the first thing I fucking said

1097
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,040
I just slid out the womb

1098
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
I said that color is probably

1099
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
different for you

1100
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,040
I literally remember having that

1101
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,040
realization and conversation

1102
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,040
right after watching The Matrix 2

1103
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,040
like me and my family were in a denny's

1104
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,040
after watching The Matrix 2

1105
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
and I was talking to Victor and I was like dude

1106
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
what if your green's not my green

1107
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Matrix 2 much regarded as the most

1108
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,040
intellectual of The Matrix series

1109
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
but anyway

1110
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
one time I had food poisoning

1111
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
I was at my friend's house and then

1112
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
the dad came over and they were like hey are you alright

1113
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,040
I was like yeah but I don't understand

1114
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
why can't I switch to the third person like I can

1115
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
in video games

1116
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
why are my eyes in this position only

1117
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
why can't I see behind me

1118
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
it's a real thing I actually said

1119
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
while I had food poisoning that's not a joke

1120
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
I like that

1121
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
so

1122
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
this is the thing that I believe

1123
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
even though I actually don't have any

1124
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
concrete proof that it is true

1125
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
but I believe that there is a

1126
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,040
highest level

1127
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
an objective true

1128
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
world

1129
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
would be in a simulation easily

1130
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
let's say I'm in The Matrix

1131
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
we're up one level from that

1132
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,040
we're looking at my body in a pod or whatever

1133
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,040
so this is a higher level world

1134
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,040
and that stuff all looks true

1135
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
and even though the people up there

1136
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
are still perceiving everything with their eyes

1137
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
which makes it therefore objectively

1138
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,040
not the accurate representation

1139
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
exactly of what it really is

1140
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,040
as true as the Lord Jesus

1141
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,040
made it

1142
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,040
you can go up as high as you want

1143
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
through artificial world

1144
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,040
through data escape or whatever

1145
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
I'm talking about if you go all the way up

1146
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,040
to the highest one that there is

1147
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,040
I'm just saying this from an outsider

1148
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,040
you just know that this is as high as you can go

1149
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,040
if you know that that's true

1150
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,040
the buck has to stop somewhere

1151
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
it has to stop somewhere

1152
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
there has to be an upper limit to it at some point

1153
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
and

1154
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
even though the people on that level

1155
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,040
again they still have sensory organs

1156
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
probably

1157
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,040
perceiving things in the same way that's imperfect

1158
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,040
but on that top level

1159
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,040
the world that exists there

1160
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,040
that is the objectively real

1161
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
true world

1162
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
that is the one

1163
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
no one can experience that themselves

1164
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
but it is there

1165
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,040
and it is objective

1166
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,040
that is what I strongly believe

1167
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
even though I don't know it's 100% true

1168
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
to me that seems quite likely

1169
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
that that's the way things work

1170
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
here's my philosophy

1171
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,040
something may exist and all that

1172
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,040
all that jazz

1173
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,040
but getting a boner is pretty good

1174
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
so I'm going to do that over and over

1175
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
that's kind of

1176
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,040
that's real meatism

1177
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,040
that's real meatism

1178
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,040
that's a good segue

1179
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,040
that's a good segue

1180
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,040
I think this is a subject that

1181
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,040
in terms of nihilism a lot of people immediately jump to

1182
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,040
and it's like good and evil

1183
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,040
good and evil

1184
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,040
is it real?

1185
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,040
yes and I am both

1186
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
at once

1187
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,040
can we all agree

1188
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,040
immediately that good and evil

1189
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,040
have been defined by humans

1190
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,040
they're entirely based on our

1191
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,040
understanding of what we are

1192
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,040
here's my thoughts on that

1193
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,040
I strongly believe that

1194
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,040
saying that something is good

1195
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,040
is literally the same thing

1196
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,040
completely interchangeable

1197
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,040
linguistically

1198
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
with just saying that you like it

1199
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040
bad is literally the same statement

1200
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,040
as saying I don't like it

1201
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,040
that's what it boils down to

1202
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,040
people have tried to argue with me on this

1203
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
and I've never been convinced that this is wrong

1204
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,040
it explains everything

1205
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
we should just replace language with little emojis

1206
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,040
we should have a happy face

1207
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
when you're good

1208
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,040
yes

1209
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,040
angry face when you see a bad man

1210
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,040
you don't like him

1211
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,040
I want to be able to downvote people in real life

1212
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,040
and things and interactions

1213
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,040
I'm gonna pee so bad

1214
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,040
I'm so sorry

1215
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,040
forgive me

1216
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
dude

1217
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,040
it could be like bronicon

1218
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,040
you could have like a little thing around your neck

1219
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,040
and if you're happy

1220
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,040
turn it around upset

1221
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
please do not approach me

1222
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,040
I'm upset

1223
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
I like how in real life you want to

1224
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,040
lay on yours around your neck to simulate

1225
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,040
what it feels like in your head

1226
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,040
when you can just use your face

1227
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,040
you've got a fucking reins attached to his face

1228
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,040
that's what I liked about

1229
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,040
bronicon

1230
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,040
when are we going back? when

1231
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,040
as soon as possible

1232
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,040
so

1233
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,040
I'm gonna camp outside bronicon to get the new

1234
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,040
iPhone

1235
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
like horse

1236
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
are we done talking about Niles?

1237
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
I've got one more point I want to make here

1238
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
so Ben was saying all that bullshit

1239
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
that I don't care about

1240
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
but

1241
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
like originally

1242
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,040
the first life form that came to exist on earth

1243
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
was functioning based on purely like

1244
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,040
attraction versus repulsion

1245
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,040
like attraction toward food

1246
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
in whatever sensory organs it had to do that

1247
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,040
and then repulsion from like probably things like danger

1248
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,040
or yeah like danger

1249
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,040
would probably be the only thing which is

1250
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,040
it all just boils down to like

1251
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,040
good, bad

1252
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
like I want to go towards this food

1253
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,040
I'm gonna go away from this shit I don't want

1254
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,040
and we're talking about like a single celled organism

1255
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,040
by touching it

1256
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,040
and then it just like tries to stay away from shit that'll

1257
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,040
like eat it or kill it or poison it or

1258
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
whatever the fuck

1259
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,040
so like I considering I think that humans are just

1260
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,040
you know that organism

1261
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,040
evolved and it kept evolving and evolving and eventually we've got human beings

1262
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,040
people think that like the system

1263
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,040
of morality that's in place you know

1264
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,040
like religious terms have been passed down

1265
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,040
but it seems to me all

1266
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
super easily explainable just in terms of

1267
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,040
again biological imperatives

1268
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,040
so I just want to make this super clear to people

1269
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,040
that good and evil

1270
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,040
I don't think is objectively

1271
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,040
true in any way but what I actually

1272
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
I actually have a little bit different from some people

1273
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
and I think that there sort of is an objectivity

1274
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,040
element to this

1275
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
which is that there are

1276
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,040
it's even a little fuzzy to say but there are

1277
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,040
basically objective truths

1278
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
in that like there are experiences that are

1279
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
like positive and negative for people

1280
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,040
like death

1281
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,040
not all the time but generally

1282
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,040
that it is like an objectively

1283
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
bad thing to do and I know I'm mixing generally

1284
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
and objectively but like death is

1285
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,040
objectively bad but what makes like

1286
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,040
life occasionally like less

1287
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,040
preferable to death is all like this terrible

1288
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,040
shit happening that that corrupts

1289
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,040
what life is supposed to be and like pleasure

1290
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,040
generally preferable to pain

1291
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,040
and so I really think this is my like hedonism

1292
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
shit I think it makes sense

1293
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,040
to like construct your life and your world

1294
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,040
in such a way that you maximize

1295
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
pleasure and minimize pain

1296
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
and that doesn't even mean like hooking yourself

1297
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,040
up to like a pleasure machine

1298
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,040
or just doing heroin all the time

1299
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,040
would it be like a maximize pleasure

1300
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,040
and minimize pain, asterisks

1301
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,040
unless you like pain

1302
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
if so that would just be pleasure for you

1303
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,040
it's like your thing

1304
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,040
but with a little asterisks like unless not

1305
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
unless different

1306
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
but see I'm taking this to the macro level

1307
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,040
because I don't even think it's just like

1308
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,040
if you're a nihilist I don't think it makes

1309
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
the most sense to just like or if you're a hedonist

1310
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
just being really pleasured all the time yourself

1311
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,040
I would argue is not actually

1312
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,040
the most pleasure you can experience

1313
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,040
I would argue that you're missing all kinds of stuff

1314
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,040
that you can only expand maybe if we develop

1315
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,040
high level artificial worlds

1316
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,040
I'm back everybody, everyone stop the fucking presses

1317
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,040
I'm back

1318
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,040
I think I'm fucking

1319
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,040
like the idea that you can't have

1320
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,040
pleasure for like

1321
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
if you have pleasure then you don't know

1322
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,040
what pleasure is

1323
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,040
and you have to have a bit of un-pleasure

1324
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,040
I think this human brain

1325
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,040
does that automatically

1326
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,040
like I don't think

1327
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,040
the human mind definitely

1328
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,040
has a quick drop off of like if you accomplish

1329
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,040
your life goal in a week

1330
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
you're going to be bored of it you're going to want to do some other shit

1331
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,040
like it's built to

1332
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,040
like unless you're literally pumping yourself full of drugs

1333
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
that's how it incentivizes progress

1334
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
even then drugs lose their

1335
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,040
effectiveness

1336
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,040
happiness is a journey

1337
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,040
happiness is not a destination because

1338
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,040
if it's a destination you'll get there

1339
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,040
and then you won't be happy anymore and the way to be happy

1340
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,040
is to structure your life so that you always

1341
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,040
have a goal to be working towards

1342
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,040
that's what I believe

1343
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
it will be great because we'll always be happy no matter what

1344
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,040
there's no way you can ever be fully bored

1345
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,040
you can just keep doing things

1346
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,040
happiness is my penis

1347
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,040
and see that's why

1348
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,040
that is where this hedonism

1349
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,040
and like humanism intersect

1350
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,040
there is no reason to not

1351
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,040
just act in a way to like maximize

1352
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,040
pleasure in your life but it is not

1353
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,040
maximizing pleasure in your life to just literally

1354
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,040
go around like murdering people for fun

1355
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,040
and then like

1356
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,040
cause like that will your life will end very

1357
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,040
quickly and unpleasantly if you just go around

1358
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
doing that and then like doing drugs like

1359
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,040
you'll die very soon you got to maximize

1360
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,040
in the long term

1361
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,040
not a lot of people want

1362
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,040
then their pleasure is to do the things

1363
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,040
that they want to do

1364
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,040
in the case

1365
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,040
they're being short-sighted

1366
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,040
in the case that somebody likes murdering

1367
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,040
it would be in their best interests

1368
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,040
to just be really really smart

1369
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,040
murder as many people as possible and never get caught

1370
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,040
that's how they do that

1371
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
what if murdering one person

1372
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,040
would bring me more happiness

1373
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,040
than the entire

1374
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,040
lifetime of things that would

1375
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,040
ever make me happy will

1376
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,040
even if I got shot right after killing somebody

1377
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,040
I would be

1378
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,040
happier it would be more worthwhile

1379
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,040
than having lived my whole life

1380
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,040
there is no logical argument I can make to say that you shouldn't do that

1381
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,040
but I don't think that's

1382
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,040
very com-likely

1383
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,040
and of course like this

1384
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040
and the other thing is like if this person

1385
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,040
should keep in mind that like okay if everyone

1386
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,040
acted like this society

1387
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,040
would collapse and then you know other people

1388
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,040
wouldn't have the opportunities to do these things

1389
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,040
I doubt a murderer cares about Star Trek

1390
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,040
why a murderer can still be logical

1391
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,040
no no no we're talking about a logical murderer

1392
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
who just understands this one thing about themselves

1393
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
well here here's the thing I think

1394
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,040
I think the fact that that can't happen

1395
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
people are too scared to assume

1396
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,040
that's what will happen like

1397
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,040
if I kill this guy I'll never be as happy

1398
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
as if I kill this guy they don't know that

1399
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
for sure unless they're completely

1400
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
insane and like you can't

1401
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,040
have a logical person

1402
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
decide to kill a person

1403
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
that's not true because they don't know

1404
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,040
what's in the future they may be like

1405
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
well it's probably

1406
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,040
it's like a bad gamble I'm not gonna take it

1407
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,040
if I have a sister

1408
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
and like she is getting like beaten up

1409
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,040
terribly by like her boyfriend

1410
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,040
and like she is like fully indoctrinated to think

1411
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
that like oh no it's all okay but like

1412
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,040
she's getting her worse and worse hurt and then like

1413
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,040
it seems like like he's just gonna end up killing her one day

1414
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
like he's got a jail work and she just will not leave him

1415
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,040
there is a logical reason

1416
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,040
to just go and kill this man

1417
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,040
to like to kill him to like save someone

1418
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,040
there is a reason to do that sort of thing

1419
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,040
I don't know about it

1420
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,040
but whatever she won't press charges

1421
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
like it can't be done I'm talking about

1422
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,040
a logical argument

1423
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,040
I can construct a scenario

1424
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,040
where murder is reasonable

1425
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,040
correct

1426
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,040
I'm just saying someone

1427
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
whose pleasure is

1428
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
the inherent destruction of society

1429
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,040
by removing society from

1430
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,040
being real because there are no more humans left

1431
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,040
by killing people

1432
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
I don't think he's too concerned

1433
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
one two watch the world

1434
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,040
bird there are clap emojis in between

1435
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,040
all those words everybody

1436
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
are we gonna move on to questions now

1437
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
I've heard enough

1438
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
I was in the middle of a point and you just memed all over me

1439
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,040
go ahead

1440
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,040
go ahead

1441
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,040
I'm just saying I don't think those people

1442
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,040
are too concerned about like the society ramifications

1443
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,040
like if everyone did this then there would be no more

1444
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,040
then they are short sighted

1445
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,040
because no one else is

1446
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,040
first of all that's not what is occurring

1447
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,040
Nate's trying to argue about

1448
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,040
like what is and is not like the most

1449
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,040
like the most like consistent

1450
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
logical system not about

1451
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,040
like what people should actually

1452
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,040
do or like what they will actually

1453
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,040
like lead people to

1454
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,040
like yeah this is not

1455
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
totally logical I understand that

1456
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,040
Nate's trying to argue for like in a perfect world

1457
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,040
everyone would think this shit through and come to

1458
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,040
like a well reasoned conclusion

1459
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,040
right I guess

1460
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,040
in a perfect world everyone would do the Macarena

1461
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,040
at all times at the same time

1462
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,040
everyone would do the Carmen

1463
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,040
dance or however you smell it

1464
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,040
it could cause million dance

1465
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,040
yeah it would be like

1466
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,040
you do the

1467
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,040
you do the

1468
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,040
yeah yeah

1469
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,040
the one where it's like you put your

1470
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
fucking hands up to your head and you do the

1471
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
caramel dancing

1472
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,040
that's how real smooth

1473
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,040
I'm doing it right now

1474
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,040
I'll do it

1475
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,040
alright I've heard enough big words

1476
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,040
and big converts

1477
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,040
yeah anyone

1478
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,040
it's a cool thing

1479
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,040
it's true except for the ontological

1480
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,040
except for the ontological

1481
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,040
except for the ontological kind all the other

1482
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,040
kinds are true there you go

1483
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,040
my ending

1484
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,040
statement on nihilism is that

1485
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,040
now that you've heard us talk about it

1486
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,040
there's no reason to ever put it in the comment section

1487
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,040
so don't comment

1488
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,040
my opinion is hashtag

1489
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,040
real meetism join me

1490
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,040
and believing that the only thing that matters

1491
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
is that humans do

1492
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,040
and I would say this is important to me

1493
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,040
wait I'm a nihilist and a real meetist then

1494
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,040
okay

1495
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,040
I don't limit myself to just one box

1496
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,040
yeah yeah yeah

1497
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,040
I would say nihilism is true

1498
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,040
but there is absolutely no reason you can't still

1499
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
be a humanist and get some of that

1500
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,040
hashtag weird utilitarianism going on in your life

1501
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,040
so don't be afraid

1502
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
I agree with literally everybody

1503
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,040
okay everything they just said

1504
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
all right

1505
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,040
let's get to some questions

1506
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,040
if you want to get your question read

1507
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
donate to PCP patreon

1508
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,040
you can go to the patreon lounge

1509
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
where we talk to all of our bestest

1510
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
fans

1511
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,040
it's a discord chat

1512
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,040
it's not a lounge

1513
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,040
it's not actually the chas

1514
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,040
well not yet at least

1515
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,040
until we set everything up

1516
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,040
and also

1517
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,040
we read less of these these days

1518
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,040
let's get on the off chance

1519
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,040
submit one to the twitter

1520
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,040
using hashtag askpcp

1521
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,040
let's get our designated for question

1522
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,040
out of the way

1523
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,040
here's our infinity rise one

1524
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,040
asks how do you find a motivation to live

1525
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,040
if the goal that keeps you going

1526
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,040
seems impossible

1527
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,040
find a better goal

1528
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,040
that's tough

1529
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,040
if it seems to be

1530
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,040
actually easy

1531
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,040
does it seem impossible

1532
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,040
because if it just seems impossible

1533
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,040
but it is possible

1534
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,040
don't stop

1535
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,040
if it is actually impossible

1536
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
then give up

1537
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
imagine that

1538
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
the thing is like a little like a bouncy toy

1539
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,040
in front of you and then like get your magnifying glass

1540
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,040
and like look at the individual atoms of it

1541
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,040
and then pick apart all the atoms

1542
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,040
one at a time and slowly after like a billion years

1543
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
you will have all the atoms of that

1544
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,040
spooky toy conquered

1545
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
and I think what you're saying is

1546
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
it's possible to break it down into the small components

1547
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,040
exactly

1548
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,040
I said it in a funnier way and I'm god basically

1549
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,040
that's great

1550
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,040
if you want to become like a beautiful

1551
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,040
thesbian world renowned

1552
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,040
like Kevin Spacey

1553
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,040
my hero

1554
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,040
then you know it might seem impossible

1555
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,040
but if you really

1556
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,040
bust your balls and do nothing but work towards it

1557
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,040
for 20 years

1558
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,040
maybe you'll get there might need some surgery

1559
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,040
if you're ugly you might need all kinds of shit

1560
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,040
well I would say that if your goal is to be

1561
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,040
like

1562
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,040
literally Kevin Spacey

1563
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,040
then like you might never get there

1564
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,040
but if you make a better goal

1565
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,040
that's like oh I want to like

1566
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,040
you know do the kind of things

1567
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,040
that my hero Kevin Spacey does

1568
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,040
then like you can start working towards that

1569
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,040
and that's achievable

1570
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,040
or if your goal is like

1571
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,040
I want to become rich and famous

1572
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
by the time I'm 25

1573
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,040
it's like well

1574
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,040
aim for the moon because even if you miss

1575
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,040
you're going to fall to the ground

1576
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,040
dead

1577
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,040
maybe

1578
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
from the patreon

1579
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
I was about to ask maybe's question god damn it

1580
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,040
fine do it fucking punk ass bitch

1581
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,040
I already have a list

1582
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,040
I wrote down the good ones

1583
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,040
copy pasting them

1584
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,040
anyway maybe asks

1585
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,040
are you the type of person who can separate the actions

1586
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,040
of an artist from their art itself

1587
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,040
or does the artist's personal life

1588
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,040
influence how you like their art

1589
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,040
the first one

1590
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
it depends

1591
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,040
I wish I could separate it completely

1592
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,040
but I really can't

1593
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,040
I think that I used to be able

1594
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,040
to separate it more but as I've come

1595
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,040
like I've come to

1596
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,040
I guess I've come to feel that like

1597
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,040
art is

1598
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,040
really just an extension of a person

1599
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,040
and so I don't

1600
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,040
think I really can anymore unfortunately

1601
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,040
I can still appreciate things

1602
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,040
but like I can't

1603
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,040
I can't fully separate

1604
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,040
in the one sense

1605
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,040
I would like

1606
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,040
I like the idea of just like enjoying art

1607
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,040
like oh did you know

1608
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,040
that that song you like was written by a

1609
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,040
peter far like well I don't care

1610
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,040
it's a good song but

1611
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,040
I will like if there's a horrible person

1612
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,040
that has made a thing

1613
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,040
I will do a little bit

1614
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,040
I still want to experience it because I like

1615
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,040
the thing but you know I'll pirate it

1616
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,040
I won't pay the money

1617
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,040
for that thing

1618
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,040
I'm not going to stop pirating Hitler artwork

1619
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,040
I decorate my abode with it

1620
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,040
exclusively but it's not about

1621
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,040
Hitler

1622
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,040
this isn't a Nazi thing what the fuck

1623
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,040
leave me alone

1624
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,040
I would say I don't I can't

1625
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,040
necessarily separate them

1626
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,040
but like I will still enjoy

1627
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,040
and consume art by terrible

1628
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,040
people if I think the art is good

1629
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,040
the only time that I won't

1630
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
is if it has to do with me

1631
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,040
personally

1632
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
because I'm in the kind of position where I've gotten into

1633
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,040
fights with a lot of

1634
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,040
artists and had people

1635
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,040
say things such as a certain

1636
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,040
my little pony musician who I was a really big

1637
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,040
fan of for a time who said

1638
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,040
don't listen to my music

1639
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,040
ever again and anyone who

1640
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,040
associates with Digi Bro don't talk

1641
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,040
to me so this artist who I was

1642
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,040
a really big fan of I cannot

1643
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,040
listen to even though it's been a long

1644
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,040
time now and now if I hear the songs

1645
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,040
I'm like alright

1646
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,040
you know I still appreciate

1647
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,040
why I liked this back then

1648
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,040
I probably wouldn't even get into it if I discovered it now

1649
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,040
you know but like there's a few

1650
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,040
artists like that and even on a lesser

1651
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,040
scale like one that was

1652
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,040
kind of a weird case is the

1653
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,040
rapper Milo who

1654
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,040
it's not that he did anything to me personally

1655
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,040
but he has a real problem with white people

1656
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,040
saying nigga and like

1657
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,040
he's like always on about it

1658
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,040
and I'm like

1659
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,040
you know that you're basically

1660
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,040
talking to me

1661
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,040
he doesn't have a problem taking like white

1662
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,040
people's money though when they buy his album

1663
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,040
yeah well he'll complain about like white people saying it

1664
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,040
at his shows and stuff and I'm like dude

1665
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,040
you're saying it on your fucking album

1666
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,040
how can we not say it at your shows

1667
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,040
if that's the case I think it would be

1668
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,040
more logically consistent to be like not okay

1669
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
with them even listening to the music because

1670
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,040
it's not for them in his mind it's like

1671
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,040
for these people or whatever

1672
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,040
the way I look at it is like there's no

1673
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,040
like if I like the person who's making

1674
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,040
it then I'll like the art there's like

1675
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,040
and you know vice versa it's just

1676
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
sort of like a modifier that I put on my

1677
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,040
enjoyment of the art itself like I

1678
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,040
consume like a comic and it's like

1679
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:30,040
a good thing that I like but it's made

1680
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,040
by a bad person that's not like an instant

1681
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,040
well I don't like it anymore it's just like

1682
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,040
like a debuff well and also

1683
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
like minus 25%

1684
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,040
sometimes I actually think the art can be

1685
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,040
enhanced by that being a bad person

1686
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,040
like I think so too very famously

1687
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,040
like control I'll delete my favorite

1688
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
webcomic well there's a black metal

1689
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,040
band called Bersam which is just

1690
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,040
a one-man band this guy Varg Vikerns

1691
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
who in the early 90s

1692
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,040
murdered the lead singer

1693
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,040
of another black metal band mayhem

1694
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,040
over a financial dispute

1695
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,040
he stabbed him 37 times

1696
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,040
and pushed him through a glass door

1697
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,040
he was in prison

1698
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,040
for like 15 years

1699
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,040
in Norway and

1700
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,040
he's out now but he's also like a hardcore

1701
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,040
nationalist

1702
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,040
and he's currently

1703
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,040
he is currently a daily vlogger

1704
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,040
by the way just by the by

1705
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,040
this like 40 something year old

1706
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,040
Xcon

1707
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,040
murderer well black metal

1708
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,040
superstar is now also

1709
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,040
a daily vlogger

1710
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,040
who talks about like nationalism and pagan stuff

1711
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,040
and

1712
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,040
pagan stuff yeah so and he lives

1713
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,040
in the middle of the card he lives

1714
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,040
like in the middle of nowhere in the woods

1715
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,040
and he's like a huge spur lord

1716
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,040
and he's got all these kids

1717
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,040
and he lives on like a farm he's great

1718
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,040
like in my opinion

1719
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,040
the music is enhanced because

1720
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,040
it's fucking black metal so like

1721
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,040
I want it to be evil

1722
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,040
and abrasive and wrong

1723
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,040
you know like I want

1724
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,040
to know that the guy who recorded this killed

1725
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,040
a guy you know that makes it even

1726
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,040
better that's that's

1727
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,040
why Nate wants all this Hitler

1728
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,040
all this all the all the paintings

1729
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,040
like it enhances the aesthetic

1730
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
experience I mean don't tell me that

1731
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,040
having a Hitler painting would like not be

1732
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,040
an amazing thing that would be so sick

1733
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,040
that would be the sickest thing ever

1734
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,040
that's literally why controversial things

1735
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,040
are really funny yeah

1736
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,040
because it's bad funny

1737
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,040
right so I think I think for all of us the answer

1738
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,040
I get a giggle every time I walk by my hitler portrait

1739
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,040
it's very fucking funny

1740
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,040
I think the answer for all of us is

1741
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,040
like generally yes though

1742
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,040
it like like it's not that we

1743
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,040
separate it per se but just that we can enjoy

1744
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,040
we can enjoy the content

1745
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,040
without necessarily

1746
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,040
contributing the the artists

1747
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,040
like it plays a part in

1748
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,040
our enjoyment I don't mean to harp on this

1749
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,040
just it just decided I don't mean

1750
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,040
to harp on this but like just just the Milo example

1751
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,040
that did you brought up like I'm just thinking about that

1752
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,040
like is it like okay

1753
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,040
so obviously that guy like has is writing

1754
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,040
music for like a specific group of people I like

1755
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,040
but he's selling it to everybody

1756
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,040
but like do you think if he could he would only

1757
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,040
sell to black people or something

1758
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,040
I mean on some level I think that might

1759
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,040
be the case because he has made like

1760
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,040
really exclusive tapes and stuff like that

1761
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,040
but I mean I don't

1762
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,040
think it's that I think a lot of it is more

1763
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,040
that he's expressing that sentiment not

1764
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,040
that it's like an absolute in his life

1765
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,040
but he does express

1766
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,040
like the sentiment in the lyrics of his songs

1767
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,040
and sometimes it can feel like an attack

1768
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,040
on me I just

1769
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,040
get behind that at all that logic I just don't follow it

1770
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,040
there's this one

1771
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,040
thing that I

1772
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,040
is like kind of relevant to this is

1773
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,040
there's this TV show called the Great British

1774
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,040
Bake Off where people bake is a competition

1775
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,040
that is serious

1776
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,040
do they get a baked as fuck dude

1777
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
yeah

1778
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,040
yes yes

1779
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,040
trolololo

1780
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,040
alright

1781
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
this is a show

1782
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,040
and it's great and the whole

1783
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,040
nation loves it it used to be on BBC

1784
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,040
and then the runners of the show

1785
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,040
asked the BBC for more money because it was raking

1786
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
in the viewers and the BBC said

1787
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,040
ah no

1788
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,040
so they left they just said fuck you we're going

1789
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,040
to channel 4 instead

1790
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,040
and people there was like a big hubbub

1791
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,040
like channel 420 you know what I'm saying

1792
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,040
trolololo

1793
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,040
we can't don't

1794
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,040
you're quite finished

1795
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,040
I'm finished for now

1796
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,040
okay

1797
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,040
channel 4 and there was like a big hubbub

1798
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,040
about like some of the presenters left and some of them stayed

1799
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,040
and the show was great

1800
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,040
it's still like exactly the same show

1801
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,040
and I love it but people were like

1802
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,040
oh I don't know whether I could

1803
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,040
you know betray the BBC

1804
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,040
and the presenters that I know and love to go

1805
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,040
and watch the same show just on a different channel

1806
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,040
like there was a

1807
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,040
everyone was talking about it and I just didn't get

1808
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,040
like and it's kind of the same sort of thing

1809
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,040
like the artist

1810
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,040
in this case is the producer of the show

1811
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,040
like they said oh he did a bad thing

1812
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,040
he left the BBC

1813
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,040
and it's like

1814
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,040
I don't know it's the same thing

1815
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,040
too much

1816
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,040
a lot of brand loyalism tied up in that

1817
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
exactly

1818
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,040
brand loyalism is the same

1819
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,040
as artists separation

1820
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,040
I don't even care if any of us try to answer this

1821
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
I just want to read this because it's so badly written

1822
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,040
it made me laugh

1823
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,040
I think it's just an honest mistake

1824
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,040
but Han Todd says

1825
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,040
sandwich slash restaurant

1826
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,040
if you have one

1827
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,040
they got like good

1828
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,040
good Philly cheesesteak sandwiches

1829
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,040
Sub Jarrod at Subway

1830
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
he's my man

1831
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:38,040
sandwich sandwich

1832
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,040
oh boy

1833
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,040
a sandwich sandwich restaurant

1834
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,040
a lot of little sandwiches

1835
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,040
between two pieces of bread

1836
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,040
and you're just biting into that motherfucker

1837
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,040
alright

1838
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,040
question

1839
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,040
this one I'm interested in

1840
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,040
because I think it could be different for everybody in here

1841
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,040
plastic gargoyle

1842
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,040
asks

1843
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,040
do you guys often experience people acting as though

1844
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,040
they're good friends with you based on their consumption

1845
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,040
of your content

1846
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,040
and what is your view on people treating consumption

1847
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,040
for creators content as a sort of analog

1848
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
for interacting with them

1849
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,040
well I'll just jump in and say

1850
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,040
that like I started

1851
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
me and Jackie started a discord not that long ago

1852
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,040
and it really took off

1853
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,040
and it's like really really active

1854
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,040
and I don't

1855
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,040
I mean people would send me tweets and stuff

1856
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,040
being like nice to me and I'd be nice to them

1857
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,040
but like it was not like

1858
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,040
friendship per se I don't know

1859
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,040
but like I actually have become like pretty good friends

1860
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,040
with a bunch of like these people in there

1861
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,040
but would you say that was based on the consumption

1862
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,040
like there's a difference

1863
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,040
to me because I have the same thing

1864
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,040
I also have a really active discord now

1865
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,040
for my Patreon

1866
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
when those people talk to me

1867
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,040
like we're

1868
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,040
I don't know they don't really act like we're all friends

1869
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,040
but like it's okay for me

1870
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,040
to me for them to like joke around

1871
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,040
because we have been talking

1872
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,040
like I know who they are

1873
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,040
there has been in the past times where people

1874
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,040
have come and been like

1875
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,040
not really a whole lot

1876
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,040
this isn't like a common occurrence but there have been times

1877
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,040
where people were like buddy buddy with me

1878
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,040
who I just don't know who they are

1879
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,040
and I'm like uh do you

1880
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,040
this happened a lot of brony con

1881
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,040
when people used to follow us around and stuff

1882
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,040
and be like real extra friendly when we were like

1883
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,040
I literally do not know

1884
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
who you are you know

1885
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,040
yeah stuff like that sucks

1886
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,040
but like I think really like when it comes to like

1887
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,040
just talking on like on a discord

1888
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,040
it's basically the same as

1889
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,040
meeting new people except them knowing

1890
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,040
your channel is just the icebreaker

1891
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,040
and you don't have to do any of that

1892
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,040
it is a great icebreaker and I will say

1893
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,040
in spite of how I just made that sound at conventions

1894
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,040
um

1895
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,040
I don't mind so much when people come up

1896
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,040
and like know a lot about me because I'm not surprised

1897
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,040
because in many ways

1898
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,040
it is pretty close to knowing me

1899
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,040
like I put out so much content

1900
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,040
and like express so much of my life

1901
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,040
that like

1902
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,040
the amount you I mean yeah there's

1903
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,040
tons and tons of my life that you don't see

1904
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,040
in the videos but a lot of that

1905
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,040
life is reported on in the videos

1906
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,040
you know so like if someone

1907
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,040
came up to me and they were like up to date

1908
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,040
going on with me that wouldn't surprise me

1909
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,040
or be weird I'd just be like oh yeah

1910
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,040
of course you know

1911
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,040
I usually have a pretty easy time jumping

1912
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,040
into in depth conversations with my

1913
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,040
fans at cons at first meeting

1914
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,040
like people I've never heard of but if they

1915
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,040
come up and they're like oh I watch all your content

1916
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,040
then we can just dive right into conversation

1917
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,040
you know the worst thing

1918
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,040
I mean I don't want to shit on anyone

1919
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,040
so you know but this just does happen

1920
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,040
is that

1921
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,040
you know people come up to you and say hey

1922
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,040
I really like your stuff or like in any

1923
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,040
situation online or off

1924
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,040
and you say oh thanks

1925
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,040
and then they sort of like

1926
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,040
feel like there's a rapport going

1927
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,040
there's like a conversation and they expect you

1928
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
to continue the conversation

1929
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,040
when they used to have a light board of me

1930
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,040
that kills me

1931
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,040
I still like I've got a couple of discords

1932
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,040
that I run and I will get messages

1933
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,040
or like friend requests from individual

1934
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,040
people and most people

1935
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,040
you know actually to be fair

1936
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,040
most people just know that like they shouldn't do that

1937
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,040
this is actually pretty rare

1938
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,040
I'm shocked how few friend requests

1939
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,040
I've gotten from my discord

1940
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
but I deny them all of course

1941
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,040
I've got like hundreds of people in there

1942
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,040
and I've only gotten like three or four friend requests

1943
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
I know I scroll this back right now

1944
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,040
I accept that shit man

1945
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,040
you don't know anything about these people

1946
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:28,040
yeah I do these are people that I've like talked to

1947
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,040
some of them I would accept the request

1948
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,040
from if they sent it but they haven't

1949
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,040
but like you know

1950
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,040
okay I'm looking I'm looking at

1951
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,040
I got a message right here that I'm just looking

1952
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
I'm not going to read it out loud

1953
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,040
it's a tiny bit personal

1954
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,040
but like I don't know who the fuck this person is

1955
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,040
and this person is like wanting me

1956
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,040
to like give them my time

1957
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,040
like hey let's talk

1958
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,040
who the fuck are you

1959
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,040
I get that literally every day

1960
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,040
and I don't

1961
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,040
ever respond to them

1962
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,040
but I don't know if that's the same thing as acting like my friend

1963
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,040
it's more like the requesting to be my friend

1964
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,040
alright stick with me here

1965
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,040
but I consider this a form of violence

1966
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,040
alright this is a form of violence

1967
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,040
you are attacking me with a conversation

1968
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
and you are

1969
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,040
there's no way I cannot waste a little bit of my time

1970
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,040
on dealing with this

1971
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
you are stealing my time for me

1972
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,040
even if it's just reading it

1973
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,040
this is not a serious

1974
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,040
I'm not seriously accusing anybody of this

1975
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,040
that goes a little like

1976
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,040
what this guy is asking about is more like

1977
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,040
acting like they're already your friend

1978
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,040
but that the idea of like

1979
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,040
asking to be my friend

1980
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,040
that happens all the time

1981
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,040
and sometimes the phrasing of it

1982
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,040
is super bizarre because it seems

1983
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,040
to assume on their part that I would

1984
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,040
be interested in them in some way

1985
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,040
like when I got recently

1986
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,040
and apologies if this guy happens to be listening

1987
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,040
but it was strange

1988
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,040
he said like what if we

1989
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,040
met up some time he was like hey

1990
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,040
I live in like a relatively near

1991
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,040
area what if we met up some time

1992
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,040
to see if we

1993
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,040
like are as similar as I think

1994
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,040
we are or something like that

1995
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,040
and I'm like why would I want that

1996
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,040
like who would ever want to hang out with someone

1997
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:10,040
similar to Digi bro that's just

1998
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,040
I mean I just

1999
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,040
why do like I'm not out in the market

2000
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,040
for like new friends right now

2001
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,040
like it's not something I'm like

2002
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
like the idea that somebody might be similar to me

2003
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,040
but he is Digi so fuck what you want

2004
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,040
like fuck what you want

2005
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,040
I've got the reason I have

2006
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,040
what becoming a friend

2007
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,040
with someone is like I have a discord too

2008
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:32,040
I think we all have discords

2009
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,040
on my discord it feels more like

2010
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,040
that I am just one of the other people

2011
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,040
in the discord and like people post

2012
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,040
things and talk about things and then I comment

2013
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,040
on them and I say silly things

2014
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,040
they say silly things it's just sort of like

2015
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,040
I'm a community with

2016
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,040
my community and that's like the best

2017
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,040
situation I'm not like a figurehead

2018
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,040
I am both a figurehead and that

2019
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,040
in mine like because

2020
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,040
I have a whole channel of just discussing my content

2021
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,040
and my content comes out all the time

2022
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,040
there's definitely a level of deference

2023
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,040
towards me in there but like

2024
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,040
to me the reason I

2025
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,040
have a big audience is that there's

2026
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,040
plenty of people like me

2027
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,040
you know like there's plenty of people who are similar

2028
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,040
enough to me that we can have a conversation

2029
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,040
so let's have a conversation here

2030
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
online that's what the internet's for

2031
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,040
you meet people who are kind of like

2032
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,040
you and you have some conversations

2033
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
like not every person who's anything

2034
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
like me is gonna make me be like

2035
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,040
oh well we gotta be best friends

2036
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,040
yeah and then like miraculously if you

2037
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,040
end up talking to someone and you just like are clicking

2038
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,040
and it's just like then like okay you know what

2039
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
we're hooking up let's let's do something on our

2040
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,040
own but I mean that was us basically

2041
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,040
that's exactly we are that that's correct that's correct

2042
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,040
so see that's that's how it happens it's gotta be

2043
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,040
a natural thing guys don't don't fucking friend

2044
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,040
me if we have not had a conversation just

2045
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,040

yeah I'm just I'm just go ahead and

2054
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,040

2057
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,040
all so all the podcast

2058
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,040
I'm just gonna delete them all they're all gonna be gone

2059
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,040
just put a high-pitched

2060
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,040
wine over all of your speech seconds

2061
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,040
in all the PCP so far okay

2062
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,040
it'll be like Marvel

2063
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,040
it's like slender man like

2064
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,040
like

2065
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,040
like slender man is near you

2066
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,040
you'll get sickness oh that sounds good

2067
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,040
we should make a let's literally make a channel

2068
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,040
that's called PCP minus munchie

2069
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,040
where we do that we just upload all the content

2070
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,040
there are people who would like to be

2071
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,040
really thankful for that

2072
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,040
and I fucking think that they should

2073
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,040
they should all get the fuck out of here

2074
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,040
we should make a channel called

2075
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,040
just munchie

2076
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,040
we should make a channel

2077
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,040
that's like PCP plus

2078
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,040
Marvel Hornets where we just all

2079
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,040
we just is Marvel Hornets but all of us are the different characters

2080
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,040
we should make a show we should make a show where munchie

2081
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,040
just literally bitches about my little pony

2082
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,040
content creators for like dozens of hours

2083
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,040
oh my god can you imagine

2084
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,040
we should just make a show

2085
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,040
where we read a homestuck

2086
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
week by week and then move through

2087
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,040
weekly munchie don't you ever

2088
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,040
fucking say that again munchie do not even

2089
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,040
speak of such an idea I don't want to hear about it

2090
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,040
alright alright here's one

2091
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,040
that I'm just going to answer really fast

2092
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,040
HappyD asks

2093
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,040
does slash will the PCP have a cap

2094
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,040
on the number of members yes

2095
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,040
the cap is the current number and it will never

2096
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,040
exceed this number again

2097
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
ever there is no

2098
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,040
reason it should or will ever

2099
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,040
happen you know honestly

2100
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,040
unless it's really festive

2101
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,040
unless it's really really festive like the mild point

2102
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,040
oh it's like a you know in an

2103
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,040
rpgs how you get like temporary party members

2104
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,040
who join just like the specific dungeon or something

2105
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,040
yeah maybe maybe a little

2106
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
yeah there might be some guests but there's no

2107
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,040
there will be another core

2108
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,040
member of the PCP again

2109
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,040
the number is going the number is only going

2110
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
down from here guys

2111
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,040
we're cutting corners

2112
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,040
I'm going to replace myself with Father Christmas

2113
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,040
I thought they meant like

2114
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,040
how many people are on each podcast like the limit

2115
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,040
to what they can record but I have no idea

2116
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,040
why would they mint that that no yeah

2117
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,040
yeah no that's already the case

2118
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,040
okay okay

2119
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,040
just theoretically

2120
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,040
it's possible but just imagine the gauntlet

2121
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,040
that the next person who's like a viable candidate

2122
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,040
to join will have to go to like the years

2123
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,040
the years of training

2124
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,040
the only way another person's going to join

2125
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,040
is if it is a case like Munchie

2126
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,040
where literally all of us have known

2127
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,040
and been friends with them for like three years

2128
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
and he had to prove his

2129
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,040
worth you know like

2130
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,040
investigator was everything I hoped

2131
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,040
it would be

2132
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,040
change the game

2133
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,040
he proved his worth

2134
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,040
with the lecture

2135
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
the parkour 291 lecture

2136
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,040
there's no doubt

2137
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,040
alright one last question

2138
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,040
no digit asks how would you optimize the PCP

2139
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,040
delete Munchie

2140
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
yeah

2141
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,040
and it's good

2142
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,040
the PCP is a chaotic

2143
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,040
blip in the system

2144
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,040
optimizing it would mean smoothing out the whole thing

2145
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,040
like smoothing out the wrinkles on the brain

2146
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,040
exactly oh my god

2147
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,040
yeah we don't want to be optimized we'll be deleted

2148
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,040
we will be removed

2149
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,040
I think if I was going to optimize the PCP

2150
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,040
obviously get everybody

2151
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,040
in one place

2152
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,040
which is what we already want to do

2153
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,040
once I'm in a room never just eat the key

2154
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,040
I think it would be

2155
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:26,040
easier for us to if we wanted

2156
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,040
to talk about like more topical stuff

2157
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,040
on the PCP it would be easier

2158
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
if we could all consume it together

2159
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,040
you know that's true like if we all lived in one place

2160
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,040
it'd be easy enough for us to all like

2161
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,040
go see a movie

2162
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,040
that just came out and then do a PCP on it

2163
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,040
right after this

2164
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,040
that would be pretty sick

2165
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,040
imagine the reputation

2166
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:48,040
that our gang would acquire at the local

2167
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,040
cinema place

2168
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,040
oh my god

2169
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,040
the PCB boys

2170
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,040
are rolling through again everybody

2171
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040
put your park is on

2172
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
there's about to be a jizz hurricane

2173
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,040
we would be ruffians

2174
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,040
we would be ruffians

2175
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,040
I think we're at

2176
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,040
we're at a

2177
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,040
point where we're probably like

2178
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
five or six months out from PCP

2179
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,040
headquarters starting to become a thing

2180
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,040
we're getting close

2181
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,040
and I think it's

2182
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,040
perfect timing because we can only

2183
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,040
stretch random ass

2184
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
weird esoteric concepts so far

2185
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,040
like as you saw this episode

2186
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
nihilism

2187
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,040
like this is a weird topic

2188
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,040
and you can only do so many

2189
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,040
nihilism podcasts

2190
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,040
you can only have so many

2191
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,040
you can only have so many podcasts that spiral straight

2192
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,040
to weird utilitarianism

2193
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,040
immediately and go there forever

2194
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,040
all roads lead back to weird utilitarianism

2195
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
this is clear

2196
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,040
it's the rock upon which the PCP

2197
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,040
rests

2198
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,040
from the beginning of the PCP I think we've been saying

2199
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,040
we need to have more specific media casts

2200
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:56,040
but there's nothing that all of us consume

2201
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,040
guaranteed enough

2202
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,040
that the rikstie minutes will pop up

2203
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
or Dark Souls 3

2204
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,040
rikstie minutes is the worst thing on this channel

2205
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,040
it's even worse than Armour Tree

2206
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,040
rikstie minutes was like

2207
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,040
significantly more popular than the PCP for its time

2208
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040
which was interesting

2209
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,040
Armour Tree was been out forever bro

2210
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,040
there's only one episode on this channel

2211
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,040
that's what I was saying

2212
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,040
the special

2213
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,040
I just want to read out this real quick

2214
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,040
this is just for me no one else can answer

2215
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,040
extra Pharisees if you could insert yourself into a movie

2216
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,040
that movie in Y

2217
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,040
a chindler's list

2218
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,040
but what?

2219
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,040
as in what?

2220
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,040
only the Germans

2221
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,040
is the protagonist that guy who played Voldemort

2222
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,040
who was the leader of the Nazi camp

2223
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,040
that's who I always empathize with

2224
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,040
it's really sad that he lost

2225
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,040
I actually want to ask this question

2226
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,040
I don't think this is a good question

2227
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:50,040
but I could be wrong

2228
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,040
because either this guy's a weirdo

2229
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,040
or there's more weirdos out there

2230
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
Pondedator2 asks

2231
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,040
how often do you think about speedrunning

2232
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,040
while you're playing a game

2233
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,040
for me it's pretty much constantly

2234
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,040
to the point that I almost can't think about games

2235
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,040
in other ways

2236
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,040
well that's fun

2237
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,040
is this the first time you play through a game?

2238
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,040
I mean I will say that

2239
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,040
occasionally when I'm playing a game

2240
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,040
if I see something

2241
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,040
that looks like

2242
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
something a speedrunner would use

2243
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,040
I would say oh that's obviously the speedrun tech

2244
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,040
like maybe once in a blue run

2245
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,040
that happens

2246
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,040
like every so often

2247
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,040
I think of a game and I'm like wait

2248
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,040
have I seen a speedrun of that game

2249
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:34,040
but that's like months or years after I played it

2250
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,040
I don't think about it at the time

2251
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,040
the fact that

2252
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,040
I am in the

2253
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,040
I'm in the midst of people

2254
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,040
who like speedrunning

2255
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,040
more than they like esports

2256
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,040
genuinely sickens me and ever since

2257
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,040
I've never been able to forgive any of you

2258
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,040
that's my opinion

2259
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,040
I don't know that I like speedrunning

2260
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,040
more than esports

2261
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,040
esports is just a lot harder to get into and follow

2262
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:00,040
I like speedrunning

2263
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,040
like a speedrun you just throw on a youtube video

2264
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,040
esports you have to like

2265
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,040
watch cool ass matches bro

2266
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,040
I don't even know where one matches

2267
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,040
watches a match of esports

2268
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,040
you fucking google it

2269
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,040
how do I know what matches are interesting

2270
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,040
you're good

2271
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,040
you got research

2272
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,040
you fucking watch Melee

2273
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,040
any day of your life

2274
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,040
just move Melee to Melee

2275
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,040
top 10 tournament

2276
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,040
I know Melee esports

2277
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,040
the last one I remember though

2278
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,040
is Hungrybox beating Armada with Jigglypuff

2279
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,040
and after that I felt like Melee's over now

2280
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,040
like we've done all we needed to

2281
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
that was all I wanted to happen

2282
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,040
and it happened and now Melee's over

2283
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,040
my friends back since college

2284
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,040
have been into the competitive league of legends

2285
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,040
scene just like following the

2286
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,040
the past

2287
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,040
disgusting

2288
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,040
I have never understood the appeal

2289
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,040
I have not once understood

2290
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,040
I get the appeal I'm just not interested

2291
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,040
leg of leg

2292
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,040
there was a brief period where I was subscribed

2293
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,040
to Thorin

2294
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,040
the guy who's like a

2295
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,040
esports commentator guy

2296
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,040
not a commentator but he makes videos about esports

2297
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,040
and all of his like broad concept

2298
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,040
videos explaining why esports

2299
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
are interesting were really cool

2300
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,040
and good but then he would like

2301
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,040
have like a video a day

2302
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,040
about actual esports and like

2303
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,040
they're all written in such a way

2304
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,040
that you need to know an incredible amount

2305
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,040
of information to get in

2306
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,040
like it's oh fucking

2307
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,040
sorry I was interrupting

2308
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,040
no it's just like I

2309
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,040
I don't even know the rules

2310
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,040
of the games that are being talked about

2311
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,040
enough to like much less

2312
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:40,040
the meta or the tech or the people

2313
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,040
you know like I'd have to

2314
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,040
like the only reason I know smash

2315
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,040
melee is because I watched that

2316
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,040
fucking four hour documentary about it

2317
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,040
and even that is considered like

2318
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,040
entry level you know

2319
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,040

2320
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:56,040
fucking Sal TV

2321

a TF2

2322
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,040
commentator esports guy I love

2323
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,040
that shit I love esports

2324
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,040
fuck you

2325
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,040
on this guy's question

2326
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,040
on the guy's question of

2327
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,040
speedrunning I'm playing a lot

2328
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,040
right now of

2329
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,040
of world renowned game

2330
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,040
for the Nintendo Switch Mario Odyssey

2331
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,040
that literally everyone agrees is a beautiful

2332
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:20,040
masterpiece with no attractive flaws

2333
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,040
of any kind

2334
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:24,040
and I do like I'm always

2335
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,040
playing that game to like optimize speed

2336
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,040
and I have actually researched like

2337
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,040
the optimal ways to place for like maximum

2338
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,040
height on jumps to like get to secret places

2339
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,040
and stuff and like there's a lot of races

2340
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,040
to do in the game so like I sort of

2341
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,040
think I know what he's talking about but

2342
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,040
I don't know it sounds like he's taking it to a higher level

2343
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,040
our Italians

2344
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,040
I just think it's weird that

2345
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,040
he would ask that question

2346
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,040
like clearly he's a

2347
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,040
speedrun guy

2348
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,040
like clearly he has a deep interest

2349
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:54,040
in speedrun so he thinks that way

2350
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,040
why would he expect anybody who

2351
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
doesn't speedrun constantly

2352
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,040
to think that way he knows none of us are speedrunners

2353
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,040
if he watches the PCP

2354
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,040
well we have done the races which is more than most people

2355
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:06,040
have done but like in all of those

2356
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,040
we make it very clear that this was like

2357
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,040
an intensively researched project

2358
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,040
for this one video

2359
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,040
you know that's true

2360
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,040
I don't think any of us has ever given the impression that we are speedrunners

2361
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,040
oh

2362
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,040
someone asked me a question directly

2363
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,040
they even added me don't do that but thank you

2364
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,040
and I just have to do this out of the kindness of my heart

2365
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,040
how many hats can you fill in your head

2366
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,040
depends on their size

2367
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,040
depends on the size of

2368
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,040
Munchie's head that day

2369
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,040
yeah yeah yeah

2370
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,040

2371
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,040

2372
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:40,040
and I have put four on my

2373
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,040
like actual hats

2374
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,040

2375
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,040
well wait

2376
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,040
wait what's a cap

2377
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,040
what does that mean

2378
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,040
I didn't say cap I said joke hat

2379
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,040

2380
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,040

2381
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,040
are you stacking them on top of each other

2382
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,040
cause that's easy I'm talking about next to each other

2383
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,040
on your head to create a full half sphere

2384
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,040
on the top of your head

2385
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,040

2386
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,040

and they've all been real tiny hats

2388
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
