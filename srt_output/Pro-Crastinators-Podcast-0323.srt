1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Cool.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Alright, let's just get right into it. Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm trying to be professional, and being professional is when you don't care about what you're doing.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, whatever, I guess it's The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I guess we're doing a show. I mean, I don't need it. I don't care.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've really got better things to be doing, but I'm on The Pro Crastinators Podcast and Gibbontake and Oblivionfall as well.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hi.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a little tipsy from earlier today.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, tell me about that.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's explore that.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, it was a meetup of the Agoonary people, a few Agoonary people at the pub the day after we finished camp for the week, which is why I was not here last week.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It was an Agoonary camp.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Would you like to explain that for anyone who, would you like, let me see the Twitter, would you like to explain what the Agoonary is for anyone who might have forgotten?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Agoonary is a scout camp for disabled children to go and have fun for a week with activities and scouty-ish things, but mostly just like low stakes fun activity stuff.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They sleep in patrol tents, they have a little patrol, and I go as a helper to help, and I apparently have been going for 11 years because I got a certificate this time.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Whoa.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it Boy Scouts related?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I mean, it's scout related.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's like, it's actually, this year was the 75th anniversary of a Goonary.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So there was a big deal about, oh, 75 years ago the first Agoonary happened, and it was, you know, because the Scouting Association, initially it was Boy Scouts.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It was a guy, a British guy, who'd invented scouting by saying, I think young boys would like to do things.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to invent that, and he did that.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Because he was in the Army.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's like, what if there was a low stakes like Army-esque thing for little boys to do so that they could feel like responsible and learn skills like tying a knot, making a campfire.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So he made that, and then the whole idea was to get to allow young people to have a sense of responsibility and autonomy and stuff.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So it expanded into Girl Scouts and all those other things, and then Agoonary was like, what about disabled kids?

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Surely we can make something for them?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And so they did, and that's been going for 75 years, and it's great.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a lot of fun this year.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Had a good time.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let me get that Twitter.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, show me the Twitter.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's a site as well, I guess.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, goodery.org.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You may be able to see me in photographs.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh my God, how embarrassing.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's so fun.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I may be doxing myself.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We're going to see you gooning.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're gooning.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to goon.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Apparently a bad word or something, I heard, I think.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To who?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not like a slur.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I occasionally get tagged on Twitter by someone who's taken a picture of Phalia, my big booby succubus,

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and they'll put text around her saying, are you a goon?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you going to goon?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you gooning right now?

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Live a life of gooning, and I don't know what it means.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm scared.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The only goon I know is someone on Something Awful.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's what the awful users call themselves.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh my God, give, I see you.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh no, where am I?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're only five or six posts down.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm going to kill baking.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It was a Scottish day.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, we made kilts, and all the kids got to make their own kilts, and did Scottish things.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There was a cabot toss, and we had black pudding, and haggis, something or other.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Like haggis-esque meat.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I had a haggis once.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've had a haggis many times. It's very nice.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I had haggis in like a...

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Spicy minced meat, sort of.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I had it in like a takeaway restaurant one time, and I ordered some over-the-counter

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
at like a haggis Taco Bell.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Damn.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you want to hear the origins of everyone's favorite transphobic slur?

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm just realizing if people from a goonery find out that I am on a podcast, and the only things

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the other two hosts have said so far is big boobies and transphobic slurs, I'm like, oh shit.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Maybe I shouldn't mix these cross these streams.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't know if it's technically a slur, but you know, that's where the word trune comes from.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's from goons who were trans, you know, people on something awful.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So they just combined it.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait, really?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, it was a neutral term at one point.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So wait, what is a goon?

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Someone on something awful.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Someone awful?

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know what the version of the word goon that I was referencing comes from, but it's probably also bad.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, I've never heard that before.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm gonna goon, like what the fuck does that mean?

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've never heard that.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think I found some urban dictionary, but it's like it's stewing in the coom or something.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know where the G comes from though.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Amazing.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't understand.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you go to this Twitter, do not mention me at all.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do not ever do that.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't let them know that this podcast exists.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm just saying, I saw some weird people using a similar word.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, it's fine.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's fine having like a podcast where we can say coom a lot.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I don't mention, whenever people at that place, because they know me, they've known me for a while,

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I talk about the things I do.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, I'm making a comic.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can show them my website.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, I'm making a game.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Show them that.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know, I'm doing this and that.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I never say my podcast ever.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Never would I ever subject them to knowing about the PCP.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is a hard line.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's fair.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's a good line to never cross, I would think.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yep.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm scrolling through more of the timeline here.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, this is a new thing.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Before the like social media, because a lot of the people who do...

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh my...

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
...Gunaria, huh?

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is not strictly relevant, but I just noticed the...

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Damn.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just noticed the frickin' minimalist modern reimagining of the Scouts logo.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The Flirterly.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, the Flirterly.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They got that too.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They got the fuckin' Scouts too, with that fuckin' modern minimalist corporate bullshit.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's...

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was looking at like the old programs.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was looking at the old programs, because every year there's like a little booklet you receive in the mail.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like, okay, meet here at this time to get on the coach to go to camp.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And here's what the...

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like, yeah, there's meat here.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You want to come over?

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And they have like the symbol of the Gunaria and the Scouts symbol,

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and then usually the symbol of the school or whatever campsite we're at.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And the more recent ones have this like really minimal Flirterly, and it's like, okay.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean, whatever.

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't care for it, but it's pretty...

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I like the purple color, but yeah, it's whatever.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The Gunaria style is iconic, though.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't minimize that, because it's just lines.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wait a minute.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait a minute.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You mean that logo?

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or you mean that on the bottom the...

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
On the bottom, the style is like a...

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Fence thing?

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a fence with like what's called a style,

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
which is like a smaller piece of wood meant to allow...

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
To help people climb over the fence if they're going on a walk,

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but animals wouldn't know how to use it.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So it's sort of like symbolic.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's like, yeah, we're helping people...

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Helping them over there.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Over the fence.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, I see.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hmm.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Confusing a double meaning of the word style there.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But, uh...

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know where it comes from, etymologically,

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but I think it's pretty stylish.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That sounds like something we should go down a whole rabbit hole

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
to discover.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, hell yeah.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm doing it.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I need more rabbits down my hole, if you know what I'm saying.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can just shove them in there, one after the other.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's a little abbreviated for one of my topics later.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I got a new pet rabbit, but I eat it with my butt hole.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're closer than you think.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's something I found, but I'll talk about it a bit later.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, on dictionary.com.

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't...

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, maybe it's not with a Y.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe it's S-T-I-O.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's what it is.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wait a minute.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Old English device for climbing or ladder

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to climb, Germanic steak to climb.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, so style with an I.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And that's where turnstile is from.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I get it.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Because it's similar, sort of.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, and you know what?

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Guess what?

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey, this is exciting.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, the style as in form of appearance,

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
design or mode type, whatever,

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
is from the Latin stylus.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, meaning a writing implement.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So, we've got one style from the Latin,

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
one style from the Germanic,

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and I've been watching a ton of videos this week

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
from a channel called Tolkien Untangled,

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
going into, like, deep lore of, like, Tolkien stuff.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so now I know that he would have preferred

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the fence meaning because he preferred Germanic words.

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He liked when English words had Germanic origins.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He didn't like when they had Latin origins.

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He thought that was stupid.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Lol.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, and he was right.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Isn't it funny how styluses and tablets

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
were a thing back in ancient Rome?

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, like ancient Greece or whatever.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't we talk about this on a podcast?

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think we did talk about the wax tablet.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, the wax, yes, the wax tablet

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that you could wipe but wipe down.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
With the stylus, which is just a stick.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They were making it full circle.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They were so close to inventing the Game Boy DS back then.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They had one half of it,

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
but they didn't get the other half until thousands of years later.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Ugh.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah, back then it was just called DS.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is why they died.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They made a Nintendo DS,

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
but they were like, hmm, what do we put in...

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do we put, like, a screen and microchips in this?

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or we could just fill it with wax.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, let's go with a cheaper alternative.

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think we'd be fine.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ugh, the gals are mad.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ugh, the Visigoths are angry.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We did that.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They wanted the new DS.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But if we spend all our freaking...

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What kind of currency did they have in Rome?

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like, drachma? No.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Coins?

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm actually kind of curious what the...

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think they definitely had coins in the printing mechanism.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They had coins, but...

240
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Oh, the gold aureus.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Aureus.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, okay, aureus.

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But if we spend all our aureus,

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you know, putting microchips in this tablet,

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
then we won't have any aureus left to spend on the grain doll.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then we're fucked.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With a grain doll as a cornerstone of modern civilization,

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and that was there, as always.

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Communism was their downfall, as with all great empires,

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so we know better.

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We know better this time.

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Their downfall was letting gay people fuck.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That destroyed everything.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Romans, one gay person fucked, the empire fell the next day.

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's what I learned.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because of the cum blast, it was too powerful.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It shattered all of the infrastructure.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's like we learned in that movie, the butterfly effect.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You know, one gay couple having gay sex across the world in China

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
can have ripple effects that spread throughout the entire world

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and cause a tornado in California.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's just...

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's just true.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's just the facts.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I was imagining, like, ancient Rome,

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
like, oh, I'm an artist.

267
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I have my Cintiq wax tablet

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
propped up on his stone marble desk.

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He's like, ah, yes.

270
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Drawing a thing.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You finished, and it's like, oh, well,

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know what to do now.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
New tablet.

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, my God, I just...

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I just learned.

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I literally just learned what Orish Alchem,

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
or Orahalchim, is.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Or a calcum.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, because I guess they made...

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I guess they made Roman orias out of it sometimes.

281
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I guess it's just some bullshit.

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In numismatics,

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
which I guess is the study or collection of currency,

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the term Orahalchim is used to refer to the golden-colored bronze alloy

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
used for the Cistercius and Dupondius coins.

286
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It is considered more valuable than copper,

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
of which the az coin...

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Az coin.

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The az coin was made, which was a bronze...

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They had fucking...

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They had too many coins.

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They're doing a stupid Harry Potter, like,

293
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
uh, bronze nuts and silver sickles and whatever.

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's too many. Just keep it simple, stupid.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't need all this garbage.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So wait, is Orahalchim like a mineral,

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
or is it just like a different percentage of something alloy?

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It says it's just an alloy,

299
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but it's a type of bronze,

300
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and it says it's golden-colored and it's a type of bronze,

301
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but it doesn't go into any more detail than that.

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, that's stupid.

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Those Romans should have wrote it down.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I guess we'll never know.

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's no way to determine these things.

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Uh...

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Man, so...

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, I've been watching a lot of those Tolkien videos.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
They're pretty good.

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I've also, last week,

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Simsie mentioned a channel called Explore With Us,

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
which is sort of, it's basically the same as Jim Can't Swim,

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and I watched a bunch of those.

315
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Those were wild.

316
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You know the kind of videos I'm talking about, right?

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Remind me, Jim Can't Swim.

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know if I've seen any of those.

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's like the Death Pig,

320
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
where they're interrogating Ben St.

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's like that.

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's exactly like that.

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, it's police interrogation videos,

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but they're paused and then...

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, this is why this guy's fucked right now,

326
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because he just lied on camera.

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, all the ones that I've seen

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
have less been about...

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They've less been focused on,

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
here's how we know he's lying,

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and more about this person is mentally ill.

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not so much about...

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I mean, there is some of that.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's like, yeah, what their body language is saying,

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
but a lot of the ones that I watched

336
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
have had mentally ill people or autistic people or something.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah, so it was like a guy who just admitted to the murder,

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and they could determine from the way he was just saying everything,

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and it was all factually accurate that he was insane.

340
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, the big guy with the long hair, right?

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I saw that one.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, that's the Jim Can't Swim.

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
These...

345
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Some of the Explorer with us...

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, they have the interviews with the freaking Slenderman killer girls,

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
the ones that stabbed their friend.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's fucking...

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, I've heard of that one.

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't take this the wrong way,

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but they're adorable.

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I love them.

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They killed their friend?

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
First of all, she didn't die. Let's not be hysterical.

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know the thing.

356
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I just heard that they stabbed someone because of Slenderman.

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah.

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, basically.

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They thought they could become his proxies or his puppets

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
or something and live in Slenderman.

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They wanted to prove themselves to him, so they went into the woods

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and they did some fucked up shit and they waited.

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, well, I've learned some things about it.

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It was not really in the woods.

365
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It was more in like a small little cops of trees in like a park.

366
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But they both...

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, my God.

368
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I was like...

369
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I had watched a bunch and then like before bed,

370
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
last night I started that one up and I was so engrossed in it

371
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
that I stayed up way too late.

372
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I watched all three hours of it.

373
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I could not stop watching it.

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They loved it.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They both...

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's these two girls.

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
One of them is schizophrenic

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and I think bipolar

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and the other one...

380
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm not sure if she was diagnosed with anything,

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but she was definitely not normal.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And they both basically seemed to think

383
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
that the other one was the one that really believed it

384
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and they were kind of like...

385
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No, that's not true.

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, no.

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, that's not true.

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, they both think the other one was the one telling them

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
they had to do it.

390
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Like neither one of them knows why they had to do it.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They both think that the other one was like,

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
it just has to be this way.

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It just has to be this way and I don't know why

394
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and I can't explain it,

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
but we have to do it or we're going to die.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Slender Man's going to kill our families if we don't do it.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, no.

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Man, what else?

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I could say a lot about that one.

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The worst one, though...

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The worst one and this was so infuriating

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
was there was a guy...

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It starts off, it's like...

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is a very unusual interview.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm not going to tell...

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm not the narrator.

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm not going to explain what is going on here.

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Watch this interview and try to figure out

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
what's going on.

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They sit this guy down.

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's got bruises all over his face.

413
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They sit him down

414
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and they found his girlfriend dead

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
in his house and he was in the house

416
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and the guy seems confused and he's out of it

417
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and he's answering questions

418
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
like only semi-coherently.

419
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They're trying to ask him what happened

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and he's just like,

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know, man.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I just want to go to sleep.

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Five minutes and I'm like,

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
he's obviously got a head injury.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He's obviously got a head injury

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and he's disoriented and he's not.

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's why he's answering all these questions weird.

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He's got a head injury.

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So the interview goes on for like an hour

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and turns out at the end,

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
he's like, did you figure it out?

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you look closely,

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you could see that he had a head injury.

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, that's it.

435
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He'd been shot through the head.

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The guy had shot him through the eye twice

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and four bullet holes,

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
four open bullet wounds were in his head

439
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and they just didn't notice.

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He noticed?

441
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The cops simply, they held him in the car

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and then they took him to the interrogation room

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and they interrogated him for six hours

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
because they didn't notice

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
obvious, visible, open bullet wounds

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
in his head.

447
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah, it sucked so bad.

448
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Was there a blood coming out?

449
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He had blood on him.

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He had bruised.

451
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
He was bruised severely in the face.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm assuming he somehow survived

453
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
because if his six hours being conscious

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
with that,

455
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I've heard of people getting shot

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
or a steam engine guy

457
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
got a train explosion

458
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and he'd bar through the head

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and his brain was cut

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but he was like,

461
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
oh yeah, I'm fine.

462
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, it was basically like that.

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He was...

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay, he had apparently been

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in his house for two days

466
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
or something before the cops found him

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
so he'd already been just walking around

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
not knowing what was going on

469
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
with, yeah, he'd been shot through the head.

470
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Then the cops find him.

471
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They don't recognize that this guy

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
obviously needs to go to the hospital

473
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
not now but a long time ago really

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and they just don't...

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It was so obvious.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Instantly, he's obviously suffering a head injury

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and of course, that's what was going on.

478
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, so they waste six hours

479
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
during which he desperately needed

480
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
medical treatment.

481
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They eventually figure it out

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and get him to the hospital

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and they get him surgery and stuff.

484
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They try to put his head back together.

485
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
They have to remove part of his brain.

486
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He does survive but he's never the same.

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He has terrible seizures

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
for the rest of his life

489
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and a couple years later, he does die.

490
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, that's so freaky.

491
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't like thinking about that.

492
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No.

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Wow.

494
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The guy's talking to him

495
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and he's asking him,

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
do you remember what happened?

497
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
At first, he says,

498
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
yeah, we had bows and arrows.

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We had bows and arrows

500
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and he's like, what?

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And then he explains what he means by the bow and arrow

502
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and he's like, you mean revolvers?

503
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You mean a gun?

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He's like, yeah, revolvers.

505
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's what I said, revolvers.

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The neurons are firing into the open air.

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
They're just falling out of them.

508
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He keeps changing the story.

509
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
First, he talks about the girlfriend.

510
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He says she's someone else's girlfriend.

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then she says he's his

512
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and then there's another girl

513
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and then there's another guy.

514
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And then at one point,

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
just totally randomly,

516
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
he's like, oh, yeah,

517
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
so-and-so and his dad, yeah,

518
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
they broke into our house

519
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and they shot us.

520
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
But I got to go.

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I just want to go home and go to sleep.

522
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And he's like, what?

523
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
They shot you?

524
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He's like, yeah, where did they shoot you?

525
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They shot me in the eye.

526
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And the cop is like...

527
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The fact that he knew

528
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that that's where he was shot,

529
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
but he just didn't do anything about it

530
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
because he got shot in the brain.

531
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He just thought,

532
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you'd be dead if you got shot in the eye.

533
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So obviously, that's not what happened.

534
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But it is what happened.

535
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It takes him a while for the guy to say it, though,

536
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
because he's having trouble remembering stuff.

537
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm just f-f-fuck off.

538
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is made me really mad.

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Apparently, and I didn't see this,

540
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
but apparently they took photos.

541
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
When they brought him in for questioning,

542
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
they took photos of him.

543
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And apparently you can see

544
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the open head wounds in the photos.

545
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I guess they just didn't look at them.

546
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We'll need that later.

547
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, man.

548
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That one was f-f-ing infuriating.

549
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm trying to...

550
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't want to watch that.

551
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't want to know about that.

552
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That one's really troubling.

553
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
That one made me sick.

554
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, I'm feeling a little woozy.

555
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yeah.

556
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The Slenderman, though,

557
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
loved it.

558
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I mean, I know they did a crime.

559
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It's really horrible what they did to their friends.

560
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But they both just seem...

561
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They're both being melodramatic about it.

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They're both...

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The schizophrenic one keeps being like...

564
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
She keeps being like,

565
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
it was just necessary.

566
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It just had to happen.

567
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
She says it in a melodramatic way.

568
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
She's narrating a movie or something.

569
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I think, you know, I just wanted to live with no regrets.

570
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, I just...

571
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And the other one is like scared and nervous.

572
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And sometimes she starts crying.

573
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But then other times she gets really animated

574
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and she starts just rattling off facts

575
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
about the creepy pasta wiki.

576
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
She just starts explaining to the cop

577
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
who Zalgo is and who Slenderman is

578
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and who Jack the Killer is.

579
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Jack the Ripper, you mean?

580
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, Jack the Killer, I mean...

581
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Jack the Ripper.

582
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, there's only one killer in the world.

583
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There are Jacks.

584
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There's Eilis Jack I learned

585
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and there's...

586
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Shit, there was another Jack too, but I forget.

587
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
And it's honestly...

588
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
She says she doesn't believe it anymore.

589
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
She says that while they were on the run,

590
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
like while they were walking down the highway,

591
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
trying to walk to the woods of Wisconsin

592
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to find the Slender Mansion.

593
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Like apparently they start...

594
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The Slender Mansion.

595
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, they literally were walking down the highway

596
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
in the direction of what they thought

597
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the Slender Mansion was.

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And they like started...

599
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They like broke down and started crying on the sidewalk,

600
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
or not the sidewalk, the shoulder of the road.

601
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And apparently the schizophrenic one

602
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
basically like cried out in prayer

603
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
to Slenderman like save us.

604
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And nothing happened.

605
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And it like shattered the other one's faith.

606
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It shattered her faith that Slenderman was real

607
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and now she doesn't believe it anymore.

608
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
How old were they?

609
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
12.

610
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I think they were like 12.

611
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, too old, too old for this.

612
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But they seem to believe it.

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They seem pretty...

614
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Well, no, that one seems to believe it.

615
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The other one, the schizophrenic one,

616
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
it's a little harder to tell.

617
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
She seems really like detached.

618
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Don't go on the internet.

619
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Do not go on the internet.

620
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I don't know much about this other kid

621
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that I've seen like footage of.

622
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Morgan was the schizophrenic one

623
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and Anissa was the other one.

624
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
No, no, I mean like I've heard of a different one

625
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that was like the inspiration for Cara in Undertale.

626
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's like a little girl looks just like Frisk

627
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
who is being interviewed saying,

628
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
like just admitting that she puts needles in her little brother.

629
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, I've never heard about that.

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, this is like little kid wearing like a similar jumper

631
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to Frisk from Undertale

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and she's got like the little bob hair thing.

633
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
She's just admitting to this interview

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
that she does terrible things

635
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and she's like, obviously doesn't care

636
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
about the consequences or the ramifications.

637
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's just like, yeah, I just do it.

638
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's like, it's really creepy.

639
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Like she's like five or something.

640
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Gross.

641
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
No, I didn't even know about that.

642
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Scary.

643
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Kids are fucked up.

644
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We should end kids.

645
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Bring back abortion, baby.

646
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
This is because they banned abortion.

647
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's why the Slender Man killings happened.

648
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes.

649
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
They're just so chunibio about it.

650
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They were planning to fucking kawaii

651
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
when they stabbed that girl.

652
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They were planning it for like...

653
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh, it's so awful.

654
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
They were planning it for like months.

655
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They were going to have like a sleepover

656
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and they were going to do it at the...

657
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They were going to have these three of them

658
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
were going to sleep over

659
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and they were going to like stab her in her sleep

660
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and then run away in the middle of the night.

661
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But I guess it didn't work out for some reason.

662
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They couldn't do that.

663
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
One of them said...

664
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The Schizophrenic one said...

665
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Morgan said,

666
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to set my alarm in my headphones.

667
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm going to set the alarm for the middle of the night.

668
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We're going to...

669
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And I'll wake you up in the middle of the night

670
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and that's when we'll do it.

671
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I guess she didn't set the alarm.

672
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It seemed...

673
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
They both seemed to like not have really wanted to do it.

674
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They both...

675
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They both talk about it.

676
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Like it's just this fatalistic thing that like...

677
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, we just had to do.

678
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
There was nothing we could do.

679
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And she...

680
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I mean, I kind of understand like kid mindset

681
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
where like if one of them tells the other,

682
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
our parents are going to die

683
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
if we don't do what Slenderman says.

684
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And they almost like,

685
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, no.

686
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, no.

687
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And they just believe it.

688
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But I don't know.

689
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The going that far seems abnormal.

690
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I mean, yeah, for sure.

691
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
They both think the other one is the one that told them

692
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
that like Slenderman will kill our families

693
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
if we don't do this.

694
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Neither of them thinks it was their idea.

695
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Which is very strange.

696
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
They both sort of paint the other one as like the leader

697
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and they were just a follower.

698
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, but she didn't set her alarm.

699
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
She didn't set her alarm.

700
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And so the next morning they wake up

701
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and Morgan says,

702
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Anissa was angry at me for not setting my alarm

703
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
so we didn't do it.

704
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But Anissa says,

705
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Morgan was being nice.

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
She let me sleep in

707
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
because I didn't want to do it.

708
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So I guess they went,

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
they only went to the park and they were like playing,

710
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
they were playing hide and seek in the park

711
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and they did it in like a,

712
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in like a cops of trees.

713
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Wait, this is great.

714
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This is great.

715
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
They said,

716
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Anissa said now and Morgan jumped.

717
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay.

718
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Morgan says that Anissa says now Kitty

719
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
because Kitty was like Morgan's code name.

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Kitty says my code name.

721
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You know, Morgan says my code name was Kitty

722
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and Anissa's code name was Scorpion.

723
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And she says that Anissa says now,

724
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and Anissa says that she said now

725
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and then Morgan said,

726
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
don't be scared.

727
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm just a little kitty

728
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and jumped on her and stabbed her.

729
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Apparently they were going to,

730
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
her plan was to become,

731
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
when she ascended to the ranks of,

732
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
you know,

733
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
someone on the creepypasta wiki,

734
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
someone who lived in the slender mansion,

735
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
like killer name was going to be Kitty

736
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and she was going to draw whiskers on her face.

737
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But then that was going to be her gimmick.

738
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh my God.

739
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah.

740
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But then she says,

741
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
no, Anissa gave me that name

742
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
just because I have cats

743
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and she says I act like a cat sometimes.

744
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Like Anissa says that I'm Kitty.

745
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It wasn't my idea.

746
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's really bizarre.

747
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
They both,

748
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
yeah, they're 12,

749
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
so they're too old for this.

750
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But they act like,

751
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
they act like little kids,

752
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
like maybe like eight or 10,

753
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
which is not like super weird for a 12 year old.

754
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Like some kids are just like that.

755
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But they're acting like it.

756
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
While they're talking about like,

757
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
yeah, yeah, we stabbed our friend.

758
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And apparently they,

759
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Morgan did the stabbing

760
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and then the one that they stabbed

761
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
is just kind of like crying out in pain

762
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and like she's yelling at them like,

763
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I hate you.

764
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I trusted you.

765
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
How could you do this to me?

766
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And then like crying because it hurts.

767
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And they're just like, okay,

768
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
well, we're going to go get help.

769
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You stay here.

770
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But secretly they weren't going to get help.

771
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
They were just going to run away

772
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to Slender Mansion and let her die.

773
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
She had to die.

774
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It was all part of the plan.

775
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There was nothing they could do.

776
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
There was nothing they could do.

777
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's so, it's so odd

778
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
because like the way you're describing it,

779
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it is sort of like a little kid plan

780
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
to like steal from the cookie jar.

781
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It sounds like they were all

782
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
talking about it like they were like,

783
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
they talk about it like they were playing a game.

784
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, but like because they had read

785
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
what was the wiki thing?

786
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The creepypasta wiki.

787
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The creepypasta wiki that they just,

788
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
they thought that that was harmless

789
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
or maybe, I don't know, how do you,

790
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I suppose if you've never like dealt

791
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
with like blood and death.

792
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah.

793
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You wouldn't really think about it

794
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
until it's suddenly there and it's like,

795
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
oh no.

796
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Terrible, terrible situation.

797
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Morgan says that like,

798
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
oh, Anisa was the one that wanted to do it.

799
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was Anisa's idea.

800
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But then when the time came,

801
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
she couldn't do it.

802
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
She made me do it.

803
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
She gave me the knife and said,

804
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you have to be the one to do it.

805
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I can't do it.

806
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm too scared.

807
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And Anisa says like,

808
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
yeah, Anisa also says like I was too scared.

809
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I couldn't do it.

810
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm too squeamish.

811
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm too nice of a person.

812
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm too nice of a person.

813
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I couldn't stab someone.

814
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I could hurt myself,

815
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
but like if it was someone else's blood,

816
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I couldn't stand it.

817
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I couldn't look at that.

818
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And that's like hours after conspiring

819
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to murder her friend and stabbing her

820
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
in the cops of trees in the park.

821
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's unclear if Anisa did any stabbing herself.

822
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It sounds like no.

823
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But really is it really do be like,

824
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
don't go on the internet.

825
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Don't end up on the creepypasta wiki

826
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and get weird ideas when you're that young.

827
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's clear that these two are like,

828
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
there's something wrong with these two.

829
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But also it's not like so profoundly wrong

830
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that it's like this is inevitable.

831
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Like they were like natural serial killers.

832
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I think it was like a weird perfect storm

833
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
of like these two girls have something wrong with them.

834
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And then they fall down this rabbit hole of lore

835
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
about, you know, these like sexy monster killers.

836
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And there's all these like legends on the internet

837
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
that you can become one of them.

838
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And then the two of them like fed off of each other

839
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
and like talked about it and like and validated one another

840
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
is like weird beliefs about it.

841
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And then they said like, like they don't talk about

842
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
like they didn't ever want it.

843
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They didn't even seem to want to do it.

844
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They don't have any plans to do it again.

845
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They never thought about doing anything like this

846
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
to anyone else.

847
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
They don't like kill small animals or anything like that.

848
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It seems like like a really weird one up one off event

849
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
that just happened due to a bizarre confluence of factors.

850
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, I watched another one about a lady

851
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
who left her baby in the dumpster.

852
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That was fucked up.

853
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah.

854
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Some people found a baby in the dumpster and they're asked there.

855
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That one was kind of sad.

856
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I mean, I don't know.

857
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The lady like she knows what she did was wrong.

858
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
She doesn't really have like an explanation for it.

859
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
She just she said she was scared,

860
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
but she doesn't really like explain what she was scared of.

861
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Like she doesn't say that like, oh, I couldn't afford it.

862
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like I couldn't take care of a baby.

863
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
She apparently hid the pregnancy from her parents,

864
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
which might be maybe she was scared that like

865
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
her mom was going to be mad that she got pregnant

866
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and she found out so she hid the whole thing

867
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and then discarded the evidence basically.

868
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And that's like, yeah.

869
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This whole thing sounds like a real fucked up thing to watch.

870
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't.

871
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah.

872
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I mean, I guess I can see why it would be interesting.

873
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, it's.

874
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I mean, if I if I think the I think the there's a lot of videos.

875
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I think the other only other one to watch it only watched a few

876
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
because I just started these like yesterday.

877
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
The last one was about like a girl like an emo girl

878
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
like a legit emo girl back in like 2008 or something who just

879
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
like just who just for fun like just to see what it felt like

880
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
like murdered her neighbor like her younger neighbor girl in like

881
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the woods like strangled her slitter throat and then like

882
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
buried her and she has and she has the interview with her

883
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
grandma in the in the room.

884
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And when she admits that she slipped the throat,

885
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
the grandma like freaks out and starts like crying

886
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and screaming and stuff.

887
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And like, yeah, that's fair.

888
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I don't like hearing about any of this.

889
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I'm sorry.

890
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay, the one thing I want to say about that is that

891
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
one's kind of that one's sort of interest sort of I want to say funny.

892
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But that one's funny.

893
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It's funny because she's like an emo girl and she has all these

894
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
pictures of her like Facebook or whatever that have like pictures

895
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
of her look an emo like she's got some like blood on her mouth.

896
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like she put on like fake blood and like posed with like her

897
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
teeth there like she's a vampire or something and they keep

898
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
showing these photos to show like what a what a person of

899
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
violent tendency she was.

900
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But like it kind of just looks like any any emo girl might

901
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
have taken these anyone would like paint themselves to look

902
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
like a vampire and like pose like that.

903
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's not weird.

904
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But I guess in this particular case it was.

905
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean, it depends on who your audiences are definitely with

906
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
it.

907
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
There's definitely a type of conservative that's like we're like

908
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
having dyed hair or any piercings at all.

909
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Like you're immediately a terrible terrible awful degenerate

910
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
person go away.

911
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
She didn't even look at you.

912
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I mean, she had like kind of an emo haircut.

913
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But she didn't have like blue hair.

914
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
She didn't have like a septum piercings or anything like that.

915
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
She's kind of had bangs and eye shadow.

916
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't know.

917
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
They're scared eye shadow.

918
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That's that's pretty extreme.

919
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That's it's gone.

920
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's too far.

921
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We've gone too far to even accept.

922
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We used to live in a country, a real country.

923
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
We're we're we're sexualizing children by letting six year old

924
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
16 year olds put on eye shadow.

925
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's we have to return to.

926
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We have to return to the ancient Roman days when they would

927
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm sure they would use some weird fucked up shit for makeup.

928
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, just like straight up lead.

929
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Just metal.

930
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
They would have chrome faces.

931
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The iron the iron mask.

932
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They would.

933
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, instead of they didn't have makeup, so they would get bolted

934
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
into like an iron.

935
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That's reasonable.

936
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Calcum all over.

937
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Right.

938
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But I've learned a lot about Tolkien as well.

939
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I've learned I've learned a lot about horrific murders and

940
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Tolkien.

941
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And that's damn you.

942
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You be tubing.

943
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'd be tubing.

944
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I've been tubing this week.

945
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I've been I've been working.

946
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I've been working and tubing at the same time.

947
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Incredible.

948
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah.

949
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Here's a here's a fun fact.

950
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
In the movies.

951
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Aragorn wears a ring that is never really explained what it is.

952
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But in the books, he doesn't wear the ring, but he does have the

953
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ring and there is like a long history of like who owned this

954
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ring and where it came from and such and such.

955
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And it's not a ring of power or anything.

956
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's just a regular ring.

957
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But it's actually like made by the elves in like in the first

958
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
age and it's like it's literally the oldest thing like in the

959
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
world.

960
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's like the oldest piece of jewelry in the world.

961
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's older than the sun.

962
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But yeah.

963
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Because I get the heat.

964
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Because I well, I guess when I guess in the early days of

965
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Middle Earth, there was no sun and moon.

966
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
There were just the stars and the land was lit by these two

967
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
like magical trees, like a golden tree and a silver tree.

968
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I don't know exactly how the sun happened, but it's at some

969
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
point it was created and this ring was made like before that.

970
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So Aragorn just casually has this like 10,000 year old

971
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
fucking ring.

972
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He's got.

973
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah.

974
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Also, also, did you know that Gandalf has a ring of power the

975
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
whole time?

976
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No.

977
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah, he's got rings of power would corrupt would were

978
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
corruptive.

979
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
They are.

980
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Is it just the one ring?

981
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The one ring is worse.

982
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They are they are all corruptive, but Gandalf has one of the

983
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
one of the he has one of the three.

984
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay.

985
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay.

986
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So, um, oh God, what's the name of the guy?

987
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Guy who forged the airy rings.

988
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's not cuckoo lane.

989
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Caleb Rimbour.

990
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
This guy Caleb Rimbour.

991
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Sauron taught Caleb Rimbour how to make rings.

992
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And so he made they made seven rings for the dwarves and nine

993
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
rings for the for men.

994
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And then Caleb Rimbour was like, hey, I'm going to go away.

995
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Thanks, Sauron.

996
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Thanks.

997
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Thanks for all the secret lore.

998
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Thanks for the ring lore, Sauron.

999
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You sucker.

1000
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And he went off by himself and he secretly crafted three

1001
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
rings for the elves.

1002
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And, uh, I think, um, uh, Elrond has one.

1003
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And another guy in a du-

1004
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Galadriel?

1005
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
No, Galadriel does not have one.

1006
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh, she was in the movie.

1007
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I remember that scene right at the beginning where she has a

1008
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
ring.

1009
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You pretty sure it's her?

1010
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Uh, maybe.

1011
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Like three rings were gifted to the race of elves.

1012
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
One.

1013
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Okay.

1014
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Maybe it was one of either her or Elrond had one.

1015
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Um, there's a ring of, like, I think it's a ring of air or

1016
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
a ring of water and a ring of fire.

1017
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And yeah, um, this guy called, uh, is it Collane the Shipwright

1018
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
or something?

1019
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
This other guy, I guess when, when the Maiar who became the

1020
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,000
wizards came to Arda, uh, they, uh, fucking, uh, what's,

1021
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
what's his name?

1022
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Tolkien the Shipwrights.

1023
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
C-Cyrdan.

1024
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Cyrdan, this is the shipwright.

1025
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
He's this elven.

1026
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I guess he's a king of something.

1027
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Uh, when the, when the Maiar that became the wizards came to

1028
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Arda, I guess this guy Cyrdan, like, met them.

1029
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And he had this, this one, Caleb Rimbour made this one, I

1030
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
think, Venya or Nunya or something.

1031
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It was the fire ring.

1032
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And he had it.

1033
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And he met all the Maiar and he's like, okay, yeah, cool.

1034
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Nice to meet you.

1035
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Thanks for coming to Arda to help out with like the work of

1036
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
God or whatever.

1037
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Uh, but then he met, he met Gandalf last and Gandalf was, I

1038
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
guess, he, I guess he was just better than the others.

1039
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And he was like, okay, actually this one's like, I really like

1040
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
this one.

1041
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So he gifted him the, the ring, the elven ring of fire.

1042
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And he's like, here, just keep this just in case.

1043
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Um, and I guess when, when Gandalf is fighting the Balrog,

1044
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
he's throws it, he throws out a bunch of like, he's trying to

1045
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
like intimidate the Balrog and he says, I am so and so, uh, you

1046
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
know, bearer of the, he says something like I am the bearer

1047
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
of like the flame of the West or something.

1048
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And it's like, it might be that he's talking.

1049
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The flame of Arnor, I remember him saying.

1050
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yes.

1051
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah.

1052
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And he, I think he's talking about that he has this fucking

1053
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
ring.

1054
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Wow.

1055
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah.

1056
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But it's like,

1057
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That was just like a, like a, like a skill tree.

1058
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Like he knows fire magic.

1059
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yeah.

1060
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Like he's, he's, he's specked into fire magic right now.

1061
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And, and, uh, despite.

1062
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
One shot you bro.

1063
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And despite what you might think, uh, uh, Balrogs actually

1064
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
are not resistant to fire elemental damage.

1065
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So you better watch out.

1066
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Sir.

1067
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Um, yes, I have, I have learned many interesting Tolkien

1068
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
facts, uh, of that, of that sort.

1069
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Tolkien, more like token.

1070
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
No.

1071
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We.

1072
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Damn.

1073
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well.

1074
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
A couple of weeks ago, I talked on the podcast about how

1075
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
there was a remake of one of my favorite games that was

1076
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
coming out and how it had a really bad, but then the new

1077
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
remake looks better.

1078
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And that was clenoa.

1079
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And I played it.

1080
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And, uh, and, uh, it's, it's, it's flawed.

1081
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Um, I have to say.

1082
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh no.

1083
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I've seen, I've seen some looking screenshots of the

1084
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
clenoa and it looks cool from what I saw.

1085
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I don't know anything about clenoa.

1086
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
What is clenoa?

1087
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Okay.

1088
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I mean, I've seen the character.

1089
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Uh, read it.

1090
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah.

1091
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Just read it.

1092
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So.

1093
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Is it a 3D platformer collectathon?

1094
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's a 2.5 D.

1095
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What if a Sonic character was their own series?

1096
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No.

1097
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Hmm.

1098
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, okay.

1099
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So here, look, I'll just grab some of the comparisons that

1100
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I made today.

1101
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Uh, so like overall, like the new game looks good.

1102
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Maybe even looks better in a lot of places.

1103
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The, the, the problem, there's a couple of problems I

1104
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
have for one, the controls are like clunkier.

1105
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't know how that happened, but, um, there's just

1106
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
little details missing that just make me sad.

1107
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So if you look at the top, uh, left image, you'll see

1108
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
in the background that you can see a waterfall with

1109
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
some platforms.

1110
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's actually level two.

1111
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You can see level two in the backdrop of level one.

1112
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And that's a cute little detail of it they put in.

1113
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Sure.

1114
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Um, and then the remake they just forgot is just a

1115
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
waterfall with no platforms.

1116
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Uh, that's, that is, that's cringe.

1117
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
That's cringe.

1118
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's cringe.

1119
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It looks a little bit like a Kirby return to

1120
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Dream Mind or whatever.

1121
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Uh, it is, from other games I've seen, it is most

1122
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
similar to Kirby, I would say.

1123
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Um, so like, okay, like, that's just, it's just

1124
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
sad.

1125
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
There's just a lot of like little things where it's

1126
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
like, where they just forgot to put something in

1127
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
or they forgot a sound effect.

1128
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Or there's like a cool sound effect in the original

1129
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and then like in, you know, you know, the new version,

1130
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
there's just no sound effect at all.

1131
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Or it's just being replaced with like a generic

1132
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
sound effect that like just blends in with everything

1133
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
else that you, that doesn't stand out at all.

1134
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Um, little things like that that are annoying.

1135
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Um, the sound mixing is fucking awful.

1136
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Um, like some of the character's voices are

1137
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
perpetually like way too fucking quiet.

1138
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Uh, Joker's voice is super quiet throughout the

1139
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
whole game, but our character's voices are really

1140
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
loud.

1141
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Is there no options for that?

1142
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's so bizarre.

1143
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
There's a voice volume option that changes everyone's

1144
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
voices like linearly.

1145
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
They're still proportionally

1146
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
wrong compared to each other.

1147
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I see.

1148
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's weird whenever that happens in a game.

1149
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Like, I don't know, whenever, whenever some

1150
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
YouTuber is explaining like why some game is bad

1151
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and then he's like, this is not edited.

1152
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I did not edit this.

1153
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It actually sounds like this.

1154
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And then they play a clip that's like, you just

1155
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
literally like can't hear characters talking over

1156
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
like the background music or something.

1157
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm always like, I can't, I can't believe

1158
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
things like that happen.

1159
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's not even that rare, but it's like, how do you,

1160
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
how does that happen?

1161
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's so bad.

1162
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The original game didn't have any issues at all

1163
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
like that.

1164
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's, it sounded fine.

1165
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You can hear everything clearly.

1166
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Um, like during, during Joker's boss fight,

1167
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
he has this like spinning attack where he

1168
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
spins around really fast.

1169
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm the Joker's baby.

1170
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
He's Joker.

1171
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Um, he, and, and the original game was like

1172
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a swish, swish, swish.

1173
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It's like this really like loud swishing sound

1174
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
that you jump.

1175
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And then the remake, it's like negative like

1176
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
30 decibels.

1177
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You have to like strain so hard.

1178
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's like almost not even there.

1179
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Um, there's like one of the boss fights,

1180
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
like over half the sound effects are just

1181
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
missing.

1182
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Um, you just don't hear anything.

1183
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It doesn't have footsteps.

1184
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It doesn't have anything when it's running around.

1185
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's just bizarre.

1186
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And that was just really weird and sad and

1187
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
dumb, I guess.

1188
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Um, sound design is sometimes overlooked

1189
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
as a very important aspect.

1190
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
It's, it's one of the music, but like good

1191
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
sounds like mastering and like

1192
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
levels and shit.

1193
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It's like, um, it's like editing, you know,

1194
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
the best editing is invisible and you don't

1195
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
even notice it.

1196
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Sound editing.

1197
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Good, good, good sound editing you don't

1198
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
even think about.

1199
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But when, when it's fucked up, you're like,

1200
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Oh God.

1201
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh no.

1202
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
What the fuck is wrong?

1203
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah.

1204
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So, so what I learned is that the reason

1205
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
there are so many weird like changes that

1206
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
didn't make sense or things missing is

1207
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because this wasn't a remake of the original

1208
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
game.

1209
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It was a remaster of the Wii remake, which

1210
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
was bad.

1211
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Um, hmm.

1212
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
What was it originally on?

1213
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It was originally on the PlayStation 1.

1214
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Came out in 1997.

1215
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Uh, it looks so lovely.

1216
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, the small amount of pixels.

1217
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah.

1218
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Perfect.

1219
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But like, has it been, has it been two weeks

1220
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
since I, since I talked about Mega Man

1221
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Legends or was that last week?

1222
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Maybe.

1223
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't know.

1224
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I haven't watched, uh, I haven't listened to.

1225
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
No, that would have been two, yeah.

1226
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's been, it's been two weeks and I still

1227
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
have not gotten around to playing Legends

1228
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
too.

1229
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I wanted to do it.

1230
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You should.

1231
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I will, I will.

1232
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I just haven't found the time.

1233
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But anyway.

1234
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But yeah.

1235
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's off topic.

1236
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'd say most of the visual changes are

1237
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
like lateral or an improvement, you know,

1238
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
with the exception of these last two

1239
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
screenshots, which are like, I don't know

1240
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
why they got rid of like the really cool

1241
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
dark colors and made everything super

1242
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
bright Mario colors.

1243
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't know what's up with that.

1244
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yeah.

1245
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah.

1246
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I really liked, especially in the,

1247
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
especially like the purple, um,

1248
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
where you see the, the triple comparison.

1249
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I, I, I, I, I'm sad.

1250
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Oh.

1251
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So, cause that was a really pretty level.

1252
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Um, so the worst offense, and this is

1253
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
a rant I have for all remakes.

1254
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Why do we get rid of pre-rendered cut

1255
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
scenes when we remake games?

1256
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Cause every time I've seen this,

1257
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
it looks fucking worse.

1258
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And I grab a bunch of comparisons,

1259
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
uh, five, in fact.

1260
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Um, and it's just, it's just fucking

1261
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
bad.

1262
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's baffling.

1263
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah.

1264
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
They do it in engine because they

1265
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
technically can.

1266
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
We can do it in engine now.

1267
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And it's like, the original looks fine.

1268
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It wasn't originally in engine.

1269
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So, or, so like, why does it need

1270
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
to be in engine?

1271
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

1272
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Because we've moved on from that.

1273
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's a new era of gaming.

1274
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Yeah.

1275
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Is it like, is the, is the idea that

1276
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
like it needs to match and like,

1277
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it just needs to have the same.

1278
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I think.

1279
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Style to it.

1280
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I think it's, it's just sort of a

1281
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
general sense that at the time full

1282
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
motion video was like cutting edge.

1283
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It was a way to flex that you could

1284
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
now you could put things on a CD.

1285
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You could have so much space to put

1286
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
movie like video files and you could

1287
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
you could animate better than what

1288
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
could be done in the game normally.

1289
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Um, but now that games can do so much

1290
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
more, it's sort of seen as regressive

1291
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
to do like a thing because it's, oh,

1292
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
that's cutting edge.

1293
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But for yesteryear and it's like,

1294
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
it's like, now we do this thing.

1295
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I mean, like computer graphics and

1296
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
animation has come so far, they could

1297
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
still be cutting edge and just do like

1298
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
an even better pre-rendered cutscene.

1299
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I mean, they could.

1300
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's very time intensive because you

1301
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
have to like storyboard it and like

1302
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
think about it.

1303
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
It's already thought about just do

1304
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
what they already did.

1305
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, first, I mean, I mean,

1306
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
why not just use the old ones?

1307
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Is the idea that they look too primitive?

1308
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I mean, what do you see on the left is

1309
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
an AI upscale and it looks great.

1310
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
It looks perfectly fine.

1311
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The design of the character is the same.

1312
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's a fan-made AI upscale.

1313
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Why does he have Pac-Man on his hat?

1314
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Because Namco.

1315
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
You see a gamer?

1316
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh, oh, I see.

1317
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's Namco.

1318
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
They put Pac-Man on his hat.

1319
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's a little funny thing.

1320
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Oh, the second to last one is so egregious.

1321
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The guy's no expression.

1322
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah, they just forgot to animate.

1323
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
The first one, the first one where he's

1324
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
snarling has so much more personality.

1325
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
They lost so much.

1326
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Did that change?

1327
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That blows.

1328
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The little orb is so like

1329
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
fucking geometric instead of

1330
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
being a little like ethereal ball of light

1331
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
like he was in the first one.

1332
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah, some of these are just

1333
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
straight downgrades.

1334
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Some of these, I think, and not even

1335
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
in like a four of the time way, I would

1336
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
just say straight up.

1337
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Some of these looked better.

1338
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Just straight up looked better.

1339
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And even technically, they don't look

1340
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
like for all five of these videos

1341
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
on a technical level, it just

1342
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
looks better.

1343
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And the animation's better.

1344
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Like, for example,

1345
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
in the final one, like, you know,

1346
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
the flying fish, you see her actually

1347
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
like swishing her tail around.

1348
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
They actually put effort into animating

1349
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
her moving gracefully.

1350
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And this one, it's just, they just

1351
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
fast tween that are across the screen.

1352
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yeah.

1353
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
They just lazily just slapped it

1354
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
together without any thought.

1355
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, I got to wonder,

1356
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
like, obviously

1357
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
time investment of making

1358
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
like remaking a cutscene if they

1359
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
didn't have the original like files or whatever

1360
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
would take time. It's like, ah, we don't

1361
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
want to spend time. That could be part of it.

1362
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Probably always is.

1363
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But like, how much of it is

1364
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
the idea that

1365
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
full motion video cutscenes that are not

1366
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
rendered in engine is like

1367
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
old fashioned.

1368
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
We don't do them anymore.

1369
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But there's no reason

1370
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
we don't do them anymore. It's just that they

1371
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
are like a symbol of a different

1372
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
era. I guess.

1373
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Like, do people, would the game studio

1374
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
be like, wouldn't even think

1375
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
to do that because, oh yeah, it's

1376
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
we don't need to do that. So we won't.

1377
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
There is one studio that does.

1378
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's so frustrating that it's like

1379
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
things that are invented

1380
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
in video games and other

1381
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
mediums, I guess, just

1382
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
that they become

1383
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
like.

1384
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They should be used as tools that you could

1385
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
use forever.

1386
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But they get abandoned for

1387
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
fashion.

1388
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Unless you're Final Fantasy

1389
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
which still does pre-rendered

1390
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
cutscenes and they look really great

1391
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
and they still flex with that.

1392
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yeah, Final Fantasy has always been good

1393
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
with that.

1394
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Those big old things. I guess World of Warcraft

1395
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
still does them. Every new

1396
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
expansion. There's a film that is like a

1397
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
really nicely animated

1398
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
intro.

1399
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
The most recent one is like, oh, that's

1400
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
that's a nice little like short

1401
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
film. Game looks

1402
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
like it sucks because it always does.

1403
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
But yeah.

1404
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That's life.

1405
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I mean, League of Legends is a good example of that.

1406
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
They make all kinds of really fucking cool

1407
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
amazing animations.

1408
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But the game is shit.

1409
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

1410
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
For sure.

1411
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
25 years.

1412
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
A difference.

1413
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And it just looks fucking so much worse.

1414
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I want pre-rendered

1415
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
backdrops

1416
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
to come back with static cameras.

1417
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I want pre-rendered cutscenes.

1418
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I think

1419
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
it's like we couldn't do

1420
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
such good cutscenes

1421
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
in engine.

1422
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And so like the new flex

1423
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
has been to do them in engine.

1424
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And now people are just getting

1425
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
lazy with it and doing this

1426
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Klanowa thing.

1427
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
They've forgotten where

1428
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
who they are.

1429
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
What are they fighting for?

1430
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Why go through

1431
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the trouble of a redo if you're just going to be

1432
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
lazy about it?

1433
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
If you're just like going to make it like

1434
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
you're not going to even try.

1435
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I could see doing it if you thought

1436
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
like, oh, I've got to, we could surpass

1437
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
the original. We can make it look better.

1438
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But it doesn't really look like they even tried.

1439
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So.

1440
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I can't think of really any remake

1441
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
off the top of my head that did

1442
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
do it because they could try.

1443
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
They wanted to try and make it better.

1444
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I think it's almost always

1445
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
like, I mean we can cash in on the brand

1446
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
recognition on this one.

1447
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Just do it again.

1448
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's always how it is.

1449
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I don't know if Klanowa is

1450
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
like a super hot license.

1451
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I mean, it's our license.

1452
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's a thing people know.

1453
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And so it's easier than making an entirely

1454
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
new game. I have heard of it.

1455
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Try to market that.

1456
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The one good thing I

1457
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
can say about the remake is just

1458
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
it is hurt by the mixing, but

1459
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
the soundtrack sounds better

1460
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
whenever.

1461
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Original composer still on the

1462
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
still on board. I found his YouTube channel.

1463
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
He does little remixes of Klanowa stuff

1464
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
every so often. He just has a YouTube channel.

1465
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And that's sweet. He made

1466
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
my favorite soundtracks of all time.

1467
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, the original composer.

1468
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Wow. Cool.

1469
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
He just has a YouTube channel.

1470
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
He's a cool guy.

1471
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'll just link his channel, I guess.

1472
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It's

1473
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Kota Takahashi.

1474
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's not

1475
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
a remake.

1476
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's more of a demake, but I decided

1477
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
just to see what was up.

1478
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I decided to play

1479
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
DOS PC

1480
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Mega Man games.

1481
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You ever seen those?

1482
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh, I have seen those.

1483
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I think...

1484
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Are they canon? Are they different?

1485
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I...

1486
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I guess I don't see why they wouldn't

1487
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
be canon, because

1488
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
they were officially licensed.

1489
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I mean, they're not mentioned anywhere.

1490
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
They are very

1491
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
strange. You could tell that

1492
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
it was not made by the team.

1493
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
The

1494
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
bosses

1495
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
have terrible AI. They mostly just

1496
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
hop. They mostly just hop back

1497
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and forth and occasionally shoot off a bullet.

1498
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
They do not look

1499
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
like robot masters at all, basically.

1500
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
All their

1501
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
in-game

1502
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
portrait sprites are just sloppy edits

1503
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
of ones from the real games.

1504
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There's no

1505
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
music.

1506
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
There's barely any sound...

1507
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
There are sound effects, but they suck.

1508
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And the game's too fucking hard.

1509
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I played it with...

1510
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Fortunately, the game has built

1511
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
an invincibility code, so I just enabled

1512
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
those and played through. And I still got

1513
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
stuck at a couple of places.

1514
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Wily's Castle

1515
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
in Mega Man 3, the robots

1516
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
are revolting.

1517
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Actually, it has parts where the platforming

1518
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
is so...

1519
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
There's a part where you are

1520
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
on these pillars, and you have to jump from pillar

1521
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
to pillar over this vat of

1522
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
green bubbling goo or something.

1523
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Looked amazing,

1524
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
obviously.

1525
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But...

1526
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I don't know

1527
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
what was going on, but the frame

1528
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
rate of the game would change

1529
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
depending on where I was standing.

1530
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So sometimes I would make a jump

1531
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and the frame rate would just double.

1532
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Just for the length of the jump.

1533
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And I would obviously misjudge the length

1534
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
of the jump and dive because the frame rate

1535
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
was inconsistent.

1536
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So that was infuriating.

1537
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And it took me an hour to get past

1538
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
that part. No, maybe not an hour.

1539
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But even with

1540
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
no damage enabled, I still

1541
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
couldn't beat that part, and I had to

1542
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
replay the level like a dozen times.

1543
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because it was too hard.

1544
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Fucking...

1545
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Wait, let me show you.

1546
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Mega Man, the robots are

1547
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
revolting.

1548
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Look at Shark Man.

1549
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Whoa, he's a

1550
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
shark eating a man.

1551
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
He's a Shark Man.

1552
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Who's the second on the left?

1553
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The blue guy?

1554
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Wave Man.

1555
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Because he's a wave?

1556
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I don't know.

1557
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I guess he's underwater, but a lot of the levels

1558
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
are in water.

1559
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Torch Man is the bottom guy.

1560
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And his weakness is Water Wave

1561
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
from Wave Man.

1562
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But when you fight Torch Man, his arena

1563
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
is underwater.

1564
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But there is water in his arena

1565
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and you're standing in several feet of water.

1566
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So I don't know

1567
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
what's going on there.

1568
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Anyway, these were really

1569
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
bad.

1570
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
They're really hard though.

1571
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Maybe if it was back in

1572
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
1999 or whatever the fuck

1573
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
this was released and all you had was DOS.

1574
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
This would give you a stiff challenge

1575
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
that would probably take you

1576
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
days or weeks

1577
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
to successfully get through without

1578
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
that no damage code.

1579
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So I mean, if you're just looking for a

1580
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
stiff platforming challenge, I mean

1581
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
this would provide that.

1582
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Also the levels were really big.

1583
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I got you a stiff platforming challenge right here.

1584
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Not the first one, because there's two.

1585
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
There's Mega Man for PC

1586
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and then there's Mega Man 3, the robots are

1587
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
revolting for PC. And there's no two

1588
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
for some reason.

1589
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But the second one

1590
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Mega Man 3 actually has

1591
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
really big levels that you can

1592
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
get lost in and explore. I think in

1593
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Wave Man Stage

1594
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
you're swimming through these coral reefs

1595
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
and it actually felt huge

1596
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and I was like, wow.

1597
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's actually not

1598
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
totally terrible. Technology sure is amazing.

1599
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
There's one or two good

1600
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
positive things I could say about this

1601
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
terrible game

1602
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
which I think was just made by one

1603
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
American guy

1604
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
who

1605
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
must have had some

1606
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Capcom association

1607
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and they were like, hey, you're an American.

1608
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Make some fucking PC ports

1609
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
of our franchise, please.

1610
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And he said, oh, okay.

1611
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And he did. And it was great.

1612
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Um, okay.

1613
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I'm sorry. I guess I will.

1614
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Um,

1615
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
yes, that was funny.

1616
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Uh,

1617
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
that's it.

1618
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The last thing I have to say

1619
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
about this week is that

1620
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
my stupid, evil,

1621
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
terrible landlord

1622
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
has ordered

1623
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
fucking work be done.

1624
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
All throughout the week

1625
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I have to deal with fucking people

1626
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
in my house

1627
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
like doing construction

1628
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
stuff.

1629
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And they keep like,

1630
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
they keep suggesting to me

1631
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
that they're going to need to work in my room

1632
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and then not

1633
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
actually doing it.

1634
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And I hate that.

1635
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
They say,

1636
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
what do they say to you to suggest that?

1637
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Okay. Well, a couple of times a guy has been

1638
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
like, hey, can I come in? I need to measure your room.

1639
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And I'm like, okay. And he comes in and he puts

1640
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
the tape measure up and he measures how wide the room

1641
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
is and he's like, okay. And then he leaves.

1642
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And then he'll say like, hey, we're going to need to come in here

1643
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
like soon or like one of these days

1644
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
we're going to be in here. And one time he said,

1645
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
yeah, we're going to need to work in here.

1646
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
He said, uh, next week,

1647
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
he said, next week we're going to be in here

1648
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
to work on this room. And I said,

1649
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
okay. And then

1650
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
the next like, like the next day

1651
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
a guy came and he was like, hey, we need to work

1652
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
in here. And I'm like, the other guy said

1653
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
next week. And he was like,

1654
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
yeah, okay. And then he left.

1655
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And I was like, all right.

1656
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And then the next day, my landlord came

1657
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and knocked on my door and was like,

1658
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Ben, you know, when these guys need to

1659
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
work in your room, you know, we need to

1660
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
we need to, you need to be letting these guys

1661
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
work in their room. And then she did, she did

1662
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
the stupid thing she does where she, she like tries

1663
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
to deflect and like she tries to

1664
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
she tries to get her way by

1665
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
using sympathy for other people. She says,

1666
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
you know, I feel bad for these guys. They're just

1667
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
trying to do their jobs. I feel bad for these

1668
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
guys. They're just trying to do their jobs in here.

1669
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And they just, they need to, and I'm like, okay,

1670
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
okay, okay, okay. And, and

1671
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't know. So I just

1672
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
so she, she told me like tomorrow,

1673
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
she told me like tomorrow, these guys are going to come in here

1674
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and I'm like, fine, like, yeah, fine.

1675
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It just, I just want to know in advance.

1676
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
But so she told me, okay.

1677
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And then so

1678
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
she said, like, keep this wall clear so

1679
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
they can work on this side of the room. And I said, okay.

1680
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So then I cleared a bunch of

1681
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
stuff and I moved stuff so the wall is clear.

1682
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And then the next day,

1683
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
nobody came and nobody did anything

1684
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
in my room. So

1685
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I don't know. You scared

1686
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
you was, you were too powerful. I didn't do it.

1687
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Those, those poor little builders,

1688
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
they, they were

1689
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
intimidated by the big mean Ben St.

1690
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
saying, okay, I was

1691
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
ready though. Okay. I was ready

1692
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
because I'm like, all right, well

1693
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
if these guys are going to be in here and they're going to work in my room, that means

1694
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I can't do anything. So I'm going to take this

1695
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
opportunity to go to the post

1696
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
office and mail a bunch of packages I've been meaning to

1697
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
mail.

1698
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
So I packed up my bag and I'm like, I got

1699
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
my bag ready as soon as they come and they're like, hey,

1700
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
we got to work in here. I'm going to be like, okay.

1701
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And then I'm going to get on the bus and I'm going to go to the post

1702
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
office and maybe by the time I get back, they'll be done.

1703
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And won't that be cool.

1704
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And then they didn't do it.

1705
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So like, I mean,

1706
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I got my bag still packed here.

1707
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's got bottles of slime and stuff in it.

1708
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Undelivered road to rad

1709
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
cons and stuff like that.

1710
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So I'm just

1711
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
maybe, maybe tomorrow

1712
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
they'll do that. And then I'll

1713
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
go to the post office when they come

1714
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and work on my, they got to install.

1715
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Apparently they're installing, they're taking

1716
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
out like steam radiators and they're

1717
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
installing like,

1718
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
you know, like the heaters that are like

1719
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
a strip of metal across like the

1720
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
bottom of the

1721
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
corner of the wall. You know what I mean?

1722
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Yeah, they're installing some shit

1723
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
like that.

1724
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They're updating the discussing

1725
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
old-fashioned radiators that we got

1726
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
in here. That's what they're doing.

1727
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Which is fine.

1728
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
My stupid idiot

1729
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
roommate who I hate

1730
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
who sucks in his bad

1731
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and he asked me for money

1732
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
for no

1733
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
sensible reason.

1734
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
So I'll never forgive him for that.

1735
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
He walked by

1736
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
and I think I've mentioned that adjacent

1737
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
to my room is another room that has no windows.

1738
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's like a horrible little

1739
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
little cave.

1740
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Yeah, I've seen it.

1741
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Oh, that's right. Oh, that's right. Yeah, you were here.

1742
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah.

1743
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So I don't go in there

1744
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
but like this idiot

1745
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
like I'm in the kitchen

1746
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and he walks through the kitchen and he's like

1747
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
something

1748
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
mumbles something and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1749
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And he looks in that cave

1750
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and he sees the

1751
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
like they put in the fucking

1752
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
they put the fucking new radiator in

1753
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and he's like, oh, that's a big improvement.

1754
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
That looks like a really big improvement.

1755
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And of course I just

1756
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I hate this guy and I want to leave me alone

1757
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and I nod and I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1758
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
On the inside, I'm like, you fucking

1759
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
you mongrel, you've fucking

1760
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
you what is wrong with you?

1761
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
How could you look at this room

1762
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and say, oh, yeah, it looks good. Oh, yeah, big improvement.

1763
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
No, you freak.

1764
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Trying so hard to make small

1765
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I hate

1766
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
all I could think of was like, that is a radiator

1767
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
in here and that's something

1768
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
this is the guy I've probably

1769
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
complained about it before. This is the guy who said

1770
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
that one of

1771
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
a guy who used to live here wants us

1772
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
to send him money

1773
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
to pay for utilities

1774
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
like suppose like he said, oh, yeah, the guys

1775
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
he's still paying the utility bill for this place

1776
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
even though he doesn't live here. So like

1777
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
can I have some money to like send to him

1778
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and I pulled out my gun and I shot

1779
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
him. I shot him six.

1780
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So I pulled out a knife and I said, don't be scared.

1781
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Just a little kitty cat and I jumped on him and stabbed him

1782
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
in the liver.

1783
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And then he shot him four times

1784
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
through the eye.

1785
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Well, twice. It made four

1786
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
entrance wounds and exit wounds.

1787
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, so two

1788
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah, so two clean shots

1789
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
in the eye, two shots in the eye

1790
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and it was clean kill, clean kill

1791
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
or so I thought, but then he

1792
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
but then he came back and he started

1793
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and he wandered around the place like a zombie

1794
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and he said, oh, hey, Ben

1795
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
where's that bow that where that bow and arrow

1796
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
you have before like where'd you get that bow and

1797
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
arrow?

1798
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That's it.

1799
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That part was so odd like

1800
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
to conflate a projectile

1801
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
weapon with a bow and arrow

1802
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
instead of a gun, which is so much more

1803
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
common. Yeah, you would think be having.

1804
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah, you would think and apparently

1805
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
the guy like he owned guns

1806
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
like this is not a guy who was like he owned

1807
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
his own guns and yet

1808
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
in trying to recall what happened

1809
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
he mentions

1810
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah, he mentions he mentions bow and

1811
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
arrow before he mentions a gun.

1812
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
He forgets what a gun is

1813
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
like it's pretty interesting how the brain

1814
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
works if you've got like a storage

1815
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
thing of like, OK, so what should

1816
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
stuff projectile weapons

1817
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and you've got a list and it starts

1818
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
with bow and arrow and he just picks that

1819
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
very counterintuitive. I like you have

1820
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
like we in the modern day have such a

1821
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
more visceral like

1822
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
fucking experience

1823
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
with guns.

1824
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I feel like

1825
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
if your brain were like

1826
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
randomly trying to pull

1827
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
firing neurons and you were trying to

1828
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
pull the concept of a projectile

1829
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
weapon, you would more naturally

1830
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
call something else a gun

1831
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
than you would call a gun

1832
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
some fucking weird shit

1833
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
like a bow and arrow. Maybe

1834
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
you was thinking alphabetically.

1835
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That's probably it.

1836
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Anyway, fucking

1837
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
can't wait to send

1838
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
cannot wait to send these packages. Some

1839
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
of them I have owed people for months

1840
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and months and I'm sorry

1841
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm sorry

1842
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I'm sorry I

1843
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'm almost

1844
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I'm almost done with the fucking

1845
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
putting the files

1846
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
together for this slime and punishment

1847
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
book. The lady

1848
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
the Alibaba lady is so

1849
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
unhelpful. She takes

1850
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
like

1851
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
a day or more to get back to me

1852
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
about very simple requests

1853
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
for very obvious information

1854
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
that I ought to have

1855
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
and she sent me the wrong

1856
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
template.

1857
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I asked for the page template

1858
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
to set the pages up and she sent me

1859
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
the correct page templates

1860
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
but the wrong cover template

1861
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
she sent me the template for a hard cover

1862
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
even though it's a soft cover book. So I had

1863
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
to ask her two days ago I sent her like

1864
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
hey could you send me the right template so I can actually

1865
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
finish making this thing and she hasn't gotten back

1866
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
to me yet. So

1867
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
that's not helping.

1868
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm

1869
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
trying to make it clear to her that I'm almost

1870
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
done. I'm almost ready to send your

1871
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
company some money. So

1872
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
if you could please help me

1873
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
get there with it.

1874
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I used Alibaba

1875
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
for the Lord of Ghost pins

1876
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and I think

1877
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
just because there's so many

1878
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
competing companies

1879
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
of that type in China

1880
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
that they probably

1881
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
skimp on like

1882
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
costs wherever they can. So like

1883
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
the translation I'm assuming

1884
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
is not like the best.

1885
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
It takes a while for them to really

1886
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
understand what I'm asking for them.

1887
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I don't know if that's the case.

1888
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
This lady doesn't seem to have any

1889
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
trouble like speaking or understanding

1890
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
English. But I don't know.

1891
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
She could be

1892
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
having to consult

1893
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
with an English speaking co-worker

1894
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
between responses

1895
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
to me. I don't know

1896
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
it's possible.

1897
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
It's going to be

1898
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
different but at least for

1899
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
pins. There was like so many

1900
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
companies that make pins and they were all

1901
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
yelling in broken English

1902
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
giving me like I put my

1903
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
thing up like I need

1904
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
enamel pins of this size of this amount

1905
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
and you get like

1906
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
messages from everyone who's selling

1907
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
that saying choose us choose us. Here's what

1908
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
we have. You can do that.

1909
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You can like post a request for like

1910
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
here's what I need made.

1911
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah. Instead of

1912
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
being the seller

1913
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
of something you can

1914
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
say I'm looking for this type of thing

1915
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
and then you'd get DMs

1916
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
from people selling that type of thing saying

1917
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
choose me choose me. Huh.

1918
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
That's what I did for the thing.

1919
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I didn't really know how I was supposed to do it

1920
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
so that worked. I just

1921
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
like I just like

1922
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I browsed products and I

1923
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
found like companies

1924
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that were selling products similar to what I was

1925
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
looking for and I would just I would just send

1926
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
messages to them being like here's what I need

1927
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
can you do it.

1928
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It's interesting.

1929
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Did you use you

1930
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
didn't use the company that I used for

1931
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
the DMs from them did you.

1932
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I don't think so.

1933
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I just I don't

1934
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
remember asking you exactly what company

1935
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
it was. Right.

1936
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I just found something

1937
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
that was like it seems like good quality

1938
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
cheap.

1939
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Like professional enough to be like

1940
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I could I could probably trust that they would

1941
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
do it. They did actually get them very

1942
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
quick to me which is nice.

1943
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That's not it took me I mean well

1944
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I mean when I did the rfck one I had to do

1945
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
like they had like 20 different designs that I had

1946
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
to yeah that would have been

1947
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
a lot more different yeah

1948
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
it took forever

1949
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
hmm

1950
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
what are we talking about. Oh

1951
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
slime punishment templates yeah it's

1952
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
pretty it's pretty close to being I've been drawing

1953
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the cover.

1954
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I've been drawing

1955
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
me let me you know what

1956
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I'm sort of I'm sort of going

1957
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
back and forth on what I think the cover is

1958
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
going to look like but here's sort of

1959
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
like this is kind of halfway

1960
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
to being done

1961
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
and like it's probably going to look something

1962
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
like this I'm probably going to redraw a bunch

1963
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
of it but like I think it's

1964
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
kind of I think it's

1965
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
alright I think it's getting there

1966
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I'm actually not sure about nightstar in

1967
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
the background I don't know if we if it really

1968
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
needs her

1969
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I think nightstar's

1970
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
positioning is a bit weird yeah

1971
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
yeah she's covered

1972
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
yeah yeah yeah she's kind of obscured

1973
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
in this it's you know what it is

1974
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
it's because I put her in the I put her

1975
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
in the sky and then I kind of

1976
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
like moved phantom around

1977
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and then I added the buildings at the bottom

1978
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
as kind of like a later

1979
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
addition so yeah the

1980
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
positioning does not account for any

1981
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
of that so yeah this is not

1982
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
also she would

1983
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
probably have a different sort of like filter

1984
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
effect on her

1985
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
this is not final

1986
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
this is not final yes yes

1987
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
understood anyway but I've been

1988
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
this is

1989
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
one of the last things I need to get done is just finish

1990
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
this

1991
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
slime and or punishment please

1992
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
yes yes right away

1993
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
wishes my command

1994
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
instead of trick or treating

1995
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
you say slime or punishment

1996
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I ordered

1997
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I'm hoping it won't be some annoying

1998
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
shit where like I order it

1999
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and then they're like okay I will send you the proof

2000
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
copies and then

2001
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
like I move in between

2002
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
when they send it

2003
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
like I'm hoping it gets here before I move

2004
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
so they don't have to like

2005
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
worry about it coming to the wrong address or anything

2006
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
like that

2007
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
could you do you not have the

2008
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
p.o. box anymore I do not

2009
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
no the old my old p.o. box expired

2010
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
which is why a bunch

2011
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
of a

2012
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
a couple of not probably not that many but a

2013
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
few of my

2014
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
a road to red con and pleading with blue rays

2015
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
might have ended up lost in the mail because

2016
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
if I got any returns

2017
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
past like February they would have had nowhere to go

2018
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
because my p.o. box was expired

2019
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
but

2020
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
yeah I need I need to make a new one

2021
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
but I haven't I haven't made a new one yet

2022
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
also I'm not even

2023
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
sure

2024
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
they would send it in a box and I'm not sure you could send

2025
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
a

2026
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
you could it wouldn't fit in the p.o. box

2027
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
but they would probably just keep it there and like put

2028
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
a slip in the box and then you could

2029
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
go and like pick up the slip and they would

2030
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
find the package in a in the back room

2031
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
or something I think that's how it works

2032
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
yeah getting a new p.o. box

2033
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
is just one of those things that I've needed

2034
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
to do for a while and I haven't gotten around to it

2035
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
oops

2036
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
whoopsie

2037
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
my gosh Ben is you should maybe should do

2038
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
that for when I go

2039
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
to the post office when they

2040
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
finally get around

2041
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
to doing some work in my room

2042
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
whoa

2043
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
what I think that was me

2044
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
you mentioned you I heard

2045
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
talking about sign punishment and it reminded

2046
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
me of like an extra topic I'd forgotten about

2047
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
oh you finished but I do want to bring

2048
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
something cool up because I just type

2049
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
something in and I'm getting crazy cool images

2050
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
that you might like uh no I think I was

2051
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I'm pretty much done with what I had to

2052
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
say about that

2053
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
okay

2054
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
surprise topic I just remembered I've been fucking

2055
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
around with an AI

2056
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
that recently became publicly available

2057
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
called mid journey

2058
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
yeah

2059
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I just put an image in chat of something I just

2060
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
generated with it

2061
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
you know inspired

2062
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
by the rfck

2063
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
colors

2064
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
wait what did you put in

2065
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
what did you type

2066
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
well at first I typed

2067
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
slime and punishment but the

2068
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
result

2069
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
so I'll post that result

2070
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
that result didn't have the right color scheme

2071
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
that looks awesome holy fuck

2072
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
so when I'm like I need the right color

2073
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
so I said green slime

2074
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
and purple punishment

2075
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
over slime city cathedral

2076
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
and then I got the

2077
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
first result there

2078
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
these mid journeys

2079
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
this is

2080
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
it's just free you just do it

2081
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
um it's the first

2082
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I think the first 20 are free

2083
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and then you have to pay

2084
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
$10 a month and then you get like 200

2085
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I gave an ever prompt

2086
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
a week ago this

2087
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I wonder if you could guess what the prompt for this

2088
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
image is wait a minute this is

2089
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
patreon.com

2090
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
you're on the right track because of the

2091
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
orange that's what I thought I was gonna say

2092
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
it looks like um

2093
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
uh oh god what's that

2094
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
fucking video game

2095
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
about space bloodborne oh

2096
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I don't know

2097
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
could be a lot

2098
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
the one about the procedurally generated

2099
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
planets

2100
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
out of worlds

2101
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
no that's not procedurally generated

2102
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I don't know oh no man's sky

2103
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
yeah

2104
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
is it no man's sky something

2105
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
uh no the prompt is

2106
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
would you trust ben saint

2107
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
so I was right

2108
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
that is what they think ben saint is

2109
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
because you're a saint

2110
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
it gave him a halo because he's a saint

2111
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I guess

2112
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
wait is it

2113
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
is it orange because of my association with patreon

2114
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
is that somehow

2115
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
like a factor again

2116
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I have to assume

2117
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
that halo looks

2118
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
so

2119
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
it kind of does look like the old patreon logo

2120
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
honestly

2121
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
it does kind of

2122
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
what I've noticed from the journey

2123
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
it can't be

2124
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
gotta be coincidence

2125
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
it is an exceptionally

2126
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
exceptionally good

2127
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
ideas machine more than anything else

2128
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
because the results are always

2129
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
going to be a bit funky they're always going to be a bit weird looking

2130
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
but there's just some really cool stuff

2131
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I think

2132
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I was talking with four eyes

2133
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
maybe a few nights ago

2134
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and he suggested

2135
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
why don't you type in earth bound

2136
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
these

2137
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm like

2138
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
oh yeah

2139
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
let's see how that goes

2140
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
let me post

2141
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
those results they were all very different

2142
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I actually

2143
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
have the AI upscaled them because all four of them

2144
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
looked so fucking cool

2145
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm just checking posting in the right order

2146
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
these four images

2147
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
that are loading

2148
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and there they are

2149
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
it's just really cool

2150
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
shit

2151
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
let me see here

2152
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
this is concept art for video game

2153
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
this is like really really good

2154
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
yeah quality

2155
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
say goodbye

2156
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
artists of human

2157
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
yeah fuck artists

2158
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I knew we'd get rid of them one of these days

2159
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
no

2160
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
this is just another tool that artists can use

2161
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
to like help them

2162
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
think of more

2163
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
ways to tackle their ideas

2164
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
that's what they told

2165
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
John Henry

2166
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
about the train

2167
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
train track laying machine

2168
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
and he died

2169
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
you ran over by a train

2170
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
head crushed by a train

2171
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
that's the guy

2172
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
that died

2173
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
to prove that he was a better railroad worker

2174
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
than the machine

2175
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
like he would lay track real quick

2176
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
something like that

2177
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
right?

2178
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
he wanted to prove it

2179
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
his big brain

2180
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
could lay on a track and when a train ran over

2181
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
his skull the train would be destroyed

2182
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
and he would lay it off

2183
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I swear this is not

2184
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
this is a real

2185
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
well it's not a real thing to happen

2186
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
possibly I mean

2187
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
I don't have enough

2188
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I'm not getting enough information

2189
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
it was a great victory for the proletariat

2190
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
labor one

2191
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
so there

2192
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
the second one you posted is

2193
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
like berserk

2194
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
the what's it called

2195
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
when

2196
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Griffith uses the behelit for the first time

2197
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
the eclipse

2198
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
that's like eclipse core

2199
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
like writhing

2200
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
massive flesh as the ground

2201
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
and like towering things

2202
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
it's like what

2203
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I wonder if this can do cute stuff

2204
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I feel like this is like a

2205
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
like a vibe

2206
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
that this is good at

2207
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
but it couldn't like create a give and take image

2208
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I don't think

2209
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
that's a great question

2210
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
yeah maybe not

2211
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
say goodbye ai you suck

2212
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
you can't make my job

2213
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
defunct

2214
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
well I asked it to generate minions once

2215
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and it was really terrifying to be honest

2216
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
ask it to do a realistic pokemon in real life

2217
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
yes please

2218
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
there's some more

2219
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
rfck looking

2220
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
rfck looking one like the bottom right quite a bit

2221
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
just for slime

2222
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
all over the cathedral there

2223
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I am

2224
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
good stuff

2225
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm hastily photo editing

2226
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
this one of me

2227
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
because I like it

2228
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
alright I can probably do better

2229
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
probably do better than this later

2230
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
this will do for now

2231
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
this is going to be my new discord

2232
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
avatar

2233
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
hell yeah

2234
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
hell yeah

2235
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'll leave you with a funny one

2236
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
to round that off so this is

2237
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
great yellow minions devour the holy spirit

2238
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
of the united states

2239
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
oh I'm looking at some of these other ones

2240
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
you posted previously

2241
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
some of these are very hollow knight

2242
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
like the big white skulls

2243
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
with the holes in them

2244
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
oh yeah maybe

2245
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
those are all results from the earthbound

2246
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
gigas

2247
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
those ones

2248
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
minions

2249
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
what's going on

2250
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
what's going on with these

2251
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I like the sort of weird smoke

2252
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
in the first one

2253
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I don't know it's like

2254
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
radiating off of this one-eyed

2255
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
american shield

2256
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
minion

2257
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
captain america

2258
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
yeah I think these are

2259
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
definitely a vibe going on here

2260
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and I'm thinking that maybe this

2261
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
program has sort of a

2262
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
bias towards

2263
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
painted

2264
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
yeah it's a bias towards

2265
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
like painterly surrealist heart

2266
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
seems to be it's

2267
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
you couldn't make

2268
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
although I am curious

2269
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
like if I typed in briska

2270
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
what would it do

2271
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
yeah

2272
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I could type in briska

2273
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
briska circuit relaxing

2274
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
after a long day of

2275
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
being my girlfriend

2276
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
that's a good one

2277
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
you should make

2278
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
you should make a visual novel called that

2279
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
that's just briska like sitting in a hammock

2280
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
and you just talk to her

2281
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
explain like hi honey

2282
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
how was being my girlfriend today

2283
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
oh it was wonderful

2284
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I have to wonder

2285
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
if the word

2286
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
girlfriend is banned or not

2287
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
they ban a lot of NSFW words

2288
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
or anything suggestive

2289
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
degeneracy

2290
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
we can't let our children be exposed to

2291
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
it says it's running

2292
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
it says it's running we'll see

2293
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
what happens with it

2294
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
this is fucking elden ring them snakes

2295
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
the roots of the heirs tree

2296
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
the root of all snakes

2297
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
the root of all snakes

2298
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
it's true

2299
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
these rfck ones I'm posting

2300
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
in the community service

2301
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I can upscale any of them

2302
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
this last one

2303
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
please do

2304
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
this last one of the two cathedrals

2305
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
next to each other

2306
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
the two cathedrals bottom right

2307
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
right

2308
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
that one on the right

2309
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I'll upscale that one for you

2310
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
these rule

2311
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
can you upscale the first

2312
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
one too

2313
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I love all eight of these

2314
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I can upscale all eight of them

2315
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I'll do it

2316
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that would make me really happy

2317
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
the top right in that second

2318
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
thing the green one

2319
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
reminds me a lot of

2320
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
new lando ruins

2321
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
in Dark Souls 1

2322
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I don't know why because it's blue in that game

2323
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
but it just sort of feels like this is the underneath

2324
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
this is like a secret

2325
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
extra cathedral in the sewers

2326
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
under

2327
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
and Wacacom

2328
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
proper

2329
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
these are like

2330
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
maybe it's the

2331
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
you know as we know

2332
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
from slime and punishment

2333
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
the

2334
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
the de-slimed alpha city was crushed

2335
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
underneath

2336
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
the re-slimifying beta

2337
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
time line version

2338
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
maybe these are the ruins

2339
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
underneath of the old alpha city

2340
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
where the slime from above

2341
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
went back down

2342
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
into it

2343
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
it's Frisca there she is

2344
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
she's got so many legs

2345
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
she does

2346
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
but does she have eight

2347
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
wait wait

2348
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I gotta see this

2349
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I gotta tell the guys

2350
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
wait a minute

2351
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
okay

2352
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
like obviously when you google frisca circuit

2353
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
it would come up with different types of images

2354
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
so this is like more bright

2355
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
colorful I like that the color

2356
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
is correct

2357
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
with the orange

2358
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I can tell where

2359
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
the source of things this would pull from

2360
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
these are so

2361
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
these are so weird and uncanny

2362
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
yeah

2363
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
AI is still a little difficult

2364
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
it's difficult for an AI to like

2365
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
figure out how to make a cartoon character

2366
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
the multiple different artists draw

2367
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
this thing cannot construct

2368
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
a body

2369
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
yeah

2370
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
this thing can do

2371
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
like organic shapes

2372
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
and like symmetrical

2373
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
creatures and it can do like

2374
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
abstract sort of like

2375
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
distance shots

2376
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
scenery sort of

2377
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
atmospheric

2378
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
this is

2379
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
did you

2380
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
include the colors is it

2381
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
like it knew the colors

2382
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
frisca

2383
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
it found complementary colors on its own

2384
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
yeah

2385
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
like again the text

2386
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
to put above that one is exactly what I typed in

2387
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
like you can type in like super vague shit

2388
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
like scariest thing ever

2389
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
and you'll like see really like creepy shit

2390
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
and it'll just come up with stuff

2391
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
it's just

2392
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
this face

2393
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
on the bottom right one

2394
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
it's the one horn

2395
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
smug grin

2396
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
yeah the one macaroni horn

2397
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
wait wait wait

2398
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
shit how do we get to this thing

2399
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
it's called mid journey

2400
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
it runs on discord

2401
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
there's actually a discord server

2402
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
so you have to like

2403
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
go to your website sign up

2404
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
and then you can join your discord server

2405
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
and the server has like a hundred channels

2406
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
that are getting used by like a hundred people

2407
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
each constantly

2408
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
and it's a real cluster fuck

2409
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
and it's hard to like find your images

2410
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
because I get drowned out by everyone else's

2411
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
you can like

2412
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
if you pay them

2413
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
like ten dollars a month

2414
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
which is what I decided to do because I just have a lot of fun with it

2415
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
you can

2416
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
interact with their bot via discord dms

2417
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
which is what I'm doing right now

2418
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
yeah that sounds like a lot

2419
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
more

2420
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
less annoying than

2421
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
the thing I'm being bombarded with

2422
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
plus there is an arbitrary limit

2423
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
which is nice to know

2424
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
you know what

2425
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I do like

2426
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
AI

2427
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
like image creation

2428
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
but I feel like on discord

2429
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I don't want to be on discord

2430
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I want to leave

2431
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
leave server

2432
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I want to leave yeah same

2433
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
why did you leave

2434
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
server just don't

2435
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
just leave me alone

2436
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
go on

2437
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I can't stand

2438
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
because there's no

2439
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
it's never clear where you're supposed to go

2440
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
you left my server

2441
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
you traitor

2442
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
you left me to die

2443
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I left your server because

2444
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
it pulls me into like

2445
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
annoying arguments

2446
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
hell yeah

2447
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
and like petty bullshit about tricksy

2448
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and I'm like you know what

2449
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'd rather just never hear about anything

2450
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
and it's great

2451
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I like to gossip

2452
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
it's not even just you

2453
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
it's just like the atmosphere there

2454
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
that's the thing people do now

2455
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I like people in there

2456
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
so it's not like a personal thing

2457
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I don't like that I keep checking

2458
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
the server

2459
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
because I get so upset sometimes

2460
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
it's not good for me

2461
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I get it

2462
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
some people in there like to just come in here

2463
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
with like hey here's some really annoying

2464
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
here's some really infuriating shit

2465
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
that I saw

2466
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
it's fine I understand

2467
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
hang on

2468
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm applying more color filters

2469
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
this cool portrait of me

2470
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
that's my

2471
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I could like

2472
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
try to have the AI just generate one

2473
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
like dark robed

2474
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
man with the power

2475
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
of slime green halo

2476
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
purple sky sort of thing

2477
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
it could like come up with something like that

2478
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I mean

2479
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
don't let me stop

2480
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I'll send it to you

2481
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
and DMs when I do

2482
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
it's taking a while to upscale all 8 of these

2483
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
things from earlier

2484
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I guess

2485
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I'll just

2486
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I can bring up the last thing I want to mention

2487
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
which is a YouTube channel that I

2488
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
remembered exists

2489
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
because

2490
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
working on more

2491
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
it's called Hippocrates

2492
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
my favorite

2493
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
this is a more obscure

2494
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
less or known channel that

2495
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
me and my friends stumbled across

2496
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
on fucking new years

2497
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
going from 2018 to 2019

2498
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
we were all playing Minecraft

2499
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
because I'm now sampling

2500
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
older Minecraft recordings

2501
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
for son of a glitch

2502
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
and oh my god so

2503
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
there's this channel

2504
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I don't remember which one of us found it

2505
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I haven't watched the recording in detail

2506
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
because it's like five hours long but

2507
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
we just found this YouTube channel that just has

2508
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
a very specific fixation

2509
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I kind of like don't even know

2510
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
like where to begin with this shit

2511
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
so I'm just gonna

2512
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
post images

2513
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
of YouTube thumbnails that they

2514
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
have

2515
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
when Jason was

2516
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
at the table I kept on seeing him look up at me

2517
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
while he was

2518
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
with that older girl

2519
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
what

2520
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
huh

2521
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
giant pooping fox

2522
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
three dimensional dogs

2523
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
what's inside a dog's butthole

2524
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
an educational

2525
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Minecraft video for kids

2526
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
what the fuck hang on

2527
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
in this kid friendly swear free video

2528
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I tell you and your kids what's inside a

2529
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
dog's rectum

2530
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
this video is fun for the whole family

2531
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000

I don't like

2536
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I mean I can just from the context that

2537
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
thumbnail is placed in

2538
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000

2539
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000

for oral anal unbirth

2543
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
cock nasal

2544
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000

2545
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
yeah

2546
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
so this channel

2547
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
somehow still exists somehow

2548
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
being like destroyed for

2549
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
some kind of violation but um

2550
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
this is making me do the

2551
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
the fucking um

2552
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Matthew McConaughey looking

2553
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
at his phone while he

2554
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
takes a drag on his cigarette with

2555
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
a deranged look in his eye

2556
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
face

2557
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
so this person likes the inside

2558
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
of canine buttholes

2559
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and he wants to live in one

2560
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
uh presumably

2561
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
and he put his Minecraft

2562
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
skills to

2563
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
to the test and built

2564
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I'm assuming a giant fox that he

2565
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
can crawl inside and pretend he was

2566
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
bored in Minecraft

2567
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
and then come out the butthole

2568
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
he's also a video game developer

2569
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
hmm

2570
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
and he's developing a video game we go inside

2571
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
of dogs butthole

2572
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000

this is a case this is what it what it means

2628
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
to be a fox that is you talk like

2629
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
you're from the early 2000s on a

2630
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
forum here's here's what I think I think

2631
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
this is an I think this is an adult

2632
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
with this kind of arrested within

2633
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
with an arrested development who is

2634
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
talking in the way that he

2635
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
maybe feels like a child

2636
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
or a or a younger

2637
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
person talks I think

2638
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
he's doing it as sort of a like an

2639
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
affect like a cute affect

2640
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
just maybe for fun

2641
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
so and but to him that's like oh yeah

2642
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
that's the way you would the way

2643
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
that a kid from 2000

2644
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000

2646
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000

01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
yeah

2648
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000

there's a certain kind of artist that is just

2720
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
out of work now

2721
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
yes yeah

2722
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Tony spent

2723
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
yeah these do look

2724
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
which ones I can't

2725
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I can't choose though the one with the

2726
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
middle middle right

2727
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
with the crown

2728
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
rules oh yeah that's

2729
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
a good one yeah the two the two

2730
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
drawn to the to the bottom

2731
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
middle right

2732
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
just because of the

2733
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
napkin that's bleeding pink into it

2734
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
with the eyes

2735
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I feel like any one of these

2736
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
that's like blown up it's like a vinyl

2737
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
record album cover it'll be like oh

2738
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
that's so fucking sick I wonder what

2739
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
it is I'm gonna buy it the one the one

2740
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
listen to it the one just to the left

2741
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
of that one that it looks sort of like a

2742
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
dead spider like set inside of like a

2743
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
diamond and there's like human

2744
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
blonde human hair flowing

2745
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
down I have it oh my oh man

2746
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
oh man

2747
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
these are so good

2748
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
give me

2749
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
give me a break

2750
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
okay

2751
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
this is a yeah

2752
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
for a certain genre of image this

2753
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
AI really

2754
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
he's really it's really

2755
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
it's really delivering yeah

2756
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I guess like ten bucks a month there's

2757
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
not that much if you needed to like a

2758
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
commission an artist to make a thing

2759
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
like like this take

2760
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
time it would not take

2761
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
like five minutes and it would take

2762
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
more than ten dollars the thing to notice

2763
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
about this is right now the upscaling

2764
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
isn't great

2765
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
for example I can

2766
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
put a few of these so like in that collage

2767
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
of all the spider imagery the top left you have the

2768
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
the woman's face with like the

2769
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
the crown floating above it

2770
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
and there's like spider webs linking everything

2771
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
together when you scale it all the

2772
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
all the like the thin spider waves disappear

2773
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
like the AI just like forgets what

2774
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
they are and doesn't know what to do

2775
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
with them you know yeah I'm opening

2776
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
it in a different tab I'm zooming

2777
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
in the

2778
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
the closer you get to it the less impressive

2779
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
it seems yeah

2780
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
yeah

2781
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
that makes sense still nice still

2782
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
still good like for inspiration

2783
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
it's very good for like inspiration

2784
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
and it will

2785
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
get better

2786
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
which is better

2787
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
or worse for us maybe I feel like

2788
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
overall I mean for me

2789
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I'm always going to be drawing like bad

2790
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
like comparatively

2791
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
like my art style is like silly and goofy

2792
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
and cute but I don't feel like

2793
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
AI

2794
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
is like it's like an industry

2795
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
forwarded by people who

2796
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
like that thing they want to make

2797
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
the most realistic

2798
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
this is what they're probably driving for

2799
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
generally it's like

2800
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
can we recreate a perfectly

2801
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
human person

2802
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
just with a computer in 2 seconds

2803
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
they're not really wondering

2804
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
whether we can draw like a stick figure

2805
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
in the same time because it's easier

2806
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
so I'll be alright

2807
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
yeah I'll be alright because

2808
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
every one of these AI things

2809
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
across the board has like

2810
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
no big huge boobies

2811
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
no porn whatsoever

2812
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
nothing the words fuck

2813
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
and shit

2814
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
and succubus

2815
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
and boob all banned

2816
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
all of them in the trash you can't type those words in

2817
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
or we'll ban your account

2818
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I can only imagine

2819
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
how fucking horrifying the results

2820
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
of trying to make porn

2821
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
with this thing would be

2822
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I think I would throw

2823
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I think cheesy was trying to make

2824
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
porn with that

2825
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
with Dolly

2826
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
yeah

2827
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I did not have great results

2828
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
but these would be

2829
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
so much worse

2830
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I did things that they would probably

2831
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
be able to recreate

2832
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
typing in porn

2833
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I don't want to see what it thinks porn is

2834
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
but like oh Bikini Babe

2835
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
it could figure that out

2836
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
and it could do like oh huge butt

2837
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
like yeah that's doable

2838
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
the faces were all fucked up

2839
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and you know

2840
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
not really a thing but I could

2841
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
choose one of those and be like

2842
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I could base of drawing off of that

2843
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
that's not even that bad

2844
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I think you're right

2845
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
it's the future

2846
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I'm the future baby

2847
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
what time is it

2848
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
it is

2849
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
wow we've only been

2850
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
hit with a wave of tiredness

2851
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
damn okay

2852
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
like I said I didn't sleep that well last night

2853
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
because I was up

2854
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
what's the word

2855
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
just enthralled

2856
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
by the slenderman

2857
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
the slenderman stabbers

2858
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
they are so infalling

2859
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I've been

2860
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I've been like tired

2861
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
like fatigued

2862
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
from camp

2863
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
it's been a pretty

2864
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
chill camp

2865
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
all things considered because coronavirus

2866
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
obviously couldn't do it

2867
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
for a year

2868
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I got home

2869
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I got home yesterday

2870
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
and I had a huge

2871
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
nap

2872
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
that I didn't expect I would have

2873
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
and I woke up later that night

2874
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
and I'm like you know

2875
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
alright

2876
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I guess it wasn't night time

2877
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
it was just getting dark

2878
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
and then today

2879
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
we were going to have the meet up

2880
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
we went to the pub

2881
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
we talked about some stuff

2882
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
and then I came back

2883
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
and I'm like

2884
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
alright I'm gonna go

2885
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
to bed

2886
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
and I nearly missed the procrastinated podcast

2887
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
that would have been

2888
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
such a long time

2889
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
that would have been really fucked up

2890
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
hmm

2891
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
yeah I still feel like my legs don't work

2892
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
like I've been walking because we're in a field

2893
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
you gotta

2894
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
if you need to get anything

2895
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
you need to walk all the way across the field

2896
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
every time

2897
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
there's a lot of walking

2898
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
my legs hurt

2899
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
well they don't hurt but they feel like

2900
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
they have less power and I keep

2901
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
losing my balance

2902
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
hmm

2903
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I gotta sleep more

2904
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I gotta get a big sleep on

2905
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
saw

2906
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
saw a tweet

2907
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
saw a tweet from

2908
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
what's her name

2909
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000

01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000

2914
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
on

2915
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
you know what I'm saying

2916
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I don't know what you mean

2917
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
like cartoons, cartoon sleep sound effects

2918
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
me-me-me-me-me-me

2919
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
honk-shoe

shoe

stop hitting yourself

2928
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000

2938
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000

01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000

it's

2944
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
what if you invite a former pcp just for one episode

2945
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000

2946

okay

2950
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I'm stalling

2951
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I'm stalling because I can't find the link okay here we go

2952
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
uh

2953
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
this one is called

2954
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
about a meme

2955
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
alright three two one go

2956
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
so since this is probably

2957
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
just the best use of my time

2958
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
to talk about an already

2959
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
obsolete meme with

2960
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
um my favorite internet

2961
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
micro celebrity uh Ben

2962
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
about the garlic bread

2963
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
meme

2964
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
obviously the joke

2965
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
although not very cool or original

2966
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
is that garlic bread

2967
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
is a more well endowed version

2968
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
of the original

2969
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
normal bread

2970
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
just like the woman with the big titties

2971
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
is a more well endowed

2972
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
version of the woman

2973
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
with the smaller boobs

2974
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
even though I realize

2975
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that that is somewhat

2976
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
sexist and

2977
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
in keeping with gender

2978
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
norms and why am I

2979
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
talking about this

2980
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
what am I doing with my life

2981
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I get it

2982
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
no listen I get

2983
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
that the meme was like

2984
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I don't know

2985
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I guess it was just pointing out like

2986
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
girl

2987
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
there's one thing

2988
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
like you have bread and you have girl

2989
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
a bread with

2990
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
extra is garlic bread

2991
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
girl with extra is big boob

2992
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
girl so it's like

2993
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
a big boob girl is like a girl

2994
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
with extra

2995
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
some extra goodness on there and like

2996
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I get it

2997
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I just think it's a very banal

2998
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
observation to the point that it's irritating

2999
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
to say it

3000
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
it's almost like

3001
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
saying I like garlic bread

3002
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
like image finished

3003
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
or I like

3004
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
boobs

3005
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
it's like almost a facebook

3006
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
boomer meme

3007
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I think that's

3008
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
pretty much how I feel about it

3009
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I did get it

3010
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I didn't like it

3011
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I thought it was a stupid

3012
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
or it could be that they think the girls

3013
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
with big boobs stink

3014
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
I don't like them

3015
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I do like garlic bread

3016
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
and I don't like big boobs

3017
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
so I said no

3018
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
that seems incorrect

3019
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
they got it wrong

3020
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
they fucked it up

3021
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
next one

3022
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
is called hypocrisy

3023
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
three two one go

3024
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
people always ask

3025
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
where

3026
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
is Nate

3027
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
where is Tom Oliver

3028
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
where is

3029
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Trixie

3030
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
but no one ever asks

3031
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
where

3032
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
is Ben Saint

3033
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I want to

3034
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
go kill him

3035
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
it's a travesty

3036
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
he's right

3037
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
he's so

3038
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
right

3039
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
where are your fingers

3040
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
and why are they around Ben Saint's

3041
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
road

3042
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I

3043
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
all I want to know

3044
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
is where is the podcast

3045
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
where is

3046
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I have still not uploaded

3047
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
any more stuff

3048
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
to the

3049
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
apps because I still don't know

3050
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
if anything there is to be done

3051
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
about the fact that new posts

3052
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
delete the old ones

3053
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I think we just

3054
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
have it be the

3055
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
latest episodes

3056
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
that are an option

3057
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
and if people really want to go back

3058
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
they'll have to go to YouTube

3059
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
you already

3060
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
can't listen to the first 12 episodes

3061
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
on

3062
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Spotify

3063
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
and maybe Google podcasts

3064
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
you can on the

3065
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
website

3066
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
you can on YouTube

3067
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
and

3068
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I feel like the people who would go

3069
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
back

3070
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
people who get into the podcast

3071
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
probably just find new episodes anyway

3072
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
they don't think this is a great show

3073
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
let's go to episode 1

3074
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
maybe they do

3075
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
maybe that helps everyone

3076
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
if you did want to do that it's possible

3077
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
it's just not on Spotify

3078
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
whatever

3079
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
you're probably right

3080
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
the next one is

3081
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Slime times

3082
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
weekend update

3083
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
number 9

3084
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
3,2,1

3085
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
go

3086
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
hello, hello, hello

3087
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
welcome back gangsters

3088
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
to the slime times weekend update

3089
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
today is a little bit of a quickie

3090
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
because I am too busy because of

3091
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
rowdy rough house

3092
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
fun fun fun party weekend

3093
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
in lieu of fun party weekend

3094
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
not because of it but

3095
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
strangely related

3096
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
there has been an update to the game

3097
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
where fun has been added

3098
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
to the game and the

3099
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
prefix

3100
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
which is normally exclamation point

3101
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
can now be changed to fun

3102
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
if you are holding a fun pizza

3103
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
and you use the command

3104
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
exclamation point fun

3105
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
very, very intriguing indeed

3106
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
furthermore the rough house

3107
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
party weekend marks also

3108
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
the end of the term of the 3 ring

3109
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
leaders who will be giving up their

3110
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
position and new elections will be held

3111
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
finally some

3112
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
interesting ARG figures

3113
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
have appeared in the city among whom

3114
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
are mysterious D of

3115
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
strange seemingly former slime

3116
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
corp employee and mainframe

3117
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
a weird

3118
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
AI computer

3119
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
thingy magic

3120
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I don't understand technology

3121
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
okay ta ta

3122
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
yeah fun

3123
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I was aware that fun was added

3124
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
to the game

3125
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I tried to have

3126
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
as a stat

3127
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
as a

3128
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
it's more than just

3129
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
a stat it's a way of life

3130
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I

3131
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
was told to try to have some fun

3132
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
to use the fun command

3133
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
so I did I tried to use

3134
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
the fun command

3135
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
but I didn't have a fun pizza

3136
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
so I died

3137
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
even though I'm a king

3138
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
which like

3139
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
pretty much just was like a cataclysmic

3140
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
offense

3141
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I don't been saying

3142
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
the cop killer tried to have fun

3143
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
but I didn't have a fun pizza

3144
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I don't know what I thought

3145
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
was gonna happen

3146
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
but they you know

3147
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
listen I mean you know

3148
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
they're working out the kinks but we're but

3149
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
they're having a lot of fun with it so

3150
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
it's good

3151
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
I like that this yeah they're having a lot

3152
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
they're having a lot of fun they were literally

3153
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
having zero fun before

3154
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
because fun had not been invented yet but now

3155
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
the game

3156
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
includes fun as one of its many

3157
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
features so that's

3158
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
big big

3159
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
big things are happening

3160
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
in rfck right now

3161
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
the next level

3162
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
of that joke is

3163
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
for fun to be the most annoying

3164
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
part of the game that nobody likes doing

3165
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
but everyone feels obligated to

3166
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
have fun don't be ridiculous

3167
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
who would find fun annoying

3168
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
it's fun that's what kind

3169
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
of a killjoy would you have to be to

3170
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
even suggest that fun

3171
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
wasn't fun

3172
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
uh

3173
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000

3174
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000

3175
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000

3177
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000

3187
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
to

3188
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000

3270
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000

if she could uh match

3277
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Ed's style and I would say

3278
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
she did a great job so

3279
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000

02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
do more if she wants

3281
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000

more undercover videos of unsuspecting people

3378
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
like

3379
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
they have parents

3380
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
potentially

3381
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
oh no

3382
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
why didn't they tell me

3383
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
they have parents

3 2 1

3387
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
go

3388
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
why

3389
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
they're typing

3390
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
they're typing their message

3391
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
we have to interpret from the key clacks

3392
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
but they're just

3393
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
it's like

3394
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
like I can tell they're just running their hand over it

3395
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
okay great

3396
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
this one is an image

3397
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
but there's also an audio

3398
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
so here's the imager link

3399
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
right there

3400
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
breaking train strikes

3401
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
rail workers have been left with no choice

3402
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
but to escalate industrial action

3403
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
due to the NSFW

3404
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
government refusal to commit to

3405
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
safety changes and decision to get

3406
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
to gut family and domestic violence leave

3407
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
for rail workers

3408
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
okay

3409
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
my brain didn't read that

3410
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
but I didn't understand anything

3411
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
because I'm not thinking

3412
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
so there's a rail worker strike because of

3413
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
government

3414
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
cutbacks

3415
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
government doesn't care about human beings

3416
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
and that sucks

3417
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
the next one

3418
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
here's the audio

3419
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
3 2 1 go

3420
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
3 2 1 go

3421
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
they're just opening the gates

3422
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
oh that's cool

3423
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
that's uh very cool

3424
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
very good, very base

3425
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
uh

3426
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
nice

3427
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
heartwarming

3428
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
the next one is called

3429
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
the stunning

3430
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
buffer effect

3431
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
uh

3432
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
yeah the stunning buffer effect

3433
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
there it is 3 2 1 go

3434
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
there's some problem that you can't really seem to

3435
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
get over

3436
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
and maybe their heads in the right place

3437
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
or they just don't have all the details

3438
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
instead of trying to address the problem

3439
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
you just say ah you see

3440
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
you're the stunning

3441
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
buffer effect

3442
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
you think you know more than you know

3443
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
but actually you're a complete idiot

3444
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
don't you think that's interesting

3445
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
and you walk away

3446
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
well the thing is

3447
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
you're that guy that's you

3448
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
haven't attempted to like make the

3449
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
problem better

3450
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
you don't bring it up in an argument

3451
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
to win the argument

3452
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
try to teach them anything

3453
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
try to mend their misunderstanding

3454
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
all you've done

3455
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
is try and make yourself look smarter

3456
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
than you actually are by

3457
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
bringing up something completely unrelated

3458
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I don't think this works

3459
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I think this guy is done in program

3460
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
himself

3461
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I just thought that was interesting

3462
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
this amazing idea

3463
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
the Dunning Kruger effect is most

3464
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
it's the Dunning Kruger effect mostly

3465
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I agree it would be stupid

3466
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
if someone is

3467
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
talking out their ass about something

3468
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
to be like aha I have

3469
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I got you now you see

3470
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
you have lost the argument because

3471
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
you are Dunning Krugering

3472
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
you're Dunning Krugering so hard right now

3473
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I don't know that happens the most

3474
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
but I've not even

3475
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
that's not the context I generally here

3476
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I don't know

3477
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
maybe it happens

3478
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I'm actually slightly disappointed

3479
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
because

3480
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
the real interesting thing about the Dunning Kruger effect

3481
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
and how it's misunderstood

3482
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
a lot by people who quote it is the fact

3483
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
that the graph is different

3484
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
explain

3485
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
okay so

3486
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
it's like when someone is new to a topic

3487
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
they're just getting into it

3488
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
they're like oh I'm starting to understand this

3489
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
wow I know everything

3490
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
oh you know they think they're real smart

3491
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
and all that and then

3492
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
the usual graph you see is one

3493
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
that looks like this right

3494
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
if we'll post it's like

3495
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
yeah

3496
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
yeah and like it's a useful

3497
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
illustrative tool

3498
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
but there's actually been tests

3499
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
into people's confidence

3500
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
versus their actual ability

3501
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
because you can test that

3502
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
you can like

3503
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
quiz people on like

3504
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
if they think you know this topic

3505
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
or that topic or this other topic

3506
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
and they'll give like a response

3507
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
and then you can test them

3508
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
let me guess does it actually like

3509
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
rise in zigzags

3510
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
pretty much

3511
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
very subtly zigzags

3512
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
this isn't quite what I was

3513
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
wait a minute but okay

3514
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
what's going on here

3515
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
well the actual test score is going to be a straight line

3516
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
because that's just 0 to 100

3517
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
right

3518
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
like

3519
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I don't know it sort of just goes up

3520
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
um

3521
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
but I guess

3522
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
you know I've seen the second one

3523
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I do

3524
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
forget that this is

3525
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
because like

3526
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
it's the

3527
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
overestimation of your ability

3528
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
versus the underestimation

3529
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
of your ability when you're actually more capable

3530
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
than you realize

3531
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
that's the main thing

3532
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
the real effect is that

3533
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
everyone thinks they're above 50%

3534
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
even

3535
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
when they're definitely not

3536
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
that's the real effect that you get from this

3537
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
and also at the

3538
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
end where people who are really smart

3539
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
like under

3540
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
sell themselves a little bit

3541
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
those are like the real takeaways from this I think

3542
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
and I think that's interesting

3543
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I feel like these

3544
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
are not totally at odds

3545
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
with each other

3546
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I mean

3547
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
they're not the same

3548
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
but like you know you have the bottom quartile

3549
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
which like

3550
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
they do overestimate themselves

3551
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
by the biggest amount

3552
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
and then that number goes down and down

3553
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
until it eventually flips

3554
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
to the negative

3555
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I feel like it's exaggerated

3556
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
for effect but like maybe

3557
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
it gives

3558
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
a wrong impression

3559
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
of how much confidence

3560
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
people have when they're just starting out

3561
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
because it's not as higher than

3562
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
the highest

3563
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
the first one is sort of a PragerU

3564
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
like

3565
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
what units are confidence measured in

3566
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
in this graph

3567
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
confidence is like

3568
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
loudness of voice when saying

3569
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
how cool you are

3570
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
decibels

3571
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I mean the first graph

3572
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
could probably be true

3573
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
if you limited like

3574
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
your test to only people

3575
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
who like have super like

3576
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
big egos

3577
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
and think they're super smart

3578
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
because

3579
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I guess the second graph is more looking at like

3580
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
an average population maybe

3581
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
because most people aren't

3582
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
super cocky like that

3583
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
but like for people who are super cocky

3584
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
maybe the first graph would apply a little bit

3585
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
but the first graph is more

3586
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
just like an idea

3587
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
if it's an average then

3588
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
it would just mean that on average

3589
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
people with

3590
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
lower skill

3591
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
would

3592
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
more likely rate themselves

3593
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
much higher

3594
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
than people with higher skill

3595
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I'm curious like what this test was

3596
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
in because I don't think

3597
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
every subject matter

3598
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
is something that like everyone thinks

3599
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
they're above 50%

3600
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
at

3601
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I've never looked into the initial

3602
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
like papers on it

3603
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
well I

3604
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I got it from watching this video which

3605
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I watched quite a long time ago

3606
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
they might be more information

3607
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
or maybe there's a source

3608
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I guess I'm curious

3609
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
about the methodology

3610
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
that generated this graph and like what

3611
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
yeah like what the

3612
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
what was being tested exactly

3613
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
is there

3614
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
ability to 360 no scope

3615
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
like was it like

3616
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
SAT

3617
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
like SAT like language

3618
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and like basic like math geometry stuff

3619
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
or was it like I don't know

3620
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
some kind of specialized

3621
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
field and was it was the test

3622
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
done among people who were involved

3623
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
in that field or was it done among complete layman

3624
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
who literally like didn't know anything at all

3625
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
about it period

3626
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
I feel like that would affect the results

3627
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
like for the results to be

3628
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
as good as possible

3629
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
it would need to be like as broad

3630
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
a range but yeah I don't know

3631
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
it would who did it's like two

3632
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
people it would need to be like four people

3633
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
they asked it would need to be something that like

3634
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
even any anyone in

3635
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
the general population is at least somewhat

3636
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
familiar with but that there also

3637
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
exists the possibility to become

3638
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
like an expert in

3639
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
like

3640
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
maybe something like

3641
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
reading people's body language

3642
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
or something like that

3643
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
this is overgraph I mean

3644
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
the full studies that these are from

3645
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
are not linked in the description

3646
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
they're just named I guess I could

3647
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
we could look into it

3648
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
if we wanted to be smart

3649
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
boys

3650
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
but I'm

3651
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
what's the confidence versus accuracy

3652
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I don't entirely know I'd watch the video

3653
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
but then I'd be hearing audio

3654
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
and not hearing you guys

3655
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
okay Elia is our

3656
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
we're all just going to pause the podcast

3657
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
and watch this video

3658
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
and you're going to leave it

3659
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
you're going to leave it all in

3660
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
you're going to leave it all in

3661
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I'll watch this later

3662
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I'll watch it later I need a refresher

3663
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
dumbass Kroger

3664
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
okay the next one

3665
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
is

3666
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
again there's an Imgur album

3667
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
plus audio so let's

3668
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
see the album first

3669
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
my stands

3670
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
it's a JoJo thing

3671
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
crystal method

3672
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
this is written in

3673
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Spanish

3674
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
this is cute

3675
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I like this sort of stuff I used to do this

3676
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
no this exactly but

3677
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
these are JoJo stands

3678
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
with

3679
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
their stats

3680
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
potential power

3681
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
speed precision durability range

3682
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
movement

3683
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
movement energizes the limbs and heart

3684
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
making it faster but too much burns the

3685
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
oh these are descriptions of what each one does

3686
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
these are actually really cool designs

3687
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I like the

3688
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
the second guy's sort of face

3689
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
they don't really

3690
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I'm not that much of a JoJo head

3691
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I don't know what stands are

3692
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I

3693
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I haven't watched any JoJo

3694
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
not that I'm complaining

3695
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
but why did you send these

3696
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
to our voicemail

3697
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I don't know they're proud of it

3698
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I guess

3699
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
put them on a fridge

3700
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
that's fair enough

3701
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
let's hear the

3702
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
audio maybe there's a

3703
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
elaboration

3704
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
here we go

3705
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
alright

3706
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
3, 2, 1 go

3707
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
a very fun idea

3708
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
to draw

3709
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
have you ever tried making

3710
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
stands like in JoJo

3711
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
JoJo stands

3712
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I drew my own on a

3713
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
or a superpower

3714
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
very specific or complicated

3715
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
or stupid

3716
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
you make

3717
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
a humanoid type

3718
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
thing

3719
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
maybe with the stand user beside it

3720
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
like

3721
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
very abstract I really like

3722
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
to do it

3723
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I have one idea

3724
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
stand

3725
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
he has

3726
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
a catch of containers

3727
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
that shoots a substance

3728
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
that whatever the user is thinking

3729
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
whatever food he's thinking

3730
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
he makes whatever

3731
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
he splashes out

3732
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
the thing so like

3733
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
he can turn you

3734
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
into a cracker and break you easily

3735
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
what

3736
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
he thinks of a food

3737
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
it turns you into the food

3738
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
he has a catch up container

3739
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
but it squirts the thing you're thinking of

3740
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
so it squirts out crackers

3741
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
if you think about crackers

3742
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
you have like a ketchup bottle

3743
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
and you squeeze it

3744
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
and crackers come out

3745
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
it says liquid

3746
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
it says a liquid substance comes out

3747
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
based on a food you're thinking of

3748
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
so what part of that turns you

3749
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
into a cracker so he can break you

3750
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
into crackers

3751
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I think it's separate from the ketchup thing

3752
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
he can think of you as a food

3753
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
and then like eat you as such

3754
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
like you are a hot dog and then he

3755
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
bites you

3756
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I mean

3757
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
pretty wacky

3758
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
but if you to counter it

3759
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
you have to just think of yourself as really

3760
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
appetizing food and then you can't bite you

3761
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
do you like hummus?

3762
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
oh I don't know

3763
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I can't eat you now

3764
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
you foiled me

3765
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
but it's not halal

3766
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
nope I'm not halal

3767
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I got pork in me

3768
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
I can't be hummus

3769
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
you reform back into a man

3770
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
next one is

3771
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
where was I

3772
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
where was I

3773
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Ben's Weekly Reminder play delta room chapter 2

3774
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
okay Ben's Weekly Reminder

3775
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
ketchup to one piece I actually

3776
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
really do mean to do that

3777
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
oh I need to do that as well

3778
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
apparently a big image

3779
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
that I want to look at

3780
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I've been seeing a lot of Yamato fan art

3781
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
on Twitter lately

3782
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Yamato is so fucking cool

3783
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I didn't really

3784
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
like the idea of him joining

3785
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
the crew like so quick

3786
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
it seemed like it happened

3787
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
really fast

3788
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I mean

3789
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
maybe I'll change my mind

3790
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
maybe because you read it all at once

3791
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I've been reading

3792
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
1.0 like weekly and so it has been

3793
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
like years since it began

3794
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
maybe even

3795
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
a year since Yamato was introduced

3796
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
on the

3797
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
thing so like

3798
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I guess it did come a bit abrupt

3799
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
like

3800
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I want to join but it did make

3801
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
sense because

3802
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
he the fucking

3803
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
all of the thing

3804
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
with Odin going away

3805
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
and seeing the world

3806
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
is like paralleled because of the

3807
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
they want to be Odin

3808
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
near all that

3809
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
and Momo is like

3810
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
like capable

3811
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
of protecting himself now

3812
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I

3813
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
yeah I need to

3814
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I need to get I must be like

3815
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
10 or 12 chapters

3816
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
behind maybe more

3817
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
oh remember you're still in the fight then right

3818
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I'm like at the very I think

3819
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
yeah no I have not concluded the

3820
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
the fight with

3821
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Kaido just yet

3822
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
so

3823
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
yeah I don't know what developments

3824
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
are going on with that yet

3825
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
but I do

3826
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I feel like I feel like I'm missing out

3827
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
by not being caught up

3828
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
you should because like

3829
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I mean it's always fun

3830
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
after the big events to see how the world

3831
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
reacts there's some big

3832
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
shit there's some big like

3833
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
oh my god

3834
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I'm pogging for one piece

3835
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I can't wait for more

3836
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I think I saw some spoilers

3837
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
but I forget them so

3838
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
yeah whatever yeah

3839
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I don't remember what it was I saw

3840
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
next butler had the one piece

3841
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
the whole time

3842
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
yeah

3843
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
next one is called

3844
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
till I draw again

3845
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
but seriously scroll back

3846
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
and share to Gib

3847
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
uh

3848

02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000

the first ones were Ben

3886
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000

3887
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000

3888
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000

02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
that the new

3893
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
the artist knew

3894
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
if you would like to draw

3895
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000

I forgot to mention it

3903
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I saw an account saying

3904
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
new and I'm like oh that might be them

3905
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
but I forgot to message them

3906
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
so a couple of podcasts

3907
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000

3909
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000

3910
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000

3911
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000

3912
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
yeah

3913
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
the next one

3914
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
is called

3915
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Mega Man Legendary

3916
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Characters

3917
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
there we go

3918
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
3, 2, 1, go

3919
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
there's this guy in Mega Man 64

3920
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
and if you talk to him

3921
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
he's like hey did you know

3922
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
and you say yes he's like oh

3923
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
so you did know

3924
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
if you say no he's like

3925
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
oh I guess you don't know

3926
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
and I think that guy is the coolest NPC

3927
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
in video game history

3928
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I don't remember

3929
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
I don't remember such a guy

3930
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
but it sounds like

3931
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
I think I've seen that

3932
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
like a screenshot of that

3933
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
cause that sounds familiar

3934
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I talk to

3935
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I talk to NPCs

3936
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I don't remember a guy saying anything like that

3937
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
was that in Legends

3938
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
64 is Legends

3939
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Legends was on the PlayStation

3940
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
64 was on the N64

3941
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000

3942
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000

3943
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000

3944
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000

3945
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000

3950
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000

3969
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
has killed himself with the fun command

3970
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
and repeat he has killed himself

3971
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
with the fun command

3972
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
he did not have a fun pizza as per requirement

3973
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
while using the fun command

3974
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
and therefore perished in a horrifying manner

3975
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
he then also lost

3976
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
all of his kingpin slime

3977
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000

02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000

4039
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
on a banana peel

4040
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
and the banana peel went right up my ass

4041
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
except it wasn't a banana

4042
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
it was a dildo

4043
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
society is conspiring

4044
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
to make me gay

4045
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
you're wrong the joker

4046
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
you put the dildo there yourself

4047
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
you're gay the joker

4048
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I'm not fucking gay

4049
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
shut the fuck up

4050
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
then explain the cat boys I found

4051
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
on your browser history

4052
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
you literally fuck a cat batman

4053
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
she's a pussy the joker

4054
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
she's a pussy on multiple levels

4055
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
that just makes you a furry

4056
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I literally dress up

4057
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
as a giant bat

4058
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I'm comfortable with who I am

4059
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
will you impress your true self

4060
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
that's why you're the villain

4061
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I'm not gay

4062
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
he's right

4063
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
I guess

4064
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
we can all learn something

4065
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
you know what

4066
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
putting a dildo up your ass isn't gay

4067
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I

4068
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
it's just an accident

4069
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
it's just a

4070
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
it's just a prank

4071
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
it's just a prank bro

4072
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
dude I pranked myself

4073
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I put a dildo up there

4074
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
it was so funny
