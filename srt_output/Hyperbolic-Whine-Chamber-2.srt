00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,960
Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber where I train

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,240
my ability to complain. I'm Tom Oliver and today I'm going to be drinking Fireball Cinnamon

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,120
Whiskey. That is today's wine. It was provided for me by the best guy ever two years ago when

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,840
he came to my house. It's been sitting here ever since and I figured fuck it. I'm down

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,960
here. It's right there. Might as well fucking put an end to this Fireball Whiskey. As usual

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,280
if you'd like to donate to the Wine Fund to provide wine for the Hyperbolic Wine Chamber

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,840
you can do so in the link in the description to my paypal. If you donate of course I will

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,840
mention your name in the beginning of the show and we'll give a link to your social

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,480
media in the description of the podcast. So today we're going to be talking about being

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,800
untalented and how much it fucking blows. So my channel RebelPixels is kind of all about

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:14,360
that idea of being untalented and trying to scavenge some small amount of success with

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,520
your lack of ability nonwithstanding. God I'm afraid it has some of those whiskeys who

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,280
are sitting here forever but we're just going to fucking go for it my friends. I feel like

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm going to need some for this. Yep. Yeah so being untalented is something I'm familiar

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,520
with. It fucking is not. Okay let me back up for a little bit and let's start with why

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm talking about this to begin with. For the last hour or so I've been sitting here

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,280
working on an illustration for a review of the new tablet that I got in from XPpen. I

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,200
know thrilling stuff for anybody who's a PCP regular fucking tablet reviews but I'm doing

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
a drawing just kind of to record some footage of how the thing works so I usually have to

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,160
sit down and do an illustration even though I don't really do illustration much anymore.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,320
Looks on me I suppose for starting a channel about drawing and then immediately getting

22
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,440
out of drawing. So I'm sitting here doing an illustration and I did a sketch on paper.

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,840
I always start my illustrations on paper even though I have all these fucking digital shit.

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,880
It looked pretty good. I mean it wasn't like amazing nothing I've ever drawn has been amazing

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,640
but in terms of like my scale it looked pretty good. So I brought it in to Manga Studio and

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,800
started inking it and now it looks like fucking garbage. And I don't know why. It's a kind

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
of a meme among artists and people who create that sometimes you draw a sketch it looks

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
pretty dope and then you try and ink it and it completely falls apart. And it's the worst

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,400
because you never really quite know why it's happening and usually the only solution is

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,960
to scrap your inks and start all over again. But that just kind of like started the whole

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,880
kind of snowball effect of like oh these inks looks like shit oh it's because you're a shitty

32
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,000
artist though it's because you have no talent and blah blah blah. It's tough being in the

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,920
PCP and drawing and not being good because you know we got Ben we got Mage we're both

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,600
really good. I'm not so good and that kind of fucking sucks because it feels like constantly

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,000
you got to like prove you have a purpose for being there. And I don't know I definitely

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,160
feel like I'm still struggling to find my niche which is weird because all throughout

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,280
high school and college and shit I always figured like oh drawing is absolutely what

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,160
I wanted to do. I always thought it was kind of laughable that people didn't know what

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,880
they wanted to do with their lives or didn't kind of have their thing figured out because

40
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,960
I figured my thing out so early in life like art duh clearly. But that was before the fucking

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,720
internet and then you get the internet and you're like holy shit I'm so fucking bad at

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,160
this thing that I thought it was actually kind of good at because like this might not

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,960
make any sense for you young people who grew up with the internet but back in the day you

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,320
only had your immediate surroundings to compare yourself to in terms of ability relative to

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,960
your age and your time spent on your craft and in my tiny little pre-internet bubble

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,760
I was doing okay. It was pretty you know locally and live in a small town there's like five

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,480
other people who draw so the fact they could even draw at all seemed fucking amazing when

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,360
considered in a vacuum the personal little vacuum. I said vacuum a lot in the last episode

49
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:43,840
too what the fuck. Small aside I have this weird tendency with my vocabulary to get stuck

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,720
on certain words for a while days weeks months. Vacuum seems to be one of the ones I'm using

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:01,640
right now. Sucks. Whatever. In this tiny little bubble of where I live I seemed like I knew

52
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,600
what I was doing comparatively but then you get high speed internet connection you go on

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,640
DVNR and you realize you're fucking garbage and despite the effort I've put in I've been

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,120
drawing now for oh my god. I started getting serious in eighth grade eighth ninth grade

55
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,760
something like that freshman year of high school so that would be 12 years of work and

56
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,480
you would never know it by what I create. To put that into perspective Ben has been drawing

57
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,200
for I think three or four years. I mean I don't really even see anything more than that

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,800
it's self-explanatory. So I've constantly had I've kind of just had to like realize

59
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,200
you know from I want to say like the middle of high school to today that I don't have

60
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,920
any talent. Looking back at what I've done and where I've been and how far I've come

61
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,560
it's it's it's kind of amazing that I can even do what I do now. All things considered

62
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,920
considering how fucking terrible I was and I like I have a little sister who's 15 right

63
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:19,360
now and she can draw better than I can today at 15. So it's just like a joke and then my

64
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
other sister who's younger than me but older than that sister was consistently better than

65
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,280
me at drawing growing up. So I've never known what it's like to actually have an ability

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,800
that actually I seemed like I was proficient at was obviously in the PCP I'd have no no

67
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,440
drawing skill compared to Ben and Mage. I don't have analysis or video making skill compared

68
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:45,160
to Momkey or Nate or Digi or your analysis skill compared to Digi or personality charisma

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,360
compared to Jesse and Momkey. So it's like it's like what do I do. What do I bring to

70
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,040
the table. I was kind of going to say this topic for another time but I guess I guess

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:03,160
we're going straight into it. I feel like in order to be part of something you need to

72
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,440
justify your being there. I don't know what I provide to this group and that really bothers

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,840
me because I have this desire and I think we all do. I think we all have the desire and

74
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,040
the want to feel useful to feel like we're providing something. That's a big reason of

75
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,200
why I create things in the first place is because I feel like the ability to create and make

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,360
things whether it be you know something as frivolous as art or something as utilitarian

77
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,440
is like you know construction or architecture or things like that. The ability to create

78
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,760
things is what separates us from from other animals. Right. Like we have this ability

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:49,120
to like be cognizant and like create tools and express higher thoughts and creativity

80
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,480
and stuff like that. So I feel like human beings we almost have like an obligation to

81
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,160
use that. That's like that's that's to be human is to express ourselves in some way

82
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,240
to to take advantage of our higher cognitive abilities and whatever direction we find most

83
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,640
resonant with our personalities I suppose. All of that's that's just mandatory and I

84
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:18,040
really not to get fucking divisive again but I really hate when people have abilities and

85
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:26,160
squander them or when they don't ever try and kind of explore some sort of higher higher

86
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,640
even the right word but like embrace their humanity you know like do something like so

87
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,240
many people are just passive consumers and it's it's so easy to fall into because our

88
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,560
society is designed to enable passive consumption because that's kind of what keeps the cogs

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,840
of everything going is you know we live in this weird kind of structure where if people

90
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,280
stopped buying things for a day the entire fucking system would just fall apart. You

91
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:00,400
know it's it's necessitating constant consumption which is a whole other you know fucking can

92
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,200
of worms we could open up in terms of like problems but human beings are are capable

93
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,520
of more than consumption you know because what what is it that animals do animals consume

94
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,520
that's it you know they go around they look for food and they fuck and they try not to

95
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,160
die and that's all an animal does they're they're they're they're they're blatant rampant consumers

96
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,960
and nature kind of has a way of providing checks and balances to make sure nothing kind

97
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,160
of gets out of whack and that's that's what life really is like we want to get down to

98
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,600
the nitty-gritty of like like the the state of nature is like consuming and doing your

99
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:46,880
best not to be consumed so when human beings are given more cognitive tools to do more

100
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,840
than merely consume but then we've created a culture that kind of incentivizes being

101
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,120
animals it's kind of sad and I'm going way off on a tangent but I think we all have a

102
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,080
responsibility to be more than animals to take the the gifts we've been given as human

103
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:13,120
beings and apply them as effectively as we can in a way that's most complimentary to

104
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,800
our skill sets I am trying to do that to the best of my ability and ever since finding

105
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,760
the internet and realizing that I'm not good at drawing like I thought I was as a kid and

106
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,040
realizing that there are so many people better and that for the amount of time I've put in

107
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,880
over a decade of work and not getting anywhere near as far as I should I've still improved

108
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,120
leaps and bounds but like when you start from such a huge deficit that's not saying a lot

109
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm trying to find something else and I've been working on that you know like videos

110
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,200
were the first thing like okay I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna try making videos cuz people

111
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,120
seem to like these even though I've never had any interest in it and that was a huge

112
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:00,240
flop more whiskey oh fuck a little bit just got into the cut on my lip out okay whatever

113
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:08,040
um videos didn't really work out for me not my thing and didn't work out long term then I did

114
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,760
writing and I'm still kind of in the midst of writing writing seems a bit better but the

115
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:20,080
problem is like with writing twofold problem number one with writing is that not a lot of

116
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:30,000
people care and I am so bad at real life I can't hold down a job I can't work a real job I can

117
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,160
barely get hired for a real job it's a miracle that I got the fucking security guard job that I

118
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,680
got and it's cuz I had connections I would never would have been able to land it on my own I need

119
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,000
to be an internet man because I have no other really possible career path at this point it's

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,800
this or like die in the streets and that's it so I gotta make that work and writing is very

121
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,120
difficult to do that I've done so much research on like how people make money being authors other

122
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,800
than just like you know becoming published and get super fucking successful and famous and shit

123
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,720
like that and like so it seems to be like you need to create like classes on how to write and how

124
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,160
to like get an email list and how to promote your stuff and like I could do that I have the

125
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,120
technical ability to do that I just don't I don't have enough experience so in order to like get

126
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,120
to the point where I can make money writing is actually not making money writing it's making

127
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,560
money teaching other people who want to write how to write effectively and I can't really teach

128
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,240
that if I haven't done it myself yet so it's just like oh that's that's it's like years of

129
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
grind before I can really get to that point so writing just seems like a fiscal dead end despite

130
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,520
having some passion for it but then the other problem with writing is that now we have fucking

131
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,040
monkey coming in who's way better at writing and has a book deal and is getting all that shit done

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,240
and then I guess Jesse's writing and Jesse's a fucking genius so he's great at writing so just

133
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
like alright this is just drawing all over again once I'm exposed to other you know writers it's

134
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,000
like oh well I don't really have the chops there that I thought I did either so that's that's a

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
fucking fail and I'm gonna stop you right there viewer who's thinking Tom you're a fucking idiot

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,080
you shouldn't be comparing yourself to other people because I hear that line all the time and

137
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,560
it fucking pisses me off and I'll tell you why the pisses me off because you have to okay in the

138
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,600
magical fairyland of dreams and like magic where where nothing fucking matters of course you don't

139
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,760
compare yourself to other people you just sit down and you do your thing and everything's great

140
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,720
you have a good time but unfortunately we live on planet earth where everything's fucking terrible

141
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,000
and on planet fucking miserable shit whole rock land okay you have to compare yourself to other

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,720
people because life is a competition you exist to crush other people under your heel and be better

143
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
than them everything that you gain in life is at the expense of somebody else every product you

144
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,840
ever bought everything you've ever consumed everything you've ever you know watched or read or

145
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,040
done was at the expense of someone else's time money and effort so you have to compete life is

146
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,560
competition and the only way you can kind of like gauge where you're at with certain things is to look

147
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,120
out into the world and understand where you fall in the hierarchy I can sit here and draw by myself

148
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,800
and ignore everybody else like I'm just gonna draw for me but I'm never gonna get anywhere

149
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
because if I don't know where I fall and where I need to improve and where I need to get better

150
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,800
or just like be like hey Tom guess what you don't you're not cut out for this shit you know

151
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,280
you're never you're never gonna know you're never gonna be able to be successful because you

152
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:47,280
have to be cognizant of your comparative value in whatever you're doing like I could sit here

153
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,000
in my room I just like I'm gonna do fucking physics I want to do physics but I don't know

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
shit about physics so if I just sat here it's like yeah I'm just gonna do my thing I'd never get

155
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
anywhere with it like you have to look out into the world and understand where you fall in the

156
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,800
pecking order to understand okay am I any good at this where do I need to improve what am I doing

157
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,320
wrong and is this even viable because it's not just about being happy it's about being happy

158
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,960
while having enough money so they don't fucking die when you're born into this world your life is

159
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,760
a burden okay that's what oh god I'm gonna get political that's what capitalism is about and I'm

160
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,840
not I don't hate capitalism but I definitely think that it kind of sucks that everybody

161
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,000
who's ever been born and ever will be born until we fucking become starfleet uh is

162
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,200
instantly at risk of death of of of just self-inflicted death and that you in order to subsist

163
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,360
you have to constantly be producing something of value in a vacuum did it again that's kind of a

164
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,360
good idea like motivating people to constantly be uh doing something valuable but the problem is what

165
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,680
you think is valuable isn't necessarily valuable I think working on source was lost and writing

166
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,040
is valuable I find it valuable nobody else finds it valuable I only find it valuable so the things

167
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,200
I have to do things that have objective value that have social value that have social

168
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,680
practical purposes and that means walking around an abandoned building for 40 hours a week I have

169
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,880
no interest in doing that has no value to me in terms of like interest but the value it provides

170
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,560
me is currency and the it helps whoever owns the fucking building that's the social value

171
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,000
it's fucking dumb so you need to compare yourself with your skills and your talents and

172
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,640
your interests in order to understand will this provide value because drawing people want drawings

173
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,400
people want art there are people out there who patron artists so drawing as a medium has value

174
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,200
has potential value but if you're so far down the rungs of the the hierarchy and there are so many

175
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,760
people above you you inevitably there's a fall off the lower you go down the rungs the less your

176
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,680
talent becomes valuable because there are people who can do it better and if you have the choice

177
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,440
between a and b and a is better than b you're gonna go with a because a is superior so the

178
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,520
worst you are the less value you have in the world so I'm at the point where it's just like okay my

179
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,160
drawing is is borderline valueless because it's just so much worse than the people around me

180
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,120
compared to the time I've put into it and and I'm hitting this kind of glass ceiling in terms

181
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,480
of just like the amount of time it would take to become valuable in this skill is so gargantuan

182
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,120
and so massive and such like a steep ascent to get to that it almost becomes a worthless endeavor

183
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,640
because by the time it becomes valuable I'm like five years dead in the streets because I haven't

184
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:04,800
done anything else it's bullshit and it sucks so I can't draw my videos aren't as good as anybody

185
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,160
else's in the pcp I don't really have any charisma or charismatic personality that can carry anything

186
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,800
I do you know right now I'm getting slowly buzzed off of my not wine and I'm sure I sound like a

187
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,640
raving lunatic so what do I have to offer right if everything is about value and you come here

188
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,600
to listen to podcasts and be entertained by the people in this group because they're providing

189
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,440
some entertainment value to you if I'm not providing anything in that sphere why am I here

190
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,880
you know I want to earn my seat at the table but I feel like I'm ill-equipped in terms of skill set

191
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,720
to provide anything that isn't overlapping and underdeveloped compared to other people I don't

192
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,280
draw better than Ben I don't write better than monkey I don't make better videos than digi and

193
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,800
I don't have a better personality than Jesse I'm a knockoff shittier version of everybody else

194
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
so what's the fucking point like what do I provide here other than complaining anybody can

195
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,440
complain this isn't a skill this is just an outlet for frustration you know my channel rebel pixels

196
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,680
people like it because they're like you're such a failure I resonate with your failure and that's

197
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,040
why I'm attracted to some of your videos because I can understand and sympathize with your feelings

198
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,840
of inadequacy if my most valuable thing is providing comfort for other failures why the

199
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,560
fuck would I even bother like that's that's so fucking demoralizing it's like yeah you draw

200
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,200
yeah you write yeah you do this but the fact that you fail the way I do is what really attracts me

201
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
to you misery loves company so I'm gonna hang out with you like like that's grounds for fucking

202
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,080
blowing my brains out right there like fuck that like oh god so shitty I fucking hate it oh so what

203
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,920
what do I do what do I do I don't know what I do what was this podcast even about it's about

204
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,680
not having talent so I guess I guess we're still semi-on topic I don't have an ego I don't have

205
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:17,520
confidence I would like to I think it's valuable I don't know how to do it but I do have ego at

206
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,760
the same time it's weird I don't really know how to describe it maybe maybe you guys are familiar

207
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,400
with this in that like you have an ego but it's repressed like you can't express it because it

208
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,080
makes you angry or something I don't really know because like if I just sit down and ask myself like

209
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,600
do I want to be better than all these people in the pcp of course I do I think that's not rude to

210
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
say like why would I not want to be more successful than people around me again if everything's a

211
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,680
comparison and everything's a competition then in order to thrive you have to win I want to win

212
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,960
clearly because I don't want to be fucking dead I mean that pendulum swing in the other way with

213
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,040
every day but we're still we're still on live live land right now so if I'm going to be alive I want

214
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,360
to win and I want to be the best guy clearly I think everybody wants to be the best guy if they're

215
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,840
being honest with themselves like who doesn't want to be the best guy right I'm gonna be the best you

216
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,120
can be well if the best you can be fucking blows what if it's like like like the lowest tier that's

217
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,600
the best you can be nobody wants to be the best they can be if it's fucking shitty still everybody

218
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,080
wants to be the best guy so I want to be the best guy I want to be the best writer I want to be the

219
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,800
best artist I want to be the best video maker I want to be the best of everything but I can't be

220
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,840
the best of everything I can barely be competent at anything I don't know what I bring to the table

221
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,720
that isn't done better by somebody else so sometimes I just ask myself why I'm even here

222
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,400
like why bother like should I just leave should I just let let these guys do their thing and and

223
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,560
not fucking weigh them down with like this excess baggage of like yeah we got Ben he's a good

224
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,520
artist we got made she's a good artist we got monkey he's he's got a book deal going and and

225
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,360
we got like all these guys doing great videos with like really charismatic personalities

226
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,480
and sweet editing and really analytical points and then Tom well we've known him for a while he just

227
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,800
he kind of does this thing if I had met these guys now and not back during the horse days

228
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:32,480
none of them would give a fuck about me and I'm so fucking aware of this and it's not spoken but

229
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,120
I'm saying it now it's so fucking obvious that the only reason I'm still here is because of the

230
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,120
history we have nothing I'm doing in the moment has any value or any interest to anybody else on

231
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,200
this fucking channel oh you review graphics tablets who fucking cares I barely fucking care

232
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,840
it was an accident that it even happened what else you do oh you talk about how depressed you are

233
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,080
and how creativity is hard no fucking shit we all know that we're all doing it none of them would pay

234
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:14,480
rebel pixels any mind they barely do now which I don't blame them because it did fuck who cares

235
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,760
I barely care and I make the damn things none of it matters it's unimportant and it's unimpressive

236
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,280
I have no reason to be in this group and I'm desperate to to earn my seat again

237
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,840
back in the day when we first met and we were all doing gay horse faggot shit

238
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,480
I earned my seat I was the second biggest guy after digi

239
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,400
and I built that from nothing granted it was off the back of a fandom which kind of invalidates

240
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,200
all of the accomplishments but it was mine and I did it and I felt like I had earned my seat there

241
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,440
at the table of the horseshoe crew I belonged I I was there for a reason you know I was doing

242
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,040
something now I don't I don't do anything of value I don't do anything worth doing and everything

243
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:16,480
that I can do is done better by somebody else we're friends we're all friends but we definitely

244
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,640
are very aware of our creativity and and the things that we make and we prescribe a lot of value

245
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,840
to ourselves and everybody else based on what they make and I know my social currency and my

246
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,240
social credit in this group is is dwindling rapidly nobody wants to say it but I can see the

247
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:46,080
writing on the wall I'm not providing anything I just want to be good at something I don't know

248
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:55,920
if that's like it must be nice maybe I'm just too fucking depressed and full of self-hatred to

249
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:02,720
recognize my own skills but again skills in isolation don't mean anything it has to be

250
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,640
you have to look out into the world and compare favorably and even if I could come to terms with

251
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,480
the fact that oh I do good things in isolation it doesn't matter because in the real world compared

252
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,240
to other people none of it's any good so I either need to get really fucking good at something

253
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,560
or do something new that nobody else in the group does and say that's my thing

254
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
he's the guy who does that and that's why he's here

255
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:43,840
because right now I don't do shit and it's just only a matter of time before I just

256
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,760
get kicked out because he's not doing anything I think I already would have been kicked out

257
00:25:51,760 --> 00:26:00,880
if I didn't have history with these guys I don't I don't do anything hi I'm I'm done

258
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,360
there's been hyperbolic wine chamber lots of whining today let me know if you want me to get

259
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,520
a specific one donate in the link and I'll get it next time
