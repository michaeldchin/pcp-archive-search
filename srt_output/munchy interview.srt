00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello, everybody, and welcome to yet another entry in the Pro Crastinators Podcast interview series.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:20,800
I've got with me a very special guest, Munchy, the king of evils back to deal a rightly fucking deserved punishment for these goons, these villains.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,600
You people did not press one hard enough, and now I'm here to take my fucking, my spoils, my spoils of war. Best guy's head ever on a fucking platter. That's what I'm giving for Christmas this year.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Technically not a member of the Pro Crastinators, but an honorary member, for sure.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,800
So Munchy, what the hell? Why is this happening?

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:58,400
I made a joke, and I said, you should add me to an interview, and he said, that's the way the cookie crumbles, crumbles right onto my flaccid wing.

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:08,600
Alright, well Munchy, you're sort of an ancillary member of the Pro Crastinators.

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:21,600
We usually just introduce you as having done my avatar, which sounds like nothing at all compared to why the rest of us know each other, so why do I know you? You want to tell that story?

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Yeah, it's a very heartfelt story. I could turn this into a summer blockbuster, all a forced gump. You obviously being the retarded cast member.

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:49,600
So I met you, I think, I honestly want to say, I think I met you before you knew about Jesse. Maybe not knew, before you were friends with Jesse. I'm not sure.

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
That seems possible.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Yeah, I met you the very, well I didn't meet you, but I found out about you the very first time Tom ever liked one of your videos. It was something like the ages in My Little Pony.

13
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
So were you already following Tom?

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Yeah, I was following him. It's a long trail of just fucking random people I found and I eventually just hopped from one personality and one podcast to another and eventually I found out Tom.

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Then I found you and I was like, ooh man, I have no time and this guy has a lot of videos. It's time for me.

16
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I didn't have that many at the time, if it was Pony Ages.

17
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Yeah, I know, but still it felt like a lot because I just waste all my time.

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Great.

19
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Yeah, and the way I just followed your content for a while as a normal person, I didn't comment or nothing.

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Then the reason why we even started talking is I would start to send you very, what's the word, sensual and strange pickup lines on your Tumblr.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Pretty much every week, maybe even twice a week for how long would you say?

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:12,600
God, months. I would just get these fucking weird pickup lines and I thought it was funny that it was happening, but you seemed legitimately psychotic.

23
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I was like, it's kind of early into me having somewhat of an internet fame or whatever in the My Little Pony community.

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,600
This is obviously a consequence of having people know who I am.

25
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
This is the fucking burden you're going to have to live with.

26
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:47,600
It was kind of funny, but it went on for so long and the thing is that the most important fact about it is that you would send these to me as asks on Tumblr and I never published any of them.

27
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:59,600
So I was thinking, what is wrong with this guy that he keeps sending me messages for months with no reply, no whatsoever response.

28
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I didn't need any due.

29
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
The act of sending them in and of itself was gratifying enough.

30
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Yeah, it would just be all these weird fucking pickup lines.

31
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,600
And then the story continued at BronyCon 2013.

32
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Was it 2013?

33
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
No, I'm sure it was 2013.

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You were having a Q&A with Tom. You were high on, this was in your prime, I think.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I just picked up, I don't remember what I said.

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It was something about the Smurfs 2, I think, if you're ever going to review the Smurfs 2.

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
I can't believe I forgot all about this.

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
A fucking con was a treasure.

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Anyway, I picked up the mic, I asked you if you were going to review Smurfs 2 and then at the very end I said, oh by the way, I'm the guy who's sending you pickup lines on Tumblr.

40
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
And you just fucking looked at me with the most like, you were fucking a deer in the headlights.

41
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
All your fears are just fucking materialized in front of you.

42
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
It was so amazing that it was a real person, a real human.

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
And the way you were acting was exactly what I expect from the guy who was sending me pickup lines on Tumblr.

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Because you got up and very loudly asked about the Smurfs 2.

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:19,600
In the middle of all these other people asking legitimate questions, you get up and you're like, are you ever going to review the Smurfs 2?

46
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:29,600
And while holding a bucket full of shit, you had this like pale, this red pale full of crap that you were carrying around.

47
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
And I asked you to sign my bucket and you were very pleased.

48
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah, so that was like right after the Q&A I think, right?

49
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Yeah.

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
You got me to sign the bucket and I, because I'm just thinking this guy is a troll.

51
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
So I think I signed it.

52
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
What did I sign it with?

53
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
It was something derogatory.

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,600
You know, it's just like something like this guy sucks and sucks is spelled wrong.

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I think I just spelled my name wrong as all it was.

56
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh yeah, yeah, something like that, something like that.

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I know something was misspelled.

58
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
That's the main thing I remember.

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
And we just kept finding each other.

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I don't know if you knew this, but I wasn't intentionally stalking you.

61
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I would just always be where you were.

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Well BarneyCon's not big.

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It's not a very large convention.

64
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
The way it was that you would do it though is that you would, we'd run into each other,

65
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
like we'd be in the same place.

66
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
And then you kept drawing things.

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
And then just like walking up to me and handing me the things you'd drawn.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,600
And they all were like these insane, like, it would be like me farting into my own mouth or something,

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
like screaming about Nazis or like holding a Schwastika or something.

70
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
And I'm like, all right, cool.

71
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
And you'd like run up to me, hand it to me and scurry away.

72
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Scurry away.

73
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Yeah, I remember one time I was just sitting on the floor.

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
I just didn't even know you were around me.

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
And then I just like see you fucking approach from the corner of my eye and you just look down at me.

76
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm fucking crisscross applesauce on the floor and you just say,

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Well you drawn this time.

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I just think I've made it.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I've made it big.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
He wants to know.

81
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I do remember that.

82
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Yeah, because I just saw you like in the hallway drawing something.

83
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
And bear in mind, because I think we've made this clear to our audience before.

84
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,600
If you're going to say something about age, then yes.

85
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Yeah, well, that you don't look your age.

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Yes.

87
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
That you were at the time, I think, 13.

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, God, yeah.

89
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, my God.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
If it's in August, I might have been 12 years old.

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Yeah.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,600
So you were like 12, but you were only probably a couple inches shorter than me.

93
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You weren't quite as tall as me at the time, right?

94
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Because now you tower over me.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I think we might have been the same height.

96
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Or if not, you were just very slightly taller than me.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
So you were like my height sort of heavy set.

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600
You had long hair and like a little bit of a peach fuzz mustache.

99
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,600
And you're like a Mexican, right?

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Or some mix?

101
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Yeah, just some mixed shit, I don't know.

102
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Right.

103
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
But you have darker skin.

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,600
And I just thought that you were just like a Mexican guy who was like my age.

105
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
And I had no reason to think otherwise.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Yeah.

107
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:18,600
But the moment that sort of changed my perception of you completely at BronyCon was you handed

108
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,600
me a picture that said how I can draw Digi and how I choose to draw Digi.

109
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,600
And how I can draw Digi was this really nice looking like picture, like with this really

110
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
unique art style that was cool.

111
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
And then the other one was like the usual shit you'd been handing me.

112
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
And that was when I was like, oh, he's actually like a good artist.

113
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
He's just deliberately.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Well, up to that point, I had no reason to think you weren't like a legitimately insane person.

115
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah.

116
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
But then when I saw that, I was like, this is all tongue in cheek.

117
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
It's like this is all on purpose.

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
You know, he doesn't draw this way because he's crazy.

119
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
He draws this way because it's ironic and it's supposed to be funny.

120
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
And so and I still have it.

121
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I kept all those drawings in my wallet.

122
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I remember.

123
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, continue.

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
And then I'll talk about something after.

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, that's it.

126
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Okay.

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Well, I remember you got home and you made like a like a decompressing vlog where you were

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
just a veggie now with Victor.

129
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,600
By the way, I'm a pinpoint that because I'm going to talk about how you're fucking stupid

130
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
for not knowing veggie now it isn't thinking it's cool.

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Anyway, you were a veggie now with Victor and you were just reviewing all the shit you got

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
at BronyCon.

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
And then there was just like fucking 10 or like nine minutes.

134
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Just feel about fucking me.

135
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
And like there was like time codes in the description where it was like, oh, we talked about da da da.

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
And then there was just fucking one.

137
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
There was like 10 minutes.

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Munchy.

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Just munchy.

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
And I guess I found out your name from this at some point at some point.

141
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah.

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah.

143
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I had gotten your Skype through that.

144
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Okay.

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
And then so yeah.

146
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Back then I accepted almost everybody on Skype.

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah.

148
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
So the fact that you got my Skype.

149
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Yeah.

150
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Yeah.

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:07,600
And then so 2013 is it because like at some point we started talking more and then it was

152
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,600
when I got into my relationship with my ex-girlfriend, she started dragging you into calls with us all

153
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
the time.

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Your girlfriend was odd.

155
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Yeah.

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
She was.

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I mean, I don't want to, she's not here right now.

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
She was fucking weird, dude.

159
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
She was weird.

160
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Well, she was obsessed with me.

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,600
And I think, you know, I think the reason that she was so interested in you is that I talked about you in that

162
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,600
vlog because like, because when I met her, she had told me that she had rewatched that BronyCon 2013

163
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
vlog like over and over again because she had wanted to go to BronyCon and she couldn't.

164
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
So she sort of experienced it vicariously through my vlog.

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I actually, like there's a lot of people who tell me that they like, like Jeff Burgess

166
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
like loves watching like parts of that vlog.

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I don't know why.

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Like I get that there's certain videos I have from that era that like almost all the views

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
I think are from the same people just watching it over again.

170
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
And that's one of them.

171
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
So I think she knew she had heard that story before.

172
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,600
And then when she found out that you were like a kid, then she thought it was adorable.

173
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
She would always like refer to you as like our son or something.

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
It was, it was, it was very interesting at the time.

175
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
It was just like, oh, I mean, I get to talk to this guy more.

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,600
So I mean, I'm not going to deny this, but that's a little weird, man.

177
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Yeah. And to me, it was always really awkward.

178
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Cause like, cause she would do it when I clearly didn't want like, cause we sit in Skype calls all the time

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
and she would just get bored and start throwing other people.

180
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
It would be like you and Vita who is even worse, far worse.

181
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
We're not going to, I don't think we're going to talk about that.

182
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
We're not going to talk about him.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
But she would throw the two of you in and it would just be like weird and awkward.

184
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Cause I'm like, okay, now I didn't, I already, it's, it was already weird how much we skyped each other,

185
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
but it was doubly weird that she was throwing in other people.

186
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,600
And you know, and I could tell for you, it was always like, I can tell I'm not wanted here.

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Yeah.

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
But I don't want to leave.

189
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah, I'm not going to leave.

190
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
This is an opportunity to, this is going to be my breakout role, dude.

191
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Yeah, but, but she was really attached to you.

192
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,600
And then you started drawing, what got you started drawing the avatars was that you just drew like a bunch of pictures

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
of like all your friends, I guess, right?

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,600
And it was just like these simple black and white like portraits of like, I guess everyone you knew

196
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
cause you drew one for both me and her.

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Yes.

198
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
And I don't even remember drawing one of her.

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I guess I did.

200
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Yeah.

201
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Cause we both started using them as our Skype avatars.

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
And then like, I liked it as cause this was in the period where I was starting to get away from Pony

203
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,600
and, you know, wanted to move into anime and I was like, it'd be cooler if I just had an avatar that's just me, you know,

204
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
and you had drawn one of the only pictures of just me.

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
So, and I liked it.

206
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,600
So I made that my YouTube avatar and it was that for like that, that particular drawing for a long time.

207
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Yeah.

208
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
And actually I just got so fucking sick of it.

209
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I just could not stand to even look at it because I would have you on Skype,

210
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,600
but I would occasionally just talk to you and then I would just see that fucking smug ass.

211
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
I hate it.

212
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I hate it.

213
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I loved how smug it was.

214
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
But yeah.

215
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
It was funny.

216
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
No, go on.

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Yeah.

218
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Cause you, you're an artist and you've been improving overall this time and your art style has been changing.

219
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So like every six months or so, you'll look at my avatar and go, I can't look at it anymore.

220
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I'm too good at drawing now.

221
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I can't have that be your avatar, you know.

222
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I gotta say the one you have now is easily my best work in a while.

223
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm very proud.

224
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Yeah.

225
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I definitely like it a lot.

226
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
And now it's got a whole metal fucking faceplate.

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Yeah, I know.

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
That's so awesome.

229
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Shout outs to whoever did that.

230
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
I don't remember your name and I don't care.

231
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
It was another JoJo avatar guy.

232
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Yeah.

233
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, I saw.

234
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
He's my Josuke dude.

235
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm his fucking slave master.

236
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
He's a dungeon master, dude.

237
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Before we, we move on to anything else.

238
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,600
There was another art project besides avatars that I was with you creating.

239
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Oh yeah.

240
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah.

241
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
So you can start this off.

242
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Yeah.

243
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Towards the end of 2013.

244
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Cause again, we, we had started talking and you just like, cause the thing is back and still to this day, I never asked people for art.

245
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Like I never come to people and I'm like, Hey, draw something for me.

246
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Like all the avatars you've made, it's always been you telling me I drew you a new avatar.

247
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Replace the old one.

248
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,600
It's never been me coming to you going like, Hey, let's update it to look like, you know, current me or whatever.

249
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:51,600
But, um, yeah, I've never been one to ask for art with the exception of like the header that cotton candy drew where like, I think I actually asked her to draw that cause I liked her before I was just using a random picture.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
She drew of me.

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,600
But, um, so you would contact me and be like, Hey man, I want to draw this or that.

252
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,600
And the project that we worked on was discorded Digi Brony.

253
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:13,600
So I had this, I had this weird character arc thing where this is going to be hard to explain cause our audience doesn't know my little pony for this show.

254
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Oh, they don't?

255
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
No, this PCP audience mostly is, yeah, it's mostly not pony fans.

256
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
So, um,

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Ah, it's fucking disgusting.

258
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:31,600
In my little pony, there's an episode where this character called discord shows up and he like, change, he basically inverts all the characters personalities so that they'll act like the option.

259
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,600
They all turn gray and they all start acting like assholes.

260
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:45,600
And I made a video about that episode where I Digi Brony gets discorded and he turns gray and he becomes an asshole who hates analysis.

261
00:15:46,600 --> 00:16:04,600
And then, uh, I decided cause in the my little pony community, there's this huge, huge culture of ask blogs on tumblr where people would have like an original character and they'd have a tumblr for it and people would ask them questions and they'd answer it with art.

262
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,600
So it'd be like, you know, like, what's your favorite sandwich to a rainbow dash tumblr?

263
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,600
And it'd be like, they draw a picture of rainbow dash eating some kind of sandwich and that would be the answer.

264
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
You should have a ton of those, by the way, but I'm not gonna even know.

265
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Yeah, I do remember you having more than one, but like, yeah, ask blogs were such a big deal and it always looked like fun and like, I have no artistic ability at all, but I thought it would be fun to have one.

266
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Panels you drew, man. Holy shit.

267
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:39,600
So I would just take my discorded Digi Brony avatar and I would just put him in a panel and just, I would just hand write the text next to him.

268
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Like in this really scratchy, like, angry looking text.

269
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Fairly, it's fucking readable sometimes.

270
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Yeah, and so it was just this weird spinoff of this one video and like, I don't think even a lot of people knew about it.

271
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,600
It was just kind of like a hidden thing that I was doing and I think I did three or four comics and then you were like, hey, your art is fucking garbage.

272
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah.

273
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Why don't you let me take over discorded Digi Brony and I had already like lost interest in doing it myself.

274
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
So I was like, okay.

275
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,600
And your art was great for it, but I had like this whole narrative I'd already concocted that I wanted it to go through.

276
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,600
And I think you probably drew like 10 updates or so before you were like, this is stupid.

277
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
And yeah, either one of us cared anymore.

278
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
And then I was just like, I just messaged you and I said, I was in the middle of an update and I was just like, I hate this.

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
And you're like, you know, you don't have to do it.

280
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
And I was like, oh yeah.

281
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,600
And then I just drew a picture of you like, like Digi Brony getting fucking stabbed.

282
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
And then that was the end.

283
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
It was great.

284
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Yeah, it was truly a radical adventure, a funky adventure if you will.

285
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,600
So did you meet the other PCP guys just through BronyCon?

286
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Okay.

288
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,600
You know how in the last interview we were saying that Davoo is the Ascended Fan?

289
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
It's me, you are wrong.

290
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It was me.

291
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Well, Davoo's actually in the PCP, although I will say Munchy.

292
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I don't know if I'm supposed to tell you this.

293
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
What the fuck is this conspiracy shit?

294
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:22,600
We have been talking about that we would put you in the PCP under the condition that you became a professional artist.

295
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Because we've kind of agreed that the one, like the one glue that holds the PCP together is that all of us work in...

296
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Professionally.

297
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Like professionally in art and we can talk about that aspect a lot, you know.

298
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Because a lot of what we do in the PCP chat is just complain about our jobs and things like that.

299
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I want to touch on this later, but I will say that I am constructing additional pylons.

300
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I heard as much.

301
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Ben made it out like he was going to invite you in as soon as you launched whatever your big project was or something like that.

302
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I guess he knows about it for some reason.

303
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I'll say this.

304
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's about an alligator.

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
And that's all you're going to hear.

306
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Okay.

307
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Alright.

308
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
What were we fucking talking about?

309
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You being an ascended fanboy.

310
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
Yes.

311
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Okay.

312
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I met Jesse.

313
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I don't think independently of you, but it wasn't like you.

314
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
You didn't talk about him.

315
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
It was you just liked a video of his.

316
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,600
That's what I thought about you and Jesse.

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
It was just through liked videos.

318
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I would always search those.

319
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Let's see.

320
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I want our audience to understand this.

321
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:42,600
I have always had a very strong policy to hit like on any videos I like because that's also how I found out about a lot of stuff in the early days when I wasn't subbed to a lot of channels.

322
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Because I would see like Egoraptor liked this video and I'd go find a channel that way.

323
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,600
And I don't think people like everyone always says like likes are really helpful and they never say why.

324
00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:01,600
That's why because if you're if you're on the like main page of YouTube, it shows the liked videos of people you subscribe to and it can be a really big help.

325
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah, it's awesome.

326
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,600
So the first exposure to Jesse I had was fuck cars.

327
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
And that's a great one.

328
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I this idea of revolutionized the way I fucking perceived reality.

329
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:24,600
The idea that somebody gets so mad at an issue that I didn't even consider any of my fucking like I just didn't even think about it.

330
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
They think that someone could get so riled up and peeved.

331
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
It got my blood pumping.

332
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
It made me appreciate like rage is an art form.

333
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah, I always said that Jesse is the Lord of rage.

334
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
If he was a homestuck character, he's the fucking defender, dude.

335
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
He is he's all out and that's what I love about him.

336
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I think it's amusing how I do think Jesse would make an amazing homestuck character.

337
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Yeah, in spite or perhaps because of the fact that he hates homestuck, he would make an amazing homestuck character.

338
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Yeah.

339
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,600
I don't know if his name is the right length of characters.

340
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Six characters for the first name and four characters for the last name.

341
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
So it's like a reversal of the of the main characters.

342
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh, yeah.

343
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
All right.

344
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Well, whatever.

345
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I found out Jesse, uh, Jesse through that.

346
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,600
And I thought he was the fucking like because he had like, like two subscribers.

347
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I mean, I'm only five characters.

348
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Whatever.

349
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Stop.

350
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Anyway, he had like no subscribers.

351
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,600
And I thought, who is this fucking underground like cave hermit?

352
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Like fucking hermaphrodite just just dwelling in the fucking shadows.

353
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
The shadows of reality is between the cracks of space and time.

354
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
He's fucking in between worlds.

355
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
And I just have like, I have a fucking taste.

356
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,600
I have like a little nib, I have a little sip of his true power.

357
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
And just one day he will show it to me in all of its glory.

358
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I will be walking down the street late from fucking like, like I'm out late.

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I'm coming home from work and I will see someone fucking out of the corner of my eye.

360
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I'll turn and there'll be Jesse and he'll just fucking flash me.

361
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,600
But instead of a wiener, it'll be fucking knowledge.

362
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Uh, that's how I thought about Jesse.

363
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Yeah, so how'd you get into contact with him though?

364
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Uh, I, when he, like the first fucking millisecond, he started drying horseshoes.

365
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I thought, finally, I can't draw humans very well, but I can sure draw the little horseshoes.

366
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Oh yeah, you drew his fucking, you drew his pony.

367
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
And he never credited me.

368
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I remember that because he said, um, because he, he had the drowning in horseshoes thing and you drew it and he put it in the, uh, the intro or whatever.

369
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,600
And then he, you also drew the one where it was me and him as the critics from the Muppets.

370
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,600
And yeah, and me and him, I remember him being like, oh, some, some guy, Munchie drew this and like, I saw it and immediately recognized the art style.

371
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I was like, oh, hey, I know who that is.

372
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
And I think I probably explained who you were to him at the time.

373
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh, I wish I could have seen your fucking description.

374
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
He's this, uh, serial killer.

375
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Don't worry about it.

376
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Well, like, I mean, as soon as I learned how young you were, then it was like, from then, because it was weird, because it's such a reversal, right?

377
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Because if you had been a 23 year old guy who was doing the things you were doing, then it seems insane.

378
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,600
But knowing that it was a 13 year old, suddenly I was convinced you were a genius.

379
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Because like, because I don't know any other people who have that understanding of irony at that age.

380
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:55,600
You know, like, um, yeah, you grew up on Homestuck to some extent, right?

381
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Like, how old were you when you started it?

382
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Um, I think Act 4 had just ended, so...

383
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Okay, it's around the same time I got into it.

384
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:16,600
But yeah, I think, like, because there's a lot of kids who are into Homestuck, and I don't think most of them get it.

385
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Oh, I think, like, one percent of them fucking get it.

386
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
I think one percent of the adults get it.

387
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Yeah, I think only I get it, actually.

388
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,600
That's a very jessie scene right there.

389
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,600
But, uh, yeah, like, because I read it all, and I was like...

390
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Cause I had never heard of it before I read it, and when I read it, I was like,

391
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
this is like the most intellectual thing I've ever fucking read.

392
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,600
And then I found out how big it was, and how big it was with kids, and I was like, there's no way.

393
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Like, there's too much to this, there's no way.

394
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,600
But then, when I met you, and you were a big Homestuck fan, and you attributed it,

395
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,600
and I was like, I feel like, even at his age, he gets the idea of Homestuck.

396
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Like, I felt like you got it, even as a kid.

397
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,600
And, uh, and like, you had that same sense of humor that Dave Strider had, or that, uh, that Dirk had later, you know?

398
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Yes.

399
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,600
I very much look up to Dirk in pretty much every way, except for the gay way, but I still look up to him that way, too.

400
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Uh, the part where he explains that when you enjoy something on so many different levels of irony,

401
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,600
then it just doesn't matter anymore, and it's just like, that's one of my favorite parts of the whole thing.

402
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Yeah, I did, too.

403
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I was like, yeah, you can just like whatever.

404
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Like, it's not about, like, at some, at some level, like, with Garzy's wing, for me,

405
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,600
it's like, it's not really ironic enjoyment, because like, I like it because it's bad, but that doesn't mean I'm like...

406
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
You're leaving today?

407
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Why do you have to go back to your hometown now?

408
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
You failed the college entrance exam twice now.

409
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
God damn it.

410
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
It doesn't matter.

411
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I will return later, Rumi Ko.

412
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Bye.

413
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
You are so easygoing.

414
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
That's my favorite fucking line for how angry she sounds.

415
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You're so easygoing.

416
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You are so easygoing.

417
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Oh, that's fucking shit, dude.

418
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
There's parts later where she's like happy, and she's still screaming like...

419
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Like, that's just her natural voice.

420
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
God damn it, dude.

421
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah, man, irony is my fucking bread and butter, and I'm not good at it, but damn it, one day I will be.

422
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
So we all met you at, at a...

423
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,600
So did you know, like, how early did you become acquainted with like, Nate and Ben and Hippo?

424
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Cause I guess you probably followed all of us, right?

425
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Yes, yeah, I followed all of you, Sans Hippo.

426
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,600
I didn't, I didn't, I met him, I really met him at Bronicon, but I found out about Ben and Nate.

427
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Like, as soon as they're, like, as soon as the video started becoming, like, watchable.

428
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah.

429
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Yeah, yeah, so, I found out about them then, and then I was like, oh, these people are all that I like,

430
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,600
and I like, I like the one that's the B the most.

431
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
I like that man the most.

432
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,600
And that's when I started jacking off to Ben every single night, and continued to this day.

433
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Then I, I didn't watch Hippo, I never, I never knew who this man was, but I knew he had a very soothing voice,

434
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
and if I, I touched him, I would probably bruise him.

435
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
If I just laid a hand on him.

436
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
He's very small.

437
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Yes.

438
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,600
I don't know if our audience is aware that Hippo is like five foot one, and probably like less than 90 pounds.

439
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
He is a very, very small man.

440
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I could use him as a toothpick, or as a, as a thing that I used to clean my ears.

441
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Well, by, by Bronicon 2014, you had grown massive.

442
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Because I, like I said, you were about my height before, but by the next year you were like six,

443
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
what, how tall are you?

444
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,600
I don't want to jump the gun because I haven't officially measured it, but I'm fairly certain that I'm six three.

445
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Okay, so you are quite tall.

446
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Yeah.

447
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
And you're currently what, 16 turning?

448
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm turning 16 in three months, yeah.

449
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Which is less ridiculous that you're that tall at that age, but you were that tall at 14.

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,600
And you were there at, at Bronicon, and like every single person who I introduced you to,

451
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
because you were walking, that was the year where you had the pizza suit, right?

452
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Yes.

453
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Yes, it was.

454
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
It was a full body like jumper that was all just pizza.

455
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
By fucking my, my, my years are fucking bleeding together.

456
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
There were, I think the latest Bronicon is the one where I had the pizza.

457
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
I don't know.

458
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Last year, like the first year was.

459
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Well, there was three different years that we were at Bronicon.

460
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
The first one, they weren't there though.

461
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
It was just me.

462
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah.

463
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,600
So, and then the second one, I like met everyone and I was just wearing some like stupid fucking spike cosplay or something because I thought it was funny.

464
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Okay.

465
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
And then the second one, the third one, I mean, was really where I think I dazzled and I pressed.

466
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Impressed.

467
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,600
And everywhere, because everywhere we would go, because here's the thing.

468
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
You're talking very calmly and quietly right now.

469
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I'm sure someone's asleep in your house.

470
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
This is not the munchie I know.

471
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,600
The munchie I know walks into the room like, hey everybody, let's fuck everything up.

472
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Like the munchie I know would yell obscenities at small children.

473
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,600
And the thing is that, because it's Bronicon, right?

474
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Half the people there are autistic and no one can tell the difference.

475
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:48,600
And we'd all be sitting around with some people that I barely know or have just met and munchie would come over and start like just acting like an insane person.

476
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,600
And the reason I would always tell people how young you were is just for reassurance.

477
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Because you look like you look like some crazy 20 year old guy who's coming over and yelling about anal sex.

478
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,600
And everyone's like, there'd always be someone looking at you like, I am scared.

479
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
And then I would go, I would go, how old do you think that guy is?

480
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
And they'd be like, I don't know, like 22 or something.

481
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Yeah.

482
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
And I was like, he's 14.

483
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:23,600
And they'd be like, oh, but it changes the way people look at it because they'll feel bad if they're like, if you're, they just think you're a crazy kid.

484
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
No.

485
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Like, oh, he's just some weird kid as opposed to a scary man.

486
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
To a threat to everyone.

487
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I would constantly, everyone we hung out around, I would explain to them how old you were just for that reason.

488
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,600
It doesn't help that nowadays I talk about school shootings and being like a the Zodiac killer.

489
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Have you gotten into the YouTuber, Monkey Jones yet?

490
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
No, I haven't.

491
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I really appreciate his stuff.

492
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:05,600
He's an anime reviewer, although most of his anime reviews are not actually about anime, who screams constantly and has done a whole audio book on Elliott Rogers autobiography.

493
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Definitely think you'd appreciate it.

494
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
I'll link you his video that went viral that me and Jesse found him through.

495
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
It's great.

496
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
But I love him.

497
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Anyway, sounds great.

498
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Yeah.

499
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You hung out with us at BronyCon and we did this drawing thing.

500
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes.

501
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
You want to explain that?

502
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
How it worked?

503
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Ben pioneered it and he would basically cut up, not cut up, but like draw a line through a piece of paper and there would be four panels.

504
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,600
The first person would draw the first panel, then he would pass it on to the second person and they would draw the second panel.

505
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
And basically they had to make a story like fucking like hot potato style.

506
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Right.

507
00:31:44,600 --> 00:32:01,600
The first year's crops were like painstakingly reimagined and re-digitalized on the computer by Ben himself and posting on the TPC, not the TCP, the fucking whatever that stupid show was that I don't care about that I love.

508
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Oh, now we've got to put them on the TPC subreddit so that people can see it when we post the story.

509
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Yeah.

510
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Oh, fuck yeah.

511
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
What's his name?

512
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Steve, you've got to find that shit dude.

513
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I swear.

514
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Your ass is going to be fucking butter and I'm going to be eating toast.

515
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
You can't have toast with butter.

516
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,600
So to clarify though, the way it worked is that you had to draw the panel in like five minutes, right?

517
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Yes.

518
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
It's like on a timer and then you could, but you could start with whichever one you wanted.

519
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Like each person got whatever, like if you wanted to draw panel three first, then you could do that and then the other people had to imagine the story up to or from that point.

520
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I don't know if it was that we were on a, I don't think we were on a timer.

521
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
It was just fucking impatient.

522
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Well, the second year we definitely had an actual timer, but yeah.

523
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:54,600
So the first year it was like you and Ben, I don't even know how you, like how did it get, how did that get organized?

524
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Like you just sat next to him and he started doing it or what?

525
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Like did he even know you were an artist?

526
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Oh yeah, yeah.

527
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:10,600
The first time I ever met Ben and I just walked over and I said, hey, I'm Munchie and then he like, like looks over you very nonchalantly.

528
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Just like looks like just fucking peeks a second.

529
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,600
Then looks back to me and then he just says, I've heard a lot of things about you, Munchie.

530
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,600
I guess I must have told him about you.

531
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,600
To say I just wonder like what fucking lies have you been feeding him?

532
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Because of all the reasons that we've talked about, I've always considered you one of my most interesting fans.

533
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:42,600
So like when people ask me about like, you know, what is it like to have fans or what are some of your fan experiences?

534
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Like you are one of the, because it's a positive story overall, you know, like it's that unique mixture of funny but not creepy.

535
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Like if I talked about some other people that may have been named earlier, you know, that didn't go so well.

536
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:11,600
But like, yeah, it makes for, I've probably told a lot of people about the 13 year old who looks like a man and draws really well and eventually did all my avatars, you know.

537
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Yeah.

538
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,600
That's how I met Ben. And we were at the who's line is it anyway.

539
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,600
And me and Ben thought this was the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone ever.

540
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,600
And so we decided, yeah, we need to either kill ourselves or entertain ourselves.

541
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
And we chose the latter thankfully.

542
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Ben had the news and I had the knives, but we were just an inch away.

543
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,600
And then his date or whatever said, how about we not kill ourselves in front of all these public people?

544
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
And I said, well, you know, being a martyr is fun too.

545
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,600
And then I died. But anyway, the way this is the date we were talking about in Ben's interview.

546
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
By the way, the well-laid.

547
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Anyway, we started fucking drawing and basically who by the way, she left a comment on that.

548
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Did you see that?

549
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I have to see it now.

550
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,600
She left a comment on a Ben's podcast saying I was the one who slept with Ben at Bronicon.

551
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
I wonder what it was like after PM for the Deeds.

552
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,600
But the three of you and I guess a fourth person did the start of it.

553
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
There wasn't a fourth person. It was just someone who did it two times.

554
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Jesus.

555
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
And then I caught on to this at some point.

556
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Like you guys were doing it in a space that I happen to be.

557
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
And then you're like, let me try.

558
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,600
And me and Ben look at each other and we're like, hmm, okay.

559
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
I know you can't draw at all.

560
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
You're just going to make our pedals look shitty.

561
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,600
But then Ben is actually really fascinated with my drawing.

562
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Like he likes my shitty ass artwork because it's so out there and distinct.

563
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Believe me, I'm a fan. I just think it's terrible.

564
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Yeah. I mean, I feel the same way about my own art.

565
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah. I'm a definite fan. Don't get me wrong.

566
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,600
You should draw your own avatar from now on and see how many clicks that gets you, bitch.

567
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,600
So I guess as a result of that, Ben has just kind of walked over.

568
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I guess as a, because of that incident of us all hanging out at Bronecon,

569
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,600
you guys drawing together, Ben has always loved you since then.

570
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,600
He thinks you're super cool, which I do too.

571
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I think anyone who can draw really well in like a style I like is automatically cool.

572
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Well, unless they're a total douchebag.

573
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah. I'm trying to think.

574
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,600
I can't find any douchebags in my database, but I know what you're saying.

575
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I enjoy how, because you are definitely someone who your sense of humor doesn't necessarily mesh with everybody's.

576
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
But Ben seems to appreciate all of it.

577
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Like when you guys did the Nuclear Throne podcast, it was so funny to me when I got to listen to it,

578
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:10,600
because you would say something weird and DeVu would clearly not know how to respond and just be like,

579
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,600
okay, and Ben would like lose his shit.

580
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,600
He was so down for every weird thing you said.

581
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,600
And Hippo loves it. He said of you after meeting you at the second Bronecon,

582
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,600
he said, Munchie says all the things I am thinking.

583
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Like every time we're in a situation, like whatever pops into my head,

584
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
the crazy thing I don't do, Munchie does.

585
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,600
And he said it was gratifying to him, because it would always be that way.

586
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm so glad.

587
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah, but you flew off the handle that year.

588
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,600
The second year was like, you know, I'm going to be like a human.

589
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I'm going to make sure that I make a good first impression.

590
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Second year was, it's time to accelerate space and time.

591
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
I need to bend it to my will.

592
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,600
And my vocal chords after that weekend, oh boy.

593
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I remember at that Bronecon, I have no fucking clue what sparked it,

594
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
but I went up to Dr. Wolf and I saw this video on my phone.

595
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I want to send it to Jesse one day.

596
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
I've sent it to him before, but I think you fully appreciate it.

597
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,600
I went up to Dr. Wolf and I said, did you kill Dr. Indian horseshoes?

598
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,600
And he just looked at me for like fucking 10 seconds and he said,

599
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I have never met Dr. Indian horseshoes and I don't know anything about Dr. Indian horseshoes.

600
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Which is a blatant lie, but we have an answer.

601
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
So he officially did not kill Dr. Indian horseshoes.

602
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,600
It was the media that killed Dr. Indian horseshoes.

603
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,600
It's the color yellow that killed Dr. Indian horseshoes.

604
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,600
And you're actually on Jesse's side in that debate, yeah?

605
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
You're with him on the yellow.

606
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
We're not going to get too into that.

607
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
No, no, no, we're getting fucking into that shit.

608
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Every day, every single day of my life, I have people coming up to me and they say,

609
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,600
you can't possibly think it's like clear, right?

610
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,600
And I just say to them, you need to go back to elementary,

611
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:20,600
but you're not going to be able to go back to elementary because your face is going to be so fucking disfigured from what I'm about to do to you.

612
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You're not even going to be able to show your face in a circus, dude.

613
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
You are going to be.

614
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
What do you mean by clear? What are they saying is clear?

615
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,600
No, they're saying it's fucking yellow and they're like, oh, you can't, you can't say it's not yellow.

616
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
It's clearly yellow.

617
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
And then I'm just, I want to murder.

618
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm going to take out my Zodiac killings, my murder weapons for all the Zodiac killings I did and I use them.

619
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
They're full extent.

620
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Well, that podcast will come out next weekend.

621
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Oh, did you do an actual whole podcast on that?

622
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Well, it's the thing is it was we got into a huge fight about it right before the procrastinators recording last weekend.

623
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
And this has happened a few times where we all get into a fight about something right before the show.

624
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,600
And then if Jesse is involved, he will keep the argument going once the show starts.

625
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,600
So the the topic of it was things you can't get into.

626
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,600
We recorded three and a half hours and about an hour of it is arguing over yellow.

627
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
It is a you're going to love it.

628
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
It's going to be your favorite podcast ever.

629
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Total cluster fuck.

630
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,600
It is madness.

631
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,600
And then the argument ever since then, like after that podcast, Jesse was so mad that he hasn't even been in the chat like all week.

632
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:40,600
He left and he went on Twitter and he started going on this whole thing about yellow.

633
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,600
So like all that was after we'd already been arguing about it for a whole day.

634
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
He went on Twitter and him and Ben started arguing on there.

635
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:55,600
And I'm just like, guys, please, I don't I don't even care about reality or facts as much as I care about not hearing about yellow.

636
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:02,600
And then I made that political cartoon about Ben being colorblind and he was a homeless man who wore a patron shirt.

637
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:10,600
And and Jess was a fucking blonde haired blue-eyed fucking God that just had the words endless tattooed on him.

638
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Yeah.

639
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:22,600
So he still hasn't been back in the chat since but that podcast will come out next week after a few days after this podcast releases this interview.

640
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,600
But yeah, at least it's nice that someone is unequivocally in Jesse's camp.

641
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah.

642
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Is no one else?

643
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Um, I am philosophically but not.

644
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,600
You'll understand when you hear the podcast.

645
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,600
It is a it is a riot.

646
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
A literal riot.

647
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Things get destroyed.

648
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Fucking samurai is going to take all this fucking appliances to Andre now.

649
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
It's going to need to smell.

650
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Yeah.

651
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Tell me some things about yourself.

652
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
You live on the West Coast.

653
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Yeah.

654
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Oh, West Coast for fucking life.

655
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Maybe I live in the most Southwest city on the United States of America, continental.

656
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
I kind of know why Hawaii is a piece of shit.

657
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
I hate it.

658
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,600
I live in San Diego, but I'm actually San Diego.

659
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
I live in another city.

660
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
It's more Southwest.

661
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,600
You're not even going to know the city, so I'm not even going to say it.

662
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
I live in San Diego, basically.

663
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Victor was born in San Diego.

664
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
No way.

665
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Yeah.

666
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,600
That proves that he's my real brother and you're just a fucking faker piece of shit.

667
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
Well, I was born in Oakland.

668
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
We were both born in California, but.

669
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,600
That's good.

670
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
That's good.

671
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,600
California is the where you need to fucking come, baby.

672
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
It's the fucking good life here.

673
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Yeah.

674
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
It's my dad's from California.

675
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,600
So we were out there when we were first born and then we moved across the country.

676
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,600
But you're the only, because the rest of the, all the PCP guys are all like either East

677
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Coast or like close to it.

678
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I know they're all pieces of fucking shit, dude.

679
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I swear.

680
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Devoos in Missouri, but.

681
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Oh, that explains so much.

682
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Jesse's in Michigan.

683
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,600
But the rest of us are on the East Coast and well, except Jeff.

684
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,600
Now we have Jeff who's in like what Vancouver or something.

685
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,600
He's somewhere in Canada.

686
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
He's a Canada.

687
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Subway.

688
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,600
So he might be, yeah, he's closer to you on the West Coast, but yeah, you're a, you're

689
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
a good old California boy.

690
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Yes.

691
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
I would rather fucking die than set foot in another state.

692
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
Except that you went to Brony con twice.

693
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Well, don't worry about that.

694
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,600
It was Baltimore.

695
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
It's basically a fucking ghetto.

696
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,600
Are you planning to go this year?

697
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Are you?

698
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Of course not.

699
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
You people aren't going.

700
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Yeah.

701
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,600
By the way, Nate needs to get fucking on.

702
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,600
We're trying to push for a new con, but he's fucking on his ass not doing anything.

703
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Well, we're all going to go to my house this September.

704
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,600
Oh, great.

705
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
We're having a conference.

706
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
They're inviting me a piece of shit.

707
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Yeah.

708
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
It's not a convention, but a conference.

709
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Oh, great.

710
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
Yeah.

711
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
So it's.

712
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Fucking relive the group poop and get Jesse to draw like a picture of me and just make

713
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,600
him do the munchie voice wherever he goes.

714
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
I bet he'd do that.

715
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,600
He seems to really appreciate you as well.

716
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I'm so glad.

717
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,600
He did that whole video about you.

718
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Yeah.

719
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Just like every line you said in the memes that need to type on.

720
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,600
All the times I laughed, which you should make another one of this video.

721
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Is that what it was?

722
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Was it times you laughed?

723
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
I thought it was just like every single thing you said.

724
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah.

725
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
It was everything I said, but including all the laughs.

726
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
So he just wouldn't.

727
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,600
He would just put every single laugh without the context of why I was laughing.

728
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Just to do.

729
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
Yeah.

730
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,600
Everyone, everyone fucking says that Munchie's laugh is great.

731
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,600
I don't know what's understood.

732
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
I don't fucking understand it.

733
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,600
It's just laugh.

734
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,600
You both have pretty good laughs.

735
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
This has been a good laugh podcast.

736
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,600
It has been a good laugh podcast.

737
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
I will agree.

738
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,600
If anybody's into laughs like in a weird way, this is a good.

739
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
A lot of LOL is in this.

740
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
All right.

741
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
Tell me some stuff about you, Munchie.

742
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,600
I don't know really where to ask because I don't know much of your life story.

743
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
Yes.

744
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,600
What are some interesting facts?

745
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Interesting facts.

746
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:11,600
I was fucking, I was born and then a lot of stupid fucking shit that didn't matter until

747
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
I got on the internet.

748
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Now I'm on the internet.

749
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,600
I started out as a Pokemon mystery dungeon role player.

750
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,600
This is where I connect to DeVoo through space and time.

751
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Space and time because Pokemon Mystery Dungeons travelers or explorers of space and time also

752
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,600
joke because space and time is a real thing.

753
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
Yes.

754
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Anyway, I would do that.

755
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
And that's where I got the name Munchie is because I, oh, Munchlax.

756
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
He's fat and short.

757
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,600
And I was fat and short.

758
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,600
And one point before I became tall and fat.

759
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
And I was like.

760
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,600
It just so happens that me and you are both huge Munchlax fans.

761
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,600
I was so excited when you found out or when I found out that you like Munchlax.

762
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,600
I thought he was so underrated.

763
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
Yeah, I agree.

764
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:56,600
I've always, he's been my favorite Pokemon ever since Destiny Deoxys, the movie.

765
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Yes, yes.

766
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,600
That's the same movie because he would just fucking do nothing and then he evolved Munchlax

767
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
just by fucking just to survive.

768
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,600
There's a part where he like, like he's like, he's always lazy and walking around.

769
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Then there's a part where he like leaps 30 feet in the air just to get over somebody

770
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,600
and then like keeps going and then just eats everything and he's such an asshole.

771
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,600
And I was like, this thing is so fucking adorable.

772
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
I know.

773
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
We're also both really big Kirby fans.

774
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,600
Yes, yes.

775
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Because I am innately attracted to anything that eats a lot.

776
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
Not attracted sexually, but.

777
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,600
Oh, well, that's the difference between you and me though.

778
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Right.

779
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Well, anything that eats a lot I love because I love eating.

780
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
I'm a huge foodie as I always say.

781
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
Most people do.

782
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
You'd be surprised.

783
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
Shade doesn't enjoy eating.

784
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
Shade is a crazy person.

785
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,600
Shade is a weirdo.

786
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,600
Oh, yeah.

787
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Yeah, that's another another funny thing about me hanging out with you is that like, um,

788
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,600
I know a lot about your family life and I'm with your brothers.

789
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:06,600
It's it's funny because of the fact that I I am the type of person who doesn't spend

790
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
a lot of time with other people online.

791
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,600
I think that like you and shade are part of a generation that does that and I'm not like

792
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,600
it to the same extent like I talked to the PCP guys, but it's in a chat.

793
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600
We only ever do calls if it's for the podcast.

794
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
We don't do things together.

795
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,600
We don't like play video games or anything like we talk when we have something to talk

796
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,600
about and we just kind of pop in and out and say shit and it's it's very much like a

797
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,600
like everything is either a conversation or it's business and there's little in

798
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
between, you know, we don't schedule things.

799
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Whereas like I know shade and probably this is true for you too.

800
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Spends a lot of time on Skype with his friends.

801
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
He gets into lots of calls.

802
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
He plays video games with his friends.

803
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Yes, I've never done any of that.

804
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Like when I was growing up, you had local multiplayer where you sat with your friends

805
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,600
next to you and you all played together and I love that me and my friends play fighting

806
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,600
games and shit, but like I don't play online games at all.

807
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,600
And I hate being called.

808
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
You're a busy guy.

809
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,600
Well, but what's funny about that is that I've known you for a long time.

810
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,600
But because I'm not the type of person to do that kind of stuff, me and you don't spend

811
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
a lot of time together.

812
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:22,600
Whereas shade who does that kind of stuff all the time, it's totally normal for him

813
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,600
to get into a call with someone and play video games or something, you know, so or Victor

814
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,600
even when he's not busy will sometimes play games and stuff.

815
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,600
I've been playing fucking smash together and it has been orgasmic.

816
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
I beat the fucking shit up Brandon Tolentino.

817
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
I made fun of them both.

818
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
It's the best thing that's ever happened.

819
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
Yeah, I wanted to ask about that.

820
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Are you like really good at smash?

821
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Like how good are you?

822
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
No, Brandon shit at smash four.

823
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Oh, that's true.

824
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
He is shit at four.

825
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,600
But I mean, are you do you consider yourself pretty good at four?

826
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Because you were talking on Twitter about wanting to have like a Mewtwo for your pocket

827
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
and stuff.

828
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,600
You were using kind of technical fighting game terms for your Mewtwo.

829
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
I do.

830
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
I do.

831
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Yeah, I do.

832
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,600
You know, I do know about the competitive scene.

833
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,600
I don't think I have the I don't have the fucking processing power.

834
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
Smash is very CPU intensive on my body.

835
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,600
And it's hard for me to do the inputs, but I'm aware of shit that happens.

836
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,600
I know shit fuck.

837
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,600
I just I find it very amusing that like, you know who Victor and Tolentino are because

838
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
they do Digi Bros with me.

839
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
Yes, which I fucking love, by the way.

840
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Yeah, and they probably have interacted with you.

841
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,600
Well, maybe not Tolentino, but like, no, no, he has more than me is what I meant to say.

842
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
Oh, yeah.

843
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Just because and this is probably true for a number of people who watch shows like that

844
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,600
because it's just funny because with something like Digi Bros.

845
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:57,600
The people involved don't think of it as their show like Victor Victor now does like over time

846
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
he's come to think of it as like our show.

847
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,600
But like when I get my friends on there, none of them care that much about it.

848
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,600
Like they have no real interest in the show itself.

849
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,600
They just it's something to do, you know, and then like when it comes out, it's like, oh, yeah, it's out now.

850
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:18,600
But then they're all way more receptive to like accepting every friend request they get on Instagram.

851
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Because they're not famous people who are getting that all the time, you know, like for me,

852
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,600
if I give out like my Snapchat or something, I'll have a hundred fucking thousand Snapchat friends

853
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,600
sending me pictures of their dick and shit, you know, whereas like for smaller people,

854
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,600
that's another thing that you might appreciate about that monkey Jones guy is that he's very audience interaction.

855
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Like he gives out a Snapchat freely.

856
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
He responds to lots of comments and stuff.

857
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,600
So which I love, I love that he does that, but I can't see myself doing it because I know it would at the level of popularity

858
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,600
I have, it would take up too much of my time to constantly interact with fans.

859
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:01,600
And I would eventually get weirdos who I don't like who the biggest problem for me is when you have someone who

860
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,600
like doesn't understand that I have lots of people vying for my attention and you have none.

861
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Yes.

862
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Those those people.

863
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,600
I felt that ever since I was in the means that need to die.

864
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah.

865
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,600
I fucking amassed a cult following and I hate them all.

866
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:27,600
There's like a weird it's like because when when someone doesn't have a lot of friends, then and you talk to them,

867
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,600
then it's like they want a lot of your attention and you can't give a lot of your attention.

868
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,600
You know, and I always get like one or two people like that where it'll be someone who, you know, it's like they're they're

869
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
not they're not a bad person.

870
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:47,600
It's not that I don't like talking to them, but then they'll message me all the time and I'm like, dude, I've got a lot of stuff to do

871
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,600
and I've got a lot of people who want my attention and I know you don't get it because I'm your only friend,

872
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
but I can't be your only friend.

873
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,600
I don't have time, you know, that's why you're talking about how this is like, like I can't relate to this,

874
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,600
but I've literally only related to this because of fucking you people.

875
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
You people have like got me on the podcast.

876
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
Have you really gotten people that like that?

877
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Yes.

878
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,600
Yes.

879
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Yes.

880
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,600
They're probably listening, by the way.

881
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
I know they're all listening.

882
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
I hate every one of you.

883
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
I don't remember any of your names and I don't like you.

884
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
All right.

885
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,600
You gotta you're the you are our eyes on the inside.

886
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Yes.

887
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
I've been waiting for this the chance to talk to you about this.

888
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,600
Yes.

889
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Let me see what they're up to right now.

890
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,600
What what the fuck is the PCP fan club?

891
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,600
We need to know.

892
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:43,600
The PCP fan club is a chat that has the name the PCP fan club and is really just a bunch of fucking dweebs and losers who don't

893
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:48,600
understand the PCP nor its artistic integrity and just think it's another run of the mill podcast.

894
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,600
And they don't fully understand how amazing and fucking incredible it is.

895
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,600
And they are just a bunch of fucking normies and retards and I hate them all.

896
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,600
They're none of them are cool.

897
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,600
And there I wish I hadn't joined.

898
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,600
I only joined because I thought, oh, they're going to fucking talk about how great I am.

899
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
Which is true.

900
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
And I whenever here, I'm gonna press one, one, one and chat right now.

901
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
And I can't fucking to you in five seconds.

902
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Someone else is going to say one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

903
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,600
I'll talk back in a second.

904
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,600
But anyway, they're fucking all scum and I hate them.

905
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,600
So do they actually talk about the PCP there?

906
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
No.

907
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay, I didn't think so.

908
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,600
Like, like, like, if someone put out a video and someone puts it, it will be like, cool.

909
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Daveau is a guy.

910
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,600
And then they'll be like, hey, want to be my boyfriend?

911
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Here's a dating channel I made.

912
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,600
That's always how it is.

913
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Like, I, I hate, I hate fandoms.

914
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
I've come to hate fandoms.

915
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Because people don't use fandoms to engage with the work.

916
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,600
They use it to engage with each other.

917
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,600
And the work becomes just the, the means to facilitate it.

918
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Yes.

919
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,600
You know, we're like, I mean, most of the best pony art back when we were in the pony days,

920
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,600
like a lot of the best art was from people who didn't interact at all.

921
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,600
You know, like, like music wise, I think everyone respected so great and powerful, right?

922
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Dude had no internet presence.

923
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
He would never talk to anybody.

924
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,600
He would delete his own fucking.

925
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Do you remember his fucking Tumblr dude?

926
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,600
That Tumblr was nothing.

927
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
It was literally nothing.

928
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
And then he just erased himself from the internet and disappeared.

929
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,600
But like, he, because to him, it wasn't about the social aspect.

930
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,600
He just wanted to make music.

931
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,600
And then he hated all of it and got rid of it all.

932
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,600
He was definitely a weirdo, but like, nonetheless, he wasn't, he wasn't in it for like, there

933
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,600
was so many of the pony musicians who really just were in it because they made friends

934
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,600
that way and they kept making that content because they had friends there that they didn't

935
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,600
want to lose or an audience they didn't want to lose.

936
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,600
And they make a lot of money at conventions.

937
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Really, most of the fucking pony shit was bad and I only made the good art.

938
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,600
And I fucking blessed the world when I sent out my fucking ask blog about Fuller Shy,

939
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,600
who was a pervert and hang out in bathrooms and constantly hit on everyone that went there.

940
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Yeah.

941
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,600
I, I hate, I think I really hate, I hate forums.

942
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,600
I hate like fan clubs that are like chats and stuff.

943
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Not that I hate the people who are in the R fan club.

944
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Like you guys are fine.

945
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Oh, I do.

946
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,600
I do.

947
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
But well, you've been there.

948
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,600
I hate them.

949
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
You have reason.

950
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,600
But like, I hate the concept of it.

951
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:29,600
What I like is like reddits where it's like everything on there is relevant content and

952
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
the discussion is about the content.

953
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,600
It's not like, if you go on Tumblr or I mean on Reddit and you go into some thread and

954
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,600
you're like having a conversation with your buddy in the thread, then that thread gets

955
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
deleted.

956
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
You know, it's not relevant.

957
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
So I do like that.

958
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
I do like that.

959
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Yeah.

960
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,600
That's why I think those things are cool or like 4chan where no one even has an identity.

961
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Yes.

962
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,600
That's, I mean, I'll talk about how much I hate 4chan and I really fucking hate 4chan.

963
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,600
But you hate 4chan from experience.

964
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Yeah.

965
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,600
Yes.

966
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
Oh, I go on 4chan every single day of my life.

967
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Yeah.

968
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,600
I just hate it.

969
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Talk about 4chan.

970
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
Tell us about it.

971
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,600
All right.

972
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,600
I got interested in 4chan for the MLP board as I'm sure a couple of people did.

973
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
I don't know if you were into 4chan at all.

974
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
I was into it way before that.

975
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
I've been on 4chan since the mid-2000s.

976
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
Oh, okay.

977
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,600
Well, perfect.

978
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Anyway, I got through that and I thought, these people are funny.

979
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:29,600
And then a second, like a week would by, I thought, oh, these people are the same every

980
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,600
day.

981
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Oh.

982
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,600
And then I eventually just branch out to other, like, oh, video games.

983
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,600
I like video games.

984
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
This board isn't about video games.

985
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
And then I just branch out through there.

986
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
And I go on there every day.

987
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,600
There's always a thread that will make me laugh every single day.

988
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,600
But most of the threads are things that make me want to die.

989
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Yeah.

990
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,600
And that's the push and pull of fucking 4chan.

991
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,600
I always say that what makes 4chan work for me is that I don't read it because I go on,

992
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
I have my 4chan in catalog mode.

993
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
And I'll go on A and I'll look for it.

994
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,600
By the way, I told you about that.

995
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,600
I told you to put it in fucking catalog mode like a fucking year, like a year or two ago.

996
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
And you're like, no, I can't read.

997
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
I can't read the threads about.

998
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,600
The funny thing, yeah, I remember that.

999
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,600
And I didn't use it for a long time.

1000
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,600
But then I got this thing.

1001
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:26,600
It was some kind of 4chan like sweet, like mod sweet thing for Chrome where it changes all this stuff.

1002
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
It made it more convenient.

1003
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,600
And it automatically set it to catalog mode.

1004
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,600
And it was like a pain in the ass to change it back.

1005
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,600
And then I realized that catalog mode was way better.

1006
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Yes.

1007
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
So I'll go through it.

1008
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,600
I'll find a thread that looks interesting.

1009
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,600
And I found that it's not just that the images are the best part of 4chan.

1010
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,600
But when someone wants to write a post on there and they put an image next to it,

1011
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,600
those are always the people who work the hardest on their writing.

1012
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Yes, exactly.

1013
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,600
If you only read stuff that has an image next to it, you will read the real thread.

1014
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Just ignore all the other shit and just read the ones with images.

1015
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
And you'll get the actual perception of what's happening.

1016
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Not that you'll agree with all of it, but it'll be a much better thread.

1017
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
I've employed this myself.

1018
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,600
Whenever I'm in the Homestuck threads on code because I want to kill myself,

1019
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,600
I always, whatever I want to shitpost about how much I hate Homestuck,

1020
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Andrew Hussie, and Undertale, even though I love Undertale,

1021
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,600
I will just have no image in the Lobby Lowercase.

1022
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,600
But then, when I want to make an actual post about Homestuck,

1023
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:35,600
I will use Dirk's fucking his writing style,

1024
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
and I will put an image of Calibur next to it.

1025
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
That's how you know it's me.

1026
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
I see.

1027
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,600
Does anybody recognize you that way?

1028
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
No, of course not.

1029
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Say stuff about, I have to pee really bad.

1030
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm just going to mute myself and turn up my volume so I can hear in the bathroom,

1031
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
and you can just keep talking.

1032
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
No, yeah, here, I'll keep talking.

1033
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,600
West Philadelphia is born and raised.

1034
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,600
It's been most of my days.

1035
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Chillin' out, laxin' out, outside of school,

1036
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,600
and a couple of guys were up no good and started making trouble in my neighborhood.

1037
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Got two little fights with my mom, got scared,

1038
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,600
and said, you're moving with your uncle and got a fucking belly or something.

1039
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,600
I do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

1040
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,600
I'm Will Smith, and I'm going to go beat my kids.

1041
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,600
I'm going to make them star moves they don't want to star in.

1042
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,600
I'm going to make sure they are just like me,

1043
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
and I'm Will Smith, and I hate everything.

1044
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
When I beat my wife, I'm going to beat my kids.

1045
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
I'm going to beat myself in the afterlife.

1046
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
Every person I kill will become a slave in the afterlife,

1047
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,600
and I'm going to be the king of the afterlife, baby.

1048
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,600
My name is Will Smith, and I'm going to be the slave master.

1049
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
I'm going to become the slave master in heaven.

1050
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,600
That's going to be my name.

1051
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,600
Slave master Will Will Smith.

1052
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
My name is Will Smith, and I'm going to beat my wife.

1053
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
Alright, now that that's over,

1054
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
now that that devilish topping is over,

1055
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,600
I was watching some documentaries about the zodiac killer earlier,

1056
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,600
and you know how the guy, the zodiac killer,

1057
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,600
killed these people, he tied them up next to a lake of some sort,

1058
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,600
I don't remember what the lake was called,

1059
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,600
and then he had this executioner outfit on?

1060
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,600
That fucking police sketch of what he would look like

1061
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,600
with the executioner outfit on.

1062
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,600
It's so fucking cool, it's such a cool character design.

1063
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,600
It looks like a fucking moral combat character,

1064
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,600
or some sort of like, like doom character.

1065
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,600
So I have a couple of images I have been drawing

1066
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,600
of what the executioner like outfit.

1067
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,600
Now you got to say, I really like the character design,

1068
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,600
and I might use it in my upcoming project.

1069
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
It has like a background character,

1070
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
just an executioner background character.

1071
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Okay, I'm back.

1072
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,600
Yeah, I talked about Will Smith beating his kids,

1073
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
and I talked about the zodiac killer.

1074
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Yeah, I heard.

1075
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Okay, good.

1076
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
You know, as I was listening to you do the,

1077
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,600
the Fresh Prince opening,

1078
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
the first thought that occurred to me is,

1079
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,600
you weren't even alive yet when Fresh Prince was on TV.

1080
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
And then the second thought that occurred to me was,

1081
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,600
I calculated your age,

1082
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,600
and I triangulated all the information,

1083
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,600
and I looked at the triangles,

1084
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,600
and I realized 666,

1085
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,600
were you born the same year that fucking 9-11 happened?

1086
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,600
No, no, I wasn't.

1087
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,600
I was a year before.

1088
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,600
It was my first birthday,

1089
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
and everyone was talking about it.

1090
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Was it really, are you born on September 11th?

1091
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600
No, no, I was born on September 14th.

1092
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,600
So it was, yes, it was very close.

1093
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,600
But you did not cause 9-11 with your birth?

1094
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Well, maybe not in this life.

1095
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Maybe not in this life.

1096
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,600
You know, you know how you can't really remember stuff

1097
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,600
from when you were born?

1098
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,600
Maybe I just hijacked the plane and I just can't remember it.

1099
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,600
Yes, as a fucking baby.

1100
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,600
As an infant, you hijacked the plane.

1101
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,600
That's how no one saw me, it's because I was so small

1102
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,600
they didn't look down at their feet.

1103
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,600
I could just crawl away.

1104
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,600
I've always wanted to ask this of someone your age,

1105
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:57,600
like 9-11, does it have any effect on you whatsoever to think about?

1106
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
It's literally a joke.

1107
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,600
It's really funny.

1108
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:10,600
It is funny, but for so much, I don't know why I made that sound like it's obvious.

1109
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,600
Because I was like 10 when it happened, or I guess 9.

1110
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,600
But wait, before we go into this,

1111
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
I just want to say one day in middle school when it was 9-11,

1112
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,600
and we were all outside, we were saluting the flag,

1113
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
I used to stream Tappy Terrorist Day,

1114
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,600
and no one knew who it was, and I got away with it.

1115
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,600
That's awesome.

1116
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,600
Yeah, continue?

1117
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Yeah, just like for everyone always says,

1118
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,600
in all the analysis videos and stuff,

1119
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,600
they're always like, oh, it defined our gender.

1120
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,600
Have you ever watched any movie, Bob?

1121
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
No, and from what you've made it sound like,

1122
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,600
I think I would rather cover myself in gasoline than watch that man.

1123
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,600
It's just funny because he always comes at things from this perspective

1124
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,600
of the historical context, and he has this whole video about

1125
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Spider-Man and its connections to 9-11 and stuff,

1126
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
which is accurate.

1127
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,600
But it's funny to me to imagine someone your age watching that

1128
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
and just feeling nothing about it.

1129
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
Like having no history.

1130
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Yeah, I wasn't there.

1131
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,600
I mean, I'm sure you learned about it in school and shit.

1132
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Yeah, of course.

1133
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,600
9-11, that's when the Jews are burned by Hitler, right?

1134
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

1135
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
To you, it means about as much as learning about World War II for me.

1136
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
I'm like, yeah, whatever.

1137
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,600
It's a thing that happened before I could even imagine.

1138
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Yeah.

1139
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Before I was just a sperm and my father's sacricle.

1140
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,600
So you're like a true millennial, though.

1141
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,600
You were born in the new millennium.

1142
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Yes, exactly.

1143
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,600
I know this sounds like obvious stuff, but I make a point

1144
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
not to talk to a lot of teenagers.

1145
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
You are like the one exception.

1146
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,600
The one teenager who I think is cool enough that I can talk to.

1147
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,600
Believe me, my highest oaks for this interview was to be about age.

1148
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,600
I think that's the most interesting thing about me when comparing myself with you.

1149
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,600
I wasn't sure if you thought it was annoying to talk about all the time

1150
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,600
because I feel like you just brought up a lot with you.

1151
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,600
Mostly, the extent of it outside of you constantly talking about it

1152
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
is we're not going to meet someone

1153
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,600
and then my mom will usually be right next to me

1154
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:17,600
because it's usually a psychiatrist and she'll ask.

1155
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,600
She'll ask, how old is he again?

1156
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,600
And then she'll just say, oh, he's 15.

1157
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,600
And then I'll fucking, I'll bend down, I'll get down on the knees

1158
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,600
and I'll be able to go, she'll be at my crotch level.

1159
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,600
And then I'll say, yes.

1160
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,600
And the thing is, I really do imagine you as this mighty warrior

1161
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,600
because you are giant and you always talk about how you could crush people

1162
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
and I completely believe it.

1163
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,600
You could crush anyone.

1164
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,600
I want to try to describe it because you're not just tall

1165
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,600
but you're not, I don't see you as fat, I see you as just large

1166
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,600
because you look strong.

1167
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,600
I am formidable, yes.

1168
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,600
You don't look like just a fat guy, you look like a big guy,

1169
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,600
like a guy who could probably crush something.

1170
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,600
Which is why we always keep, after last year's BronyCon

1171
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,600
we were begging you to become a professional wrestler

1172
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,600
because you have the personality for it perfectly.

1173
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,600
And by begging you mean Jesse mentioned it one time.

1174
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
I've brought it up all the time.

1175
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
I'm always talking about how like,

1176
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,600
we gotta come up with names for Munchie's wrestling career and stuff.

1177
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,600
Oh, oh, oh, believe me, believe me, I want to,

1178
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,600
I desperately need names.

1179
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,600
I want my custom beat Captain Crunch themed.

1180
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,600
So have you actually considered going into that as a job?

1181
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,600
Well, see, the only thing is I don't know how we would get into that

1182
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,600
but if I, like, if it was just a career option

1183
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
then I would totally take it.

1184
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,600
Like have you watched any wrestling or anything like that?

1185
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
No, I just think it would be funny.

1186
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
Yeah.

1187
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Well, because like, I mean, most of it is just yelling

1188
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,600
and being insane and then throwing people.

1189
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,600
That's most of your job.

1190
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,600
And like, you would be a great like,

1191
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,600
like 90s throwback crazy man wrestler.

1192
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,600
Crazy man wrestler.

1193
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,600
Because that's what a lot like, from what I've got gathered from Jesse,

1194
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,600
the 90s was mostly people just being off the wall

1195
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,600
because they were all on drugs and they would just go crazy.

1196
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,600
My wrestler name would be Zodiac version 2.0.

1197
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,600
Yeah, that would be acceptable in wrestling.

1198
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Like half of them are named after like serial killers or shit.

1199
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
Oh God, I forgot we were talking.

1200
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Oh yeah, you want to talk about age.

1201
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,600
I've come to realize I'm obsessed with age

1202
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,600
because I've started noticing that if I watch my...

1203
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Do you watch any of my vlogs?

1204
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
Like the Digibro After Dark shit?

1205
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Yeah, I watch all your content, you fucking retard.

1206
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
And I hate all of it.

1207
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,600
Stop.

1208
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Yeah, well I know you don't watch anime

1209
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,600
so it's funny to me that you watch all my fucking anime vlogs.

1210
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
By the way, have you seen my Mal by the way?

1211
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,600
No, I have not.

1212
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,600
I have watched including like, like movies,

1213
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,600
like the two girl in the gun movies, including all those.

1214
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I have watched 10 anime before.

1215
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,600
What are they?

1216
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,600
They're fucking, they're, they're, they're

1217
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,600
Popey the Clown, fucking girl in the gun movie.

1218
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,600
Oh, you've actually seen Popey the Clown?

1219
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Holy shit.

1220
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
I love that shit dude.

1221
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,600
It's like the most obscure thing you could possibly have named.

1222
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
I love it.

1223
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,600
I'm not surprised you love it.

1224
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm just surprised you've heard of it.

1225
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,600
I was introduced to it by a friend who watches this.

1226
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,600
Hi.

1227
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,600
Because I only know one, I haven't seen Popey the Clown

1228
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,600
but there's a friend of mine named,

1229
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,600
there's a friend of mine called Shin Maru

1230
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,600
who's like obsessed with it.

1231
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Like he found it like a few years back,

1232
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,600
like, like no one had heard of it and he found it

1233
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,600
and he was like, what is this masterpiece?

1234
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,600
And made it his avatar.

1235
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Popey the Clown.

1236
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
That's what the intro is.

1237
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
I see.

1238
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Yeah, I'm impressed you've seen that

1239
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,600
but what are the other 10?

1240
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,600
Here, here, it's, it's just all fucking,

1241
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,600
it's Ava just fucking newbie shit.

1242
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
It's a...

1243
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
Ava's not that.

1244
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,600
I mean, I guess it's, I guess it's newbie shit

1245
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,600
and that most people know about it,

1246
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,600
but it is great, you know.

1247
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,600
If I think newbie shit, I think Naruto, you know.

1248
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
I have never seen a fucking episode of Naruto.

1249
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,600
Yeah.

1250
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,600
I mean, you're kind of too young to have seen Naruto.

1251
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,600
It's kind of before your time, like it's mid-2000s.

1252
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
Yeah.

1253
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,600
Yeah.

1254
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
I grew up with Pokemon.

1255
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Surprisingly, I watched the original Pokemon too.

1256
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
Interesting.

1257
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, I didn't watch like Sinnoh or something.

1258
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,600
Right.

1259
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Well, like if you had gotten into anime at your age,

1260
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,600
the most likely intro level would be like fairy tale,

1261
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
would have been you.

1262
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,600
Like, that's the kind, like that's the big shounen

1263
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,600
that's from your generation of 12 year olds

1264
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,600
would have been fairy tale or like,

1265
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,600
if you're a super lucky hunter-hunter,

1266
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
like the newer edition.

1267
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,600
But yeah, like, pretty much just fairy tale,

1268
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,600
most likely intro level show.

1269
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,600
I don't know if you have friends who watch that.

1270
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,600
The first season of JoJo, JoJo, Stardust Crusaders,

1271
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,600
Killa Kill, Ava, Indoveva, Penny and Stocking,

1272
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Popey the Performer, Gurren Lagann,

1273
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,600
then the two Gurren Lagann movies.

1274
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,600
That's it.

1275
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,600
So, what do you get out of my videos?

1276
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,600
It's just fun to watch me talk.

1277
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,600
I like the character of Digi Bro,

1278
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
he's not a character.

1279
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,600
Yeah, he's not a character.

1280
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,600
It's just a heightened read.

1281
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I mean, when I'm not on camera,

1282
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,600
I'm on the internet not talking, you know.

1283
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
But like, when I talk to other people,

1284
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,600
I don't think the character is any different

1285
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
than the on-camera character,

1286
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,600
so I wouldn't say it's like an act at all.

1287
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,600
And you mostly talk about like, what makes a show good?

1288
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
Yeah.

1289
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,600
Which I really am surprised people think your channel is negative.

1290
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,600
That's another thing.

1291
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
Go ahead and get into it,

1292
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,600
because I'd love to hear someone rip on the people who think I'm negative.

1293
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Well, here, I'll do that in a second.

1294
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,600
You mostly talk about what makes a show good, I think?

1295
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
Yeah!

1296
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
That is what made the show good.

1297
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
Now I don't have to watch it,

1298
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,600
because now I know all that's good about it.

1299
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,600
Yeah.

1300
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,600
I understand that because I watch way more analysis videos

1301
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,600
than I do shows, or...

1302
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,600
For me, it's video games mostly,

1303
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,600
because like, with anime,

1304
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,600
Well, with anime, I know all the shows,

1305
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,600
so no one can tell me stuff I haven't figured out

1306
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,600
unless the rare case someone covers a show I haven't watched.

1307
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,600
But like, when it comes to video games,

1308
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
I barely play them,

1309
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,600
but I watch hours and hours of analysis every week,

1310
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,600
because there's so many fucking game channels.

1311
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,600
And so I know everything about all the games that are coming out,

1312
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,600
even though I don't play any of them.

1313
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,600
So like, if we wanted to have...

1314
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,600
We could probably right now have a whole conversation

1315
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,600
about any new game that's out,

1316
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,600
and I would have not played it,

1317
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,600
but I could hold a whole conversation about it.

1318
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,600
There's only one problem there,

1319
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
is that I haven't bought a new game

1320
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,600
between Super Smash Brothers,

1321
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,600
and that's the first game I bought since the Wii U watched.

1322
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,600
I'm almost surprised you're not an Overwatch guy.

1323
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
I was thinking about it,

1324
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,600
and I realized I hated everything about it.

1325
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,600
I think the art style is the worst thing that's ever happened,

1326
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
and I think all the characters are not only boring,

1327
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,600
but their designs are probably the worst thing

1328
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
that has happened in this country since 9-11,

1329
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
and for the Holocaust.

1330
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
I like Widowmaker, and...

1331
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
No, she's the worst one!

1332
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
She is the worst one!

1333
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
She is single-handedly the worst one!

1334
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
She's like...

1335
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
Oh, hot!

1336
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
No, that's what they want you to think.

1337
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
That's what the Jews want you to think.

1338
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,600
That's what they fucking...

1339
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
What about the...

1340
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,600
You know what, actually?

1341
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Here's the funny thing.

1342
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
The girl in the pink robot.

1343
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,600
What's her name?

1344
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
Do you remember?

1345
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Diva.

1346
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,600
Diva.

1347
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
I saw her, and I'm like,

1348
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,600
yeah, she's cute,

1349
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,600
and I liked that she's cute,

1350
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,600
but she's supposed to be like a Korean pop idol?

1351
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,600
I don't know if you've ever seen Korean pop idols,

1352
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,600
but they are fucking beautiful.

1353
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,600
The most attractive people in the world

1354
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,600
are Korean pop idols,

1355
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,600
and Diva is supposed to be like an 18-year-old Korean pop idol,

1356
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,600
and I don't buy it.

1357
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,600
She just looks like a normal Korean girl.

1358
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,600
She does not look like a pop idol.

1359
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,600
Those women are unbelievably godly beautiful.

1360
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
I thought she was supposed to be like a Twitch streamer.

1361
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,600
She's that, too.

1362
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,600
She's like a pop idol and a Twitch streamer.

1363
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
Oh, great.

1364
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Yeah, but I can't believe that she...

1365
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
I can believe Twitch streamer.

1366
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
I can't believe she's a pop idol.

1367
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
She's just not...

1368
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,600
She doesn't have that level of superhuman beauty.

1369
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Yeah.

1370
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,600
Going back to Widowmaker and how I think you may be

1371
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,600
the worst human I've ever encountered,

1372
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Widowmaker is literally frozen.

1373
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
She's like,

1374
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,600
oh, we're going to make attractive character designs.

1375
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
These are what humans find attractive.

1376
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,600
We are robots.

1377
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,600
We've created this in a lab.

1378
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,600
My name is Shadman.

1379
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,600
I run Shadbase.com,

1380
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,600
the worst internet fucking place ever to exist ever.

1381
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,600
My name is Shadman.

1382
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
I'm going to create a character.

1383
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Let's just make it the most cartoony.

1384
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,600
I hate it.

1385
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,600
No good.

1386
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600
It's not good.

1387
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
It doesn't make anything of my rocks.

1388
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,600
It doesn't do any...

1389
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
And I hate it.

1390
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
I don't disagree.

1391
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,600
And I especially hate Tracer's design,

1392
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,600
because she looks like if someone tried their hardest

1393
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
to just make Pixar,

1394
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,600
which is already what Pixar is doing.

1395
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600
I can't stand...

1396
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,600
I hate the Pixar aesthetic.

1397
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Yeah, me too.

1398
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,600
I hate it so fucking much.

1399
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,600
When I look at Big Hero 6,

1400
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,600
all I see is marketing.

1401
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,600
I just see dollar signs.

1402
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,600
That's the best way to say it.

1403
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
You are the man.

1404
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
That's why you're the words, man.

1405
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,600
That's why you're the man with the words.

1406
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,600
Because you know how to make words happen.

1407
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,600
Yeah, and that's what I feel when I see Tracer.

1408
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,600
When they first announced Overwatch like two years ago,

1409
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
and they had that cinematic trailer for it,

1410
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,600
and it had Tracer,

1411
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,600
and I literally thought it was Big Hero 6,

1412
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,600
because that wasn't out yet.

1413
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,600
And someone showed me that trailer,

1414
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,600
and I thought it was a trailer for Big Hero 6,

1415
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
and I was like,

1416
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,600
wait, this is like a Blizzard game?

1417
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,600
This just looks like a generic Pixar movie,

1418
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
and I hate the way Tracer looks.

1419
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
I hate all fucking 3D animated movies.

1420
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,600
They need to go.

1421
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,600
All of them?

1422
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,600
What one do you think is good?

1423
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,600
I like Frozen.

1424
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
I like Zootopia, it was okay.

1425
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,600
I thought Frozen was super boring.

1426
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,600
I like Zootopia actually.

1427
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,600
You know what's funny is,

1428
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
I saw Frozen,

1429
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,600
and I loved it back at the time,

1430
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,600
and then it got really popular,

1431
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,600
and I started feeling like it was overrated,

1432
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,600
and it beat some movie I wanted to win

1433
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
at the Academy Awards,

1434
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,600
and I was like,

1435
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
this is fucking bullshit, right?

1436
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,600
And then like,

1437
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
and then,

1438
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
but at the time that I saw Frozen,

1439
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,600
I made an analysis video of it,

1440
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
with me and Clover Keen,

1441
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
where we had our alpacas.

1442
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Do you remember that?

1443
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Yeah, of course.

1444
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Yeah, I remember everything you've ever done.

1445
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Well, me and DeVoo did commentaries

1446
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,600
on that whole era of my videos

1447
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,600
that are for patrons,

1448
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,600
and we watched that video,

1449
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,600
and I made all these great analytical points

1450
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
in that that I didn't remember at all.

1451
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,600
And I was like,

1452
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,600
whoa, Frozen is deeper than I remember.

1453
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,600
I was impressed with my own analysis,

1454
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,600
which is not usually the case

1455
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
for my older videos.

1456
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,600
They're usually garbage.

1457
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,600
But that one, I was like,

1458
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,600
oh my god, this is intelligent.

1459
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
Yeah, I thought Frozen was boring,

1460
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,600
and I hated all of them.

1461
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Wait, that's not even a Pixar movie.

1462
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
No, it's a Disney movie.

1463
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
We were talking about 3D movies.

1464
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,600
I thought it was boring,

1466
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,600
and I thought the character design

1467
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,600
made me thought I wanted a guy.

1468
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Did you like Tangled?

1469
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,600
I don't remember Tangled.

1470
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,600
I remember I saw it when it came out,

1471
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
and I thought, yeah,

1472
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
I don't remember why.

1473
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Same here.

1474
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,600
I feel exactly the same.

1475
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
When I first saw it,

1476
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,600
it was at a time when I hadn't seen

1477
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,600
any movies in a while,

1478
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,600
and I was like,

1479
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
this is my favorite movie ever.

1480
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,600
And then like a year later,

1481
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
I don't remember anything about it.

1482
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Yeah.

1483
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,600
Or didn't rather.

1484
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,600
Yeah, I don't know.

1485
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,600
I don't know what 3D movie

1486
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,600
I could bring up that maybe you'd like.

1487
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,600
Wreck-It Ralph was like,

1488
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
I, like, whatever.

1489
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,600
That was pretty okay.

1490
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,600
Yeah.

1491
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,600
I liked it.

1492
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,600
I'm the glitch, man.

1493
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,600
It's in my code.

1494
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Kanye Weld.

1495
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,600
Do you know that from my videos?

1496
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,600
I feel like...

1497
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,600
Well, I heard it before,

1498
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,600
but I didn't fully appreciate it

1499
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,600
until you brought it up again.

1500
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,600
And I was like,

1501
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,600
oh yeah, that was fucking insane.

1502
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,600
So I know you've always been in the

1503
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,600
pro-victor camp when it comes to

1504
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
Digibus.

1505
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,600
More than you can ever imagine.

1506
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,600
What is it about Victor

1507
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,600
that you find so attractive?

1508
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
He's funny.

1509
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,600
He's charming.

1510
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,600
He's kind.

1511
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,600
He's gentle.

1512
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
He's always there for you

1513
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
when you need him.

1514
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,600
Well, except that he hasn't

1515
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,600
been around at all

1516
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,600
for two weeks now.

1517
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600
I have seen less than two hours

1518
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
of him in the last two weeks.

1519
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
He's gentle.

1520
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,600
He's kind.

1521
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
He's always there for you

1522
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,600
when you need him.

1523
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
He's got that look in your eyes.

1524
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:03,600
It's like a baby giraffe.

1525
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
Victor's like a baby giraffe.

1526
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,600
When I look at him,

1527
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,600
I feel like I'm at peace.

1528
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,600
Like I'm at Nirvana.

1529
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,600
Not like I've reached Nirvana,

1530
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
but I'm at a Nirvana concert.

1531
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,600
Looking at Victor,

1532
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
he's being at a Nirvana concert.

1533
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,600
Oh.

1534
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,600
You know what's funny is

1535
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
all that stuff I was saying

1536
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,600
about 9-11 to you,

1537
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,600
people who are a generation older

1538
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
than me would say all that

1539
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,600
about Kurt Cobain

1540
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
killing himself.

1541
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
Who the fuck is Kurt Cobain?

1542
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,600
The lead singer of Nirvana.

1543
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,600
Who gives a fuck?

1544
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,600
I hate Nirvana.

1545
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
It was a really big deal.

1546
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,600
I don't even know what it is.

1547
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,600
In like 1991,

1548
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,600
or whatever,

1549
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,600
like around when I was born,

1550
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,600
he killed himself

1551
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,600
and everybody was like,

1552
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
sure.

1553
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,600
You know who I honestly

1554
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
thought Kurt Cobain was?

1555
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
I thought he was Bill Maher.

1556
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,600
I thought he was like a liberal,

1557
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,600
like fucking...

1558
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,600
I thought he was like a liberal,

1559
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,600
like city house.

1560
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,600
You really didn't know who Kurt Cobain was

1561
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,600
till just now?

1562
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,600
No.

1563
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
You just heard the name

1564
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,600
a bunch of times?

1565
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Yeah.

1566
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,600
He was the lead singer

1567
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,600
of Nirvana.

1568
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,600
It's like the most important

1569
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,600
and influential band

1570
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,600
in the 90s.

1571
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,600
And I would always hear him

1572
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
like Kurt Cobain.

1573
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,600
He's always on the red side.

1574
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,600
He's so good.

1575
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,600
He was so great.

1576
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,600
And it was always by like liberal parents

1577
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,600
and I was like,

1578
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
oh, he must be one of those guys.

1579
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,600
Oh my god.

1580
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,600
By the way,

1581
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,600
by the way,

1582
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,600
by upbringing,

1583
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,600
I don't know if this will

1584
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,600
I'm going to wait until you're done laughing.

1585
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,600
Go ahead.

1586
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,600
Uh,

1587
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,600
my upbringing

1588
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
was entirely,

1589
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
entirely,

1590
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,600
reruns of Seinfeld.

1591
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,600
Every single day

1592
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,600
of my life,

1593
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Seinfeld was on in the background.

1594
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,600
No,

1595
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
I didn't watch cartoons.

1596
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,600
I watched maybe like three cartoons.

1597
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,600
After that,

1598
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,600
it was only Seinfeld.

1599
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,600
Only Seinfeld

1600
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,600
for 15 years.

1601
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,600
I know you love Seinfeld.

1602
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Oh, I love it.

1603
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Everyone thinks it's like,

1604
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,600
dude, it's Seinfeld.

1605
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,600
I'm going to murder.

1606
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,600
Wait, are there people who like,

1607
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,600
who think Seinfeld's like a meme?

1608
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Like Seinfeld's great.

1609
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,600
No, yeah.

1610
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,600
Seinfeld's great.

1611
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Larry David is great.

1612
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,600
Jew humor is my favorite kind of humor.

1613
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,600
And I'm being brainwashed.

1614
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,600
It is now that you've mentioned it,

1615
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,600
it's your family at all

1616
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,600
related to Judaism,

1617
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
or at all?

1618
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,600
No, no.

1619
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,600
They are,

1620
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
they are,

1621
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
they are, they are,

1622
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
they are divus.

1623
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,600
I ain't having no that shit though.

1624
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Are they like that hardcore,

1625
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
like divus family?

1626
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
That's,

1627
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,600
no, I don't think no one can be

1628
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
as hardcore as divus family,

1629
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,600
but they're up there.

1630
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,600
My mom downstairs sleeping,

1631
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,600
like I'm going to stop my foot.

1632
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,600
She heard that probably.

1633
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,600
She has like a little fucking shelf

1634
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,600
that just has like a whole,

1635
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
like different pictures of Jesus.

1636
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,600
Just fucking,

1637
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,600
so when she wakes up,

1638
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,600
she can immediately look at Jesus' face.

1639
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600
Are they like Catholic?

1640
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
Cause that sounds like a Catholic thing.

1641
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,600
No.

1642
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,600
I don't know what they are honestly.

1643
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,600
They're just,

1644
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,600
they just believe in God.

1645
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,600
And that's all I know.

1646
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,600
And that's not for me to be.

1647
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,600
You're not having that shit.

1648
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
No, I am not having that shit.

1649
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,600
And then I,

1650
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,600
they were like, dude,

1651
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,600
why didn't you want to go to Easter?

1652
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Or why didn't you want to go to church on Easter?

1653
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,600
And then I just looked at them and I just said,

1654
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,600
uh,

1655
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,600
dude,

1656
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,600
are you really asking me that dude?

1657
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
Do you want to know the answer?

1658
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,600
Yeah.

1659
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,600
Do you want to know the answer?

1660
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,600
Yeah.

1661
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
I don't know if you're prepared.

1662
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
Well, I asked that because it's a,

1663
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,600
it's funny because my family's not,

1664
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,600
in no way do we practice

1665
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,600
any form of religion,

1666
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,600
especially not Judaism,

1667
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,600
but because Victor looks

1668
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,600
very Jewish.

1669
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,600
And we come from like a Jewish ancestry.

1670
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
Victor's like really into,

1671
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,600
like,

1672
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,600
the comedy.

1673
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,600
Like he loves Larry.

1674
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,600
A lot of Woody Allen.

1675
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Yeah.

1676
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,600
Loves Woody Allen,

1677
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,600
loves Larry David,

1678
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,600
loves Seinfeld.

1679
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,600
And like,

1680
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,600
has this like,

1681
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,600
like really relates to like Jewish guilt,

1682
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,600
even though he's not Jewish.

1683
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,600
It's super,

1684
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,600
super funny.

1685
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,600
Oh my God.

1686
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,600
I'm going to,

1687
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,600
I'm going to make a new mean

1688
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
super smash brother.

1689
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,600
It's called Jukill.

1690
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,600
And it's just going to be called Victor.

1691
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,600
It's going to be Victor.

1692
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,600
By the way,

1693
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,600
I've made a whole bunch of fucking me's.

1694
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
I've just been waiting to show to Victor

1695
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,600
for when we finally do the,

1696
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,600
the Digi Bro is smashed for.

1697
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,600
Yeah.

1698
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,600
We were,

1699
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,600
we,

1700
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,600
you guys both got like,

1701
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
there was a time where Victor comes up

1702
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,600
to my room all excited.

1703
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Like,

1704
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,600
we got to do this smash thing with Munchy,

1705
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
like right now.

1706
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,600
And I'm like,

1707
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,600
I think I was like really drunk

1708
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,600
and out of it at the time.

1709
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,600
And I was like,

1710
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,600
I didn't want to do anything.

1711
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,600
And he comes in like,

1712
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,600
I'm excited.

1713
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,600
And I'm like,

1714
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,600
dude,

1715
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,600
I don't even begin to know how to set that up.

1716
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,600
Like I have no idea

1717
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,600
how we're going to capture audio

1718
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,600
from all these,

1719
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,600
because the thing is

1720
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,600
if both of me and him are playing with you,

1721
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,600
then we can't be wearing headphones.

1722
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,600
So that means that your audio

1723
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,600
is going to come out of the speakers

1724
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,600
and get picked up by my microphone.

1725
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Oh fuck.

1726
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,600
So even if you played by your,

1727
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,600
like even if you had,

1728
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,600
you know,

1729
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,600
headphones and a mic and everything like,

1730
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,600
this is why you don't do group podcasts,

1731
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
like a group of people doing a podcast.

1732
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Although,

1733
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
there might be a way to do it

1734
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,600
that only Cider,

1735
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,600
that only Cider knows.

1736
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,600
Because,

1737
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,600
fun fact,

1738
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,600
in the pub crawl,

1739
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,600
none of us wear headphones.

1740
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Because Cider has a bot

1741
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,600
that he puts in the thing with him

1742
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,600
that records everything.

1743
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,600
And the bot records

1744
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,600
each incoming audio itself.

1745
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,600
What the fuck?

1746
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,600
So like,

1747
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
all the audio that's coming into his computer

1748
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,600
is recorded by his bot.

1749
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,600
And so it doesn't,

1750
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,600
it doesn't matter what you have on there.

1751
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,600
Yeah, it's crazy.

1752
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,600
Every call he has,

1753
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,600
it's called Cider Bot.

1754
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,600
And if he taught me

1755
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,600
how to make a bot like that,

1756
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,600
I'd be able to do shit

1757
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,600
with no headphones.

1758
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,600
That's crazy.

1759
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,600
But yeah,

1760
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,600
and like,

1761
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,600
it was hard for me to explain,

1762
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
because like Victor came in,

1763
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,600
all excited,

1764
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,600
wanted to do this thing with you.

1765
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,600
And I was like,

1766
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,600
explaining to him like,

1767
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,600
we can't do it,

1768
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,600
because it's going to sound like shit.

1769
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
And I also don't want to right now,

1770
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,600
because I'm fucking

1771
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,600
completely out of it.

1772
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,600
And he was like,

1773
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,600
mad at me,

1774
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,600
like I was like,

1775
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,600
like a super villain

1776
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,600
for denying this podcast to happen.

1777
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,600
And like, we can't,

1778
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,600
we can't do it.

1779
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,600
Like, I don't know

1780
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,600
how to make it happen.

1781
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
I don't know what you want from me.

1782
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,600
I remember,

1783
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,600
he was super fucking sad

1784
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,600
when he came back and texted me.

1785
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
He was like,

1786
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
I can't do it.

1787
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Conrad doesn't want it.

1788
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,600
And I was like,

1789
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,600
it's okay, man.

1790
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,600
It's okay.

1791
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,600
But after that,

1792
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,600
he completely just,

1793
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,600
it was like,

1794
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,600
I'm never going to even ask again.

1795
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,600
I am never even going to entertain

1796
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,600
the thought ever again.

1797
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,600
He's brought it up a couple of times.

1798
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,600
He wanted to do it.

1799
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,600
Yeah.

1800
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
I didn't think he,

1801
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
he still fucking cared.

1802
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,600
There's just no way of,

1803
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,600
there's no logical,

1804
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,600
like I said,

1805
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,600
for the reasons I just explained,

1806
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,600
I don't know how to organize it.

1807
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,600
Like,

1808
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,600
I mean, I've had it in mind.

1809
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Like it would be fun to do,

1810
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,600
but I would need the method

1811
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
by which to do it.

1812
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,600
I hate,

1813
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,600
that's why I hate doing stuff

1814
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
all over the internet like that,

1815
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,600
because it's such a pain.

1816
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,600
That's why Digi Bros.

1817
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,600
is always just whoever's next to me.

1818
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
And I've never done like a,

1819
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,600
like,

1820
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
over the internet guest Digi Bros.

1821
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,600
for that reason.

1822
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,600
That's why you need to,

1823
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,600
you need to make Victor,

1824
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,600
you need to,

1825
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,600
like,

1826
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,600
without him knowing,

1827
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,600
take out,

1828
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,600
you know how he's like,

1829
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,600
rushing around to find a job?

1830
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,600
Get him like some sort of,

1831
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,600
like fucking backwater Chinese job.

1832
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,600
And all of his fucking profits,

1833
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,600
like 99%,

1834
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
doesn't go to him.

1835
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,600
It goes to a fucking secret fund

1836
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,600
that you have at City Bank.

1837
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,600
And all that fucking money,

1838
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,600
it will accumulate over time

1839
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
and it will be a,

1840
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,600
like a plane ticket.

1841
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,600
No, not even a plane ticket,

1842
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,600
a bus ticket.

1843
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,600
For me to go all the way over to your house,

1844
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,600
and I'll just show up unannounced.

1845
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:38,600
And it'll be like,

1846
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,600
did you,

1847
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,600
I mean,

1848
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
whatever the fuck,

1849
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,600
why am I getting paid

1850
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,600
literally two nickels

1851
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
for 300 hours of work?

1852
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,600
And then I'm gonna,

1853
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,600
you're gonna walk over the door

1854
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,600
of your fucking castle,

1855
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,600
and you're gonna say,

1856
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,600
this is why Victor,

1857
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
and I'm gonna walk in with my bombs.

1858
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,600
And then you're gonna just,

1859
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,600
all the walk bar,

1860
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,600
and blow us all up.

1861
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,600
Yep, it's all over.

1862
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,600
This is what you've been

1863
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
waiting for is terrorism.

1864
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Oh, God.

1865
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh, should I have the pee again?

1866
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,600
Why would you fucking pee?

1867
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,600
I've been drinking,

1868
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
this whole time,

1869
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,600
I've been drinking like nonstop gin

1870
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,600
mixed with orange juice,

1871
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,600
and it's a,

1872
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,600
I don't know,

1873
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,600
it's messing me up.

1874
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,600
Just, just get a little,

1875
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,600
like two.

1876
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,600
But now I'm out of orange juice.

1877
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,600
Just a little tube

1878
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,600
and I'll re-route here,

1879
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,600
toilet, dude.

1880
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,600
That's what I have.

1881
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
I know you haven't had time

1882
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,600
to listen to tonight's

1883
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,600
procrastinator podcast,

1884
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,600
but we talked a lot about piss

1885
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
in it for some reason.

1886
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,600
Uh, it's a poor part of life.

1887
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm gonna go to the bathroom

1888
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
again so you can just keep

1889
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,600
talking again.

1890
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,600
Pokemon, it's the biggest

1891
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,600
winner ever choice.

1892
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,600
Oh, wait, no,

1893
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,600
I'm not gonna do that with

1894
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,600
no one shit.

1895
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
To be a master,

1896
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,600
a Pokemon master.

1897
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
To be a master,

1898
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,600
I think it's Pokemon master again.

1899
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,600
Do, do, I'm gonna beat Pikachu.

1900
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,600
My name's Will Smith

1901
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,600
and I'm a Pokemon trainer.

1902
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,600
I'm gonna beat Pikachu.

1903
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
I'm gonna beat Misty.

1904
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,600
And I'm not gonna beat Brock

1905
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,600
because he could probably beat me up

1906
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,600
because he's taller than me probably.

1907
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,600
I don't know how to tell Brock

1908
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,600
his beast.

1909
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Probably taller than me,

1910
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,600
so I'm not gonna beat him up.

1911
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,600
But I'm gonna beat up

1912
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,600
all the people who are shorter than me.

1913
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,600
I'm gonna pick on people

1914
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,600
who aren't my same size.

1915
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,600
I'm gonna force them

1916
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
to be in movies

1917
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,600
and they don't want to be in.

1918
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,600
Uh, my name is Will Smith

1919
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,600
and I'm a bad Pokemon trainer.

1920
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,600
I'm a Team Rocket group.

1921
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,600
I'm gonna make sure

1922
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,600
that they, uh,

1923
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Pokemon aren't just not,

1924
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,600
but you're just not

1925
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,600
have the same fucking skills.

1926
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,600
They do not develop properly.

1927
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,600
They have fucking anxiety disorders

1928
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,600
and they grow up

1929
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,600
because I'm constantly beating them

1930
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,600
for doing well.

1931
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,600
You know, no matter what,

1932
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,600
no matter the outcome,

1933
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,600
I still beat them.

1934
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
My father did to me.

1935
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
I'm gonna do it to my kids.

1936
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,600
Will Smith,

1937
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,600
the Pokemon trainer.

1938
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,600
I'm gonna do it to my kids

1939
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,600
and my Pokemon.

1940
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,600
And it's just not

1941
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,600
gonna be pretty for anyone.

1942
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,600
I'm telling you, dude,

1943
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,600
you gotta stop this.

1944
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:53,600
This is a plea for help.

1945
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,600
Right now,

1946
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,600
I'm on the fucking phone

1947
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,600
with the police commissioner.

1948
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,600
I'm telling them

1949
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,600
about how I'm gonna

1950
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,600
fucking shoot up some schools

1951
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
of Pokemon, Pokemon schools.

1952
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,600
And I'm leaving a message

1953
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:03,600
and no one's gonna take me

1954
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,600
seriously until it's too late.

1955
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,600
I'm gonna think,

1956
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,600
oh, just crazy Will Smith again.

1957
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,600
Crazy Will Smith

1958
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,600
from fucking Seldon City.

1959
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,600
What are they gonna know?

1960
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,600
They're gonna fucking realize

1961
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,600
it's gonna be too late.

1962
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,600
I'm gonna have shot up

1963
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,600
a Pokemon school

1964
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,600
for Pokemon learning

1965
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,600
where you learn about

1966
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,600
the different types.

1967
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,600
Grass, fire,

1968
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,600
flame, electric, water.

1969
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,600
Don't forget about psychic.

1970
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
To be a master,

1971
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,600
Pokemon master.

1972
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,600
To be a master,

1973
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
a Pokemon master.

1974
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,600
I'm back.

1975
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,600
Hey, welcome back.

1976
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,600
That was perfect.

1977
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,600
Lee time.

1978
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,600
Um,

1979
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,600
hey, Monty,

1980
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,600
I have this impression

1981
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,600
that you're a man

1982
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,600
of liking a few things

1983
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,600
very intensely.

1984
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
Yes, yes.

1985
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
Rather than a lot of things.

1986
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,600
Like, I'm a guy

1987
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,600
who doesn't like anything

1988
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
that much,

1989
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,600
but I like a whole lot of things.

1990
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,600
But you seem to like

1991
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,600
Pokemon,

1992
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,600
Homestuck, Kirby.

1993
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,600
Although you don't

1994
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,600
like Homestuck anymore.

1995
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,600
No, uh,

1996
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,600
it's very complicated.

1997
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,600
Me and Ben and Nate

1998
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,600
and Hippo

1999
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,600
and probably another guy.

2000
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,600
No, not the other guy.

2001
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,600
I don't, never mind.

2002
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,600
I changed my mind.

2003
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Not the other guy.

2004
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,600
We're probably gonna do

2005
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,600
a Homestuck podcast

2006
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,600
once Nate is not

2007
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,600
fucking gay.

2008
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,600
Oh yeah,

2009
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,600
I want to,

2010
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,600
I want to be in on that,

2011
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,600
but I have to read

2012
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,600
the whole fucking thing again.

2013
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,600
Yeah.

2014
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:23,600
Have you seen the ending?

2015
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,600
No, I haven't.

2016
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
I stopped.

2017
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,600
God, I stopped like two,

2018
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,600
two, maybe two and a half years ago.

2019
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Like I just stopped reading

2020
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,600
and then haven't caught up.

2021
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
Well, I mean, most of that was,

2022
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,600
there was a big coming out.

2023
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2024
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,600
I just realized that,

2025
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,600
yeah, that was probably like

2026
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,600
three pages.

2027
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,600
I want to say like Act Six,

2028
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,600
Act Six is where I stopped

2029
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,600
or something like that.

2030
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,600
Yeah.

2031
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
And I just never caught up

2032
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,600
from there, but.

2033
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,600
Uh, yeah.

2034
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,600
You know how,

2035
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,600
what do you think,

2036
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,600
define an ending?

2037
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,600
Um,

2038
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,600
the place where the story stops.

2039
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,600
Yeah.

2040
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,600
And that, that's not,

2041
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,600
that's.

2042
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,600
What are you hoping for?

2043
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,600
No,

2044
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,600
I know you guys happened

2045
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
and what it wasn't.

2046
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,600
It wasn't.

2047
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,600
I know you guys are not happy

2048
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,600
with the ending of host.

2049
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,600
Because nothing happened.

2050
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,600
Nothing happened.

2051
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
Nothing happened.

2052
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,600
Nothing happened.

2053
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:17,600
I mean, I'm,

2054
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,600
I'm very curious about it.

2055
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,600
Like what I'll feel when I get

2056
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,600
to it.

2057
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,600
Because historically,

2058
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:23,600
I've been someone who's

2059
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
never been that bothered by

2060
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,600
non endings.

2061
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,600
But.

2062
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,600
You're going to be like,

2063
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,600
ooh,

2064
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Hidiakiano,

2065
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,600
Andrew Hussey,

2066
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,600
same person.

2067
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Oh, they're so cool.

2068
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Oh, I like them so much.

2069
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,600
What are the other,

2070
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:41,600
what are all JoJo's

2071
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,600
and other things?

2072
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,600
What are all the things you're

2073
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,600
really into?

2074
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,600
What are your.

2075
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,600
I'm,

2076
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,600
I'm big into JoJo.

2077
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,600
I haven't finished it.

2078
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,600
No spoilers.

2079
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,600
You can put spoilers though.

2080
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,600
That was a joke.

2081
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,600
You can put spoilers.

2082
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
Because I fucking hate you.

2083
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,600
In a way.

2084
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,600
JoJo.

2085
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Yeah.

2086
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,600
No.

2087
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Don't laugh.

2088
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,600
It's not funny.

2089
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,600
It's not a joke.

2090
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,600
JoJo is something that I'm

2091
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,600
really into.

2092
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,600
I'm also into Kirby.

2093
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,600
I'm,

2094
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,600
I'm in all the stuff you said.

2095
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,600
I'm also very big into

2096
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,600
chicken wings.

2097
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,600
Very spicy stuff.

2098
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,600
I should say,

2099
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
actually I should broaden that.

2100
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,600
By the way,

2101
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,600
the next time we ever meet,

2102
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,600
I need specifically you,

2103
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Victor and Ben.

2104
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:17,600
These are the three people,

2105
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,600
the three,

2106
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,600
the three men that I've chosen

2107
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,600
to go on my,

2108
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,600
on my quest with me.

2109
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,600
We need to eat hot wings together.

2110
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,600
You gotta bring shade.

2111
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Shade very recently got

2112
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,600
really into spicy food.

2113
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,600
That's fine.

2114
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,600
Yeah.

2115
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,600
I'll bring shade if you

2116
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,600
please to argue with me.

2117
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,600
Anyway,

2118
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,600
we'll eat,

2119
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,600
that's how,

2120
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,600
that's the bro pack I've made.

2121
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,600
We all eat spicy chicken wings

2122
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,600
together.

2123
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,600
That will solidify our

2124
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,600
fucking,

2125
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,600
our ooze together.

2126
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,600
Our celestial ooze

2127
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,600
will be together.

2128
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,600
Our man ooze.

2129
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:46,600
Yeah.

2130
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,600
Our man ooze.

01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,600
Yes.

2132
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,600
Our mayonnaise.

2133
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,600
Yes.

2134
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,600
I like the view.

2135
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,600
Oh man.

2136
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,600

01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,600

01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,600

2142
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:30,360

01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:42,200
watch shows unless I know that I will fucking jizz every single episode okay

2145
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:48,000

2150
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,660
I actually don't think I finish the first episode either. I

2151
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,320
Think I got halfway through and stopped same way

2152
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,400
So every since then wait wait, he wait wait wait so the sentence he said to you was I

2155
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,520
Canty Collection

2156
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:57,960
Like it was like you gotta trust my opinion on things you gotta know that I have good taste

2157
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,400
I showed you those are like not even slightly remotely similar

2158
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:04,920
What a fucking idiot

2159
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,680
Yeah, what a fucking douche, dude

2160
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
So yeah, I very I

2161
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:19,440
I'm very picky and so I only watch shows where I know that I'm going to fucking oh

2162
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,040
every time

2163
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:28,360
So the I think it's it's been too long for me to talk about kill a kill because I don't remember anything about it

2164
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:35,400
I remember thinking oh, it's funny. Also boobs. Also. It's kind of cool and has some stuff to say, but I don't really care

2165
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,800
Yeah

2166
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,800
Yeah

2167
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:44,480
That was just letting my cat into the window. I oh hold on. We just stop talking about anime. I don't even like anime

2168
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,480
Let's go about fucking cats. I

2169
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,320
People okay, Jesse's gonna get mad at me for the same this but and I know this is like some sort of like normie like

2170
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:57,840
Like oh, you can't have this opinion. These multiple have it cats are the worst. They aren't cool

2171
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,840
They don't do anything cool. They haven't done anything. They're like, oh, yeah, they're cute

2172
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:08,800
Yeah, if you can get the right like Facebook angle for them. What's the time that you're fucking assholes and like, oh, yeah

2173
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,840
Oh, I bet you like dog. Yeah dogs are better. They're every way and better

2174
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,600
There's no downsides to a dog and you're gonna be like, oh, but I hate all animals

2175
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,480
Yeah, that's cuz you're a serial killer and I hate you. You're not cool. I

2176
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,440
Don't get like I don't

2177
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:29,600
What do you mean? There's no downsides to a dog. They're they smell bad. They

2178
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,880
Give them a bath you fucking retard loud

2179
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:38,280
They fucking you can train your dogs to not bark all the time. I have they they want attention

2180
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:43,200
And I don't want to give them attention. They don't need attention. They just want it

2181
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:48,600
They'll look up. I mean in fairness the cat was attention to and I can't fucking stand her so yeah

2182
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,440
I mean, okay. Okay. This is my relationship with my dog. I

2183
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:57,720
Love the room. I have no interaction with them and I go down and it's like, oh, yep. Yep. Hey, and I'll be like, hey

2184
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:02,000
I'm gonna spend like 30 seconds. I'm gonna I'm gonna give you the best massage I've ever done

2185
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,560
Then I'm just gonna go on my merry-away and then he'll be like, all right

2186
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,840
Bye and then that'll be that'll be it. And it's the best relationship I've ever had

2187
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:16,000
Including all the women I've been with which is zero. I

2188
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:20,360
Find I find animals to be terrible people

2189
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:27,400
The pretty needy the pretty clingy like I you know

2190
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:35,720
This is gonna sound really fucking weird and and I can hear Nate scratching his head through space-time

2191
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:41,960
At this because he thinks it's weird that I come that I constantly compare unlike things

2192
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:48,160
That like I that I look at porn the same way I look at art or that I look at like food the same way

2193
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,160
Nate stupid alright, I

2194
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,840
compare everything right yeah, and the way I see it like

2195
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:02,160
There's no reason to judge animals on a different scale from how I judge people

2196
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:10,880
Like there it's another living being I don't get why I give them special rights and privileges just because they're not people

2197
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,360
Animals are too dumb to talk

2198
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:19,960
Most of what I get out of people is talking like I can appreciate liking

2199
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:25,520
Like companionship if you like a dog or a cat or something like something that likes for some people the fact

2200
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,280
They can't talk is the appeal they have no opinions about you

2201
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:33,400
They don't they don't care what you're like you give them food therefore. They unconditionally love you

2202
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:39,280
I don't feel that way because what I get out of people is interesting conversations

2203
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:44,880
And I've never had an interesting conversation with my cat and therefore she bores me and so I

2204
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:52,320
All she ever wants for me is to get up out of bed when I'm asleep and let her into one of various doors

2205
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:56,660
That's around my room. So all she ever does is cause me problems, you know

2206
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,840
She's she's adorable. I'll give her that

2207
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,280
She's been around for fucking ten years. So I'm used to seeing her so

2208
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:12,680
You know but otherwise I see I see she's not a good person if she was a human

2209
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,240
I would long ago have been like get the fuck out of my house, you know

2210
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:24,200
That's how I feel about that's that's the difference between you because I have had a lot of meaningful conversations with my pets

2211
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,520
I consult them on pretty much everything I do

2212
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,120
Yeah, they look at me and that's how I know

2213
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:39,160
Okay, if the answer is no then they'll say yep. Yep, and then if the answer is yes, it's like yep

2214
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:43,960
You know much you I've always been jealous of people who who have tulpas

2215
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,960
Yes

2216
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,560
I'm jealous of people who can convince themselves

2217
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:54,400
That's that their own imagination is talking to them. Yes, because I can't do it

2218
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:02,280
I'm not saying those people aren't doing it. I just can't myself. So I am legitimately jealous of like people who are crazier than me

2219
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,560
Oh, believe me. Believe me a son of a gun. I'm crazier than you

2220
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,600
I don't doubt it

2221
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:16,080
The things I could do are things that you have nightmares about

2222
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,840
And the things I do are things that I revel in

2223
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:25,680
I'm a champion. I'm a champion of blood. I hate to potentially bring your mood down

2224
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:30,920
But how do you feel about school? You're in high school, right? Yes. How do you feel about it?

2225
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:36,280
Very interesting relationship about school. I don't want to talk about my individual experience with it

2226
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,880
But okay, well, well, I mean I'll talk about my how I feel about it

2227
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:46,680
But I don't bring up the specifics about the situation. I'm in bad situation. Anyway, I think school is

2228
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,440
The worst thing that has ever happened ever. I

2229
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,200
Think that nothing is ever any good

2230
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:01,200
It is all not good and all the things that are good are not good and they can be good elsewhere

2231
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:05,560
Other than a place that is not good everything about it next to feel bad

2232
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:08,960
I don't want to do it because it's fucking gay and it doesn't make any sense

2233
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,160
And it's stupid and I hate it and it's not even cool. It's not even fun

2234
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:15,920
And it's not even important and it's not even anything. It's gay. I don't like it

2235
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:20,200
It's not cool. All the things that are cool. Like, oh, yeah, like, oh, you're gonna have friends there

2236
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,720
You know, like I don't give a shit

2237
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:26,600
I don't even like 99% of the people the only people I like I like super smash others and I get to beat them

2238
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,000
It's super stretch others. That's the only reason I like it. It's just the shit

2239
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,280
Oh shit, I think I just inhaled a beard hair

2240
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,760
I

2241
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,120
Wanted to ask you because uh, I assume you listen to our school PCP. I yes

2242
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:47,720
I listen to everything. Yeah, and I wanted to know what that was like from the perspective of someone in the high school

2243
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:52,280
Yes, yes, I believe me. I was raring. I was a raring. I

2244
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:59,720
Did it make you want to like drop out and go do other things or something? No, okay, uh, I mean

2245
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,680
Did you want me to

2246
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,680
Hey, man, they might accept you as like a car

2247
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:15,960
Can you imagine me as a clown I would be the best clown ever it would be great. I would definitely pay to see that. Yeah

2248
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,960
Popeys I come

2249
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,920
Yeah, how did you feel though I

2250
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:30,960
Felt like everything everyone said was on point except for anyone ever saying that anything good about school ever happened

2251
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:38,800
That all the positive points. Yeah. Yeah, Ben was like, oh, you know, there's some benefits and then I just wanted to

2252
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,960
Go inside, you know how when you were little kid

2253
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,440
You always want to have the superpower to go inside TV shows and like alter them like be inside

2254
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:50,280
Not really personal. Okay. Well, you're gay and you are stupid anyway

2255
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:55,700
Everyone else has that opinion and you are just an anomaly and you shall be you shall be

2256
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,320
Yes

2257
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:03,920
Anyway, I wanted to do that but with Ben and I would go inside of his dreams and I would make all the dreams of bricks

2258
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,120
They would all be bricks from now until forever like

2259
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:16,720
Like he sees bricks or his dream itself is a break like what is the what is the brick?

2260
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,720
I think that's up for

2261
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,800
interpretation

2262
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,760
I think the art I think art beauty is in the eyes of the Holy I

2263
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:31,460
Think I have a I think I have a mustache hair in my like in my esophagus

2264
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:36,200
What is it like having a beard like that? I don't have a beard, but I don't have a beard like that

2265
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,640
It seems like it would get in the way

2266
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,000
It's definitely in the way. It's it's it's funny because

2267
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,160
The beard the beard is pretty in the way the mustache is super in the way

2268
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,720
Like when I go out to eat a lot of stuff is hard to eat because of it

2269
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,480
I have to constantly wipe

2270
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,600
After every bite and every time I'm out eating

2271
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,640
I think I really need to trim this mustache or just fucking get rid of the whole thing and then I get home

2272
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,200
And I forget and I don't think about it at all

2273
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,560
So it's like yeah, it just so happens at the times

2274
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:13,320
It's most annoying or when I'm in the least position to do something about it. Yes. Yes

2275
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,680
I know how you feel. You know how there's there's like videos on YouTube

2276
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:20,320
Where it's like we found this homeless man a homeless event

2277
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,120
And we took him to a barber shop for the first time in 50 years

2278
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:27,120
And he's finally been able to like see his face and like we've like we like pampered him

2279
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,480
I want that for you not to shave the beard, but just to make you

2280
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,080
Human yeah, just to make you human again

2281
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,280
To be human again will be do do do do that's from the eating the beast

2282
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:44,000
I mean I kept saying that I was going to shave it once the summer came and the summer's here now

2283
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,640
And I haven't done it and it's just I don't know I get very attached to certain

2284
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,840
looks and I'm also lazy, but like when I

2285
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:59,360
I I like the idea of me as a bearded guy like this guy with this big giant beard, you know

2286
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:03,280
It's I'm not saying get rid of the beard. I'm saying make it not look bad

2287
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,760
That's impossible

2288
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:12,240
The way it grows is just too fucked up. There must be a way. There must be there's no way

2289
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:17,120
People people are always like if you just trim it or if you like brush it. I'm like guys

2290
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:23,840
It's not like that. It's the way it grows is just this I have terrorist beard like it looks like

2291
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,560
I I am of some degree of Middle Eastern just not even Middle Eastern

2292
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:35,760
I guess my my my grandparents on my dad's side are were jews

2293
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,560
And this is how their facial hair grows

2294
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,520
Like it's just like a terrorist. Yes

2295
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,600
Every time I've wanted to shoot up a school a hair pops up on my body

2296
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,600
A hair pops up on your body. Is that where all of your hairs have come from? Yes, you're pretty hairy guys

2297
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,920
I'm talking about you. Oh

2298
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,360
Well also me

2299
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,920
Every time I've wanted to impersonate the zodiac killer a hair spot on my body

2300
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,400
What did you how many times do you think I've I've mentioned the zodiac killer?

2301
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
A number

2302
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Is the zodiac was he a real killer?

2303
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,640
I can never remember he tarred

2304
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:21,120
Well, I can never remember if the zodiac killer was a real killer or if it was the character from the movie seven

2305
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,200
No

2306
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,480
No

2307
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:30,000
Who was the killer from the movie seven? Uh, Kurt Cobain. No, not that one

2308
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,240
I

2309
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:42,560
I don't fucking know. I don't watch movies. I hate movies. They aren't cool. They aren't art. Oh, this is why I want to talk about you

2310
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,240
This was uh, uh, Nick put this in like the list, but I don't think he actually put in the list

2311
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:49,040
I think it was just humor in me. Can we talk about how books aren't art?

2312
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,560
I guess sure

2313
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,520
All right, books aren't art. They aren't cool. They don't have any fucking merit. They need to be all be gone

2314
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,800
That's it. What do you have against books?

2315
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,520
Uh, they don't have images their words. I have to look I have to have a book in my hands to read them

2316
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:14,640
Uh, just I don't like I don't like books either for the record. I mean, there's some I I love house of leaves

2317
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,800
Uh, which is a book

2318
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,400
It's one of my favorite things

2319
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,680
But it's kind of an exception to the rule and house of leaves is

2320
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,040
Is a lot like homestuck in that it's yes, exactly

2321
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:28,080
Homestuck is a book, but it's the only book I like because it's not stupid

2322
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:33,040
I mean, homestuck has a lot of pictures in it though. So it's hard to think of as just a it's it's mostly

2323
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,400
It's mostly a book man. There's a lot of fucking pester logs

2324
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,400
Yeah, but there I mean, there's whole video games in it too

2325
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,920
But whatever house of leaves doesn't have any pictures

2326
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,840
But the way you read it is like homestuck and that's very it's very complicated to you

2327
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:54,240
Have to actually move the book around to read it like you have to flip it around and do like go between pages and shit

2328
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,240
It's like a it's a maze of a book

2329
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,480
So it uses the the medium of being a book to the fullest

2330
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,200
There have been books I have enjoyed

2331
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:10,880
But overall I don't like the medium of books as much as I do the medium of moving pictures like it's exactly

2332
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,280
Not even moving pictures. There can be still images

2333
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,840
I mean picture says a thousand words

2334
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:21,360
People ask me all the time books people ask me all the time like why do I stick to anime so much and why not other stuff?

2335
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:26,960
And it's like I I legitimately think anime is the best medium

2336
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,080
Because it has it has all the things it has

2337
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,960
Dialogue it has writing like you can write anything you could write into a book

2338
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,400
You could write into the script of an anime not all of it would make sense

2339
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,480
But you could write it all in there

2340
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,320
You and then you can also add images and you can make them move

2341
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,160
And you can add music and you can add voices like you can do everything to it

2342
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,560
And there's no there's

2343
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,280
There's almost no limitations

2344
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
The biggest limitation is budget, you know

2345
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,040
To what you can or cannot do a lot of the time

2346
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:05,840
I think the seal images are better than moving images in some like in looking home stuck

2347
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:11,520
The page is like they're they're you know, obviously remember some of the great gifts like the day of getting covered in fucking puppets

2348
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:19,600
But then there's just this page. There's just pages where you just there's just a still frame like fucking john looking at jade's dream self or whatever

2349
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:21,840
Dead and it's just

2350
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:28,160
Well, that's that's the funny thing about anime too is that anime

2351
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:35,280
Yeah, well, it's been criticized a lot by like by fans of western animation

2352
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:40,800
Because like all the classic western animation like disney or like tom and jerry and stuff was all about the movement

2353
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:46,160
And the expressiveness of the movement and in japan like originally as a cost cutting technique

2354
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,000
They focused more on the individual images, but over time like

2355
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:55,600
If you ask me what the best looking anime is I always say kill law kill and kill law kill

2356
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:01,760
Is rarely animated and it doesn't even have any moments of like really exemplary animation

2357
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:05,280
It's just that the individual images are all amazing

2358
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:11,120
Like any one shot of kill law kill is the best looking picture frame you'll ever see, you know

2359
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:17,360
And like it doesn't have to move to tell the story well and to be inventive and and

2360
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:23,520
More creative than actual animation is we're like there's parts in disney movies where everything like old ones

2361
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,720
We're like everything's moving and I don't give a single fuck

2362
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:32,080
Yes, I feel the same way the only disney movie I like is Aladdin Hercules if you don't like those ones

2363
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,160
You're not quote because those are actually fun

2364
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:38,320
Those are two of the best disney movies because they're actually entertaining and like have

2365
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:45,840
Interesting characters and Mulan. I like Mulan just because will smith is in it. I mean whatever his name Eddie Murphy. Yeah

2366
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:51,600
Will Smith the the pokemon beater and the child beater and the white beater and the misty beater

2367
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,760
I want that to become a mean by the way if that's not a meme. I'm gonna make someone mad

2368
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:03,280
So what what do you spend most of your time doing munchies? I spend most of my time working on

2369
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,120
Fuck it. I'm just gonna say it. It's a story about an uh, well shit

2370
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:15,280
Shit because I don't I don't know to what extent because I'm still very much in the writing phase. I am writing

2371
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,440
I'm actually doing something but

2372
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:21,120
The way I'm doing it is I'm gonna write the script and then I'm going to try it

2373
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,920
So I don't I don't want you to end up ruining this for yourself by talking about it

2374
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:32,320
Yeah, yeah, what do you spend most of your time doing that's not working on this art project? Okay, it's uh

2375
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:37,360
Most of the time I am like you said, I'm talking to people or I'm playing video games

2376
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,200
I I rarely rarely have any fucking like I don't watch

2377
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,160
Fucking I don't know

2378
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,680
Gay enemies

2379
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:51,120
Yeah, game of whoo. I'm I'm okay. I'm convinced that everyone doesn't like game of thrones, but it's just like a meme

2380
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,400
It's like, oh, hey game of thrones is on two guys

2381
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,040
Like oh, yeah game of thrones

2382
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:03,520
Classic like that. It's not a real show. Yeah, just like a break being played by all of society. Yeah

2383
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,560
That would be fucking hilarious. Yeah

2384
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,360
Um, but what do you see you spend a lot of time playing games. What games do you play other than I play?

2385
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,880
I play I play mostly smash

2386
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,520
I I play mostly games that are off the wall and fucking weird

2387
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:26,240
Usually like weird multiplayer games

2388
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,720
I can't think of any good examples, but

2389
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:35,760
Just fucking weird shit that you find like not on steam, but fucking direct download shit from 4chan. That's my bread and butter, dude

2390
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,240
So you spend a lot of time in like the uh

2391
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:43,200
The weird boards of 4chan. Yes. Yes. I love I love x

2392
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,960
I love

2393
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,160
Fucking I love adult gif not for the porn, but for the you uh, you laugh you lose

2394
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,400
Just because there's usually weird stuff

2395
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,200
Like like every thread is like the same shit, but then there's that

2396
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:01,760
That one post that has all the replies and like a thumbnail that you can't really tell what's going on

2397
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,440
So you always think what the fuck is going to be inside this

2398
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,640
What could possibly be drawing all this attention?

2399
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,680
And then that's usually where you find the

2400
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,400
How do you feel about the fact that you would be underage banned from 4chan?

2401
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,960
Or most of the things you do

2402
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,240
I was banned I I was banned

2403
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:28,080
Because some moderator thought I posted child porn when I hadn't posted the entire day

2404
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:34,320
And I tried to appeal like I yeah, I was perma banned and I thought like I I literally didn't do anything

2405
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:41,280
I didn't post anything and then I I tried to appeal and then immediately it was like your appeal has been denied. Uh, goodbye

2406
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,840
And then so I was like, oh

2407
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,880
Let me google how to get by this and I got by it in three seconds

2408
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,560
I got a week-long ban from a once for posting porn

2409
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,240
Really?

2410
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:55,760
You fucking retard you gotta check it can't go by the thumbnail. It was

2411
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,040
It was uh, I don't remember the it was like some

2412
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,040
Some thread where for whatever reason I didn't understand at the time like what the rules were about porn on 4chan

2413
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,240
And like someone else had made a thread that had

2414
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,120
Like porn in it that hadn't been banned

2415
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:19,920
So I thought it was okay in the context of this thread and I posted some porn image and like got uh week-long banned

2416
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,800
This was like oh eight

2417
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,000
So uh

2418
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,120
You've been using this mid-2000s, but you haven't realized what the rules are yet until 2008. Well, no, I would say it's more like

2419
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,920
Like late 2007 early 2008 is when I got into uh 4chan

2420
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,840
But I didn't understand it that much at the time like I knew about it

2421
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,280
And then it was only in like later 2008 that I

2422
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,360
Actually started like going there like regularly for any reason other than curiosity, you know

2423
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:57,040
Yes, exactly. I don't spend a lot of time on 4chan though. I don't post there almost ever. I mostly look at stuff

2424
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:02,560
I go there, but I'm like so bored. I have no idea what to do with my life. Yeah. Yeah, same same

2425
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:08,320
Uh, I would say about 30 minutes not 30 minutes about an hour and a half

2426
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:13,440
Maybe are playing games then 30 minutes is on 4chan and then the rest is usually drawing commissions for people

2427
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,400
Or just just making gifts and photos. So you do

2428
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,520
But like what do you do commissions from like your tumblr?

2429
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,400
Uh tumblr and my twitter. I posted

2430
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,720
Commissions there before how how much money are you making on uh commissions?

2431
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:29,920
Like nothing just pocket change just enough like oh

2432
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,640
I want to get a pizza now

2433
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,280
I

2434
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:41,120
Mean it's impressive to me that you're making money at all on uh on the internet

2435
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:47,680
I up until I was well into adulthood. I didn't even understand how money transferring worked on the internet

2436
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,000
So like did you I want you to realize something?

2437
01:53:50,640 --> 01:53:52,080
in about

2438
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,360
Not maybe less than a year. I'm gonna be able I'm gonna have my own patreon going. I'm gonna have a

2439
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,880
Going

2440
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,240
I'm going to be 16 and I'm going to be able to make money from patreon. Well, I'm still in school

2441
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:09,280
It's pretty fuck. I mean if patreon had existed when I was in high school

2442
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:13,120
I would probably have utterly failed at trying to do that

2443
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,520
But see you you were a dummy. I'm a smarty

2444
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:26,240
I I break the laws. I'm the guy that again is why I'm always so impressed with your age because I wasn't that smart at your age

2445
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:31,520
like I wanted to be an artist, but I didn't have any clue how to go about it and

2446
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,920
um, I mean

2447
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,720
Sure, I was I was writing back then in the style that would eventually become what I do now

2448
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:44,640
But I think that the level of my writing when I was 15 is like

2449
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:48,800
Exponentially lower than the level of your drawing at 15

2450
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,360
Like thank you, man. I don't think like because 50

2451
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,120
You can read my old blog post from when I was 15. They're they're almost unreadable. They're garbage

2452
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:04,720
Like whereas I actually like your drawing enough right now that I use it as an avatar. So

2453
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:08,160
Yeah, yeah, definitely definitely

2454
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:13,280
Uh, I I'm I have no idea what I was going to say. I was going to say something important

2455
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,920
About patreon. I had no fucking clue

2456
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:19,120
Uh, basically

2457
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:23,360
Fuck you all I'm going to be rich. You're all going to be stupid and you're not going to wish you were me

2458
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,040
And that's not that's not directed to you. That's directed to you

2459
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,720
Yeah, like like like the world

2460
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:35,680
Like every every you every single you

2461
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:40,960
I'm gonna I'm gonna be I'm gonna be Scrooge McFuck

2462
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:46,160
Well, monchi, uh, do you have anything else you want to talk about on this interview?

2463
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:49,120
We're coming up on two hours. These usually go for three hours

2464
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:55,280
But uh, yeah, but we've gotten so fucking sidetracked that we we fucking completely missed the point of the entire thing

2465
01:55:55,280 --> 01:56:02,320
Well, I I struggled hard to get devu up to three hours because he uh, was it was for whatever reason

2466
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:06,400
Completely not interested in talking about his personal life at the time

2467
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:13,280
I only remembered after the interview that he lived in Africa for like years and I didn't get to talk about that

2468
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,240
Uh, he lived in fucking Africa

2469
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,760
Yeah, his family did like his family did like missionary work in Africa

2470
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,400
And that didn't get into the podcast

2471
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:29,840
The interview I I literally asked him like is there anything interesting about your life and he was just like, uh

2472
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,480
Has there been any trips I've been on uh, there's

2473
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,800
I've been to oh, I I don't know if I want to make this a story

2474
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,160
But I once you know how I I'm you said I was Mexican really, you know, I can pass as a Mexican guy, right?

2475
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:52,000
Uh, I once went to Tijuana and my mother forgot to bring my passport

2476
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:57,760
And uh, when we tried to go back to the United States, uh, I think you can imagine

2477
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:01,360
The how did you even leave the country without a passport?

2478
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,320
We can just what do you mean? We just walk

2479
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:11,120
You just like what what do you tell you didn't walk to Tijuana? Yeah, we walked to Tijuana. Yeah

2480
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,920
That's how close our house is to Tijuana

2481
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:20,480
But you like do you live literally on the border like what the fuck are you talking about? No, no, we live like okay

2482
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,560
Okay, we drove until we were like

2483
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,440
Like we drove like 10 minutes

2484
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,920
Then we got the car and then we just walked over the bridge and we were at Tijuana

2485
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:35,200
Is Tijuana like the first city past the border? I don't know. I think so. Yeah

2486
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:41,840
Can you walk through the border without a fucking visa or passport apparently?

2487
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,160
I guess that's why we have some maybe illegal immigrants in the country

2488
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,840
Where the fuck's the trump wall?

2489
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:57,280
While I was there, it was actually quite a great experience for me

2490
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:01,200
I think it opened up a lot. I took a picture on a next-way donkey

2491
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,600
His name was bill and the next thing said

2492
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,680
And I was like, I did not understand that but I do like donkeys

2493
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:14,000
It's I I was next to a donkey and he was like

2494
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,760
And I was like, yes

2495
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,520
So how did you get back into the United States?

2496
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,120
Uh

2497
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:27,920
My mom was like, oh, shit. And then the guy was like, yeah, you retard. I'm not falling for this

2498
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,720
This is my this is my fucking fifth year on the job, dude

2499
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,720
I'm not I'm not falling for this shit again. And then my mom was like, uh, please. He was like, oh, okay

2500
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:41,040
I mean, I was thinking like wouldn't it be easy enough if you if you're in walking distance

2501
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,520
Couldn't she have just walked into the u.s

2502
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:49,280
Ran home got your passport and brought it back and like pretty short amount of time. Well like like

2503
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,520
I

2504
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:56,480
Like it's weird. We could walk over just fine. But like we had to go through a line to get back

2505
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,040
Right. It wasn't like we like we could yeah

2506
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,120
Because no one in the u.s. Gives a fuck if you're going to Mexico. Yeah. Yeah

2507
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:10,800
Mexico is happy to have you the u.s. Does not want what's coming back. Yeah, exactly. That's pretty fucking funny though

2508
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,320
Yeah, it is great. I eventually got out your passport

2509
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:19,040
I didn't fucking do shit. I was like, oh mom you have the passport, right? And she's just like, yeah

2510
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,440
And then uh, no

2511
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,320
And

2512
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,000
by the way, uh

2513
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,760
my passport, uh

2514
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,400
I don't can you imagine me looking like a kid?

2515
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,840
Uh, I I could

2516
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,520
I can picture you being small

2517
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,600
But at no age can I picture you being small for your age like

2518
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:46,480
I would imagine you being slightly too big for whatever age you were

2519
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,200
So if I'm picturing you at five, I'm picturing a seven-year-old. That's what I'm saying

2520
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,920
When I was born I weighed, uh,

2521
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,720
9 pounds and 14 ounces

2522
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:01,760
That's fairly big. Yeah. Yes. Uh, the doctor said he's a big guy

2523
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:04,480
And my mom said for you

2524
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,120
That's actually but not the for you part, but I said before you because I knew

2525
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:12,080
I knew I knew I knew the meme

2526
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:18,960
I knew the meme. No more travel stories. I I don't travel outside the country. I'm I'm I'm very

2527
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,040
Secluded in my lifestyle. I don't like venturing out into the wilderness

2528
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:29,280
I remember I talked to you a long time ago about how I would literally get raped if I step one foot outside my house

2529
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,600
Get raped?

2530
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,600
Yeah, who is gonna rape you?

2531
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,800
Uh, I don't know

2532
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:41,040
Someone who or what like I'm a chupacabra gonna

2533
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,560
I'm gonna get kidnapped and I'm going to who can kidnap you

2534
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:52,720
They'd have to be armed to kidnap you. Yes, exactly. You need fucking hulk hogan to kidnap you

2535
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,720
Yeah, that's not the same guy

2536
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:00,080
I just want to let that I don't I don't want just you to kill me now

2537
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:07,520
That's um macho. Yeah macho man ready. So I don't just see please. I I was a simple mistake

2538
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
What happened again master

2539
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:18,960
Uh, I I don't I only travel out when I want to be the people I know my quintices and super smash brothers

2540
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,080
how um

2541
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:27,120
You say you watch all my videos that is a considerable amount of time

2542
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:34,080
Because these days i'm releasing like at minimum 45 minutes worth of video a day

2543
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,960
Uh, are there any other content creators you follow to such an extent?

2544
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,520
No

2545
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,520
I I follow the pcp

2546
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,560
and

2547
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,080
I can't

2548
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:49,680
I don't think any I I watch some I watch stir

2549
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:57,680
And germa. I know, uh, I think nate and jesse know about germa. I know about germa, but I've only seen like one video

2550
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:00,560
Jesse watches them. Yeah

2551
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:06,480
Uh, I I don't I I don't follow any person religiously like uh, like I follow you people

2552
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:12,160
So it's mostly yeah, I would say that most of the content. I don't even like most of the content

2553
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,160
I get nothing out of but I just like well

2554
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:19,120
I'm I'm too I'm I might as well if I can't be the best I might as well be the worst

2555
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:27,680
So so you mostly come to youtube for our group. Yes, and not so much for anything else

2556
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:32,880
Oh and for a race site shout out to race site. Ben knows what I'm talking about

2557
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:36,320
He's a crazy old seven-year-old who makes uh

2558
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:39,840
Interesting videos

2559
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,480
Okay, I know there was a time

2560
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:46,720
Which may be a very long time ago that you were into game grumps pretty heavily

2561
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,600
Uh, I mean, I don't know if I would consider it very heavily. I was a fan definitely, but I don't

2562
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:58,880
The people people get really into game grumps, right? Well

2563
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:06,080
Yeah, I consider myself pretty into like or was pretty into game grumps before the last year when I

2564
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,560
They completely went to fucking shit, but uh

2565
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:12,880
Um, oh, you mean four years ago? If you

2566
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,760
Well, that would be the beginning

2567
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,760
That'd be the whole time

2568
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,800
Which is true. Yeah

2569
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,200
I can't pretend it's not

2570
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,280
But there's definitely people who are uh too into it. Yeah

2571
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,720
There are I have a I have a very

2572
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:38,640
broad range of uh people I talk to

2573
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,800
And by broad, I mean there are a lot of like okay imagine

2574
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:50,080
I'm in the middle of a spectrum and at the very fucking ends are like normal socially adjusted people

2575
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,680
Uh, they're the worst kind of humans. I I wish I was on the normie so I could really just drive at home

2576
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:59,200
How much normal people just don't understand anything?

2577
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:01,680
They don't know anything. They know nothing

2578
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:07,040
They're all in yuppies and I'll kill them. I can't take normies man. I I had a year

2579
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:11,440
I've had a few normies re moments recently. Have you had any recently?

2580
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:14,960
Recently not

2581
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:17,680
Not super recently. I've had a lot in the past

2582
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,240
I don't know if I want to tell mine because it kind of be co-opping your uh podcast. You know

2583
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,320
Uh

2584
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:27,680
Go go ahead and tell tell one story and then I'll get back because I have a I have a

2585
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:34,160
I've just had lately. I've I've been having the I've been making the mistake. Um of going out

2586
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:38,640
To get like food at 2 a.m. On Friday nights

2587
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:42,640
I don't know if you're aware of this, but that's when the like

2588
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:48,240
2 a.m. Is when clubs let out like they they they stop selling shit at 2 a.m.

2589
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:54,640
So uh on like I'm used to going out at 2 in the morning and and no one being out because

2590
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:59,040
Why would they be it's 2 a.m. On like a wednesday, but on fridays

2591
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,960
The clubs and on saturdays the clubs and stuff are full

2592
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:08,560
So like if I go to like walla or it's like a 24 hour cafe like right at 2 a.m

2593
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:15,120
They're fucking packed on friday and it's all drunk people and I'm short so you fit right in so

2594
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:19,760
Yeah, well, you know, well, I don't I don't drive drunk. So if I'm if I'm going out, I'm not drunk

2595
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:22,880
But I don't leave you for a second. I'm a short guy

2596
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,720
and I

2597
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:30,720
Unlike even though I I kind of look scary. I don't see myself as being intimidating

2598
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:33,360
Like I I feel like I'm a small person

2599
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:39,920
And when I'm surrounded by like large normies who are all drunk. I feel like unsafe

2600
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:44,640
Like I don't like I feel like normal people are volatile when they drink

2601
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:50,240
It's like all these giant dude bros who just got out of the club and obviously didn't get laid because

2602
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,760
You know, they're in they're here and not somewhere else, you know

2603
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:58,000
It's like just a bunch of like slightly pissed off drunk dude bros

2604
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:01,920
And and and it makes me uncomfortable that I know they because I'll be like at wawa

2605
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,920
Which is like a convenience store and it's like packed with drunk dude bros

2606
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
And I'm like these guys are all about to go drive

2607
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:13,680
Like they all drove here and they're about to go drive home and I'm going to be on the road with them

2608
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:20,400
And well, you see did you it's disgusting what you need to realize is that you can pay me to be your full-time

2609
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,640
Bodyguard. Yeah, I would totally do that if you were around

2610
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:32,000
If you lived anywhere near me, I would bring you everywhere because I would feel so safe with you around

2611
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:35,440
Like like it's it's not that they're going to do anything

2612
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,480
It's just that if they just see me they are instantly

2613
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:44,720
I am not going to make it out here alive if I even look at this guy. Have you ever seen the uh mtv show robin big?

2614
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:50,080
No, it's it's this show. It was about this guy, uh the skateboarder

2615
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:54,800
I think it was bob burnquist and he he was like this like so much shrimpy white guy

2616
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:00,480
He was like a famous skateboarder and he had this giant black guy as his bodyguard

2617
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:02,640
And like they became best friends

2618
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:07,520
And so they had like a show on mtv. It was just about him hanging out with his giant

2619
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:11,920
Bodyguard best friend and that would be us if we if we hung out

2620
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:18,240
Yeah, I would just bring you everywhere to look intimidating and eat just to scare off your foes. Yeah

2621
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:22,160
Like I would hype up the idea that you were mexican

2622
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:28,800
Because it would make you scarier like I would have you eat churros at all times so that you look maximum scared

2623
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,880
I come up with a fucking sombrero

2624
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:36,480
Hey, hombre, I give me my pay or else you are gonna come for your fucking head's gonna come off

2625
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,920
By the way, I'm picturing you in the pizza outfit. Yeah

2626
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,000
I'm picturing you following me around in the pizza onesie

2627
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:50,000
And the sunglasses by the way, I have prescription one sunglasses now

2628
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:56,400
So I can I can I can have only sunglasses unlike the the double the double fucking glasses that I was doing last time

2629
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,560
Dude the the sunglasses

2630
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:06,240
And the pizza onesie is absolutely clusterpunk aesthetic. You would fit right in with my clique, which is just me

2631
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,680
No, dude, uh, I'm fucking in I'm down. I'm down to clown with that. Yeah

2632
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:19,920
The clusterpunk I want to go briefly back to uh, I want to piggyback on the topic of schools and

2633
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:22,640
shootings and

2634
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,600
I go right ahead

2635
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:29,680
That'll keep everyone real comfortable school shootings

2636
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:35,680
My favorite topic as I'm sure everyone the tcp fan chat knows because they constantly talk about doing it

2637
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:41,280
Uh, this time I'm really gonna do it though. It's not a joke. Anyway, back when I was a little kid. I

2638
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
But like I've always been like this

2639
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:49,520
This is this is the beast that I live with. This is just me. This isn't like an act

2640
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,680
I I'm I'm I'm insane. I'm an insane person and everyone around me is scared of me

2641
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,680
I I go to school and I just fucking scream and I hug the people

2642
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,560
But that was all by youth. I would just scream

2643
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:08,640
Like fucking nonsense. I would run up and be overly affectionate to people

2644
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:13,680
I would just hey dude. Hey. Hey. I hope you're having a great day. Can you do something for me, buddy?

2645
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:17,360
Can you do something for me? I want you to have a great day and that would just run away

2646
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:20,240
This sounds like a bunchy. I know. Yeah

2647
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:26,000
And then uh, the only people I fucking the the only friend I've ever had in high school

2648
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:30,800
Is because he wore in a tari shirt one day and I walked up to him and said hey, dude

2649
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:37,120
Nice shirt. I wish I had one of those shirts, you know, and he was like, yeah

2650
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:40,480
Ever since I've been being him in super smash brothers

2651
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:45,520
Do you even care about a tari at all? No

2652
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,640
I don't give a fuck who gives a fuck about a tari

2653
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,560
No one even relevant in my lifetime much less yours

2654
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,480
No

2655
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:59,280
Um, it was just I don't fucking know. He's black too. So I have bragging rights. Oh, yeah, sweet

2656
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,240
Nothing's better than black bragging rights

2657
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,800
By the way, I haven't ever seen don son, but I used to imagine he is a typhoon

2658
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,520
He is just he's uh, how much do you weigh?

2659
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,760
100 or no 240 I think

2660
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,560
He's bigger than you

2661
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:23,680
Um, because he's about your height, but uh a bit fatter because he's probably

2662
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:29,680
Pushing 300 right now. So holy shit, dude. Yeah, don son is like my fucking like a nega

2663
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:34,240
Not not not not my nigger, but I mean my my like nega form

2664
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,880
Oh my fucking yeah

2665
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:41,040
Like like we we need a fuse to become one again don son if you're listening to this

2666
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,600
We need to dance. He does not listen to anything

2667
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,040
Don son if you're listening to this we need to fuse

2668
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:52,320
I wouldn't be surprised if don son has literally never watched one of my videos before

2669
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:58,400
If he has he's never mentioned it and I've never asked so, uh, yeah

2670
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,880
Uh, there was a period of time where after doing the the crazy person thing for a while

2671
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:08,160
There was like a like a month where I thought

2672
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:13,920
You know, this is kind of pushing people away. This is kind of making people not take me seriously

2673
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,880
Not taking me seriously as an artist or as a person

2674
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:18,960
I think I need to tone it down for a little bit

2675
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:25,040
Yeah, and then I became like a normal socially adjusted person for like a little bit and I was like this is fucking boring

2676
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:34,480
That's how you lure them in man you need victims. It's like the that's like the angler fish the little dangly thing

2677
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:37,360
Lure them in you

2678
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:41,680
You know, there's a guy who my my cousin boy and he used to work with this dude

2679
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:46,880
Who said that he would uh, he would go to clubs and he'd pick up

2680
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,840
Women who were too drunk to know what was going on

2681
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:54,640
And he'd take them home and he said what you do he advised this to my cousin boy

2682
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:00,960
He said what you do is you lure them in with the Marvin gay and then you put on the dmx

2683
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:03,520
And you just go crazy

2684
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:07,440
And that was his method and he legitimately did that and uh

2685
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:14,800
That's what I've been saying ever since you lure them in with the Marvin gay. Then you hit him with the dmx

2686
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,360
Huh, you gotta add the huh after so it sounds like a song lyric

2687
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:25,600
By the way the tweet I posted earlier you and Shaden just need to do you need to do a cover of that

2688
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:29,360
Uh, which which tweet it was something like

2689
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:36,240
Yeah, I I tripped and I fell I wound up in a cell for a pizza on my plate. I'm a pope. I'm a pizza pope

2690
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,720
Yeah, I did see that

2691
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:45,440
It was it was I came to me much like all my ideas in a fever dream about pizza

2692
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:53,440
Pretty pretty much all my dreams all my entire life have just been pizza related or nightmares about pizza

2693
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,440
Yeah, that's amazing. Are you a big pizza fan?

2694
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,640
Yeah, I love pizza. You're fucking weird because you don't like pizza

2695
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,280
I absolutely love pizza

2696
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:08,320
I got the impression that you were indifferent towards pizza. No, I am a huge pizza fan

2697
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:13,680
Oh, that's great. I am uh, I would consider I actually consider myself a pizza aficionado

2698
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:18,960
To some extent. Oh, I see. I see uh, jesse hates pizza. He made a video

2699
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,240
I mean, he likes to eat it, but he also likes to complain about it

2700
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:26,640
Shade shade legitimately doesn't like pizza at all

2701
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:31,040
taste wise when I've heard shade is not real

2702
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:39,920
I do I don't get it. All he eats is fucking beef jerky. It's like and ramen. That's it beef jerky and ramen

2703
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,440
That's enough for him to live like like and it's not you know

2704
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:47,840
I grew up on a lot of ramen because we didn't have a lot of money

2705
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:53,680
And then once I ate other foods, I went. Oh, there's like good food out there. I don't have to eat ramen

2706
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:59,920
Shade eats other food and he's like I could just be eating ramen. Like that's how he feels, you know

2707
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:06,640
Like nothing is as good to him as ramen and beef jerky. I mean ramen is good, dude, but

2708
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:14,160
Yeah, it's it's a little much pizza. Yeah, he doesn't like pizza. He likes calzones not pizza

2709
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:20,160
But you know why he doesn't like pizza why shade and this this this applies

2710
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:25,840
Whatever you're if when I say this you're gonna go you mean even and I'm gonna say yes even

2711
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:28,480
shade does not like any sauce

2712
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:38,960
No sauce whatsoever no condiments no sauce no no liquid that is applied to food. Let's put it that way

2713
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:42,560
What he eats everything dry

2714
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:47,200
He eats everything dry everything dry with the exception of like

2715
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:52,640
Like ramen or like spicy foods like he will put he'll eat like spicy wings

2716
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:58,800
But he won't put like if you gave him chicken if you gave him a box of chicken nuggets and every dip known to man

2717
02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:01,920
He would not open any of the dips. He would just eat the chicken nuggets

2718
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,520
I mean, I'm very similar. I don't like very many

2719
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:11,920
I don't like salad dressing or anything like that. I I normally don't eat my shades ever eaten a salad before

2720
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:21,440
I I normally don't like like ranch or anything like that. Right, but there's a there's a lot. Have you ever heard of a thing called ketchup?

2721
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:26,480
Ketchup's pretty good. It goes good with literally everything. It's pretty good

2722
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:31,760
It's pretty fucking good. And I hate tomatoes. I always remove like actual tomatoes by

2723
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,440
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of it like growing up. I was but you're the disheveled man of tomato-based products. What are you talking about?

2724
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:39,920
What? I don't know what you're talking about

2725
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,360
of

2726
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:43,520
You know growing up I was a picky eater

2727
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:46,960
So I kind of get it like I didn't like a lot of the sauces and condiments

2728
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:51,840
But like as I got older I started eating them but shades like 18 now and nothing's changed like

2729
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:57,040
We all just assumed he would grow out of it, but he hasn't at all and there was one time

2730
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,800
You'll you'll like the story

2731
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:04,400
We were at this Mexican restaurant and I ordered these three

2732
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:07,360
chicken empanadas like it was like a

2733
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,120
a

2734
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:13,440
Appetizer and it's just like it just looks like a fucking hot pocket full of chicken, right?

2735
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:17,360
Yeah, and we got three of them and I was like all right one for me one for victor one for shade

2736
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:21,840
It was just the three of us and shade looks at and he's like I don't want to eat that and we were like

2737
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:25,600
Why not? He was like it just doesn't look appetizing

2738
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,120
Like like the way the chicken looked didn't look good to him

2739
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:31,120
Even though chicken's his favorite food

2740
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:34,160
But the way the chicken looked didn't look good to him and he was just like I don't want to eat that

2741
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:34,880
And we were like

2742
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:40,560
Dude, how can you like you don't have any idea what it tastes like and we're both eating it and it tastes like something

2743
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:42,320
We know you'd like

2744
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:46,720
Why won't and like we were like begging him to eat it and he was just like he got mad and he was he was like

2745
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:49,440
You guys it feels like you're raping me

2746
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Oh

2747
02:16:54,080 --> 02:17:00,960
My god, dude, honestly, I sympathize with the fact that if food doesn't look good. I'm not fucking touching that shit

2748
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:06,000
I mean has to look somewhat appealing. Yeah, I don't think it looked bad

2749
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:09,680
I understood why like I understood what he thought it looked like

2750
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:14,800
But it didn't it wasn't like that like it looked like it had some kind of sauce on it and it didn't you know

2751
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,120
But like we could not convince

2752
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:22,480
Just did it. I just wanted him to take a fucking bite before making up his mind like

2753
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:25,120
I was like, how can you know

2754
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:30,000
Like how how do you ever learn new things if you don't try new things? He was like, I don't want to try anything new

2755
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I just I like the stuff I like. I have no reason to eat anything new ever

2756
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:37,200
And I was like, oh my god, you're a fucking robot

2757
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:44,240
By the way, when I when I talked about you how you're the the uh disheveled man of tomatoes based products

2758
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:48,000
I was referring to the first tweet I ever made. I think

2759
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:52,800
I'm gonna send it to you and if you want to if the fans at home want to see it, you can just go back

2760
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,920
Oh, yeah, I do remember this if you see this while scrolling the first page

2761
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:00,640
It's a picture of me squirting ketchup on something

2762
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:05,920
You have been visited by the disheveled man of tomato based products full ketchup bottles and french fries will come to you

2763
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:09,040
But only if you post lay off the sauce digi in this

2764
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:11,760
Is this from like

2765
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:13,760
What videos is from

2766
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:18,640
I have I jeff uh, uh, not not not jeff brother's basement jeff the

2767
02:18:19,360 --> 02:18:21,360
Burgess. Yeah, Burgess

2768
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,560
Yeah, we we conspire a lot to bring you down

2769
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:26,800
Take you down a notch

2770
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,800
Is this from the uh, because this

2771
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:33,040
Now i'm seeing that i'm wearing the party hard shirt, which I know i was wearing when he came over to my house

2772
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,040
So did he take this when he was at my house?

2773
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:40,160
He did he gave me no information. I'm sure he don't information give him

2774
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:47,440
It looks like because this he has a video from when he was at my house and I looked exactly like this in that video

2775
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,360
So that's probably what it is

2776
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:50,640
Yeah, probably

2777
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:57,360
But for forever until the end of time you will be known as the man of the disheveled man of tomatoes based products on my mind

2778
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,520
Good to wear that. Yeah, I think you wear that probably

2779
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:08,080
Uh, uh to go back to the interview we're doing. Yes

2780
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:11,840
Uh, uh, I was talking about how I for a while

2781
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,600
I wanted to be respected as a human being and letting that didn't go well because I

2782
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:20,880
Hated being a human being and I always wanted to be a turtle and I thought frogs are cool. I want to be a frog

2783
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,880
uh, anyway

2784
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:29,360
I I came back to my senses and I that's when I really started becoming like an art guy because I've always like drawn

2785
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,760
I've never like drawn

2786
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,200
right

2787
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,440
I uh, so yeah, so

2788
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:39,120
I would realize like, okay. I'm not gonna like

2789
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,520
Go super all out like crazy, but I'm just gonna sit down

2790
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:46,480
I'm gonna draw and if anyone ever even fucking comes up to me

2791
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:51,360
I am going to turn on like a faucet and they are not going to

2792
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,920
See the light of day ever again

2793
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:58,080
It's gonna be it's gonna be like fucking p.t. But for in like one second

2794
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:00,880
and forever

2795
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:07,200
Like the game pt. Yeah. Yeah, like for the game like the game pt in this person's mind

2796
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:13,920
Just looking at me. I am going to like through my speech. I'm going to literally give them like a visual pt

2797
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:22,960
Like like all my words are gonna become in such a way that will make them literally like play pt in their mind while they're talking to me

2798
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,200
How did that go

2799
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:33,760
It went good. I I started drawing the guy who I I saw it had a nice Atari shirt started uh

2800
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:40,560
Like fucking coming over to me and since uh, I had loaned him a book and I didn't get the book back yet

2801
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:42,640
I let him be next to me

2802
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:49,840
Uh, and then I I eventually realized that I I can do more with this man than just be even super smash brothers

2803
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:53,440
Yeah, he gets more used to me as a black person

2804
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:56,160
And

2805
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:01,840
So what did you do?

2806
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:04,640
So we fucking became friends duh, okay

2807
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:08,480
So so so i'm the lord master and he's my guy

2808
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:13,120
Yeah, and uh, there's a few others, but they don't those don't matter

2809
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:19,200
Uh, we basically became friends and all like we we the reason we're all friends is because we all do different shit

2810
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,600
And there's the stream monday

2811
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:28,560
It doesn't matter what or fucking how or in what context, but one day we're all gonna do something at the same time

2812
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:35,920
And it's all gonna be this like a like one thing so all this different shit squad goals

2813
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,720
Squad goals. Yeah

2814
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:40,560
exactly

2815
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:46,560
Man we have yeah be careful with your squad goals because the pcp had squad goals for june

2816
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,120
and we failed

2817
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:50,560
miserably

2818
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:53,760
It was the worst I saw because I watched everyone's videos

2819
02:21:54,560 --> 02:22:00,240
Everyone was like it's gonna be june guys. Yeah, it's mark your calendars guys. It's gonna be june

2820
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:08,000
Nothing well jesse had this whole plan to launch my japanese animes into like overdrive in june

2821
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:10,160
and then he started making a

2822
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:15,440
One-year anniversary video for horse shoe finale and apparently that became like an

2823
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:20,720
Overwhelming project just like horse shoe finale. Hasn't he learned his mistake? No

2824
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:27,360
Never you haven't we've been through this and then I had this idea like

2825
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:34,640
Because for me like the month of may I did all my work for may before may started as you probably know and uh

2826
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:41,600
The idea with that was that during the month of may I would do something big and instead I did nothing

2827
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:46,800
So then when june came around it was like, okay. Well, I completely failed at may so in june

2828
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:52,320
I have to get things rolling and then it took like two weeks before I got anything rolling

2829
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:58,880
So see I was literally earlier today thinking about that and I got really mad at you, but I forgot until just now

2830
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:00,640
see

2831
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:02,800
Big projects are terrible

2832
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,520
Good like what's good is just a bunch of tiny little like tiny

2833
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:12,720
Micro micro fucking organisms. They're just tiny polished to a fucking shine

2834
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,720
Tiny just tiny just so tiny, but there's just a million of them

2835
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:20,400
They're cells they're cells in a body and the body's youtube channel

2836
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,200
I mean, I agree

2837
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,400
But I find those unsatisfying to make

2838
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,920
Because for me, I always feel like I have to be challenging myself

2839
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,040
Like it always has to be something that's better than what I've done before or like something new, you know

2840
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,280
Or something. I'm excited about we're like

2841
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Like I think if you're if you're trying to become

2842
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:45,280
The most marketable youtube channel without throwing away your dignity

2843
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:51,920
Jeff has it right mother's basement that channel is fucking it's exactly what it should be like

2844
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:54,480
He has a follow up with what dignity

2845
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,680
I'm just a joke

2846
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:04,640
Like in internal like just being able to look at your work and being able to say I'm okay with this, you know

2847
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:12,000
Like jeff does good enough work that he doesn't come off as a vapid cunt like a lot of people on youtube do

2848
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:17,520
But his video is his videos are easy to make and accessible and

2849
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:20,480
He has a format that works well with like that

2850
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:26,560
That style which is like what he's trained to do because he used to work for like a proper video game magazine

2851
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,520
So like this big sense to him, but like for me

2852
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:32,480
Like it always has to be

2853
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,680
Like I I could do stuff that way

2854
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,000
But like I have a mental block against it

2855
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,880
We're like I launched all those series in in april where it was like, oh i'm gonna do this every week and then

2856
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:45,920
You know I can't

2857
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:50,480
Because i'm crazy. I don't want to get too deep into that. I'm distracting from your interview

2858
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:57,040
I've gotten a lot of complaints from uh from the other tpc members that every interview is actually an interview with me

2859
02:24:58,240 --> 02:24:59,920
Yeah, uh, don't worry, dude

2860
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:06,160
It's more even though like I constantly fucking belittle you on every forum I have available

2861
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:10,320
I I think you're a good guy. I like hearing it. I like hearing it

2862
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:14,800
Well, I imagine you wouldn't actually watch all my videos if you didn't appreciate the content

2863
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:21,920
Like I've never been under the illusion that you think i'm shit because if you actually thought that you wouldn't be interested

2864
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:27,600
I'm actually surprised by how long you've maintained interest in my content considering

2865
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:29,680
I don't even talk about anything you watch anymore

2866
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:34,720
Uh, I mean I didn't really care about pony at all

2867
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:37,440
I mean I I did I thought it was cool

2868
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,520
But I was never like that into it, but you were pretty in the community

2869
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:46,320
You had I was in the community a lot of friends in there and stuff. Yeah, exactly. I was in the community

2870
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:49,040
I didn't care about the fucking show who gives a shit about the show

2871
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:54,640
Interesting. I actually meant to ask that like how much you actually cared about the show itself

2872
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:57,360
Or about my little pony very little

2873
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:04,640
So you wouldn't say you weren't you weren't you're not you were never into it the way you were into like homestuck or pokemon or curbie or jojo

2874
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:11,040
I'm not that and like I was I wasn't a pokemon kid. I was never a pokey kid

2875
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:13,040
I'm a pokemon guy now

2876
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:19,120
But I I mainly just played the games like like on a very surface level didn't do any like anything crazy

2877
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:24,800
I remember yeah, my my first exposure to anything that wasn't pressing attack over and over

2878
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:29,680
Was I I did the battle like frontier in platinum and the first fight

2879
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:34,560
Was a munchlax and I was like, oh cool. I wonder what he's gonna do

2880
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:38,800
He would do stockpile over and over. Do you know what stockpile does? I don't

2881
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:44,320
It raises their fence their defense and their special defense up. I think a stage

2882
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:49,040
And he would keep doing that and little me. I have no fucking idea what anything

2883
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:55,760
Ever does I just think status effects just whatever who gives a shit same here and I just I just could not

2884
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:00,800
What why can't I hit him? Why is he not dying? He's a baby pokemon. How can he take this much hits?

2885
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:06,160
And then I eventually he did like I got him like that. I was shizzling down like oh

2886
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:08,720
She's gonna fucking tell me this piece of shit is fucking over

2887
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,040
Then he uses swallow

2888
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,040
You know swallow does I do not

2889
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:16,000
It is a move that has to be used for stockpile

2890
02:27:16,400 --> 02:27:20,080
And it uses all the stockpiles that you've done to recover a set amount of hp

2891
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:22,000
I see so

2892
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,520
He's he used all his like 15 million stockpiles to get back to

2893
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,160
100% hp and I turned off the game and I wanted to die

2894
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:40,320
Uh, that's my first yeah, I've never done any high level pokemon stuff like even the stuff that's in the games

2895
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,320
Yeah, I'm doing showdown now. It's an online balance simulator. I want I want sun and moon

2896
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:49,440
I swear dude, it's gonna be it's gonna be the new this is gonna be the genesis

2897
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
The neon if you will

2898
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,040
Yeah

2899
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:58,800
Of genesis, how did you feel about even going on? He said you finished that show. Yes. I did finish it

2900
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:05,520
Uh, a funny thing. I I refused to watch it until I was sick and I wanted to throw up every second

2901
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:08,320
And I thought this is the perfect climate to watch even gillion

2902
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:10,800
I was miserable

2903
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:13,920
I was miserable nothing made me happy

2904
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:18,400
I was I was constantly on the verge of just fucking pissing and shitting and throwing up on myself

2905
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:21,680
And I just got my laptop out and I watched it all

2906
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:24,400
I'm fucking like one night

2907
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:26,400
And I was like, yep

2908
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,200
That's how I feel right now

2909
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:34,640
The last because the last line of end of eva and gilly on the film is oska says

2910
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:39,600
Kimo chi warui, which means I feel like shit essentially or I am disgusted

2911
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,920
um

2912
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:47,280
And yeah, it is often translated as I want to throw up. So it's a perfect

2913
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,080
Perfect thing to be doing

2914
02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:52,960
Yes, the the line was actually unscripted

2915
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
and it was a result of

2916
02:28:56,320 --> 02:29:01,760
Hideaki ono really wanted that actress to come like to have a good a good line at the end

2917
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:04,880
And he had the voice actress who played shinji

2918
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:07,360
actually strangle her

2919
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,520
and then he told her

2920
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:11,280
to

2921
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:17,200
Imagine someone masturbating over her and what would she say at that moment and that's what she said

2922
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:24,720
He's a guy. He's Andrew Hussie. He is Andrew Hussie

2923
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,080
Uh, I to be honest with you I

2924
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:32,080
Every single day I think about home stuck and I guess I my urge to get on the podcast goes

2925
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:39,920
Like fucking like hotter and hotter. So Nate been get on it retard. Anyway, we're ready to go back to

2926
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:44,160
By the way, do you like how this entire podcast up to like a couple of minutes ago?

2927
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:47,600
Like I this wasn't even about me, but now it's like about me and I have stuff to say

2928
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,320
Yeah, go ahead

2929
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:52,960
All right, uh, I started to get into art and that

2930
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:58,320
I I guess I should talk about pony because pony was like like it was a big part of me

2931
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,560
But I didn't really like it that much

2932
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,760
I thought it was okay, uh about the community

2933
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:10,880
Like you and the other people that you the pcp literally shaped me and I don't know if I like that

2934
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:13,680
I don't know if I'm okay with that

2935
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:16,240
I think I'm gonna start again

2936
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:21,680
I'm glad you're self aware enough to know that because one of my biggest concerns is always that

2937
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,160
I'm going to inspire people

2938
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:30,080
Uh, and they're not gonna realize why that could be a bad thing. You know, yeah

2939
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:34,160
That's why I I always throw those little things where I say like do you really want to be like me?

2940
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:39,840
Like I said in that one video like I aimed the camera down at myself and like do you want to be this guy, you know, because

2941
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:43,600
It's like it's not just for self depreciation

2942
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:48,160
But to like legitimately ask people like you know that if you try to act like me

2943
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:53,200
I'm not like a normal like me. Yeah, I'm not a normal guy

2944
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:58,080
Like I'm not someone who can show my face in public and you would think that guy is normal

2945
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:04,080
Like I get weird looks, you know sometimes not often because I live in a pretty liberal area

2946
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:08,720
But like I'm walking down the street. You get the neighborhood watch called on you. Yeah

2947
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,200
that's

2948
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:14,320
Well, they didn't call them on me, but they they they did

2949
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:20,000
I well that was mostly because I was with a black guy. Uh, I think he had more to do with that than me

2950
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:21,840
but um

2951
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,840
Yeah, like I'm not a guy who

2952
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:29,120
Like if you if you want to act like me you have to be ready for all that that comes with

2953
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:34,480
You know, like can you be a person who lives in a room full of anime shit and lives off a youtube

2954
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:38,800
Donations, you know, like yeah, which I mean when I said that in the video

2955
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:42,000
I actually got a lot of people who were like, of course. I want to be like you. Are you kidding?

2956
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,160
You seem happy with your life

2957
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:49,680
But uh, yeah, thanks for letting me talk about what I wanted to talk about

2958
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:52,240
Go ahead

2959
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:58,880
I was just so happy to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, uh, I got the first

2960
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:05,120
Uh, the first ever like fandom thing I did. Do you know what brony breakdown is? I'm sure you do

2961
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:11,840
No, I'm not sure. Oh the thing that paleo steno does with saberspot. Oh, yes, I do know about that

2962
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:14,080
That was how tom got his career, right?

2963
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:16,480
Yes, that was the

2964
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:20,000
I was at the very fucking inception. I was at the sperm in the egg moment, dude

2965
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:24,400
Really? I was at the and I immediately the second fucking episode. They're like, hey, dude

2966
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:28,080
We got fan art by this guy named mucho and I was like, yes

2967
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:30,000
I'm in

2968
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:35,840
By my entire internet career. I have been the second the fucking second fiddle to a famous person

2969
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:38,240
You're just you're you're not special digi

2970
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:43,600
You're only you're only the latest in a string. Is that how you found tom because of brony breakdown?

2971
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:46,640
Uh, yes, I think so

2972
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:52,560
I I don't know like explicitly because of brony breakdown, but I know he was a friend with paleo

2973
02:32:52,960 --> 02:32:56,320
Yeah, well because they he had drawn some

2974
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,800
Uh comic about scoodaloo

2975
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:04,720
And they I like how you refer it to some comic about scoodaloo when to him

2976
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:10,560
It's probably like the greatest thing that's ever happened and like the way he's tom hates everything. He's ever made

2977
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:16,080
So I'm sure he would describe it the same way, but uh, he drew a comic about scoodaloo

2978
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:19,760
And it was like his first major project thing and they invited him onto the show

2979
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:26,560
This comic was a very long comic by the way. Yeah, it's like not not super long, but it wasn't like a like a fucking

2980
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:32,240
It was a considerable effort that he'd spent like a year drawing, but uh, yeah

2981
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:37,600
That's how he got on the show and that's where all of his brony career started

2982
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,800
His brony career

2983
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,680
It's a thing. It was it was legitimately a career

2984
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:46,400
Yeah, yeah

2985
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:51,200
God damn it. I wanted it so bad. I wanted it so bad

2986
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:53,760
I

2987
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:58,400
So I would always draw fan art for people and like I would always be friends with them, you know

2988
02:33:58,640 --> 02:33:59,600
I would always get there

2989
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:03,680
It's just the right time where I would be able to be friends with everyone I met and drew fan art for

2990
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,640
Just because I'm I'm such a likable and a good person

2991
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:12,160
I mean, that's what the brony fandom was like. It was it was always like, hey, I made this thing for you

2992
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:14,240
Let's talk and be pals, you know

2993
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,000
Yeah

2994
02:34:16,400 --> 02:34:18,400
So I I would always uh

2995
02:34:18,400 --> 02:34:22,000
Do that and I remember there is uh, there was a moment

2996
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:26,800
I don't I don't know if it was I think it was I just found out like I just started getting to you

2997
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:31,040
But I was still with with tom and then started I have so much power

2998
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:37,120
I can start influencing these people and I will have a proxy to spread my ideals

2999
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:41,920
I can influence them and they will talk to it to their fucking mindless idiot fans

3000
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:43,920
And I will be the one with the power

3001
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:49,280
I will be the puppet master and they will be my puppets and I will make them do heinous acts

3002
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I will be

3003
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:55,600
Yes

3004
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,480
And then I realized now that's actually gay. I don't want to do that

3005
02:34:59,440 --> 02:35:03,280
Hmm, but one day I'm gonna make you shoot up a school digi mark my words

3006
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:12,080
Uh, uh, that that's that's my brony really I only just drew fanner

3007
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:16,640
You can you you can do this if you want to

3008
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:19,360
go on uh

3009
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:24,240
It's it's not it's not munchie is the tag you want to go on a king munchie

3010
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:28,640
King munchie you go to derpy boo king munchie

3011
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:33,920
You will find my old deviant shit. This is when I was using a mouse to draw

3012
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:41,200
A mouse to draw on the fucking derpy burroo being the pony version of yeah gel burroo

3013
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,920
Yeah

3014
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,520
Yeah

3015
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:54,240
Whatever died anyway, dude, there's so many fucking images on bruh. It's crazy

3016
02:35:56,160 --> 02:36:02,640
Anyway, you can see all my old old shit there. There's not there's not anything for munchie, but there's there's shit for king munchie

3017
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:05,200
Since munchie was already taken

3018
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,520
uh

3019
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:11,280
That's that's basically where I I don't update my art frequently

3020
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:15,120
But but I should say that as an I don't post my art

3021
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:18,880
I'm always drawn like every single day. I'm drawn, but I just never post it

3022
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:23,600
Which I I been might get angry at me for but I I don't know

3023
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,960
Uh, I I I've been doing a lot more through twitter

3024
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:30,880
By my utumbler was atrocious because I would only

3025
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:33,520
update once like a month

3026
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:34,880
At most

3027
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:40,480
I I would I would always be like hey guys. I'm sorry. Well, thank you for clicking on my youtube video

3028
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:43,360
I'm sorry. Oh my god. I swear my schedule is gonna be better guys

3029
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:45,120
V's michael here

3030
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:50,800
I don't I don't want to talk about what what I remember from your tumblr because I feel like it would be embarrassing for you

3031
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:55,040
What no, I don't I don't get embarrassed. I mostly remember you

3032
02:36:55,600 --> 02:37:00,320
Reblogging this one girl who you were like yeah, don't talk about that. That's what I thought

3033
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:05,920
Oh, I don't get embarrassed

3034
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Five seconds later

3035
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:25,840
Anyway, anyway, yeah, yeah, I refer to that as my gay period

3036
02:37:26,480 --> 02:37:28,480
Where I was just really gay

3037
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:33,440
Oh, that's perfect

3038
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:37,680
I know what you mean. I had a gay period when I was your age where I was just like

3039
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:44,400
I'm gonna be friendly. That's fucking gay dude. It's really gay

3040
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:51,520
Uh, anyway, yeah, there's there's my there's my pre pre-bescent. There is my gay and then there's my super

3041
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,400
Super power. This is my superpower phase right now

3042
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:59,840
I don't know what's gonna. I think it's gonna become uh super dad after superpower

3043
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:06,640
Powerful dad powerful father. Maybe it's gonna be something with power and father in it. I know that that's what I'm gonna call my next

3044
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:09,520
power

3045
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,520
great name

3046
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:14,560
I am power father

3047
02:38:15,280 --> 02:38:20,160
I've come to kick ass and chew bubblegum. Anyway, uh, what was I fucking? Oh, yeah

3048
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:23,200
Anyway, twitter has been like a revolution for my for me

3049
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,160
Doing anything because on top of it. There's some sort of resemblance of

3050
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,680
Make like a post right that people will see

3051
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,480
But on twitter, it's like

3052
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:36,160
Yeah

3053
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:39,520
And you can just do anything twitter is just shitting into the void. It's

3054
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:44,960
Because the only time the only time a tweet matters is in the moment. It happens

3055
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:47,520
And like whoever is there to see it

3056
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:53,280
Then they can respond to it, but it leaves no lasting impression and it's gone, you know

3057
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:58,000
All my tweets are hilarious though. I don't know if you see my tweets ever but my tweets are amazing

3058
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:01,440
I read everything on twitter. So I see all your shit

3059
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:09,680
You tend to tweet in large torrents of madness like yeah suddenly ten crazy completely different tweets in a row

3060
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:15,120
You're very much along the lines of like drill in your twitter. Do you follow drill?

3061
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,760
Oh, yeah, I follow it too. Yeah

3062
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:25,600
Uh, it's either like right before bed. I just think I have so many ideas that I didn't think about until I can't think about anything else

3063
02:39:26,560 --> 02:39:29,040
So I just need to I just what what can I do twitter?

3064
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:32,160
So it's always just weird fucking shit

3065
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:34,720
Uh

3066
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:38,400
I don't know a good way to think about this or to say way into this

3067
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:44,800
I'm just gonna briefly mention it because it's like a side project. That's not really anything. Uh, I'm writing a

3068
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:52,240
I wouldn't say a novel. I'm writing it. Uh, basically a fan fiction, but there's it's not a fandom. It's just a fan. It's just a fiction

3069
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,400
of uh

3070
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:56,400
Everything I hate about society

3071
02:39:56,720 --> 02:40:04,720
Oh god, is this your fucking manifesto? Is this what we're gonna be if I get to do an audiobook of this after you shoot up a school and kill yourself

3072
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:07,760
Uh, it's called john major

3073
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:10,560
it's about uh

3074
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:16,000
It started out as a joke in tf2 where I would make it. My name's john major

3075
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:20,640
I'm a video game soldier personally drafted by obama to eliminate all islams

3076
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:25,520
That's what it started out as and then it grew into this this fucking

3077
02:40:26,560 --> 02:40:30,080
What if the future is the worst thing ever?

3078
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,760
And and I just make all these yes

3079
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:40,000
So it's just all my fucking anger about how terrible everyone is and all their flaws

3080
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:45,440
But in the future that's okay, and it's it's like fucking celebrated. I see in the future

3081
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:52,160
Uh, uh, e-sports have completely eclipsed normal sports and the super bowl gets like 300 viewers

3082
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:56,320
Why does it still happen?

3083
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:58,640
It just just cuz

3084
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:01,520
Like a few traditionalists. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

3085
02:41:02,480 --> 02:41:04,720
And uh, like a civil war re-enactment

3086
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:09,120
Exactly exactly

3087
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:13,920
I'm not gonna go to the plot because it's not very interesting. I just want to mention it here because that's that's a lot of what I'm doing

3088
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:19,760
That's that's the reason I'm so fucking weird is because I I'm I'm always looking for a new john major character

3089
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,200
I'm always looking for a new fucking psycho for john to defeat

3090
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:28,080
The whole plot is for john to eventually wipe out uh,

3091
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:34,480
Muslims and and take down their their their video game bomb that will destroy all video games

3092
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:36,880
Is this a future where

3093
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:40,320
Muslim just applies to like everything bad in society?

3094
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:45,760
It doesn't even refer to a religion anymore. It's just a catch-all. I could totally see that happening

3095
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:52,160
Like the way that our world is going I could easily see muslim becoming that a catch-all for just bad things

3096
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,280
Oh, that's pretty fucking hilarious

3097
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:02,800
So so we have all these weird characters one of them is named sandy hook. She's a pirate

3098
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:11,520
Go on

3099
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:15,920
One of them is named darryl pluto. He's a fat guy who's sponsored by arby's and he has all this bling on him

3100
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:21,920
And he's really fucking fat and he has like he's like jacks. But if he just never fucking did anything and they only ate arby's

3101
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:26,720
How does he get jacked eating nothing but arby's

3102
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,480
That's just that's just what he does, dude. That's just his power

3103
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:34,960
Everyone has a gaming prowess and that's they're like super that's their like standability

3104
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:38,640
That allows them to play video games differently. This is all like video game based by the way

3105
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:43,600
So they they like they john is going to defeat them through video games. I was so unprepared for sandy hook

3106
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:47,360
Perfect

3107
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:50,320
Uh, we have a lot of shit like that

3108
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:56,880
Really, you're just gonna have to wait until because the funny thing is we have been talking about john major for

3109
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:03,440
Easily two years now. We haven't ridden anything. We're just coming up with new fucking characters for jaw to just come into contact with

3110
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,960
Who is we?

3111
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:10,080
I just told you i'm doing it with a team. Okay, not a team, but someone else. All right

3112
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:13,920
Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's a coalition. It's a coalition

3113
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:20,160
Uh, we're fucking uh, i'm proud that it's a collective. Didn't you realize did you? Oh you started this collective?

3114
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:26,960
Yeah, but is uh, so is your main project anything like this at all? Is it at all this kind of edgy?

3115
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:29,920
Insane just kind of edgy

3116
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,600
No, no my my main project is very

3117
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:37,520
It's it's a munchy, but it's not super munchy

3118
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:43,280
Okay, it's is it more like munchy. Who's a curbie fan or munchy? Who's a uh?

3119
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,080
Uh zodiac killer

3120
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,680
Uh, munchy. Who's a curbie fan? I'm just gonna say this

3121
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:55,120
It's about an alligator living in miami. Who's a private detective. Oh

3122
02:43:55,840 --> 02:44:02,160
That sounds fun. Are you good at like you seem like you you are creative enough that you could come up with mystery stories

3123
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:07,600
Do you think that is true? Have I said a yes, uh

3124
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:13,360
Really, I don't think it's gonna be a mystery. I think it's just gonna it's gonna be uh, it's gonna be a thriller, dude

3125
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:16,720
It's gonna be it's gonna be uh, I'm gonna name it

3126
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:18,960
gone

3127
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:25,680
Because it's something's not there anymore. It's do you get it? Do you get it? It's a reference to me and jeff arguing about

3128
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:30,080
What a mystery is right? Yes. This comes up every once in a while

3129
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:36,240
Every time I mention the word mystery someone's like jeff's gonna kill you. I actually don't remember what we argued about so

3130
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:41,200
I so don't give a fuck about what people think a mystery is

3131
02:44:43,360 --> 02:44:46,000
No effect on me that he doesn't think it's a mystery

3132
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,880
It's gonna be a mystery in the same way the part four of jojo's a mystery

3133
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:54,320
It's like you obviously know you're just here for the fucking crazy shit that's gonna happen in between the bad guy going to joe

3134
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:59,760
I'm gonna say too much because it's it's bound to change and I'm not fucking courage myself

3135
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:04,000
Well, I wanted to get out there. I know you know my policy. I don't talk about anything

3136
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,080
I'm working on because did you listen to that pizza party podcast I was on

3137
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,800
I

3138
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:16,800
I got halfway through it and then I realized that wasn't you were the only person I could even remotely stand in that

3139
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:18,880
Okay, so you don't think I should go back

3140
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:23,600
No, no, you should I was just what I I found it boring

3141
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,240
Um while I was there

3142
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:31,760
But it was funny because I listened that the thing is they remove all the pauses like that

3143
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:36,640
podcast was way longer than the one that actually got released like

3144
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:42,320
Everyone was really low energy and everyone talked really slow and it'd be like so

3145
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:45,680
Zootopia came out and the next guy'd be like

3146
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:52,320
Yeah, I saw that it was pretty good. But then like they cut out all the pauses. So it'd be like zootopia came out

3147
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:57,600
Yeah, I saw that it was pretty good. Yeah. Well, that was you know, like it all flowed so much better at the final recording

3148
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,760
That I was like, this is not the podcast that was a part of

3149
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:04,800
And I think they might have even sped it up slightly like just ever so slightly

3150
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:10,720
Really because it just felt so much faster than what I remembered. I was like, this is not the same show

3151
02:46:10,720 --> 02:46:14,480
Do you think uh, you were accidentally watching youtube on your sega genesis?

3152
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,520
No, I don't think so

3153
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:21,280
I don't even owe to sega genesis

3154
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:27,040
Just wondering because because I do that often I wake up. This isn't my fucking computer. It's a sega genesis

3155
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:29,360
Also, I'm in the trash

3156
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:33,920
I probably get out of here

3157
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:37,200
Do

3158
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:39,440
And we're back at mushy hq

3159
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:42,640
Uh, the news today. I shot up another school

3160
02:46:43,360 --> 02:46:45,360
Good job. When will he stop?

3161
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:47,760
When when when will the pain stop?

3162
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:51,520
All right, mushy. Do you have any other things you want to talk about?

3163
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:54,080
I mean, I I don't want to I

3164
02:46:54,640 --> 02:47:00,560
The things the things are boiling things are boiling when when the food will be ready to serve. I can't say but

3165
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:02,960
I

3166
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:05,840
Before 2017 things will have happened

3167
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:08,560
Are 20

3168
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:11,440
Don't say any dates. Just yeah, it'll happen

3169
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Let's leave it at that

3170
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:19,760
When people ask me like, oh, are you ever gonna cover a full metal album? It'll happen. Yeah

3171
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:24,080
I'm not saying it'll be this decade, but it'll happen

3172
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:28,720
It'll it'll happen. We live long lives. You're only 15

3173
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:36,080
You have all the fucking time in the what you're you're not even like even by current life expectancy predictions

3174
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:42,720
You're not gonna die until the year 2100. You've got you've got a lot of time ahead of you to do this

3175
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:45,920
So, uh, no one needs to be concerned

3176
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:48,480
Yeah, it will happen while you're breathing

3177
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:52,560
Unless you get hit by a truck, but you know, well tragedy

3178
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:55,760
I'm I'm what you need to realize is that I could easily

3179
02:47:56,720 --> 02:48:00,480
Lift the truck. Yeah, I could I could lift the truck. You can hulk the truck

3180
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:07,600
I think that happens in Avengers, right? He like hulk gets hit by a truck and he throws the adventures

3181
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:12,000
I watch it because I want to be with my friends and also play smash with them and beat them

3182
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,760
Yeah, that's something to say while playing splash. Yeah

3183
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:20,640
You hear about the Avengers. No, fuck you kill yourself

3184
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:28,000
You hear about the new episode of game of thrones. Oh, no, you're choking me

3185
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,640
Bunchy is choking this character. No

3186
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:39,280
I want an alternate version of game of thrones where you show up and just murder everyone

3187
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:45,440
There's like it's like fucking homes like where gambling just starts murdering everyone for no reason. Yeah

3188
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:53,760
Does that kid I don't I don't want to spoil myself. I'm not too. No. Well, it continues. Does it conclude? Of course not, right?

3189
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:57,360
I remember when he killed like

3190
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:03,760
Nepeta and everything and they were like and in everyone thought the most worthless character, but aqueous was the best character. So

3191
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:06,960
Let's balance that

3192
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:11,040
Uh, let me think let me let me think of a closing a closing settlement

3193
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:13,120
um

3194
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:17,760
If you think that I like you and and you found me through

3195
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:23,280
This podcast or or through any of these podcasts. Can you think that I like you? I don't

3196
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,600
Don't talk to me

3197
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:27,600
and please

3198
02:49:28,480 --> 02:49:32,240
For the sake of all mankind kill yourselves

3199
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,080
Please

3200
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:39,280
I don't feel like you're memeing me. So I feel like this is serious. You really have had some annoying

3201
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:44,720
There's this one guy. I'm not going to say his name for it for the sake of public humiliation

3202
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,720
This guy this guy is fucking hey, dude

3203
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:51,280
20 minutes later. Hey, dude

3204
02:49:51,280 --> 02:49:53,280
20 minutes later. Hey, dude

3205
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:57,840
I'm so I don't I don't respond. I don't respond. Why why do you think I like him?

3206
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,720
You should just type the name into the chat so I can know

3207
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:04,480
Okay, I feel I must know these secrets

3208
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:09,120
I need to know who to look out for

3209
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:12,160
Okay, I don't know that person so

3210
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,400
The person probably knows too is the best part

3211
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:25,920
Well, that's why I'm always I'm always very careful to like when I'm when I really mean one person

3212
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,680
I make it sound like I'm talking about 40 people that have all done it, you know

3213
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:37,600
But uh, I'm just like, yeah, there's all these people who do this really annoying thing and it's like mostly like one guy

3214
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:39,840
Who's really the worst?

3215
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:42,560
Really

3216
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:43,840
Just die

3217
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:46,000
To all to all of the listeners out there

3218
02:50:46,480 --> 02:50:48,240
Everyone who listens to this

3219
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:53,360
Please die. It doesn't have to be soon. You don't have to do it yourself. Just one day. Please be dead

3220
02:50:54,960 --> 02:51:00,800
Well, munchy, I know we plan on bringing you on more of these in spite of the negative attention you've been getting from the audience

3221
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:04,480
I know we definitely want to have you on the homestuck one

3222
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:09,840
If and when that happens, which hopefully I'll read it and try to get on that one myself

3223
02:51:10,320 --> 02:51:16,000
I'm rereading it dude. You better catch up. Oh, so you so you you still like it enough to re-read it. I'm taking notes

3224
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:22,320
Yes, I love homestuck. Okay other than the I just fucking I'm just fucking ballistic and I hate everything about it

3225
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:24,480
That's not the parts that I like

3226
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:30,000
Yeah, I have homestuck is the best thing that's ever happened and the other half is uh,

3227
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:32,480
It makes me want to actually be a zodiac

3228
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,400
I

3229
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,400
But only for Andrew Hussie

3230
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:38,400
Yeah, but I love

3231
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:44,880
No matter what he does with homestuck. I can't not like Hussie because I just idolize his work ethic too much

3232
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:51,280
It is worth it or whatever. Who gives a fuck if he's turning out shit. He's turning out shit

3233
02:51:52,480 --> 02:52:00,000
I I miss his blogs. What happened to that. I miss when he would write stuff that wasn't homestuck. That was so cool

3234
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:08,000
Remember fucking problems with remember whistles and it don't stop remember the fucking olive garden story

3235
02:52:08,960 --> 02:52:10,960
God damn it

3236
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:13,120
It was beautiful. Hussie. What happened?
