00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is a podcast called The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A variety podcast running since 2015.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're here. Oh, let me turn that down.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We did it. It's Radcon 4 Paradise.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have a house that we're in right now, and we're all friends.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And here we are, just experiencing that in real time.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who are we?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Where The Pro Crastinators Podcast, individually, we are Ben Saint.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, this mic position sucks.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sure, screw it a little closer. It's very like you and Jess basically.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Jesse, Endless Jess, Munchy J. Trump, Best Guy Ever Meet, Gibbontake.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Digibro.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I used my special move. Get high.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Tom Oliver.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love video games.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we're here just to talk about whatever we feel like at today's PCP episode that we're all part of.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, as a part of why we're here at this house, we had a Kickstarter link in the description

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so you can just look at the Kickstarter, which we have already funded.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, right.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And as a part of that, there was a reward tier where you could suggest things and talk to us

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and tell us what to do at Radcon.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Be quieter, is that what you mean?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, he's saying to move the mic arm because it's completely in your face.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So move it just down.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Down like so.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You will be audible if picking up everything.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's fine.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Aim it upwards at the very least.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's barely a mic up.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No more microphones.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's fine.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No more talking.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why don't you go on?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, as a part of the PTA being a thing that can suggest things to us, we asked them questions for this.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One of the questions that they asked us was, did you, bro, you said that, do you know their name?

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here, I'll get their name real quick.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But they were lovely and they asked us, what?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How do you feel about the Rad content that you've made so far?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you want to go over what we've made so far?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh my God.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, we got in and we started making like vlogs and dumb shitposts right away, which are all great.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's pretty much what I come to Radcon to do.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Everybody else is always like, oh, I've got a plan and I'm like, I have no plan.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have cameras and I have you people and I'm going to make you entertaining and put it on the internet.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's paradoxical that the big things are kind of the least important long term, the least memorable.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To a degree.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The streams are always the best.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like a really good stream where all of us are shouting and having fun is the best time.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean, I think that all the big videos are great too, but like they basically exist to give like form to the Kickstarter.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Whereas like the real purpose of Radcon inherently is to get all of us, you know, creative people in one place and make shit.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so it's like, on the one hand, we always try to make it so like there's certain things that we guarantee because, you know, so that we can have like a justification for the Kickstarter goals.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But we try to leave as much time as possible unaccounted for just so it's like, you know, the magic can happen.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Got to have that serendipitous content.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What was that first one we did about something?

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, sorry.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Patches from Dark Souls.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Patches from Dark Souls.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sucking my dick, sucking my cock.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, ain't nothing.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Touching my dick.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Touching my balls.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Touching my dick.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Touching my balls.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's what it was.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pooping on a cock.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, yeah.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Pooping on a cock.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
These are just the things that I say in my everyday life.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So they're all jumbling in my head.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, besides all the bullshit that like sucks, we have made like a billion and a half lectures.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This will be like.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We have three so far.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And we're not done yet.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We're doing two more today.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you count the Brad Garling House lecture.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Brad stopped by and he did one real quick.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Brad Garling House lecture was really fucking good and I cannot wait for that.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it?

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do we want to reveal all the ones that we have done?

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, I'm trying to figure out how many we've done.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think it's five.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
One, two, three, two, three.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, good.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Three plus Brad Garling House.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There you go.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, that's what we've got.

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We have two more.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And we've got two more on deck and possibly more as well.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait, no, no.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It was five.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I stayed up all night writing my fucking notes and now I'm depressed and I hate you.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, but the point is that this is going to have like an exponential growth of lectures

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
from last night.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like double one point five or two point five times.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Something like that.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sure.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Last time we had three, right?

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I did one.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You did one.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You did one.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I did one.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I did one.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Final fantasy.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I did one.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He's a four.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Four.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, you did one.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So we did five last time.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, so we're going to have an exponential growth.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're still going to have more than last time.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Five.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's like picking up Munchy like twice as loud as everyone else.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Just the loudest name in the world.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, I did that and everyone yelled at me.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, the problem was that it was blocking Munchy's face if we were trying to move the arm out

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
of his face.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's all that matters.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Shanagins, everybody.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's Radcon.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I love it.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, let's talk about, I mean, the little bit at least, we already did the big stuff,

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
the big ticket items as well.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The OVA and the music video.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Songs coming at you soon folks.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Those are intense.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Those are fucking intense recording days.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, as they were.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Those are two days of nonstop recording.

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,500
Like consider that like when we do Radcon, we usually expect there to be like constant

142
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
live streams.

143
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,920
Just like, oh, well somebody will have a chance to live stream while we're doing something.

144
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,000
This was not the case for those two days.

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,320
It was just like ball busting.

146
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,360
We broke our bodies.

147
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,860
We were bedridden some of us.

148
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Did he say that?

149
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Just because you're old as fuck, you like jumped and you jumped like three times.

150
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Tom was bedridden.

151
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Ben was bedridden.

152
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
We all had to nap, man.

153
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
We don't have the energy.

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I was just tired.

155
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
I was just tired.

156
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,860
I have sort of three problems.

157
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,860
Sleep.

158
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Everybody else?

159
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Yeah, you could have like sleep issues.

160
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
You're on your own.

161
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Yeah.

162
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
You could have a lot of issues, Ben.

163
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
Yeah.

164
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
I'm just fat.

165
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
Cool.

166
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Fuck off.

167
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Ben's just stressing out about fucking delegates for Bernie.

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Yeah.

169
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Bernie sleep.

170
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I also am convinced I'm going to die.

171
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Oh, because the plane, the plane right home.

172
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,860
The plane and the coronavirus.

173
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Wait, are you afraid of the plane crashing?

174
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Yes.

175
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Okay.

176
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
So they're separate.

177
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Yeah.

178
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Crash into the coronavirus.

179
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Yeah.

180
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,860
You will live the virus though.

181
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
First of all, you won't even get it.

182
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,860
First of all, when you do get it eventually, then you will live.

183
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
That's true.

184
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
No.

185
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,860
There's only like a .2 percent chance that I die.

186
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
It's like 1 in 500.

187
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
I suppose.

188
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,860
That's pretty good odds for the coronavirus.

189
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
You don't want to risk that.

190
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,860
What if I gave you a gun and I said, hey, spin this revolver.

191
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,860
There's 500 holes in it and only one has a boat.

192
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Pull the trigger.

193
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Not everyone has a random chance.

194
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,860
If you're old and inferred, you have a much worse chance of dying from it.

195
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,860
No, that's including age.

196
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,860
I'm already more sick of hearing about this stupid virus than I am about.

197
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
Yeah.

198
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,860
Hearing about Greta Thunberg and Billie Eilish combined.

199
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Well, what if you combined Greta Thunberg and Billie Eilish?

200
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
And gave them the coronavirus phase.

201
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Thank God.

202
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
That would be so stupid.

203
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Well, then they combined would be so young that it would be impossible to kill.

204
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,860
The nation would be mourning and I would be celebrating.

205
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Anything of note that's happened that we should let people know while we've been here?

206
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,860
Apparently this stream going on has once again killed our previous streak.

207
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Well, what can you do?

208
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
What in the fucking shit?

209
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
That was the best stream of all time.

210
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
That was the most base stream in history.

211
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Wait, is it over?

212
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,860
What? No.

213
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
No, no, it's fine.

214
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
The stream we did all last night.

215
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,860
Every time we do a stream, the previous one gets the fucking...

216
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,860
That means if we stream again, we will kill PCP episode 200.

217
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Potentially, but unless we download it first.

218
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Wait, what are you talking about?

219
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Did the last one get deleted?

220
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
Yes.

221
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,860
Why?

222
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Someone said in the chat that when this stream went live, the last stream disappeared.

223
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Just like what happened to us last night.

224
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Well, there's nothing we can do about that right now.

225
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Let's see if we can solve this problem again.

226
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
We were planning to...

227
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,860
If anybody still has it open, download it.

228
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Yeah.

229
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Fuck, I forgot the name of the guy.

230
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
One guy.

231
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
He managed to save the last one.

232
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,860
He saved everything we did in one guy.

233
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,860
So I really hope we can save that one too.

234
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
What the...

235
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I'm gonna cry.

236
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Why is YouTube the worst?

237
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,860
They've served their purpose in acquiring super chats.

238
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Let them be lost in a seed of time.

239
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Wow, I hate you.

240
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
You don't understand.

241
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,860
You don't understand the clutch Yoshi's Island moments that you missed last night.

242
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
I'm sure they were really great.

243
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
Hey, we're talking...

244
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,860
This is unspeakably retarded and we have to stop now.

245
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Sure.

246
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,860
One thing, since it's big numbers episode, you know, 00, I'm gonna be a little bit reflective

247
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,860
and Mr. Kuhlman, or my Kuhlman, however you prefer to be pronounced against Iranian,

248
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,860
asked, what has changed in the last Radcon?

249
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,860
And I want to add onto that, where do you guys think you will be at in your develop psychologically

250
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
by next Radcon?

251
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Where do you think you will be?

252
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Where's the momentum of the group going?

253
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
Depends on how long we think it will be before the next Radcon.

254
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,860
That was also another question that someone also asked, how long do you think the gap will be?

255
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I mean, it's too...

256
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
Probably...

257
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Too numerous to know.

258
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
One year or less then.

259
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Yeah.

260
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,860
For the next Radcon.

261
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Because this...

262
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,860
We definitely waited too long to do this one.

263
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,860
We shouldn't wait two years.

264
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
No.

265
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,860
We shouldn't wait...

266
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
I was thinking like a year to a year and a half.

267
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
I mean, the funny thing about it...

268
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Depends on what time of the year we want to do it.

269
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,860
When we first started doing these, the idea was that like we...

270
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,860
Because we had gone to BronyCon yearly on our own dime, we figured we had between us

271
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,860
the money to each travel like once a year to meet up.

272
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Yeah.

273
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
And so the idea was like, we'll just go to my house.

274
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,860
But then we were like, we could do this more than once a year, so let's do a Kickstarter

275
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,860
and then we can do it every six months because we'll pay for it once and we'll Kickstarter

276
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
at the other time.

277
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,860
Then we all realized that like, oh, we should only do this if we're going to Kickstarter

278
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,860
because why would we spend all that money on flights when we could potentially fund it

279
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
this way?

280
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,860
But that also means doing it more rarely as it means organizing a Kickstarter every single

281
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
time.

282
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah.

283
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,860
So it kind of went from like being like, we'll use the Kickstarter to do it more often to

284
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,860
just we'll use the Kickstarter to do it at all.

285
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Now it's a question of how often do we want to do a Kickstarter and have to gather up for

286
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
10 whole days?

287
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Well, see, the thing is, is that there are like smaller meetups sometimes first throughout

288
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
the year.

289
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,860
So I remember specifically there was a big meeting meetup.

290
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
Yes.

291
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
To get a win.

292
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
October 3.33.

293
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
Yes.

294
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
October 3.33.

295
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Because that was not October.

296
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
That was January.

297
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Okay.

298
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Last year.

299
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,560
Well, I mean, we are getting to the point where we are starting to like be next to another

300
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
kind of normally.

301
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Me and Ben see each other like every fucking day.

302
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
It's a nightmare.

303
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Tom lives nearby even though we never see him because he was crippled.

304
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
And then he won't come to furry conventions, even though we asked him to come to furry

305
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
conventions.

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
And he won't even respond.

307
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,060
It was in time to come to the furry convention.

308
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,560
What's fucking wrong, Tom?

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
What's up, dude?

310
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Let's talk about this later.

311
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Fuck you.

312
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I'll kill you, Austin, right now.

313
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Please do.

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Nate, and did you're going to like gay marry or something?

315
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
I heard that in the grape farm.

316
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
It could happen.

317
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
That's the current plan to move to this very area.

318
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
That's been your plan for like four years.

319
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Okay.

320
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Well, here's the thing about me as opposed to everyone else.

321
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
I have plans and then eventually they all happen.

322
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
You know who else had plans?

323
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Elizabeth Warren.

324
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
And look what happened to her.

325
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Yeah.

326
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
She failed.

327
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
I succeed because I'm a man and a woman cannot make it in the presidency.

328
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
This is what I learned.

329
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
That's what Bernie said.

330
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Even I voted for Jill Stein.

331
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Hashtag Bernie was right.

332
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I'll vote for Elizabeth Warren because I believe in the dream, but I know it can't happen.

333
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
That's my vote in my favor.

334
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
What were we talking about?

335
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,560
We were talking about where we're going to be by next red card.

336
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Very likely I will live in this area.

337
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
And what has changed since the last red card?

338
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
I quit my job.

339
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
That's one big thing that happened to me.

340
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
That's a big thing.

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
I quit my job to become a YouTube's man.

342
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
It hasn't worked out for you.

343
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
And still going like this.

344
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah.

345
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
But I've got aspirations to make it go like this.

346
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
To at least reverse the damage.

347
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
If I could at least be neutral, that would be one thing.

348
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I mean, you know, whatever.

349
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,560
The whole point of me just stopping to do a Viagra was like, well, this doesn't seem to

350
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
work in the way I hoped it would.

351
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Time to try something else.

352
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
And I'm just going to do that as long as I can.

353
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,560
And then, you know, either it'll get better or not.

354
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,560
If I have to, as I always say, I'll get a fucking real job and just do YouTube on the

355
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
side the way I did for a very long time.

356
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
And I don't even think it'll be that much worse.

357
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
So frankly, I'm just very confident things will go just fine for me in life.

358
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Do you foresee that it's going to happen?

359
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,560
Huh?

360
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Do you foresee that it's going to happen?

361
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Like, do you think that you will?

362
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
I don't know.

363
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,560
I mean, it seems like not a ton of people actually succeed in making YouTube their career long

364
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
term.

365
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Really?

366
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
So I'm just open to that possibility.

367
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,560
I mean, I don't honestly really care either way.

368
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I have a preference, but I'll just do whatever I got to do.

369
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
And I'm going to keep making YouTube videos no matter what.

370
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,560
So to the audience, it should make basically no difference other than perhaps the speed

371
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
at which they come out.

372
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,560
So yeah, I'm just going to be here doing my shit, trying to make things better and hopefully

373
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
making money enough to do it.

374
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
If not, I'll do other shit.

375
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
That's it.

376
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
That's it.

377
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Low stakes here.

378
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
So, well God, how many years ago did I come through here?

379
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Two years.

380
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Just under two years.

381
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Jesus.

382
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay, so you quit your job.

383
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Yep.

384
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
There was also me and Matthew with two.

385
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Resounding failure.

386
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Resounding failure.

387
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Would you say that?

388
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Well, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but kind of, yeah.

389
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Okay.

390
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,560
You used to be here some time.

391
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
That was the one goal.

392
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I mean, I talk about the shit a million times people know.

393
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
I just summarized it right there.

394
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
That's everything going on in my life.

395
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Nothing else of interest.

396
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Hippo, what's been going on?

397
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
You, like, died, I think.

398
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Were you already dead by the time the Rack on 3 happened?

399
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Were you already not doing epic, cool video game reviews?

400
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
And rick and mad-dosh?

401
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,560
No, I think I was still, yeah, that was 2018, right?

402
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Early 2018.

403
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Yep.

404
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Yeah, by the October 2018, I decided no more Hippo Crit.

405
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,560
So, the things I recorded at Rack on 3.

406
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
GRPJ Kingdom Hearts 2.

407
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,560
GRPJ Kingdom Hearts 2 is not out.

408
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,560
I mean, we'll never be out unless I find the time and the inclination to just do it for no reason.

409
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:57,560
But yeah, like, I've switched gears from being a YouTube gamer review person because I realized,

410
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,560
I don't really, like, ultimately it's more of like a passing interest, I realize.

411
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Just the fact that it is a career that people can have,

412
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,560
maybe think that I should pursue it as such,

413
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,560
but I didn't really feel that I was that into it.

414
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,560
So, I stopped, I went back to what I really liked,

415
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,560
which was at the time I was in the process of finishing Beljape.

416
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
So, I went hard on that.

417
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Actually, I can't remember when I started Beljape.

418
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
I think it may have been around the same time,

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,560
or it could have been, like, happening throughout the whole year.

420
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
But it was not a serious thing when it first started.

421
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Well, in the sense that it was not your fault.

422
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
No, no, it was just sort of like,

423
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
would it be fucking cool if I made something?

424
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,560
And then everyone responded no, and you kept adding it.

425
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Just throwing balls around.

427
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
No ball games.

428
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,560
So then...

429
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,560
I did Beljape.

430
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,560
I think April, the following year, in 2019,

431
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,560
I finished it, April, May, whatever.

432
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I tried to do a Kickstarter and that failed

433
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
for making a plushie of it,

434
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,560
but I was very much into doing this as a thing.

435
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,560
And so, I think, for the rest of 2019,

436
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
I didn't really do much, but I was planning

437
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
and crafting certain stories and stuff,

438
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,560
and doing, like, hundreds upon hundreds of Google Docs

439
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
with, like, world-building shit

440
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
that will eventually see the light of day

441
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,560
in certain, like, comic forms or whatever.

442
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
On the side of that, I have been, like,

443
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
continuing with my writing job freelance stuff

444
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,560
that I'm doing, which takes a long time

445
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
to get anything made.

446
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
I don't want to, I keep saying, like,

447
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,560
oh, we're just about to make it real,

448
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
but then it's sort of like, oh, there's a setback.

449
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
We have to do something else.

450
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
We have to change the script

451
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
or, like, get a different screen right over.

452
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
But there's significant progress coming there.

453
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Significant progress,

454
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
but I don't want to jinx it again,

455
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
so I'm just going to not say what stage it's at at the moment.

456
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,560
I mean, the idea of, like, that even being your job

457
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
is, like, in a weird, mega-alternate dimension

458
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
where it kind of, like, is brought up,

459
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
where it's like, yeah, I had this job,

460
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
we're, like, doing a thing by,

461
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
and then it's kind of elaborate on that.

462
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Once the first thing that I have my name on

463
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
as a writer of is a real thing,

464
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
then I can say, I'm a writer.

465
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
This is what I've made.

466
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Until then, it's like, I'm dabbling in it

467
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,560
and dabbling in it and, you know,

468
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
if you could fall through,

469
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
it would kind of be difficult at this point.

470
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
But that's sort of the two things that are going on,

471
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
is, like, freelance writing work

472
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,560
and then my own personal comic hobby

473
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
in the beginning of 2020.

474
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I started the Lord of Ghosts comic,

475
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
which initially started out as,

476
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,560
like, a very small idea, fan thing for Endless War,

477
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
your and Ben's thing.

478
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,560
We'll talk about that when it comes to that.

479
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,560
But, yeah, I'm just doing stuff.

480
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Then Radcon 3 is, like, hell yeah.

481
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
I want to see my friends and be cool.

482
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Cringe.

483
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Yes, yes.

484
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Big cringe, bro.

485
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I can't count.

486
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I don't know if this is the case,

487
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,560
but you have gone, like, completely different medium

488
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,560
of, like, artistic expression, basically.

489
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Like, you went from, like, a video man

490
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
to a comic person.

491
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
I was always, like, an art boy at school.

492
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Sure.

493
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Videos, like, I got into making videos

494
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
through my little funny stuff

495
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,560
because I made a video on a whim

496
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
and I got great feedback.

497
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
I always thought of you as an art guy

498
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,560
because you drew your own stuff in the videos.

499
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Like, you drew give and take.

500
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
So, like, from my perspective,

501
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
anybody who can draw at all

502
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,560
is automatically, like, an artist in my mind.

503
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Like, I just compartmentalize you.

504
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
I mean, I don't think of video as non-artistic.

505
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Well, I don't mean like that.

506
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
I mean, like, if you can draw,

507
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
then you have the ability to sell art in my mind.

508
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Like, if you can draw with any competency,

509
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
then I'm like, oh, you can make money doing that,

510
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
and I can't.

511
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,560
So, you're an artist.

512
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Yeah.

513
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:09,560
So, I got into video for basically just, like,

514
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
like, happy feelings.

515
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Like, oh, I got loads of notifications,

516
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
like, some subscribers and people saying

517
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
I really like these videos.

518
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
So, that, like, propelled me forward.

519
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,560
But it took me a while to realize that

520
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
editing is boring, and I don't like it,

521
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
and I hate it, and it sucks,

522
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,560
especially when it's with video games,

523
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,560
because unlike, you know, a pony show or whatever,

524
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,560
you're, the footage you gather

525
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
is not, like, prepackaged as to what it is.

526
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
You have to film it yourself.

527
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Yeah.

528
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
And you have to find, and the games are really long,

529
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
you have to find specific moments

530
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,560
if you want the footage to be correct

531
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
to what you're saying.

532
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
And it's hard being an analysis guy.

533
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
I like video games, but I don't really

534
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
care too much about analysis.

535
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Like, I like hearing about it,

536
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
and I like thinking about it, but,

537
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
I don't know, it just wasn't really my thing.

538
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,560
So, you switch away from that.

539
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Yeah.

540
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Do you think that you will have another

541
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
major medium shift by Recon 5?

542
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Where do you see yourself going?

543
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I mean...

544
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
Will you finally kill yourself?

545
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Don't take it away from you.

546
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Everybody's got to get asked that question.

547
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Yes.

548
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay.

549
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,560
No, I think, I think in terms of, like,

550
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,560
medium shifts, I got into the drawing,

551
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
because, like, drawing and, like,

552
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
art and comics, and, like, it might not be

553
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,560
comics, but it will be, you know,

554
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
creating worlds.

555
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
It might, I might go harder into writing.

556
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I might go, like...

557
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Harder into boner?

558
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Harder into boner.

559
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Into, like, animation, like,

560
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
creating a world, creating characters,

561
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,560
doing cool, like, making of stuff.

562
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Like, making a cartoon, like,

563
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
you know, stuff like that.

564
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I don't, I don't imagine that I would, like,

565
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
switch and do something completely different

566
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
exclusively.

567
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Like, I like, I have in, like,

568
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
aspirations to make, like, music,

569
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
and albums and stuff.

570
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Yeah.

571
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
It can't be...

572
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Sattled with one medium.

573
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
No, I like, I mean,

574
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I don't know what I like, but I just

575
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
have a propensity to get into a lot of

576
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
things that I just, like, oh, I like that.

577
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I want to do that.

578
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I want to make gorillas.

579
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I want to make, um, fucking,

580
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,560
uh, video games that I've seen already.

581
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I just want to make homestuck.

582
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
I want to make things that I like and

583
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
just do it, but I did it.

584
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Um, but I think, like,

585
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
the most, like, the thing I'm most

586
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
proficient in is drawing.

587
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
So I'll probably be doing something like that.

588
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Yeah, forever.

589
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Now, speaking as a fan of you,

590
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I am very charmed by your audio, visual,

591
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
community, timing, and aesthetic.

592
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
And you obviously can draw.

593
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
And you have done animations before.

594
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
That, I mean, that's what you just school for.

595
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Yeah.

596
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
So more hippo animations would be, like,

597
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
dude, that's the best of both worlds.

598
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
That's, like, not here.

599
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I have been thinking of, like, doing,

600
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
like, with Red Man and Gun Girl,

601
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
just, like, really short, like,

602
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
webisodes, just, like,

603
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
you know, the Red Man comics,

604
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
where it's just Red Man saying some bullshit.

605
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Um, I could easily make a really simple, like,

606
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
like, five minute, like, non,

607
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
like, YouTube algorithm,

608
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
or optimized, like, length of video.

609
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Uh, just, like, old school animation,

610
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
like, five minute, two minute, cool thing

611
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
where Red Man says,

612
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
uh, I'm stupid.

613
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Like, and skateboards off.

614
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
And everyone claps because they like it.

615
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah.

616
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Like, that would be, like, a nice, like,

617
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
money sink that is just cool to do.

618
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah.

619
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Sure.

620
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Sure.

621
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
It wouldn't really propel me anywhere,

622
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
but it would be cool.

623
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
I like cool things.

624
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Epic.

625
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Um, die.

626
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Did you, bro?

627
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Who are you?

628
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Yeah.

629
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
What?

630
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Who am I?

631
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Who are you?

632
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah.

633
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Who are you?

634
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Where were you last time?

635
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I kind of know where you hooked me,

636
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
but I'm fine.

637
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Wait, let me tell you.

638
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
Radcon 3 could be seen as the,

639
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
the beginning of my tailspin

640
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,560
as I dove into the ground and died.

641
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I feel that.

642
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,560
So, you know, it was, it was,

643
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,560
it was Christmas of 2017.

644
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I came to Boston to visit Munchie

645
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,560
and Nate and Tom and Ben.

646
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Yeah.

647
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
Did you actually show up to that?

648
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Yeah.

649
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
I don't think you...

650
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
Very good.

651
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Live in Boston.

652
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Were you there the same time that I was?

653
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Everyone's there for Christmas.

654
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Oh, yeah.

655
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Everybody was there for Christmas.

656
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
It was a double date thing.

657
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Yeah.

658
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Double date times two plus one.

659
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Yeah.

660
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Before Radcon 3, right?

661
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Yes.

662
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
So, we all met up in Boston

663
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,560
and Munchie was like hard-selling me

664
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
on how Boston's a cool place.

665
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
And Nate was like,

666
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
oh, I've always wanted to live in Boston.

667
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
And we were like,

668
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
all right, let's move to Boston.

669
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
We'll do PCP,

670
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,560
we'll do Radcon 3 in Boston

671
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
so that we can like house hunt

672
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
and scope for shit.

673
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Now, at this time,

674
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
I was throwing around cliff

675
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
like a motherfucker,

676
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
spending a lot of money on weed,

677
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
spending a lot of money on paying people

678
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
to help me make my videos,

679
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,560
such as you or Tom or Jesse,

680
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
all of whom I hired to do like contract work

681
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
on videos.

682
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
I was like,

683
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
this is my way forward is I'm going to start

684
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
using the extra money I have

685
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
because I was living very low cost of living

686
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
at the time.

687
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Like, you know,

688
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
weed aside,

689
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I just had tons of extra money.

690
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
So I was like,

691
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
I'm going to pour this into having other people help me

692
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
and that'll be how I make my stuff better.

693
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
And I'm also going to work on only like big,

694
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
interesting projects.

695
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Because I had made,

696
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
we have accepted mediocrity at the start of that year,

697
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
a video that was very popular,

698
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
that was just calling out YouTube.

699
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Shout out to DeVoo.

700
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Shout out to DeVoo,

701
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
who is the only reason that video is good

702
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
because it's just an unscripted rant.

703
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
You're really quiet in the mic.

704
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
I am?

705
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Yeah.

706
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Hello.

707
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
It all sounds fine.

708
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Hello.

709
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Is anyone there?

710
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Don't trust with it.

711
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Hello.

712
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
Okay.

713
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Anyway,

714
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
so,

715
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
yeah,

716
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
I'm like trying to make bigger videos

717
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
more fucking real ass content.

718
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
And then it kind of began

719
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
when I started the,

720
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
when I did the Finish or Fail video

721
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
where I wrote the script really quickly

722
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
and I sent it to DeVoo

723
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
thinking it would take like a week.

724
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
And while he was doing it,

725
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
like, you know, while he's doing that,

726
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm going to start work on my next big thing,

727
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
which is going to be how they marketed.

728
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
I remember at Radicon 3,

729
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
you hyping up how they marketed.

730
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
In fact, I was wearing all those munchy bumpers.

731
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
How they marketed were recorded.

732
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Yes.

733
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
All of you were supposed to be involved

734
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
in how they marketed

735
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
because the plan,

736
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,560
the original plan for this series

737
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
was that it was supposed to be

738
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
exploring the marketing of different shows

739
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
and then using that marketing

740
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
to promote the videos themselves.

741
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,560
And so the main show I wanted to talk about

742
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
was Pop Team Epic,

743
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
which was developed basically

744
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
as a marketing gimmick.

745
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Like, the point of the show

746
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
was to use this,

747
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
this like popular comic strip

748
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
as a vehicle

749
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
and like fill it with memes

750
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
and fill it with shit

751
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
that would get people to tweet about it

752
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
and just like promote itself.

753
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
But then the rest of the show

754
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
is all this like weird fucking animation

755
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
and like super outsider art.

756
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
And so I was like,

757
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
I want to do that.

758
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I want to make a Pop Team Epic video,

759
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,560
but like the idea is that

760
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
it seems like a Pop Team Epic video,

761
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
but it keeps veering into

762
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
other people's content basically.

763
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
And so like there would be

764
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
just a munchy segment,

765
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
a Tom segment, you know,

766
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
and each one would be

767
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
in whatever your art style is

768
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
just brought into this video.

769
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
There'd be tons of memes,

770
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
tons of references.

771
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Like I just wanted to imitate

772
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
the feel of the show in the video.

773
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,560
And so like that was going to be

774
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
a very expensive video to make

775
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
because I was going to hire everybody

776
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
to do their input.

777
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
And I'm like, this is my way forward.

778
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Spend money to make money.

779
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Spend money to make money.

780
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
That's what they say, right?

781
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,560
So that's the eight inch.

782
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
So, so...

783
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
It's adage, did you?

784
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Adage.

785
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
You got yelled at in the two...

786
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
I don't care.

787
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Anyway, so I'm working on

788
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
how they market it.

789
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
I'm conceptualizing it

790
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
while that video is in the editing bay.

791
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Radcon 3 is coming up.

792
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
I'm so, I'm like all I'm focused on

793
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
is planning how they market it.

794
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
I don't work on the planning

795
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
for Radcon 3 at all.

796
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,560
And it was made clear

797
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
that I could not bring my girlfriend

798
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
to the Rad House.

799
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
So I was like, well,

800
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm not going for seven days by myself.

801
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Fuck that.

802
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I have all this extra money.

803
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I'll just buy a fucking hotel room

804
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
and you can stay in this hotel room

805
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
for this whole time.

806
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
It's funny to think back,

807
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
there was a man long ago

808
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
who once asked to bring his girlfriend

809
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
to Radcon.

810
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
We had a similar policy for that.

811
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
So it really just seems consistent.

812
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, you mean Jeff?

813
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Yeah.

814
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Well, I mean...

815
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
In Jeff's case...

816
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Damn.

817
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Destroyed.

818
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
In Jeff's case...

819
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Obliterated.

820
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
It was that he was already there

821
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
and asking if he could bring his girlfriend.

822
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Right?

823
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Wasn't he...

824
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Wasn't it like, like a week before

825
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
I am really...

826
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
I don't think he was like expected to be there

827
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
and he just decided he wanted to come

828
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
or something like that.

829
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Something along those lines.

830
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
It was especially weird

831
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
because it was just like my house

832
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
and I was like, oh, I don't know

833
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
your girlfriend.

834
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
Like, I kind of know you.

835
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I kind of trust you.

836
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Yeah.

837
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
I don't know your girlfriend.

838
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
You just started dating.

839
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Well, regardless.

840
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
So Radcon 3, you know,

841
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
I got a hotel.

842
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
We did that.

843
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Radcon 3 was great.

844
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Lots of good stuff came out of it.

845
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
But most of the main content

846
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
was stuff that was going to take a long time to edit.

847
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
And again, just like this time,

848
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,560
I mostly came and did like tons of behind-the-scenes stuff,

849
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
random...

850
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
Like, I try to get stuff out during Radcon

851
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
because for the audience, it's like,

852
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
we hype it up.

853
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
We're like, oh, Radcon,

854
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
we're going to be here for a week.

855
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
And then for them,

856
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
it's like they see a few live streams,

857
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
I guess, and nothing else happens.

858
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
And they're just like, oh, Radcon's fucking gay.

859
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
You know?

860
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
No, there has to be stuff coming out during Radcon

861
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
so people feel excited about the event.

862
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
It's my mentality.

863
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
But then, like,

864
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
doing all that work for the PCP,

865
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,560
I come home and there's nothing for my channel.

866
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
There's nothing for me to show

867
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
for Radcon 3.

868
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,560
And I haven't finished conceptualizing how they marketed.

869
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,560
And Davoo is still working on my other big video.

870
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
I don't remember if that came out

871
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
like before or after Radcon actually happened,

872
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
but I think it was afterwards.

873
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
I think it was working on it while I was there.

874
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
I think it was after, but I'm not sure.

875
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,560
So, all of that in mind,

876
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
when that Finish or Fail video finally came out,

877
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
it dramatically underperformed.

878
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm expecting it to get like 300,000 views.

879
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
It gets like 50,000 views.

880
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,560
And its main purpose was to advertise how they marketed.

881
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
So, the fact that it failed

882
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,560
as an advertising platform for that series

883
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
already made me like, uh-oh.

884
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Like, I fucked up.

885
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Also, Finish or Fail took way too long to come out.

886
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
And at this point, I made another huge mistake.

887
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I was really obsessed with Denzel Curry at the time, the rapper.

888
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,560
And I had the idea to make a documentary about him

889
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
because he was just starting to, like, blow up.

890
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I don't remember that.

891
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
There were tons of interviews coming out with him.

892
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
And, like, his fan base was getting really passionate.

893
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
If I had done this documentary,

894
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,560
it would have been the best idea of any of the ideas I had.

895
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
It would have been, got by far the most views.

896
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Denzel Curry blew up really big not long after this.

897
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
So, and he definitely would have retweeted my video.

898
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
So, like, and I knew all that at the time,

899
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
which is why I wanted to do it.

900
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
But adding in another big project,

901
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,560
which as I worked on it continually escalated in scope

902
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
because I kept wanting to make it better,

903
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
rewriting parts of it, doing more research, adding in more clips.

904
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Suddenly, I've got just hours of interviews

905
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
downloaded on my computer that I have to sort through

906
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
if I want to find everything I want.

907
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,560
And I was just like, this project is becoming overwhelming.

908
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Meanwhile, we're trying to house hunt to move to Boston.

909
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
We have to leave at the start of May, you know?

910
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,560
So, I've got, you know, this big hole in my content

911
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
from when I did RadCon.

912
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
I've got two big projects in the work.

913
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Neither of them is close to done.

914
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
What do I do?

915
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I'll record a bunch of Bloodborne Let's Plays,

916
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
and that will, I'll use those to, like,

917
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
just fill the gaps while I'm moving.

918
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,560
So, I record, like, 20 episodes of Bloodborne Let's Plays.

919
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
No, it had to be, like, 30 or 40 episodes,

920
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
but we released, like, 20 of them.

921
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,560
And then we had 20 more that were supposed to, like,

922
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
pad the gap after we moved.

923
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,560
But they, the hard drive, when we moved, like, failed.

924
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,560
So, I did not have access to these Bloodborne Let's Plays.

925
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
The second we moved, because we moved, you know,

926
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
on the first of the month,

927
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
is when my Patreon takes its monthly hit, right?

928
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,560
So, the Patreon, because of the fact that

929
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
for this past month, nothing has come out.

930
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
I'm working on two big projects.

931
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Nothing's actually materialized.

932
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
My Patreon just goes,

933
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,560
straight down, lost, like, over $1,000.

934
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Oh, my God, really?

935
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Yeah, it went from, like, over $4,000 to around $3,000.

936
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
And this is right when I moved into a house

937
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,560
where the rent was $2,300 a month,

938
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,560
and I had to pay triple rent up front when I moved in

939
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
because of the fact that they didn't,

940
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,560
they let me move in because of my credit score,

941
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,560
but they said, like, they didn't think I made enough money.

942
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
So, like, to prove I had enough money,

943
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
they made me do, like, a triple down payment.

944
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,560
So, the end result of this is that it was also tax time

945
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
at the same time.

946
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,560
And when it came time for me to go to file my taxes,

947
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
because of the expenditure of the move

948
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
and the triple down payment,

949
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,560
I only had exactly enough in my bank account

950
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
to pay my taxes.

951
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,560
And I was like, clearly, I am not going to pay these

952
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
because that would leave me with no money

953
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
to move around with if anything bad happens,

954
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
and then something bad immediately happened

955
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,560
because me and May had a dual mental breakdown

956
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,560
about a month into living in Boston.

957
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
So, after that, everything was just, like,

958
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,560
all plans, any ideas up to that point

959
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
were just, like, all this is gone.

960
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Like, I don't care about how they market it.

961
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
I don't care about anything.

962
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
I just care about making money

963
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,560
and pulling myself out of this tailspin

964
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,560
because I will be fucked

965
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
if this continues the way it is.

966
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
And it was immediately clear

967
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
when winter came,

968
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
like, we thought that we...

969
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I loved the house that we were in

970
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
because it was big and weird

971
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
and had lots of odd hallways,

972
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
and I was like, I'm going to decorate this place

973
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
because it's super cool.

974
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
But, like, I couldn't afford to put anything in the house.

975
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I was like, I have no money.

976
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I had, you know, 15 grand in the bank,

977
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
but in my mind, that was just tax money

978
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
that needed to be held on to, you know?

979
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I mean, if I think of it that way right now,

980
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
I have negative money in the bank.

981
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
But, like, you know, the...

982
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Were we talking about Radcon 3?

983
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Yes, we're the space between Radcon 3 and now.

984
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Pardon me, Professor.

985
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
This is the How We Got Here story.

986
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
Okay.

987
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,560
So, Boston, huge bust,

988
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
lost a lot of money,

989
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
spent a lot of time recovering,

990
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
put out a video every day for a month,

991
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
and then I just spent, like, this whole interim time

992
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
trying to figure out, like,

993
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
what am I trying to do with my career?

994
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Like, because I think I've pretty much

995
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
reached the height of what I think you can do

996
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
with, like, just anime analysis videos.

997
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Like, my videos...

998
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
I've made a video that's, like, as good

999
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,560
as I think this can get at this point.

1000
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
And, you know...

1001
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Do you have one specifically in mind when you say that?

1002
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I would say The Great Anime Director Who Time Forgot.

1003
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Okay.

1004
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
Like, that video is my favorite one I've done,

1005
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
and it's pretty much just perfect.

1006
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
Like, there's nothing I'd change about it.

1007
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
It's pretty much ideal, and, like,

1008
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
having already made that, it's, like,

1009
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
from that point forward, any new video I do,

1010
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
like, I just think of it as, like,

1011
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
try to make it that good.

1012
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,560
Like, the one I did recently on The Most Underrated Anime.

1013
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Like, I would consider that pretty much the same.

1014
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
It's not as well-edited,

1015
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
because Davood didn't do it, but, like,

1016
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
as good as you can really get with an anime analysis video.

1017
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
And it's like, I want to see if I can do something else.

1018
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
So I started working on lots of other projects

1019
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
while we were in Boston.

1020
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
I started writing novels.

1021
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
Started trying to work on video games.

1022
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Me and Tom were constantly coming up

1023
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
with all these crazy, big brain fucking ideas

1024
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
that would usually fall through,

1025
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
because we did not have time to work on them.

1026
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
We did I Am Games.

1027
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
We were live streaming.

1028
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Heavy into branding.

1029
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Constantly changing gears.

1030
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Finally moved to Virginia Beach after our release was up.

1031
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Everything has been much better since moving here.

1032
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Just quality of life.

1033
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Have money in the bank again.

1034
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Able to do things just more easily and better.

1035
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
So, yeah, ever since moving here,

1036
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
life has been great,

1037
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,560
but it's also been moving extremely fast.

1038
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
From my perspective,

1039
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
it feels like I've only been here for like a couple months,

1040
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,560
and it's been almost a year,

1041
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,560
just because I have not stopped working.

1042
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
And one of the coolest things about being

1043
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
in the middle of the East Coast is

1044
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
people tend to just be passing through.

1045
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
So, like, mates passed through.

1046
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Don Jolly passed through one time.

1047
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Econ and Nino came up.

1048
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
And so, like, I've just kind of been doing these, like,

1049
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
micro-RAGCON-esque events

1050
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
where, like, two people come to my house

1051
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
and I just force them to make content all weekend.

1052
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,560
And through that spawned can-tent,

1053
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,560
so where do I hope to be by RAGCON 4?

1054
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Five. Five.

1055
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Depending on how long it takes,

1056
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,560
my expectation is that the PCP will have

1057
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,560
basically been cannibalized by can-tent

1058
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
and IM games.

1059
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,560
And that will be the central brand

1060
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,560
that me and Nate will over with an iron fist.

1061
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Everyone who's not Nate and Digi are all like,

1062
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
oh, okay, cool.

1063
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Well, uh...

1064
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
One more reason not to support can-tent.

1065
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Well, there's nothing you can do to stop it

1066
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,560
other than not watch, because there is no patreon yet.

1067
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
But one day it's coming soon.

1068
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
It does need you.

1069
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Keep an eye out for a Kickstarter, one of these great spots.

1070
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
That would actually be really cool

1071
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,560
if you guys started a patreon and split the fanbase

1072
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
and there was a war, and the PCP finally...

1073
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
I don't think you guys split the fanbase.

1074
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
...finally self-destructed and died.

1075
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Did the Pajikast cause a split amongst PCP fans

1076
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
because it does a separate patreon?

1077
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
I think that's too neat.

1078
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
The degree is there. How do we know?

1079
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Okay, what I meant by cannibalizing the PCP

1080
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
is not that it would cause any kind of yordle

1081
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
than the audience. What I meant is that

1082
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
can-tent would simply grow so large

1083
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
that it would be in everyone else's best interest

1084
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
to be a part of can-tent instead of the PCP.

1085
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
That's my plan.

1086
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah, sure. That would be pure benefit to everyone.

1087
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
No, I'm not being...

1088
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,560
I'm not being sarcastic. I want that to happen.

1089
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I know you do.

1090
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Yeah, you know, I forgot to mention can-tent.

1091
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I don't know. I always under...

1092
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I have such an aversion in life

1093
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
to overselling things and overhyping things.

1094
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
I'll do anything to avoid it.

1095
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I wouldn't know it's can-tent.

1096
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Because immediately after it started, basically,

1097
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
there was the whole channels got...

1098
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
That did happen to us. That was a big event.

1099
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Honestly, when the hack happened,

1100
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I made no assumption that it would ever come back.

1101
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
I just assumed it was gone.

1102
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I was like, I'm not going to work on this until it's back.

1103
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
I fucking... I'm not going to give

1104
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
any energy to this.

1105
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,560
For the record, that would just go into the fucking void.

1106
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Quick summary for the ages.

1107
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
My fault the channels got hacked due to a fuck-up,

1108
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
doing some deal installs and bad software.

1109
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,560
Seven channels of ours got hacked,

1110
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
but they are now all back.

1111
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
They have all been restored, so that's good news.

1112
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
We killed the guy responsible.

1113
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Brad is deceased, he will no longer live on today.

1114
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
You'll all see the story of it.

1115
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
It's quite deep.

1116
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
It is truly a legendary tale.

1117
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Okay, so Nate hopes to be a YouTube

1118
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
main man and be making money.

1119
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Yep.

1120
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Hippo wants to progress as an artist

1121
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
and make more stuff

1122
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
and be a real boy who makes comments

1123
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
with that guy and say,

1124
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
he makes comics.

1125
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Did you want to be making money?

1126
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
I want to be better known as a writer

1127
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
than as a video maker,

1128
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
but I don't think that's going to happen by Radcon 5.

1129
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Oh, we didn't even talk about it.

1130
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
You have a whole novel series that you're doing.

1131
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I have a novel series.

1132
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Let's try The Road to Radcon 4.

1133
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
Yeah, everyone's favorite.

1134
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Road to Radcon 4, which we should work on

1135
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
concluding while we're here.

1136
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
But also Kusomega.

1137
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
I have a very large...

1138
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
My plans for Kusomega are quite

1139
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
ambitious and I hope to have them

1140
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
all done within the year.

1141
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
But I want to make it like a...

1142
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I would describe it as like

1143
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
a micro sprawling franchise.

1144
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Like, it has

1145
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
elements of everything, but they're all

1146
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
small, you know?

1147
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
So that's like my vision for it.

1148
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Okay, so being a writer and making money.

1149
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Can 10, both of you.

1150
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
Also, to answer the previous question,

1151
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
what's the best thing to come out of Radcon so far?

1152
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
The Brad Garlinghouse

1153
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
lecture was probably my outright favorite

1154
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
thing we've done so far.

1155
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
I thought it was just so...

1156
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
I mean, it felt that way in the moment.

1157
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,560
I haven't seen it back, but it felt

1158
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
really, really good.

1159
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
The lectures have all been great.

1160
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
It's enough for me.

1161
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Tom, you've been crippled for the past

1162
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
like 100 years.

1163
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
You gotta turn the camera to Tom.

1164
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
I'm getting to it.

1165
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
Yeah.

1166
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
I've always been crippled my whole life, but now

1167
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
it's just physically represented

1168
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
in physical form.

1169
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
So Radcon 3 to 4.

1170
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
What's the journey?

1171
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Well, Radcon 3 ended.

1172
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
It was pretty fucking good.

1173
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
Then

1174
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
everything, I guess, changed with my

1175
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
content. Like, because me and Munchy were talking

1176
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
up, we're gonna do Investigator,

1177
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
we're gonna do Schloss, we're gonna be sick.

1178
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
We did our art apology, we committed

1179
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
Sepuku on camera.

1180
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
It's weird to think that Radcon 3,

1181
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,560
Investigator and Schloss, we're still

1182
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
in the works. Yeah, they're still on the table.

1183
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
We made big

1184
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,560
bold promises that they're coming.

1185
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,560
We basically said if we don't finish

1186
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
these, we will kill ourselves and we're still

1187
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
here and we lied completely.

1188
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
You're doing...

1189
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Okay, comics are cool.

1190
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
But you're making a video game?

1191
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Which is way cooler.

1192
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Well, he's not making a video game right now.

1193
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
You have made a video game

1194
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
and planned to make more.

1195
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
You're not making a video game?

1196
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Well,

1197
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
I got this whole big...

1198
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I talked about it in the video we did.

1199
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah, go watch the Digi's creative consultation

1200
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
with Tom Oliver where he talks about how

1201
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Azumi is currently

1202
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
more expanding

1203
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
as a brand beyond... It was always supposed to be

1204
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
a multimedia brand character.

1205
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Since the game is taking so long to make,

1206
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
it's currently looking like

1207
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
doing other things with the characters.

1208
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Gotta build up the brand first, so then the game

1209
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
can come in and be fucking

1210
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
based as fuck and not cringe.

1211
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
So pretty much all your

1212
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,560
energy is on that?

1213
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Yeah, I'm trying because

1214
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
someone is actually talking about this on the live stream last night

1215
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
which is deleted, press F.

1216
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Somebody save it.

1217
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
They were talking about why aren't you doing programming

1218
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
and it's like, well, to make a really cool video game

1219
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,560
you gotta do programming but you also need 3D

1220
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
modeling and you also need animation.

1221
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
And it's like, well, I can do coding

1222
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
first and have nothing to show for it

1223
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
because coding by itself is boring and no one cares.

1224
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Or I can learn the animation of the 3D

1225
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
first and have tons of content

1226
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
come out with that while I'm learning it

1227
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
to build up the brand and then do the coding

1228
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
and that seems like

1229
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
the more intelligent path of acquiring these two.

1230
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,560
This is typically why video games are made by teams

1231
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
of people.

1232
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Toby Fox.

1233
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
That's true.

1234
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,560
So the idea right now is

1235
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
I had this whole thing where

1236
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
me and my friend Matt, we were doing

1237
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
a big accountability group.

1238
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,560
We had a bunch of people in there trying to keep ourselves hype

1239
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
and then a bunch of people we brought in were all doing video games

1240
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
and they peer pressured me into making a video game

1241
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
and so when I came up with the Zoomie

1242
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,560
my idea was like, okay.

1243
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
I've been trying to make big, sprawling,

1244
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
crazy fantasy stories for like a decade

1245
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
and every single one of them has collapsed under its own bloat.

1246
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
So what if I made a character

1247
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
and worked in a way that was

1248
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
purposely, completely opposite

1249
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,560
all of my natural inclinations?

1250
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,560
What if I just made a purely aesthetic character

1251
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
with no story, with no lore

1252
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,560
and it was just fucking cool

1253
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
and that was the only guiding principle.

1254
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,560
You could pull a George Stancy, the opposite of every natural instinctive guy.

1255
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Exactly.

1256
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,560
And the character took off in a way

1257
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,560
that nothing else I've ever done has.

1258
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
People were doing fan art like instantly

1259
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
and it was just like, I did it.

1260
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
I figured it out. I cracked the code.

1261
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
Gotta get those furry bucks apparently.

1262
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
So, base.

1263
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
They were just like, you gotta make a video game

1264
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
so that's where the idea came from is like making a video game.

1265
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
So the big moonshot project with like

1266
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
all the fucking deep, cool things

1267
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
is all in this video game that will happen in like 40 years.

1268
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,560
But in the meantime

1269
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
I made a cool like guilty gear style shader

1270
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
so I can make cool 2D that looks 3D

1271
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
or 3D that looks 2D.

1272
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
It's fucking sick. It's gonna be dope.

1273
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
And as soon as Radcon is over

1274
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
it's back to the grindstone

1275
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
and I got like

1276
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
4 books and comics and like 4 commas

1277
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
and animations and maybe doing some

1278
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
AMV music videos. It's just like learning 3D

1279
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
learning animation

1280
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
and just putting a zoomie on everything

1281
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
and hopefully that'll work.

1282
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Tom, I think

1283
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
they're making some sort of like

1284
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
new train system

1285
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,560
that's better than the meter rail.

1286
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
It goes from Worcester to Boston.

1287
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
So when that happens, move to Worcester

1288
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
so we can actually see each other.

1289
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Cause we live like the same state

1290
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
when you're like a decade

1291
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
you're gonna get Tom before I get Tom.

1292
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
I have empty rooms in my house

1293
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
my friend.

1294
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
Is there still hope

1295
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,560
or intention for that to happen?

1296
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
I mean, it'd be cool.

1297
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Tom has said from the start

1298
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
that he has no desire to live in Boston

1299
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
as he hates Boston.

1300
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,560
It's not even that I hate Boston.

1301
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,560
I hate cold.

1302
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Cold is really bad.

1303
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
The Nor'easters have been a blight on my life

1304
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
ever since I was a wee lad

1305
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
and they never end.

1306
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I hate that a lot.

1307
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
I don't know.

1308
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
I'm still hoping out hope that somehow

1309
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
we can all

1310
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
converge on one location

1311
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
because it is still the dream.

1312
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,560
It will never move to Virginia Beach. Virginia Beach can suck shit.

1313
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,560
Damn.

1314
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
We've had a great time this whole week.

1315
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
This is not Virginia Beach.

1316
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
You say that, but one day the dollars

1317
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,560
could tell a different story.

1318
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,560
That's stupid.

1319
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,560
We'll say it.

1320
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
We don't want it to happen.

1321
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
What a weird sinister sentence to say to someone.

1322
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Ben's always so dimmical.

1323
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
Guys, nothing on this fucking earth could ever

1324
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
compel me to leave this city where I have

1325
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
some connections to some places.

1326
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,560
I lived here for a year and it sucked.

1327
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
They would like completely change your life.

1328
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
But being a bitch, I don't want to move to your dumb city.

1329
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
It's not my city.

1330
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Well, you're moving there.

1331
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
I mean, maybe.

1332
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
You're the one with the head of it.

1333
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Ben, it's like a moral, like, indignation

1334
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
against cars.

1335
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Well, yeah, sure.

1336
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
I also don't like Virginia Beach.

1337
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
What?

1338
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
I mean, for what it's worth, at the time, I didn't like Virginia Beach

1339
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
because we lived in the shittiest part of Virginia Beach.

1340
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
Now I love it.

1341
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
Every location to be is identical

1342
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
because I live inside and I don't do anything.

1343
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
So I have no interest in where I live.

1344
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
This is someone who's lived their entire lives

1345
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
in their bedroom and then finally once he moved to Boston

1346
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
and was able to realize, oh wait, the outside is cool.

1347
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
I go outside every single day now.

1348
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
I use the public transport every single day.

1349
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Look, I live in...

1350
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Then it pays $500 rent, right?

1351
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Or around there?

1352
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Less than $500.

1353
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
So he's literally able to live in Boston and have a great time.

1354
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
Thanks for having my back.

1355
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
It's a shitty place to live.

1356
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
I would rather live, I don't know, like California.

1357
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Somebody's nice, Hawaii.

1358
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
That would be nice.

1359
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
The reality of my life is that I am inside working.

1360
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
The quality of life, things better.

1361
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Being here in Virginia Beach is way better than the place I live currently.

1362
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
But the reality today

1363
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
is that I'm inside doing it.

1364
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Honestly, the reason I live in a better place

1365
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
is because it would make my girlfriend happier

1366
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
and she would be much happier living here.

1367
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
That's the main reason that it even matters to me a little bit.

1368
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Other than that, I mean,

1369
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
if there's any degree of just more convenience

1370
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
by living in a place that's just less nice,

1371
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
that, like, work is my priority.

1372
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Being able to do my work well

1373
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
and efficiently and whatever,

1374
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
that's, like, 90% of what I care about in life.

1375
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
And then the other 10%.

1376
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
So, I mean, if people don't agree with that, fair enough.

1377
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
But that's just why I think

1378
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
that I don't care where I am.

1379
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,560
I'll just do anything as long as it has, like, the bare minimum shit

1380
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
that I need to get by.

1381
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,560
I'll travel to places once in a while

1382
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
when I fucking feel like it and go do fun things.

1383
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
I don't think anyone's opposed to coming to Virginia Beach to hang out.

1384
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
Except Ben, he just said that he is.

1385
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,560
I said I would never move.

1386
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,560
I said to hang out, yes.

1387
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Okay, fair enough.

1388
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
I'm going to go to Virginia Beach and that's okay.

1389
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
Ben just put in this, like, it will never happen, man.

1390
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
Because he doesn't want to live here before.

1391
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,560
I don't want to come here before.

1392
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,560
I mean, for what it's worth,

1393
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,560
like, it's not as though we need Ben to move down here.

1394
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Like, he can come, like you said, visit anytime.

1395
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,560
Yeah, there's very clear, like, network of people

1396
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,560
who, like, can work together.

1397
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,560
What happened in Boston, particularly

1398
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
at Radcon 3.33,

1399
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,560
like, what became clear, at least to me,

1400
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
was that, like,

1401
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
Munchie and Ben

1402
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
have no real interest in, like,

1403
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,560
being YouTubers and, like,

1404
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,560
making a main, central pillar of their life

1405
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,560
be doing YouTube content.

1406
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
It's like, you guys want to do Endless War,

1407
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
you want to do your own art, you have your own community.

1408
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
There are literally only two people in this room

1409
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
whose goals are remotely similar.

1410
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,560
Right. And it's Nate and Digi.

1411
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Exactly. You guys should have a blast.

1412
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,560
You guys should have a blast.

1413
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,560
But, well, you say that it's only two people

1414
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
except that Tom also has,

1415
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,560
like, for him it's quite easy

1416
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,560
to just kind of

1417
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,560
be in things

1418
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,560
with us, like,

1419
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
I don't know, for Tom,

1420
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Tom and I have talked a lot about his

1421
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,560
I'm trying to, like, not speak for you

1422
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
while you're not paying attention, but, like...

1423
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,560
I was just checking chat

1424
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,560
because nothing was going wrong.

1425
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Because you've talked about before how, like,

1426
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
you have your own work

1427
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,560
and you're very passionate about, like, your personal projects

1428
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,560
but you also find it almost easier

1429
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,560
to, like, just work on someone else's thing

1430
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,560
and, like, be a part of that.

1431
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
Especially if it benefits you monetarily.

1432
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,560
As someone who's been a fucking hermit their entire lives

1433
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,560
and has no real-life connections,

1434
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,560
collaboration is cool, especially when

1435
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,560
it's in person with other people

1436
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,560
and you can vibe off each other's hype

1437
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
because the hardest thing for me to do on my solo projects

1438
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
is motivation

1439
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
because everything I feel like I'm doing myself

1440
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
inherently has less value

1441
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,560
because I'm a broken man.

1442
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
But, like, and when you and I were trying to work together

1443
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
on I Am Games, like, it always came down to, like,

1444
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
I have my own YouTube career

1445
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,560
but, you know, I would take time away from that

1446
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
to try to make I Am Games more of a thing

1447
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,560
and you have your 3D career

1448
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,560
and you try to take time away from that

1449
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,560
to make this more of a thing.

1450
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,560
But, like, ultimately, it was, like,

1451
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,560
you know, one of us

1452
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,560
would have had to make it, like,

1453
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
the real focus of our career

1454
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,560
for a while for it to work.

1455
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
But, like, me and Nate

1456
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,560
are living in the same spot

1457
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,560
and we were, like, we had the time

1458
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,560
to do a show, like, that we could

1459
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,560
put more focus into.

1460
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Then I feel like it's

1461
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,560
it makes more sense for you and I to do that

1462
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
when, like, you know, our goals are literally the same

1463
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,560
whereas yours are, like, more ancillary

1464
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
to that. It's, like,

1465
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,560
you know, you're not trying to be a YouTuber

1466
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,560
you're just down to do YouTube videos

1467
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
if there's, like, a successful venture

1468
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
here that you can easily slot yourself into, you know?

1469
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,560
It doesn't even have to be successful

1470
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,560
just, like, hey, there are people that are, like, doing cool things.

1471
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
I'll be a part of it. Why not?

1472
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,560
You know, successful is a

1473
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,560
subjective term. And to me, any

1474
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,560
channel with, like, 1,000 subscribers

1475
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,560
is successful in my mind.

1476
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Like, because that's so high above

1477
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,560
the baseline of what I had before I started having

1478
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,560
subs that, like, a thousand subs

1479
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,560
to me is always, like, oh, you've already got your foot in the door,

1480
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
you know? Sure, sure.

1481
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Anyway, I don't know what I'm talking about.

1482
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
So, Ben.

1483
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Yes, where have you been

1484
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
since the last radical? Where do you hope to be?

1485
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Uh, I guess we made

1486
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Endless War. Yes, we did.

1487
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
That was pretty funny and wacky.

1488
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Uh...

1489
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
Like, a month after we got back from

1490
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
my country. From my

1491
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,560
perspective, it has always seemed like that has just

1492
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
been you guys' entire lives

1493
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,560
since then, but is that how it's always

1494
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,560
happened? Basically.

1495
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,560
Um, kinda.

1496
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,560
For a while, I was, like,

1497
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,560
making the game

1498
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,560
and then, like, lately

1499
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,560
I haven't really been making it, but I've been working

1500
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
on Slime and Punishment, which is adjacent to it.

1501
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Um...

1502
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Uh, I don't know what else to say

1503
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,560
about the time in between. I mean, I guess I was

1504
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,560
making more comics. You moved back

1505
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,560
to Boston. I moved back to Boston. I did the

1506
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,560
Vapors 2 Kickstarter, which I was still waiting

1507
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
on. I'm sorry.

1508
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
It's okay.

1509
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Uh...

1510
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Um...

1511
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
I had two kidney stones.

1512
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
That was my favorite part.

1513
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,560
Uh...

1514
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
Lost 50 pounds

1515
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
got really woke.

1516
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,560
Gained 50 pounds in my energy.

1517
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,560
Uh...

1518
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
I don't know.

1519
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
I've just been

1520
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
fuckin' around.

1521
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Fuckin' around on my tablet in Manga Studio

1522
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,560
making a bunch of bullshit

1523
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
for, like, two years.

1524
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,560
Where do you want to be the retcon 5?

1525
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Um...

1526
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,560
I was doing the same thing, but with more

1527
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,560
people watching.

1528
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,560
That's it. Not more money, more people

1529
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
watching. I mean,

1530
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,560
tomato tomato.

1531
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
Uh...

1532
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,560
I don't know. Is that a boring one?

1533
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Yes, extremely

1534
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
excruciating. Cool.

1535
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
I'll probably, if we end up doing...

1536
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,560
That was torture.

1537
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
I totally forgot I was supposed to do

1538
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,560
those creative consultation videos with everybody,

1539
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,560
but if I did one with you, one of the questions

1540
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Tom is, like, is there a dollar

1541
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,560
amount you're, like, hoping to reach?

1542
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,560
Um...

1543
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,560
What, on Patreon?

1544
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Yeah. Not just, like, through your Patreon,

1545
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
just, like, in, like, your total income

1546
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,560
in a month. Like, is there, like,

1547
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,560
a number that you visualized yourself as,

1548
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
like, oh, I'd be, like, really happy if I was

1549
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,560
just making this amount?

1550
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Um...uh...

1551
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,560
I kind of feel like I already am past the

1552
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,560
threshold of, like,

1553
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,560
I make enough that I can keep

1554
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
doing what I'm doing and I won't die.

1555
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,560
That's good.

1556
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
Is that your only ambition, though?

1557
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,560
Yeah, pretty much.

1558
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
No, not really. That's so cool.

1559
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,560
It's pretty fucking smart.

1560
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
It's pretty fucking awesome.

1561
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,560
As long as...just gotta keep my

1562
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,560
biological functions continuing

1563
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
so I can keep generating

1564
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,560
digital imagery

1565
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,560
to be disseminated throughout culture.

1566
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,560
Yeah.

1567
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
That's the only goal.

1568
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
I don't know what song it is.

1569
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,560
I don't know what song it is.

1570
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,560
I don't mind stealing bread

1571
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
from the mouths of

1572
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,560
Nicaragans.

1573
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Wait, wait.

1574
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,560
But then he says,

1575
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
well, I can't feed on the underfed

1576
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,560
when my cup's already

1577
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,560
overfilled

1578
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
so I'm going hungry.

1579
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
I'm going hungry!

1580
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Hey!

1581
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,560
Sure.

1582
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,560
I guess that's me.

1583
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Excellent.

1584
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,560
I guess that sums it up, huh?

1585
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,560
Do you have any other aspirations whatsoever?

1586
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,560
Do you want everything to be exactly the same?

1587
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,560
But you have more money now.

1588
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,560
What would I change?

1589
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,560
I don't know.

1590
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,560
You don't have to improve in some way

1591
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,560
that I can't understand

1592
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,560
because I'm not you.

1593
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
I'll just get better

1594
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,560
doing my shit now.

1595
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
That'll just happen.

1596
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,560
I don't have to worry about it.

1597
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,560
That'll just happen naturally.

1598
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,560
We are desperate for some insight

1599
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,560
into the mystery of Ben Sane.

1600
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
I don't know what you want me to tell you, dude.

1601
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,560
I knew this would happen.

1602
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,560
I'm just vibing over here.

1603
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
I'm just vibing over here.

1604
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,560
He's just vibing.

1605
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,560
Jesse, do you care?

1606
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,560
Do you care about your own life?

1607
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,560
What?

1608
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
What happened between Radcon 3 and now?

1609
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
Everything bad

1610
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,560
and nothing good?

1611
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,560
No, everything was already happening at the point of time.

1612
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,560
That's true.

1613
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
I don't know.

1614
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,560
The entire period

1615
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,560
of my life

1616
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
between 2016

1617
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,560
and 2020

1618
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,560
is just a constant

1619
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,560
dark spiral

1620
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,560
of abject misery

1621
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
and pain.

1622
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,560
Then I moved and I guess I got a little bit better.

1623
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,560
Now I'm here.

1624
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,560
Where do you want to be

1625
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
by Radcon 5?

1626
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Rich.

1627
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
I mean me too.

1628
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
I don't know.

1629
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,560
I've been like really

1630
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,560
I'm in this

1631
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
transitionary period

1632
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,560
of realigning

1633
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,560
goals and pursuits

1634
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560
of really trying to branch out

1635
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
and get back to being a human

1636
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
and doing stuff outside of the YouTube bubble.

1637
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,560
I've been

1638
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
I've been

1639
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
I've been getting back into stand-up.

1640
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
I've been doing some stand-up stuff.

1641
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
That was really legendary.

1642
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,560
Back a million years ago.

1643
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,560
I've been

1644
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
learning how to have fun again.

1645
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
Teach me about that

1646
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560
because I don't know what that's like.

1647
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,560
I got into edibles.

1648
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
Oh, never mind.

1649
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Exactly.

1650
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
I started going to the movie theater alone

1651
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
and that's pretty fucking cool.

1652
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,560
And so

1653
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,560
I try to take

1654
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,560
some time for me

1655
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,560
out of the week where I just go in my car

1656
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
and on some adventure

1657
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,560
to anywhere.

1658
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Sometimes I'm like I'm going to go to the big movie theater

1659
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,560
two cities over

1660
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,560
and sometimes I'm like no, fuck that.

1661
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,560
I'm going to go to the woods and walk around

1662
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
in the woods and explore.

1663
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
And sometimes I'm like I'm going to do some

1664
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,560
other shit. I don't fucking know.

1665
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,560
So anyways, I've been doing the stand-up thing.

1666
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,560
I've been working out a lot.

1667
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,560
And my ultimate goal with the working out

1668
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
is to get my body

1669
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
looking really good and then

1670
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
finally do

1671
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
what I was supposed to do

1672
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
10 years ago which is

1673
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
trained to be a professional wrestler.

1674
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,560
Thank God.

1675
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
This was the turning point

1676
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
mistake of my entire life.

1677
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
When I got out of high school

1678
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
a million years ago or so

1679
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
I had like

1680
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
people give you money at your

1681
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
open house or whatever so I had

1682
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,560
like a thousand dollars or something

1683
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,560
which at that point was the most money I'd ever seen in my life.

1684
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,560
And

1685
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
I was looking up wrestling schools because I didn't know what else

1686
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,560
to fucking do with my life

1687
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,560
and it just seemed cool

1688
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,560
and I found a guy

1689
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,560
Truth Martini. He had a wrestling school.

1690
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,560
He's a cool guy. I've seen him on TV

1691
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,560
and like Ring of Honor and stuff.

1692
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,560
So he's a real man

1693
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,560
and I'm like okay I'm going to go to Truth Martini's

1694
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,560
wrestling school. It was like a thousand bucks to get in

1695
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,560
but then it was also

1696
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,560
like a thousand bucks for like a laptop

1697
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,560
and

1698
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,560
I bought the laptop and I started making

1699
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
videos on YouTube

1700
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
and it was the fucking

1701
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
it was the ground zero of my entire

1702
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,560
horrible life. That one decision

1703
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,560
ruined everything

1704
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,560
so now

1705
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,560
even though

1706
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,560
I'm not 20 anymore and it might be too

1707
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,560
late

1708
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
but I do have

1709
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,560
I still harbor these aspirations

1710
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
of being involved in that business

1711
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,560
some way in an official capacity

1712
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,560
either as a wrestler

1713
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,560
or even as a manager or an announcer

1714
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
whatever the fuck

1715
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,560
but my goal is right now

1716
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,560
to get in shape which has always been a goal anyways

1717
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
because I've been out of shape for many fucking years

1718
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,560
so I'm doing that. I'm doing stand up.

1719
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,560
I'm trying to I want to do more

1720
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,560
like get more into music and stuff

1721
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,560
I'm glad with people. I've been like

1722
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
reconnecting with friends that I've let

1723
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,560
friendships that have gone to the wayside

1724
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,560
as I've been more sucked into the

1725
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,560
YouTube lifestyle

1726
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,560
I've been hanging out with my friend Cody the Roo

1727
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
I've been acting more. We've been like

1728
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,560
writing skits. I wrote a pilot

1729
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
that we're planning on filming at some point

1730
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,560
for a 6 sci-fi series

1731
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,560
it's gonna be dope

1732
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,560
Flint Rat films

1733
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,560
YouTube is the channel

1734
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,560
and

1735
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,560
yeah, I'm just branching

1736
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,560
and even to the point of

1737
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,560
looking up

1738
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,560
normie work which has always been

1739
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,560
a dream of mine is to just be

1740
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,560
You mean movies? Is that what you mean by normie

1741
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,560
work? Well no, that's part

1742
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,560
of my creative sickness

1743
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,560
but I've been looking up

1744
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,560
like give me a fucking job

1745
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,560
please you know

1746
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,560
Oh, normie work is when you work with your hands

1747
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,560
and you okay

1748
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,560
I think that's normie artwork

1749
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,560
No, we're like

1750
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,560
I used to work on a farm

1751
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,560
before all this started I was like a gardener

1752
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,560
and like a sheep shearer

1753
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,560
what do they call the guys who

1754
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,560
heard the fucking bastards

1755
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,560
Shepard, yeah, that was my job

1756
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,560
I can't remember the name of it but that was my job

1757
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,560
for a while

1758
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,560
you know, bailing and stacking hand stuff

1759
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,560
and like I loved working on the farm

1760
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,560
like I love physical labor

1761
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,560
and it's like

1762
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,560
my body's pretty broken down now from

1763
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,560
sitting at a computer desk for 11 years

1764
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,560
but like man, I don't know

1765
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,560
fucking put a hard hat on me

1766
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,560
let me be, I fucking, the movie

1767
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,560
they live with Rowdy Rowdy Piper

1768
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,560
which is

1769
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,560
supposed to be like a dystopia

1770
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,560
right? He starts out the movie

1771
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
he's living in a shanty town

1772
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,560
just like he just walks into a construction

1773
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,560
site and gets a job and it's supposed to be

1774
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,560
like this is the beginning of the movie where he's

1775
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,560
like poor and destitute and it's the sad part

1776
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,560
but like I was watching the movie again

1777
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,560
the day I'm like this part of the movie

1778
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,560
that is the poor, humble beginnings

1779
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,560
is my dream I just want to

1780
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,560
wander into a town and be

1781
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,560
ripped and buff and

1782
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,560
someone puts a hard hat on me

1783
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,560
and I live in a shanty town and eat beans

1784
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,560
out of the can and work

1785
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,560
physical labor every day and get my little

1786
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,560
my $250 paycheck

1787
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,560
and that'd be

1788
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,560
pretty fucking cool

1789
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,560
those are achievable goals

1790
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,560
but then also like I found, I was like

1791
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,560
looking for other work and I found

1792
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,560
like I started looking for writing jobs

1793
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,560
because that's a thing that I'm actually good at

1794
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,560
and so I found one that was like

1795
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,560
looking for a

1796
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,560
science fiction ghost writer

1797
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,560
and it's like we're a magazine or something

1798
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
just like in that episode

1799
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,560
of Star Trek Deep Space Nine

1800
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,560
where Captain Sisko

1801
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,560
was in the 1950s

1802
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
as a science fiction writer

1803
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,560
it was like hey, we're a science fiction

1804
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,560
publication or whatever

1805
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,560
we just want someone to

1806
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,560
write the prose, we'll give you the characters

1807
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,560
and the big story beats

1808
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,560
and you figure out what to do

1809
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,560
and I'm like I could apply for that fucking job

1810
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,560
that'd be fucking sick

1811
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,560
just write a novel and get paid for it

1812
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,560
and not have to like, huh?

1813
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,560
where do you even find job listings like that?

1814
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,560
like Craigslist and shit

1815
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,560
the same way that normal people all over

1816
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,560
the world find jobs

1817
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,560
I finally realized oh yeah I can do that too

1818
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,560
I don't have to be on fucking podcasts

1819
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,560
every week of my life

1820
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,560
wait, sorry

1821
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,560
if you have more you can go, I just remembered something

1822
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,560
I don't want to interrupt though

1823
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,560
no I mean that's pretty much it

1824
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,560
I mean I still, I'm pretty much a retired

1825
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,560
YouTuber at this point and like I'm kind of like

1826
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,560
I'm kind of at the point where like

1827
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,560
it's time for Endless just to go away

1828
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,560
like he's had his run

1829
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,560
it was mostly a failure

1830
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,560
he can be, I can like

1831
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,560
I don't know redefine him or something

1832
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,560
like you know I get bored, I got bored of drowning in footwear

1833
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,560
I got bored of drowning in horseshoes

1834
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,560
I'm kind of bored of

1835
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,560
Endless just and it's like

1836
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,560
I don't know maybe like I'll keep the name

1837
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,560
as like a rap name or something but like

1838
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
I'm really considering like

1839
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,560
completely changing my channel

1840
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,560
and all my channels and like

1841
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
finding a way to do something do everything

1842
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,560
entirely differently than how I've been doing it

1843
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,560
I feel the temptation to do that

1844
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,560
about every month and then I

1845
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,560
do that about every six months

1846
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,560
well I have

1847
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,560
plans that I don't want to go into

1848
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,560
but I am thinking of like doing stuff differently

1849
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,560
and I still

1850
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,560
am making videos

1851
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,560
because I have to keep the revenue coming in from Patreon

1852
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,560
but that's all it is

1853
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,560
I keep getting comments and I keep having to

1854
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,560
clarify this of people like

1855
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,560
where is Jess? Jess never uploads

1856
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,560
videos anymore, Jess doesn't

1857
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,560
make videos, I make videos

1858
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,560
I have videos coming out every month

1859
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,560
they're just not on YouTube I don't post

1860
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,560
them publicly because I don't care

1861
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,560
I have zero desire

1862
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,560
or inclination to be a public figure at

1863
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
all it is a cancer and a poison

1864
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
in my life every second that

1865
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,560
I am not being

1866
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,560
a public figure I am much happier

1867
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,560
so

1868
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,560
like I am still making content

1869
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,560
I am a creative person and that's never going to

1870
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,560
change but

1871
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,560
most of it is like exclusive to Patreon

1872
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,560
right now while I figure out

1873
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,560
what the hell else I'm doing in this

1874
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,560
transitory

1875
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,560
period of like

1876
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,560
fuck it you know what I'm saying

1877
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,560
you know what I'm saying

1878
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,560
Ben would you forget

1879
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,560
oh I was thinking

1880
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,560
ok you were talking about finding

1881
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,560
normie work I

1882
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,560
haven't really been thinking about this because

1883
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,560
I have been

1884
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,560
before Radcon I was trying to crank out

1885
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,560
the finale to slime and punishment

1886
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,560
and um I haven't really

1887
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,560
I don't know

1888
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,560
but sometimes when I'm not

1889
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,560
like when I'm not working on something like that

1890
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,560
sometimes I think about

1891
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,560
looking for work as like

1892
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,560
like if I wanted to get like a job job

1893
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,560
I would really like it

1894
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,560
if I could be some kind of artist

1895
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,560
on a project like an indie game

1896
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,560
if I could be like an in-house artist for an indie game studio

1897
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,560
I think that would be cool

1898
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,560
or basically any project

1899
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,560
that like wasn't overly

1900
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,560
restrictive that like an artist's role

1901
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,560
on any project that like I could

1902
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,560
that I could like have

1903
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,560
some creative like input on

1904
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,560
that I wouldn't have to like stick really rigidly

1905
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,560
to a template or something

1906
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560
I would just

1907
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,560
like um I don't know

1908
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,560
like when you made t-bap

1909
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,560
I was the guy who did the art for t-bap

1910
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,560
it would be cool if there were other things

1911
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,560
that I could work on and I wouldn't even be

1912
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,560
too too picky about it just anything

1913
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,560
that like I could work on and then

1914
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,560
if people saw it they'd be like oh

1915
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,560
you're the guy who did the art for whatever

1916
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,560
x thing

1917
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,560
I guess I could even

1918
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,560
do it for like a

1919
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,560
like a comic or something

1920
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,560
it's just so fucking hard

1921
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,560
every once in a long while

1922
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,560
I'll go on Craigslist and I'll just look

1923
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,560
for like art gigs

1924
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,560
and it's all shit and I give up immediately

1925
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,560
I've looked like the only like

1926
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,560
indie game jobs I've been able to see

1927
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,560
is like UI designer

1928
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,560
for like a mobile app and I'm like

1929
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,560
no that's nightmare

1930
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,560
that's like worse than working on a cubicle

1931
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,560
honestly that sounds

1932
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,560
totally thankless and pointless

1933
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,560
and just like a waste of human effort

1934
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,560
makes me sad

1935
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,560
okay who's next

1936
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,560
it's a tough thing to pin down

1937
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,560
I'm sure there are opportunities out there

1938
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,560
there are people who want artists but

1939
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,560
how to find them

1940
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
why pay artists when you just go on twitter

1941
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,560
steal their artwork

1942
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,560
go on google.com and google

1943
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,560
sick UI and then just download that

1944
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
but then you could also google search

1945
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,560
hot anime pussy and then you could

1946
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,560
jack off instead of doing that

1947
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,560
at all so what's the point

1948
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,560
I find this

1949
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,560
interesting broadly speaking

1950
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,560
aspiring to normie job

1951
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,560
aspiring to normie job maybe kind of thinking that

1952
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,560
you think that's a normie job

1953
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,560
that's not really a job

1954
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,560
in a sense that's not a feature

1955
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,560
I don't really aspire

1956
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,560
I don't aspire to that

1957
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,560
I would only do that because it would be

1958
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,560
like boy I should

1959
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
lights are falling

1960
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,560
I only think about that because it's like

1961
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,560
maybe living

1962
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,560
on just enough money

1963
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
to not die immediately

1964
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,560
is like a little dangerous

1965
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,560
it's risky

1966
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,560
maybe I should

1967
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
aim a little higher than that

1968
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,560
financially speaking

1969
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,560
well if I was going to pursue that

1970
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,560
I guess it wouldn't be too bad

1971
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,560
to do it in this way

1972
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
the way I just described

1973
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,560
working on art in a way

1974
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,560
that's not really restrictive

1975
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,560
I would be okay with that

1976
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
the ultimate goal

1977
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,560
is that I can just fuck around

1978
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,560
and make whatever I want

1979
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,560
and I'll have a big enough

1980
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,560
or dedicated enough audience

1981
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,560
that I can just survive on that

1982
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,560
if I were to go and do a job like that

1983
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,560
my dream scenario would be

1984
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,560
the lights are falling

1985
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
is that on?

1986
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,560
okay cool

1987
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,560
they've been up the whole week

1988
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,560
they've been good boys

1989
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,560
the dream scenario

1990
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,560
is that I do that

1991
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,560
maybe I work for a studio or something

1992
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,560
we make a project and I do the art for it

1993
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,560
and it's hugely successful

1994
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,560
and then I gain cloud

1995
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,560
and it's like oh you're the guy

1996
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,560
who made the thing for that thing

1997
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
oh I know your work

1998
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,560
and then I gain

1999
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,560
my own audience

2000
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,560
this is really your coke or a wish

2001
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,560
you want a game, complete

2002
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,560
no I just want cloud

2003
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,560
I just want cloud

2004
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,560
because cloud is

2005
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,560
cloud is life

2006
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,560
because if you got cloud

2007
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,560
people will pay you

2008
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,560
people will support you

2009
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,560
just because it's you

2010
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,560
that's what I want

2011
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,560
I want to make my shit

2012
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
and I don't want to work for anyone else

2013
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,560
because I'm a communist

2014
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,560
and I don't want anyone else extracting surplus value

2015
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,560
from me because that's rape

2016
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,560
and I don't want that

2017
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,560
is it fair to say who aspired to be a demagogue?

2018
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,560
what do you mean?

2019
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,560
to be a cult leader

2020
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
cloud man who gets to bend people to his will

2021
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
and enact vengeance in the world

2022
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,560
well my schools have so far seen purely financial

2023
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
which is so sick

2024
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,560
I wouldn't say no

2025
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,560
if I type saw that on Craigslist

2026
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,560
I might send in a resume

2027
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,560
cult leader wanted

2028
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,560
I'm just talking about being independent

2029
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,560
I'm just talking about being able to

2030
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,560
survive

2031
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,560
without

2032
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,560
getting bossed around by the man

2033
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,560
you know if you could apply

2034
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,560
to a cult leader position

2035
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,560
the sort of internship experience

2036
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,560
that you would need would be

2037
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,560
being a youtuber

2038
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,560
yeah that's what you're saying

2039
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,560
um

2040
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,560
oh

2041
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,560
I was going to say in terms of cloud

2042
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,560
I don't know if any of you ever used it back in like

2043
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,560
2012-2013

2044
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,560
there was a website

2045
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,560
why would you do that?

2046
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,560
shut up

2047
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,560
to victor

2048
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,560
love you bro

2049
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,560
there was a website back in like 2012-2013

2050
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,560
it might even still exist

2051
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,560
called cloud with a K

2052
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,560
and you would just type in your name

2053
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,560
and one of your social media accounts

2054
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,560
it would rank you in like how much

2055
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,560
cloud you had

2056
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,560
it was extremely confusing

2057
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,560
and nobody could figure out

2058
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,560
we have social blade now

2059
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
which also is not

2060
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,560
really that accurate

2061
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,560
both of them are like

2062
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,560
both can make you seem like you're way more famous than you are

2063
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,560
they definitely seemed like

2064
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,560
best case scenarios

2065
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,560
and as someone who was living the worst case scenario

2066
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,560
definitely not representative

2067
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,560
like it's funny because like

2068
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,560
Saber Spark has almost a million subscribers right now

2069
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,560
and like on social blade they say

2070
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,560
he makes like $500,000 a year

2071
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,560
and he's just like

2072
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,560
not even

2073
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,560
remotely close

2074
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,560
well we've all answered this question now

2075
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,560
let's go to other piece of your memory

2076
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,560
Gino, what have you been doing

2077
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,560
since we were at con 3?

2078
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,560
no

2079
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,560
well I wanted to hear from Gino

2080
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,560
he's a star and he's continuing to be

2081
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,560
a star, thanks Gino

2082
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,560
alright Munchy, bore us with your story now

2083
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,560
hey

2084
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,560
what?

2085
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,560
there's a sibling rivalry going on

2086
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,560
Gino's like the new guy, he's so fucking huge

2087
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,560
I know what I'm saying

2088
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,560
it's magnificent

2089
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,560
what happens in the last

2090
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,560
I mean in this war like you were saying

2091
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,560
that's been my whole life

2092
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,560
and since it stopped being your whole life

2093
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,560
it's become my whole life

2094
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,560
I'm still, I'm not like active on the server

2095
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,560
I'm making slime

2096
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,560
nah I gotcha

2097
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,560
I'm not as involved in the servers

2098
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,560
you are

2099
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,560
your presence has still fell

2100
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,560
that's the most important thing

2101
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,560
just don't forget me

2102
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,560
I say

2103
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,560
so I'm in punishment finale

2104
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,560
it's coming out like

2105
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,560
probably like right after redcon's done

2106
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,560
ouch

2107
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,560
I've gotten into doing because of endless war

2108
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,560
and because of other stuff and getting really into

2109
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,560
weird stuff and that's kind of

2110
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,560
what will lead into where do I want to be

2111
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,560
but redcon 5, just like

2112
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
in case you don't know

2113
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,560
for a thousand times, but in case you don't know

2114
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,560
in this war is a game

2115
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,560
that me and Ben made

2116
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,560
it's about slime

2117
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,560
oh of course, I started to crack

2118
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,560
in punishment

2119
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
and you can play it

2120
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,560
and you can enlist and rise your killers

2121
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,560
and those are our games and you should play it now

2122
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,560
do it, please

2123
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,560
what are we going to get

2124
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,560
endless war 2

2125
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,560
it's time, I need the new version

2126
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
I need 3D graphics

2127
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,560
I need microtransactions

2128
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,560
I need a season pass

2129
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,560
why do you need a sequel to a game

2130
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,560
that's an ever evolving organism

2131
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,560
because I

2132
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,560
I'm against live services

2133
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
as a principle

2134
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,560
it's a bad business value

2135
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,560
what about free live services

2136
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,560
the jury is still out on that one

2137
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,560
I love free things and I hate live services

2138
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,560
so it's just like

2139
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,560
what?

2140
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,560
I guess that's why I don't play

2141
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,560
I don't know what to feel about it

2142
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,560
while making

2143
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,560
endless war and while

2144
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
doing other miscellaneous podcasts

2145
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,560
and stuff, I kind of realized that

2146
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,560
podcasts are boring

2147
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,560
not that I have a human hatred of them

2148
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,560
or that they're like, oh I hate them

2149
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,560
I want them to die

2150
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,560
maybe

2151
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,560
we'll let the viewers decide

2152
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,560
I guess

2153
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,560
I don't know, I just don't really like

2154
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,560
personality driven content that I make

2155
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,560
because I don't really like doing it anymore

2156
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,560
but it's cool if you like it

2157
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,560
and so

2158
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,560
I was doing endless war

2159
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,560
there's nothing more boring to me than my own personality

2160
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,560
you feel the same way?

2161
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,560
yeah I do

2162
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
and so I was doing endless war, I was ramping down

2163
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,560
doing all other sort of personality driven

2164
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
podcasts and shows like that

2165
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
I traversed the world

2166
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,560
on a summer of pain too

2167
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,560
I went to hippo's house, we did game for a day

2168
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,560
and I did a road trip

2169
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,560
and it was nice, I've really been trying

2170
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,560
to focus on being like a human being

2171
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,560
because like for all my entire life

2172
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,560
all I would do is sit in my room

2173
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,560
and I wouldn't leave my house at all

2174
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,560
and I realized that's like a bad recipe

2175
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,560
for being an artist because if you're in your room all day

2176
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,560
then you're gonna make really bad, boring art

2177
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,560
which I was making

2178
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,560
and so I decided to get out of the house

2179
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,560
and instantly I felt my quality of life

2180
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,560
immediately improved just by leaving the house

2181
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,560
and talking to my real life friends

2182
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
for even like a second and it was great

2183
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,560
that branched into going to college

2184
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,560
and I started my first semester in college

2185
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,560
and I'm in my same semester right now

2186
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,560
hashtag split break, hashtag fuck pussy

2187
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,560
hashtag free Cuba, hashtag

2188
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
80 million dead

2189
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,560
and it's been really

2190
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,560
very interesting

2191
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,560
I've been very happy that I went

2192
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,560
I feel like being an actor

2193
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,560
in the world which is something I have not been

2194
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,560
since I was a wee lad

2195
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,560
I have not like talked to people

2196
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,560
that I don't know IRL

2197
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,560
since I was like 12

2198
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,560
and so it's a very interesting

2199
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,560
cool experience and I'm happy to be moving along

2200
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
in my real life

2201
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,560
and I think that that will improve my art

2202
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,560
as I think it has been

2203
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,560
with stuff like once in cactus and in this war

2204
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,560
continuing to be interesting and cool

2205
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,560
so where do I want to be in Radcom 5

2206
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,560
I want to, I have ideas

2207
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,560
and I want to get into specific projects

2208
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,560
but here's where my brain is at

2209
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,560
I want to make new experimental art

2210
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,560
using technology

2211
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,560
during the between the last two Radcom

2212
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,560
or the last Radcom me and Tom

2213
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,560
were killing Code Hall, where is it law

2214
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,560
well I'll tell you where killing Code is

2215
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,560
it's in endless war and elsewhere

2216
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,560
and in lonesome cactus

2217
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
that's where killing Code is where all my energy and my brain power is

2218
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
I became a coding god man

2219
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
and I want to use coding to make weird experimental art

2220
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
I want to be personality based

2221
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,560
I want to make cool fiction to make people happy

2222
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,560
and I want to live my life like a normal person

2223
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,560
but also be weird, freak at the same time

2224
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,560
I just want to be a person in the world

2225
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,560
doing cool shit, I don't care about making podcasts

2226
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,560
I don't care about YouTube, I just want to make cool art

2227
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,560
that's experimental and cool

2228
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,560
hell yeah, hell yeah

2229
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,560
I don't think any of us really

2230
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,560
wants to do personality driven content

2231
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,560
well the why is it that everyone does

2232
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,560
because it's easy to expect

2233
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,560
I don't consider what I do to be personality driven content

2234
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,560
wait

2235
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,560
who so mega isn't

2236
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,560
who so mega isn't

2237
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,560
but your entire thing is like

2238
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,560
there is a YouTube trap

2239
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,560
that we all fell into for a while

2240
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
did you make a video about

2241
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,560
I find this director interesting

2242
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,560
these are the reasons why

2243
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,560
yeah I guess that's his personality

2244
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,560
as to why he thinks it's why

2245
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,560
all my videos are about things

2246
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,560
okay okay

2247
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,560
I don't think that being

2248
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,560
like I don't think it's a binary

2249
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,560
or a personality driven show or not

2250
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,560
I think there are degrees

2251
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,560
I think that like

2252
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,560
historically at the very least

2253
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,560
you have presented yourself

2254
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,560
as content

2255
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,560
people interpret it that way

2256
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,560
I think when you're

2257
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,560
starting out as an artist

2258
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,560
a good way to market yourself

2259
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,560
is to make it personality driven

2260
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,560
and to make it seem like

2261
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,560
it's not just my art that's good

2262
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,560
I'm also good look at me I'm important

2263
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,560
you kind of have to go through that phase

2264
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,560
and do that

2265
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,560
but I think all of us here

2266
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,560
have done that for long enough

2267
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,560
and now we can maybe make something more humble

2268
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,560
I think injecting my personality

2269
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
and my content has mostly

2270
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,560
only ever heard it

2271
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,560
I think that my content would have always been

2272
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,560
way more popular if I never injected myself into it

2273
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,560
I sometimes feel similarly

2274
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,560
wasn't there a whole like idea

2275
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,560
where it's like your videos are drifted away

2276
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,560
and that's how you were during like modal

2277
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,560
soul days and that big long vlog

2278
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,560
where you started doing colored chip

2279
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,560
hue value things and you're like

2280
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,560
oh let's get back to the real Digi Bro

2281
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,560
and your entire fucking entire

2282
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,560
brand is the Godzilla journalist

2283
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,560
it's my opinion and nobody liked it

2284
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,560
nobody was into that at all

2285
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,560
that was when I started losing all my patrons

2286
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,560
and people were like stop doing drugs

2287
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,560
and making your vlogs purple

2288
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,560
how is the rant hole not personality

2289
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,560
personality driven content that is your main source

2290
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,560
they're all about things

2291
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,560
like pay for you because they like your personality

2292
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,560
it's not

2293
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,560
personality isn't everything about what's in your brain

2294
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,560
it's also just like your thoughts

2295
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,560
I was going to say the rant hole

2296
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,560
after dark is personality based

2297
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,560
is it

2298
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,560
but maybe that's not the main

2299
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,560
I don't know if you consider that your main thing

2300
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,560
after dark is dead it's just rants now

2301
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,560
well yeah, rants then

2302
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,560
the rants

2303
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,560
is it that they want my personality

2304
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,560
or that they want my perspective

2305
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,560
they want both

2306
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,560
I think of those as different

2307
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,560
no I don't think that's different

2308
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,560
okay

2309
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,560
when I think personality driven content

2310
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
this is retarded

2311
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,560
all content that has anything to do

2312
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
with your views on something just is bad

2313
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
is this the point being made

2314
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,560
maybe it's not

2315
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,560
you would have to be purposely trying to be the most

2316
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,560
stupid person on earth to think that that's what we're saying

2317
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,560
and intentionally trying to

2318
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
mis-ingenderize

2319
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,560
all art

2320
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,560
is autobiographical inherently

2321
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,560
that's why the author is objectively wrong

2322
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,560
but

2323
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,560
it's okay to say

2324
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,560
this project doesn't have to be about me

2325
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,560
every once in a while

2326
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,560
okay

2327
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,560
so the way I would put it is like this

2328
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,560
when I go into making a video

2329
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,560
the mentality is like

2330
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,560
here's an idea, here's a thought I had

2331
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,560
how can I express that idea

2332
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,560
in a way where the audience will best understand it

2333
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,560
the way that I understand it

2334
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,560
and if the

2335
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,560
like if that thought

2336
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,560
is a natural result

2337
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,560
of my personality

2338
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,560
it will require a lot of my personality

2339
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
and explaining myself to get to that explanation

2340
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,560
and I think that

2341
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,560
most people

2342
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,560
view that as egotistical

2343
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,560
and it's not egotistical

2344
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,560
it's just autistic

2345
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,560
I don't have enough reference to refer to things

2346
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,560
other than myself to explain things

2347
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,560
so like

2348
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,560
there's always been this idea that

2349
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,560
Digi makes content about himself

2350
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,560
and it's like that's true

2351
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,560
but it's always just kind of been because

2352
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,560
it's easy to make content

2353
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,560
it's easy to use yourself for comparison

2354
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,560
it's easy to say here's what I would do in that situation

2355
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,560
you know

2356
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,560
I think it's sort of like

2357
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,560
the end goal

2358
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,560
by

2359
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,560
a method to get people

2360
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,560
to care about an anime

2361
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,560
is to tell a personal story or an anime

2362
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,560
which is what you do

2363
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,560
what personality driven content would be

2364
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,560
is a vlog channel where

2365
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,560
my life is the content

2366
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,560
Casey Neistat I would consider personality driven content

2367
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,560
and it's not just

2368
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,560
him himself

2369
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,560
but his editing style

2370
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,560
has a personality

2371
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,560
and it is the draw of the video

2372
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,560
nothing that happens in the videos is interesting

2373
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,560
at all almost ever

2374
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,560
it's just his daily life

2375
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,560
it's purely his energy

2376
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,560
his editing style

2377
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,560
and yes a lot of people watch me for those reasons

2378
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,560
and I do think that

2379
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,560
most of my patrons are

2380
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,560
fans of my personality

2381
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,560
probably above most other things

2382
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,560
but I don't consider

2383
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,560
the personality to be

2384
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,560
what is driving the videos

2385
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,560
individually and if it is it's usually

2386
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,560
not a good thing

2387
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,560
we need to step way back

2388
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,560
this is not judgment of good versus bad

2389
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
personality does not mean bad

2390
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
the only reason I was saying that it was

2391
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,560
boring is because what Ben said

2392
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,560
I view my own personality as boring

2393
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,560
I think most personality

2394
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,560
driven content is boring

2395
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
because nobody is as interesting as concepts are

2396
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,560
so inherently

2397
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,560
something like Casey Neistat's videos again

2398
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,560
they have an aesthetic kind of vibe

2399
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,560
I might resonate with him

2400
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,560
as a person but there is no

2401
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,560
intellectual content I forget those videos

2402
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
as quickly as I've seen them

2403
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,560
they are just fluff entertainment content

2404
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,560
that makes you feel

2405
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,560
good for the duration of watching it

2406
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,560
and I think that my stuff

2407
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,560
can have that effect and that is a good

2408
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,560
benefit of the content but what I hope

2409
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,560
my content does is get you to think about

2410
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,560
the stuff I'm talking about

2411
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,560
if your main take away is

2412
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,560
I love listening to DigiBro's voice

2413
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
I'm glad you had a good time

2414
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,560
that wasn't the point here

2415
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,560
hopefully you also thought about what I was talking about

2416
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,560
it does have to be one or the other

2417
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,560
I feel like it's a very clear spectrum

2418
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,560
it's undeniable

2419
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,560
that a lot of DigiHeads

2420
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,560
just like you and will follow you

2421
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,560
to the edge of the earth

2422
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,560
it's totally fair to say that people like me

2423
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,560
for my personality

2424
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,560
it's just that I feel a lot of the same way

2425
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,560
that you do about

2426
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,560
I find myself annoying and boring

2427
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,560
I don't like to listen to my own

2428
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,560
podcasts and stuff

2429
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,560
in fact most of what I release

2430
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,560
these days if it's a podcast I do not listen to it back

2431
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,560
I just publish

2432
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,560
because unless I can remember

2433
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
that there was something that has to be edited out

2434
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,560
I will go back and do that

2435
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,560
to me it's just like

2436
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,560
I'm over listening to myself

2437
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,560
endlessly about things

2438
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,560
I just have endless ideas

2439
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,560
and so I will provide those

2440
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,560
to the rest of you who do want to hear me

2441
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,560
you have endless ideas

2442
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,560
we have endless wars

2443
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
true

2444
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,560
and I have

2445
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,560
endless jobs

2446
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,560
thank you

2447
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,560
we can go on for over an hour

2448
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,560
we're fucking done with this question

2449
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,560
it was that one question

2450
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,560
it was one question

2451
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,560
I mean that was just the topic of the

2452
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,560
it became just the topic

2453
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
I guess it did

2454
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,560
that was like two years of time

2455
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,560
it was a good topic

2456
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,560
I mean assumably

2457
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,560
episode 100 would have happened around

2458
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,560
Radcon 3 right?

2459
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,560
yes it did

2460
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,560
well then this was a good topic

2461
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,560
thank you to whoever suggested it

2462
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,560
there were more questions

2463
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,560
there were

2464
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,560
most of them were kind of slight variants

2465
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,560
and they weren't that cool but I will go through them again

2466
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,560
just for the sake of completion

2467
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,560
I know we will see

2468
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,560
I'll grab my phone now that it's charged

2469
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,560
and look through them too

2470
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,560
it was a big old time

2471
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,560
everybody continually to talk about this question

2472
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,560
this is very cool

2473
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,560
they had rablon about something

2474
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,560
that no one cares about

2475
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,560
who said that

2476
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,560
give me a name

2477
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,560
no no one said that

2478
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,560
I'm saying you do that while I look for this

2479
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,560
not necessarily

2480
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,560
that you always do that

2481
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,560
but please for once find it in you

2482
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,560
to be boring

2483
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,560
I can't

2484
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,560
no where inside

2485
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,560
anything that's not just astonishing

2486
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,560
Bernie's only 150 delegates

2487
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,560
oh yeah

2488
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,560
Bernie Sanders dude

2489
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,560
hell yeah

2490
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,560
so how about that

2491
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,560
coronavirus

2492
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,560
dude I definitely have it

2493
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,560
dude they might cancel WrestleMania

2494
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,560
I'm hearing

2495
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,560
the NBA

2496
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,560
how am I going to find out what happens

2497
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,560
to AJ Styles

2498
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,560
calling the undertaker a cock

2499
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,560
it's a great question

2500
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,560
most of these questions are variations

2501
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,560
of what we were just discussing

2502
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,560
there's one where it's like

2503
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,560
how much of the peace of the change

2504
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,560
since the last ritecon

2505
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,560
is there like a lifejack going on

2506
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,560
again if you donated

2507
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,560
a certain amount to the kickstart

2508
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,560
for ritecon 4 you're able to become a PTA member

2509
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,560
a secret discord for those PTA members

2510
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,560
where they can tell us things to do at ritecon 4

2511
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,560
and this is one of the things that they can tell us to do

2512
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,560
they're going to ask us questions

2513
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,560
so that's what is happening right now

2514
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,560
is this a live stream

2515
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,560
or a pre-recorded thing

2516
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,560
that's what I thought

2517
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,560
there is a chat but we're not looking at it

2518
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,560
those people didn't buy their way

2519
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,560
well what if someone's super chat

2520
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,560
we'll check later

2521
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,560
can you do this more than god intended

2522
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,560
if there's no questions

2523
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
there's a super chat but we won't read it

2524
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,560
yes

2525
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,560
destroy it

2526
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,560
I mean maybe we want to

2527
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,560
exit maybe

2528
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,560
what are your daily morning routines

2529
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,560
I saw that one I didn't know if that would be interesting

2530
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,560
does anybody have a morning routine

2531
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,560
here's my morning routine

2532
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,560
oh hey by the way this is the thing that started

2533
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,560
since the last ritecon which has like a couple posts

2534
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,560
my munchie scripts

2535
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,560
tumblr check that out

2536
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,560
for the content about what I'm going to say

2537
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,560
way into like

2538
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,560
basically using machines to rule my life

2539
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,560
for me because I can't be trusted to make a decision on my own

2540
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,560
so here's what I have here's my morning routine

2541
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,560
I get up

2542
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,560
my alarm is going off and I set it up

2543
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,560
so I made a thing where

2544
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,560
my phone will only stop

2545
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,560
doing the alarm when I scan a QR code

2546
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,560
that is inside of my shower

2547
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,560
so I have to go to my shower

2548
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,560
to scan a QR code so that my alarm

2549
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,560
will turn off and then

2550
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
once I'm there I'm like I have my clothes already

2551
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,560
set up there from the night before

2552
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,560
so I literally just get into the shower

2553
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,560
so I don't have like a decision making process

2554
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,560
like oh do I want to get up right now do I just want to hit snooze

2555
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,560
no I'm already in the shower

2556
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,560
I already have my clothes here man

2557
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,560
I might as well get naked and shower

2558
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,560
so that's my morning routine

2559
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,560
then I get up sometimes I get breakfast

2560
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,560
but I usually don't because breakfast is fucking stupid

2561
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,560
and then I just start working or go to school

2562
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,560
and that's my morning routine

2563
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,560
what app does that

2564
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,560
there is an app called

2565
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,560
it is

2566
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,560
alarming for Android

2567
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,560
and you can see it so we'll scan a

2568
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,560
barcode or a QR code and I made a QR code

2569
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,560
that says wake up and then

2570
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,560
I have begun to settle into more of a general

2571
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,560
routine for my days in life

2572
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,560
that's good as opposed to like

2573
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,560
the dark times where

2574
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,560
my life was just an endless fog

2575
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,560
of grey matter

2576
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,560
read munchy strips you'll vibe on

2577
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,560
guess it you'll vibe hard

2578
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,560
where do you find munchy strips

2579
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,560
you've seen it before you've read it before

2580
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,560
it's my time oh munchy strips

2581
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,560
yeah

2582
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,560
I've gotten into a routine of like

2583
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,560
I wake up I fucking

2584
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,560
you know brush my

2585
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,560
ass and shit my teeth or whatever the fuck

2586
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,560
and I fucking

2587
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,560
I fuck around and I go to the gym for a couple hours

2588
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,560
and then I come home

2589
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,560
and then I usually just fucking chill

2590
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
and I do that for like

2591
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,560
the first 20 days

2592
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,560
of the month about and then I remember

2593
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,560
that I have to create content

2594
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,560
to get paid

2595
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,560
and so then I like cram on the last fucking

2596
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,560
day of the month like oh my god I have to do something

2597
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,560
on Patreon oh my god oh my god what have I done

2598
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,560
and so it's

2599
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,560
and then like I have like a

2600
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,560
my day off from the gym

2601
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,560
where I instead of going there I go on

2602
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
a silly adventure to like the woods or like

2603
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,560
a comedy club or something or some city

2604
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,560
and

2605
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,560
and then also I travel a lot all across the country

2606
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,560
because my fucking girlfriend is on the side of the country

2607
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,560
and I'm fucking terrible

2608
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,560
and yeah we're desperately

2609
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,560
both of us trying to save money

2610
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,560
to get a place together

2611
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,560
but it's also hard because

2612
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,560
seeing each other costs money

2613
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,560
so every time that we see each other

2614
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,560
it bleeds from the funds

2615
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,560
of saving up to see each other permanently

2616
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,560
so

2617
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,560
how can we help you to save money?

01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,560

have a really good life hopefully

2637
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,560
I'll tell you my morning routine

2638
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,560
because it used to be that I just

2639
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,560
jumped out of bed immediately

2640
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,560
went straight to the computer and just

2641
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,560
went about my day

2642
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,560
but now that I

2643
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,560
have a wife and usually

2644
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,560
wake up at the same time

2645
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:38,560
it's more like we

2646
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,560
battle over whether

2647
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,560
we're going to get out of bed or not

2648
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,560
for about 45 minutes

2649
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,560
I finally do and

2650
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,560
most of that time is

2651
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,560
me in the back of my mind thinking

2652
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,560
okay on the one hand

2653
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
I really want to get up and smoke weed

2654
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
immediately but on the other hand

2655
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,560
this bed is very comfy

2656
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,560
and I have the warm

2657
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,560
love of my wife so I'm going to stay

2658
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,560
here as long as I can

2659
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,560
but the second I get up

2660
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
I'm going straight to the bomb

2661
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,560
so the second I get up I go straight

2662
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,560
to the bomb

2663
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,560
usually though

2664
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,560
actually I'm exaggerating because

2665
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,560
usually what we do is

2666
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,560
anything that needs to get done for the day

2667
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,560
I try to get it done like the second we

2668
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,560
wake up so that I can start smoking

2669
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,560
so like it's usually

2670
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,560
like oh

2671
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,560
we'll wake up and I'll be like what do you need to do today

2672
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,560
and it's like we got to get groceries

2673
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,560
we got to go here and then we just do that

2674
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,560
right away get food while we're out

2675
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
come home

2676
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
I smoke and then eat

2677
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
and then I spend

2678
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,560
usually the afternoons just

2679
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,560
chilling, smoking and watching

2680
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,560
shit and then at night I just work

2681
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,560
constantly and

2682
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,560
and sometimes the work doesn't end

2683
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
that sounds like a pretty good routine honestly

2684
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,560
for so long I got into this rut

2685
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,560
of just like

2686
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,560
timeless nothing where because I had no

2687
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,560
structure to my days and it was

2688
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,560
just like a meandering like I got a

2689
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,560
piss and shit now I got to eat now I got

2690
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,560
a computer set on my desk now

2691
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,560
where like the months would just

2692
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
go by and bleed into each other and I wouldn't

2693
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
know what's happening

2694
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,560
it's sounding like you are

2695
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,560
going to have to be under quarantine for two weeks

2696
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,560
when you get back home

2697
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,560
what like self quarantine

2698
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,560
I don't know

2699
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,560
I don't want to be in a box

2700
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,560
what is this

2701
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,560
is it a europe thing or is it a UK thing

2702
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,560
I don't know may just message me

2703
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,560
and said hippo might end up in quarantine

2704
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,560
for two weeks when he goes back

2705
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,560
we are on a podcast

2706
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,560
I don't know if you forgot because these people just

2707
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,560
said things randomly but you can continue

2708
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,560
what you were saying on this

2709
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,560
art that you are supposed to consume

2710
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,560
for that to watch

2711
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
well I guess my point is that once I did

2712
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,560
get out of that situation and the whole

2713
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,560
furnace room basement era

2714
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,560
which was not good

2715
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,560
and I know that it was a meme that it was not good

2716
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,560
made Jesse sad again guys he was way better

2717
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,560
when his life was worse

2718
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,560
I made it a meme

2719
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,560
that it was not good

2720
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,560
I guess so that's true

2721
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,560
I made it into a joke

2722
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,560
and a meme to cope with it

2723
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
but that does not really

2724
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,560
express exactly how terrible

2725
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,560
it really was however bad

2726
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,560
I made it out to be it was worse

2727
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,560
it was much worse for a very long time

2728
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,560
but like

2729
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,560
and because of that

2730
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,560
I was kind of like stifled

2731
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,560
as a human

2732
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,560
like not being able to

2733
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,560
figure out like what I even

2734
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,560
wanted like I couldn't see a light

2735
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,560
at the end of the tunnel and like as soon as

2736
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,560
like that changed and I got out of it

2737
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,560
and like

2738
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,560
I'm not saying that everything is great but like

2739
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,560
there is a light now and like I have

2740
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,560
I have goals and like

2741
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,560
I have things I know I can do to reach

2742
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,560
those goals but I'm like

2743
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,560
as soon as I was out of there

2744
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,560
I was able to

2745
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,560
like figure out

2746
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,560
who the fuck I am now

2747
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,560
like when it started I was like

2748
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,560
22 and then I became like a

2749
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,560
gormless mass of depression

2750
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,560
for eight years with no

2751
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,560
personality beyond that

2752
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,560
and so now I'm like

2753
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,560
figuring out and like I had two

2754
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,560
epiphanies

2755
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,560
that have like almost completely

2756
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,560
changed my entire mindset

2757
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,560
I realized

2758
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,560
for the first time

2759
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,560
one that I have always been

2760
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
a hippie

2761
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,560
two that I have always been

2762
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,560
a fucking cowboy white trash

2763
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,560
hick and now that I finally

2764
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,560
cowboy baby

2765
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,560
and now that I understand like I finally

2766
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,560
realized like all my everything that I feel

2767
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,560
all these like emotions

2768
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,560
and philosophies that I've internally

2769
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,560
that I cannot articulate or express

2770
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,560
I finally realized oh wait

2771
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,560
it's because I'm literally a fucking hippie

2772
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,560
the like the formative

2773
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,560
years of my life were spent on

2774
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,560
a hippie commune

2775
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,560
that's why I am the way I am

2776
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,560
and then

2777
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,560
I also realized and then before that

2778
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,560
I grew up in a fucking trailer park

2779
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,560
and I have I've got the hick

2780
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,560
in me and like I just need to embrace

2781
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,560
that so I started I started like

2782
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,560
I really buying all these like crazy

2783
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,560
horse albums just like just

2784
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,560
injecting Neil Young into my bloodstream

2785
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,560
and just I know what you're talking about

2786
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,560
when I moved down here it just so happened

2787
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,560
that the song that like the new big song

2788
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,560
was that

2789
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,560
yeah

2790
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,560
they said the tax man and I was like

2791
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,560
I haven't paid my taxes they took my car

2792
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,560
and I got hooked on oxy

2793
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,560
code and I was like hey I need drugs

2794
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,560
they shut the lights off

2795
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,560
hey I don't pay my bills

2796
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,560
I want to kill myself too

2797
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,560
I feel exactly at home here

2798
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,560
so now that I finally understand about myself

2799
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,560
that I've always been a hippie cowboy

2800
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,560
I can finally like

2801
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,560
base my goals and decisions

2802
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,560
and the way I live my life

2803
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,560
around that and it's been a vast

2804
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,560
improvement because now I realize

2805
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,560
I do want to wear

2806
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,560
flannel and cowboy boots all the time

2807
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,560
I do just want to drive around

2808
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,560
and like adventure all over America

2809
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,560
and like see different cities

2810
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,560
and like have Memphis barbecue

2811
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,560
and fucking you know and I do just want to

2812
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,560
fucking do drugs all the time

2813
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,560
and hang out in my bed and be fucking cool

2814
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,560
and shit and now that I

2815
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,560
figured that out it's like hell yeah

2816
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,560
bro

2817
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,560

2818
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,560
epic

2819
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,560

driving you

2827
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,560

2828
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,560
whose ass were out

2829
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,560
and uh out and about

2830
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,560
those will probably be the ones that

2831
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,560
your eyes get drawn to

2832
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,560

01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,560
finally I crack the code

2847
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,560
you can just

2848
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,560
paint a better face on your real face

2849
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,560
what is each of your preferred methods

2850
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,560
of wiping your ass with no toilet paper

2851
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,560
I fucking hate wiping my ass

2852
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,560
it is the fucking worst part of my day

2853
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,560
every day of my entire life

2854
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,560
have you thought about investing in a

2855
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,560
he knows

2856
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,560
I think about it every goddamn day of

2857
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,560
my life on this earth I pray to the gods

2858
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,560
please somewhere get me to a place

2859
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,560
in life where I can

2860
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,560
where I can afford to install a bidet

2861
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,560
in my fucking toilet

2862
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,560
dude I had a bidet I hated it

2863
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,560
how could you hate such a wonderful thing

2864
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,560
I mean I tried it once

2865
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,560
and it felt horrible and I was like never again

2866
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,560
what feels horrible then

2867
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,560
like it's like a fucking

2868
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,560
scratched paper onto your butthole

2869
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,560
no that feels fine

2870
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,560
well I wet the toilet paper

2871
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,560
so it's gently

2872
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,560

2875
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,560
I've ever been on the PCP podcast

2876
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,560

2877
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,560
I fucking hate it more than anything

2878
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,560
in life I've never heard it before

2879
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,560
basically you do it before are you shit and then you like

2880
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,560
no no it's shit

2881
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,560
and then I ball up some toilet paper and then I run it under the faucet

2882
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,560
just get it a little wet

2883
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,560
if I have to

2884
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,560
how far away is the sink from the fucking toilet

2885
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,560
most bathrooms are not that big

2886
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,560
you cannot get up after

2887
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,560
you have to wipe and then get up

2888
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,560
you cannot get up

2889
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,560
wait wait

2890
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,560
when you get up

2891
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,560
you're walking and watering around and it's just spreading your shit

2892
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,560
yeah no it's spraying shit

2893
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,560
you can do it in a way

2894
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,560
that like your cheeks don't move

2895
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,560
and you don't get shit over your ass

2896
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,560
you squat and knock

2897
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,560
well I mean just like a little

2898
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,560
like a bird

2899
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,560
like in my bathroom

2900
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,560
all I have to do is just kind of twist to the side a little bit

2901
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,560
and I get

2902
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,560
all I have to do from the toilet

2903
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,560
is like twist it a little bit to the side

2904
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,560
and I can get it wet and it's fine

2905
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,560
you're fucking disgusting

2906
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,560
you don't even fucking wet your toilet paper when you fucking wet

2907
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,560
where would I meet you

2908
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,560
I can share me an ultrasonic

2909
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
it's just fucking spot

2910
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,560
it's you cleaner

2911
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,560
okay I'm gonna waste water

2912
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,560
I'll tell you

2913
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,560
that's shit

2914
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,560
there was somebody who called into the dick show

2915
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,560
one time because dick swears by the bidet

2916
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,560
and this man said

2917
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,560
if you got shit on any other part of your body

2918
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,560
would you only use a dry

2919
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,560
implement to wash it off

2920
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,560
this is true I thought about this

2921
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,560
shut the shit down I gotta step in

2922
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,560
I want to have a story because I use the bidet in Japan

2923
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,560
if you want to hear the bidet story

2924
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,560
that's a fucking nightmare

2925
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,560
second of all let's get fucking wet wipes

2926
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,560
yeah that's just basically

2927
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,560
use wet wipes

2928
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,560
wait hold on he's not galaxy brain

2929
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,560
because I have a problem with wiping my ass

2930
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,560
and it might just be

2931
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,560
because I'm unhealthy and fat

2932
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,560
but this motion

2933
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,560
causes my rib

2934
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,560
this area you are fat

2935
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,560
sear with pain

2936
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,560
go under the front

2937
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,560
hold on

2938
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,560
you get your balls

2939
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,560
oh sweaty on

2940
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,560
my argument

2941
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,560
wet wipes are not

2942
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,560
are you not wiping your ass because you're in pain

2943
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,560
no I am wiping my ass

2944
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,560
I'm just fucking suffering that's why I'm saying

2945
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,560
wiping your ass sucks

2946
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,560
what's your preferred method of wiping your ass

2947
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,560
when there's no toilet paper

2948
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,560
I don't understand the question

2949
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,560
if you don't have toilet paper how do you wipe your ass

2950
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,560
there's only one way

2951
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,560
you stick your ass over the sink

2952
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:56,560
and you just wash it with water

2953
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,560
and you just wash that

2954
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,560
of course I've done that before

2955
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,560
that's enough you have to

2956
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,560
if you don't have toilet paper

2957
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,560
you don't have to sink and not the shower

2958
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,560
I mean if you don't have toilet paper

2959
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,560
I guess my first emergency method

2960
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,560
would be like well maybe

2961
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,560
I'll just like find a paper towel

2962
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,560
and then I'll just vary

2963
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:18,560
I will tell you that I have both had to use the paper towel

2964
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,560
I've had to use the just jump in the shower

2965
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,560
yeah just jump in the shower

2966
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,560
yeah

2967
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,560
in Vietnam they use leaves

2968
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,560
where do you get leaves when you're in your bathroom

2969
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,560
I mean well they shit out in the woods

2970
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,560
this is a topical question to ask

2971
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,560
because toilet paper

2972
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,560
sold out everywhere because America's retarded

2973
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,560
and you know this question

2974
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,560
that's why I always keep leaves in my purse

2975
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,560
that's why I always keep leaves in my purse

2976
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,560
because I don't have toilet paper

2977
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,560
unironically isn't that

2978
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,560
one of the reasons Japanese people carry around

2979
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,560
those tissues

2980
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,560
because like in a lot of Asian countries

2981
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,560
those are the only toilet paper

2982
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,560
the fuck that's a terrible kind of toilet paper

2983
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,560
in the Philippines

2984
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,560
public bathrooms almost never have toilet paper

2985
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,560
aren't there like some like weird like

2986
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,560
limitations of like certain places in Asia

2987
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,560
where you can only use like X amount of squares

2988
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,560
of toilet paper and then you're fucked

2989
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,560
and then you're on your own after that

2990
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,560
but the actual answer to this was

2991
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
like okay you either find toilet paper

2992
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,560
or you do what you gotta do without toilet paper

2993
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,560
and in some situations

2994
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,560
that's just gonna get fucked

2995
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,560
we're in a public restroom

2996
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,560
about the idea of just using my hands

2997
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,560
and then washing my hands afterwards

2998
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,560
unironically, yeah

2999
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,560
you gotta do it

3000
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,560
you have the tools

3001
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,560
it's literally easier to wash your hands

3002
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,560
than your butt, we should all be wiping with our hands

3003
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,560
I mean kind of

3004
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,560
that is the way

3005
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
I don't sign off on this

3006
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,560
wait, I will never shake hands again

3007
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,560
if this becomes the cold shoulder

3008
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,560
it's due to all the motions though

3009
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,560
it's easier to wash your hands

3010
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,560
it's just more work from the think of it

3011
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,560
all you'd be doing is smearing shit with your hands

3012
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,560
no, not true because I mean you can get yourself

3013
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,560
there's just no good solution to the problem

3014
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,560
of shit and there never will be

3015
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,560
it drives me bonkers

3016
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,560
unironically had the thought that like

3017
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,560
toilet paper is a sign that we are still

3018
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,560
barely out of the fucking cave

3019
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,560
we haven't even gotten to the three

3020
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,560
seashells yet

3021
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,560
one day I'm gonna become elevated

3022
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,560
hey, here's a totally separate question

3023
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,560
we might have answered this before

3024
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,560
but it's just a good one on a occasion such as this

3025
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,560
is it full of rifa?

3026
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,560
wait, wait, wait, before you do that

3027
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,560
I wanna adjust this, because son of Marowak

3028
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,560
said to talk about the failure of the poll yesterday

3029
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,560
and he was mad all day because

3030
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,560
okay, we played

3031
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,560
Super Smash Bros. last night

3032
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,560
because at the moment

3033
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,560
that Nate checked the poll

3034
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,560
Super Smash Bros. was ahead by one point

3035
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,560
by the time we started

3036
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,560
streaming this was no longer the case

3037
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,560
Scott Pilgrim was winning

3038
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,560
there had to be a cutoff point

3039
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,560
it was just that moment when Nate

3040
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,560
looked at his phone that he said

3041
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
smash is ahead by one point, that's what we're playing

3042
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,560
so to you it seems like a cruel deception

3043
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,560
but in reality it was just bureaucratic

3044
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,560
delays caused

3045
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,560
this incident

3046
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,560
but perhaps we'll make it right

3047
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,560
in the future, we'll see

3048
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,560
okay, is it full of rifa? just ask

3049
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,560
what video should I introduce

3050
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,560
you to new people as the PCP

3051
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,560
any suggestions?

3052
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,560
did he mean specifically the PCP

3053
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,560
or like each of us in the video?

3054
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,560
sure

3055
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,560
Nate, who? what?

3056
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,560
it's gotta be Ben

3057
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,560
you're in log in part 1 and part 2

3058
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,560
or like I would say

3059
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,560
for your videos, if you're into smash

3060
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,560
watch any of the smash videos

3061
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,560
it depends what they want to see

3062
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,560
my favorite

3063
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,560
best guy ever video

3064
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,560
is Uncovered Final Fantasy 15

3065
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,560
and Head in Hell

3066
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,560
and Evening in Hell

3067
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,560
that one is probably

3068
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,560
incomprehensible if you don't know

3069
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,560
what the fuck was going on

3070
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,560
which nobody did, so the video is incomprehensible

3071
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,560
basically everybody but me and you

3072
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,560
happened to witness this weird

3073
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,560
Final Fantasy event

3074
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,560
but also

3075
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,560
I have a BGE Essentials playlist

3076
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,560
for a reason, I choose

3077
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,560
to be all the best contents in there

3078
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,560
so link up that playlist

3079
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,560
but also

3080
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,560
what would be the best for getting into the PCP though?

3081
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,560
just like episode 1

3082
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,560
I mean there's probably better episodes

3083
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,560
things we can't get into

3084
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,560
is the one that most people see

3085
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,560
your thing last night

3086
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,560
was unironically

3087
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,560
kind of fulfilled that function

3088
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,560
at least in terms of

3089
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,560
finally being

3090
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,560
able to explain some part

3091
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,560
of this madness that is my life

3092
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,560
in a way that makes sense to me

3093
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,560
I did like that about it

3094
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,560
but that's free PCP history

3095
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,560
means it needs to die

3096
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,560
the first episode was me

3097
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,560
on it

3098
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,560
that one's good too

3099
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,560
things I can't get into the episode

3100
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,560
there's your easy answer

3101
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,560
there's a helicopter

3102
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,560
there's a big loud noise

3103
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,560
I know a loud man, Munchy

3104
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,560
what should people get into for you?

3105
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,560
it's gotta know

3106
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,560
that you have to

3107
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,560
get into this warplay

3108
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,560
you basically have to know who me and Ben are already

3109
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,560
I would say either

3110
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,560
first episode of Armour Treeble

3111
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,560
and then follow that through

3112
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,560
and read Humphduck with us

3113
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,560
The Deal Nation Lecture obviously is a classic

3114
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,560
and then if not that

3115
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,560
then The Spice of Bro packed

3116
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,560
or still in your dad

3117
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,560
the first live episode

3118
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:28,560
any of those

3119
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,560
I guess give or you

3120
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,560

3121

3149
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:33,420
old-school underground mix tape which is where I took a bunch of my best

3150
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:38,640
verses from all my other albums and made like a very accessible version of them

3151
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,140
so like that album is pretty much just designed to be like your intro to

3152
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:48,780
Digi Bro music kind of experience. I always really like the art is all about pushing your buttons or

3153
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:52,460
turning that one. Art is all about pushing your buttons. It's the first thing in the

3154
01:46:52,460 --> 01:47:00,860
essential Digi Bro playlist. The essential Digi Bro playlist is not a collection of my best

3155
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:05,260
videos but just the ones that I think if you watch them. Found in Ideology. Right,

3156
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:09,220
because so much of the way I talk about shows is different from other critics

3157
01:47:09,220 --> 01:47:12,700
and it confuses a lot of people and so it's like if you watch these videos

3158
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:15,620
you'll understand where I'm coming from and like art is all about pushing your

3159
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:19,060
buttons is the first one in there because it's just to explain like look I'm not

3160
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:23,180
always gonna talk about every element of every show. I'm gonna talk about the

3161
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:26,940
interesting elements of every show that pushed my button like what stood out to

3162
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:31,300
me because that's what makes the experience meaningful to me. Also we

3163
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,260
have accepted mediocrity also an excellent video. That is a good one as well.

3164
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:40,780
Tom where should they go for you? Just go to my Twitter I guess I mean that's where I'm just living right now.

3165
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:47,780
At Tommy Oliver Says on Twitter you can play. You need it Tom. You gotta get your fucking website out so you can start killing people.

3166
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:52,860
It's halfway done. I was working on it before. Obviously you can't have made any

3167
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,700
progress on it while at Roundcon but it's just driving me crazy because I go to

3168
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:01,280
your Twitter and it is a useless way to like get into you because you tweet way

3169
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:06,040
more than just your own art. Yeah well yeah I have also made it into

3170
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,060
Zoomy Twitter but I haven't done anything like that. It's like I get it Tom you support

3171
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:13,060
Gamergate. I don't need to repeat it.

3172
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:20,060
Hashtag not your shield. The fight continues. It's not over yet.

3173
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:24,060
The Endless War Twitter and the Zoomy Twitter should like ERP.

3174
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,060
Have you seen what I've been doing with the Endless War Twitter lately?

3175
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:32,060
Yeah of course. It's just like key words Endless War, Slime, Retweet.

3176
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:38,060
I just searched the word Slime. I just find like funny Slime posts on Twitter and just retweet all of them.

3177
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:41,060
So Ben how about you?

3178
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:45,060
I mean I guess I would say my comics at stcomics.com.

3179
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:50,060
If it was a video I guess I would say depending on which way the wind blows for you either the

3180
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:55,060
Sonichu lecture or the Nuzlocke one. Yeah the Nuzlocke.

3181
01:48:55,060 --> 01:49:00,060
It's probably starting with Genesis. I'll probably do another one at some point.

3182
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:05,060
I don't know when but like oh I was thinking of doing one with Temtem.

3183
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:08,060
I was thinking of Nuzlocke and Temtem. I don't know.

3184
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:13,060
But it's like in beta pre-release right now. So I probably wouldn't do it until it's a season full release.

3185
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:16,060
Do you want anyone to get into you at all? Do you want that?

3186
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:19,060
Patreon.com slash Endless Jest of course right? Yeah.

3187
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:24,060
I mean Patrons where everybody should go. Just give us money. We promise it's worth it.

3188
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,060
Oh yeah Patreon.com slash Give and Take. Ben St.

3189
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:34,060
I got 50 bonus podcasts. Patreon.com in general. Everyone know what Patreon is.

3190
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:39,060
We literally all have Patreon. Everyone knows. Yes I don't.

3191
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:44,060
He's got only fans though. I will after this.

3192
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:48,060
Send me that link as soon as it's live.

3193
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:52,060
AshleyMadison.com slash MunchieJ.

3194
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:55,060
I don't want to tell my dad about this. Don't worry.

3195
01:49:55,060 --> 01:50:01,060
Check out my Seeking Arrangements page. Looking for a baby daddy type situation.

3196
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:04,060
I'm the baby. No.

3197
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:07,060
Well I mean we pretty much got through all the...

3198
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:09,060
Wait I didn't answer.

3199
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:12,060
What? You didn't answer?

3200
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:15,060
I think we're pretty much done. I mean we could go on.

3201
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,060
Are you done? They're not just you speak.

3202
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:25,060
No. The best video to get into my stuff. I peaked very early with a video called Reapers.

3203
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:29,060
Reapers. If you are into Mass Effect then yeah.

3204
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:35,060
I'll tell you how you get into Jesse is you watch the fuck series.

3205
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:37,060
Those are the most easy accessible videos.

3206
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,060
Yeah I guess.

3207
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,060
And they're all hilarious.

3208
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:42,060
The way I got into Jesse was fuck cars.

3209
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:46,060
And I need you to understand how young I am and how old you are.

3210
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:48,060
When you made that video I watched it.

3211
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:51,060
And then I showed it to all my friends at the library in sixth grade.

3212
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:55,060
You know the funny thing about that video is when I watch it back.

3213
01:50:55,060 --> 01:51:01,060
It's like so obvious to me that first that I was just starting out and trying to figure out what my voice was.

3214
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:04,060
And second that I had just started listening to a lot of Bill Burr.

3215
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,060
Yes.

3216
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:09,060
I'm just talking like Bill Burr in that video.

3217
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:14,060
Yeah. It's very noticeable that you're really confident that you are like a Bill Burr AVGN.

3218
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:15,060
Yeah.

3219
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:19,060
That's me. The Bill Burr AVGN.

3220
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:22,060
I mean if you're going to be something it's not a bad thing to be.

3221
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:29,060
But other than that actually you know what? One video, the one video to get into endless stress I would pick sound criminals.

3222
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:35,060
Yeah. Sound criminals and everyone loves unanimously.

3223
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:40,060
Like the one video I've made that everyone unanimously enjoys is the autumn video.

3224
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,060
Yeah.

3225
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,060
Oh yeah.

3226
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:46,060
People like really, people blow smoke up my ass about that autumn video all the time.

3227
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,060
And so cool.

3228
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,060
I guess that must be the one.

3229
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:55,060
I don't like, honestly like everyone, it seems like a lot of time people talk about me and they're like, oh endless Jess.

3230
01:51:55,060 --> 01:52:04,060
Hoshu finale, meta stuff, standing in front of a bookcase angry yelling at the camera man.

3231
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,060
It's like, dude like when he grew the neck beard.

3232
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:07,060
Yeah.

3233
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:08,060
Yeah.

3234
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:10,060
When he grew the neck beard it really came into his own.

3235
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:11,060
Yeah.

3236
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:14,060
All that, but like this, I guess this is how I've evolved.

3237
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,060
Like I hate all of that shit.

3238
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,060
Embarrassed of all of it.

3239
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:19,060
None of it matters to me.

3240
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:22,060
The Crystal Empire video is still an old favorite.

3241
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,060
The Colt Corona.

3242
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,060
Oh yeah.

3243
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:25,060
Colt Corona is gold.

3244
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,060
I will never, I will never not love Colt Corona.

3245
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:31,060
He's one of the best things that ever came out of me.

3246
01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:34,060
He is my son and I love him forever.

3247
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:36,060
Him crawling out of that little baby castle.

3248
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:37,060
Yeah.

3249
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,060
Stuck with him so powerfully to this day.

3250
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:42,060
Everything involving Colt Corona is gold and will always be.

3251
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:43,060
It's true.

3252
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:46,060
I think like my, but my favorite videos of mine.

3253
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:48,060
I think it's possible.

3254
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:49,060
I've never seen this.

3255
01:52:49,060 --> 01:52:50,060
Reasons I love auto videos.

3256
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:51,060
You've never seen.

3257
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,060
I saw it.

3258
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:53,060
I don't remember it.

3259
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:54,060
Yeah.

3260
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,060
They were gross.

3261
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,060
Oh yeah.

3262
01:52:56,060 --> 01:52:57,060
I have a like on it.

3263
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:58,060
So clearly I did watch it.

3264
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:02,060
I also really like the Arnold's Thanksgiving one that I did, but I don't think anyone fucking

3265
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:04,060
gave a shit about that video.

3266
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:12,060
I do remember that one, but I also remember the best Christmas episodes one, which also

3267
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:16,060
the Hey Arnold holiday analysis, which is also great video.

3268
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:22,060
I just as, as my tone evolved, like to the less like trying to be like hostile and cool

3269
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:26,820
and like ego guy to the more like laid back stuff like the other, like that's the tone

3270
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:29,060
that I like the most.

3271
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:35,060
And the videos of mine that I like to watch back the most are like the not a reviews.

3272
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,060
Yeah.

3273
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:39,660
Those are all good because they're like, those are like the fucking not a review on which

3274
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:44,260
in the hundred night is the only place where my opinions on me, Ponichi have been expressed

3275
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,260
on the internet.

3276
01:53:45,260 --> 01:53:50,060
Well, those are like the most pure because like those are like deliberately the least

3277
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:52,500
ego driven videos.

3278
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:53,900
That was like kind of the point of them.

3279
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:57,900
And that's kind of why they're called not a reviews because like I'm saying in the title,

3280
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,500
you don't have to take this seriously.

3281
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:00,500
This is not.

3282
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:05,500
And so like, and saying that up front, freeze me to just goof off and say whatever dumb

3283
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,340
shit I want and not have to act like it's important.

3284
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:13,420
Not a review is such a good title because you immediately like give yourself a free

3285
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,420
pass.

3286
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:19,060
But you also get the search result of exact review.

3287
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,060
Most of those videos are good.

3288
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,060
And I like them.

3289
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:24,180
And everything else I've ever done is shameful disgrace.

3290
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:25,740
But we're not what you just said.

3291
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:30,100
Are you saying that we've exited the hostile and cool faces just and they're the warm

3292
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:31,660
and gay phase.

3293
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:32,660
Warm and gay.

3294
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,660
Warm and gay.

3295
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,660
Warm and gay.

3296
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:35,660
Warm and gay.

3297
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:36,660
Warm and gay.

3298
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:37,660
Is that a reference?

3299
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:38,660
No.

3300
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:39,660
No.

3301
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:40,660
It's just.

3302
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:41,660
It's just.

3303
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:42,660
It's just pure organic.

3304
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:43,660
It's just good.

3305
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:47,180
I think we have one last question to exit on here guys.

3306
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:52,460
It's how much capitalized do you guys love each other question mark question mark question

3307
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:53,460
mark?

3308
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:54,460
A lot.

3309
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:55,460
A lot.

3310
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:56,460
Hey, hey, everypony.

3311
01:54:56,460 --> 01:55:00,740
Welcome to the fucking sub dick show.

3312
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:05,460
No one even fucking slightly cared about anything that just happened the past thursday.

3313
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:07,260
No.

3314
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,260
It's good.

3315
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,860
Guys, I slept like three and a half hours last night.

3316
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:12,020
My warm and fuzziness is at an all time low.

3317
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:13,020
You just can't.

3318
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:14,020
I cannot stand a single one of you.

3319
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:15,020
Well, let's just address.

3320
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:16,020
Oh, thank god.

3321
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:17,020
The reason we do rad cons.

3322
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:18,020
I don't know why.

3323
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,940
We don't have a meetup so we could go to anymore because we all like being around each other

3324
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:25,180
and just we all say it and then it just comes true that when we are together it's just a

3325
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:30,460
way good time and it's just always nice to hang out so I'm real happy for it.

3326
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:34,460
So somebody suggested Jay and I said, hey, why don't you guys all sing a song together?

3327
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:40,460
Oh, I'm supposed to be working right now.

3328
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:45,460
I'm supposed to be working right now.

3329
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:47,460
But I'm not working.

3330
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:50,460
I'm doing nothing.

3331
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,460
Myself, I'm jerking.

3332
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:55,460
Myself, I'm sucking.

3333
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:57,460
I am an asshole.

3334
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:59,460
I am a stupid.

3335
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:02,460
I've got a deadline.

3336
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:05,460
Don't want to do it.

3337
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,460
Yeah.

3338
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:09,460
What the hell is wrong with you?

3339
01:56:09,460 --> 01:56:10,460
Thank you.

3340
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:11,460
Thanks everybody.

3341
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,460
See you later.

3342
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,460
See you in another 200 episodes.
