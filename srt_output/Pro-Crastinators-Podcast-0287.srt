00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello internet, welcome to Pro Crastinators.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,280
It's uh, it's looking like I'm here. It's 10 25 a.m

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,280
Withered on the vine whatever that means

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,280
So, you know what that means looks like we're starting another

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,640
We're starting another Ben cast will it conclude a Ben cast or will we have a or will we have a new interruption?

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,520
We have some such an inconsiderate interruption as the last time

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,640
Only time we'll tell but you know what this means. This is my opportunity to phone it in. Oh my god

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Did you wait until I started what no I didn't know you had started I was sorry I was late

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Literally just started like a minute ago. Well, I guess it looks like I'm on time

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
All right

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
Very good very very nice. Hi Gib. How you doing? Hey, I'm good

Okay, sure are you recording I am yes, okay cool very very nice

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What's going on

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
Uh

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Nothing I was just playing I was just playing a even colony

19
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,400
On which is free on the epic store, but now it will

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,440
until November 11th

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,600
So you you've you've missed it if you're listening to this lol

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,600
I guess I'll I guess I'll google it. It's uh, it's like a city

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,200
Simulator building thing but on space

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
New planets and

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
It's it's pretty good. It's pretty nice

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
You got your you got your buildings and you got your immigration to for new residents. You got your housing

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
air filtration

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
farming

29
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,960
Pretty good. I I have never really played a city builder games

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
Although I think I can understand the appeal

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
I've just I've just never really really delved into the genre

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I have played a lot of them

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,040
uh

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Actually, I guess I've played sim city 3000 a million years ago

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,720
And and some other like tangentially related stuff

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,880
I like I like city building in in like the the the

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
The uh

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Oh, what is it? What do you call it when it's like stats and figures?

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,080
When you're over viewing all of the all of the numbers

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Spreadsheets

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,880
Yeah in the spreadsheet fashion. I don't know how to describe it

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,360
But it's like nice like balancing all of the food intake and food

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
You know consumption you can ration things

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Sure. Yeah

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,800
I had a I had I had a version of sim city on like fucking windows 3.1

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
Uh

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,760
Like I had a really old like it came that had sim city and sim or like I think the original ones

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,800
And I that was when I was a kid and I and I found them I found them impenetrable

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,240
Uh, I couldn't really understand them. So, uh

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Didn't end up playing a lot of them

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,560
Uh, I would fuck around with them and like like try and make natural disasters happen

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
Uh, and that was like pretty much all the enjoyment I could get out of them

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
Because I was an idiot

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
Yeah, there's like there's usually a point where it's like it's so big

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,520
That either it's too big to fail and then there's no like challenge anymore

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,560
Like you've got too many completely filled storage

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
Things and it's like you're never gonna run out of food or water or anything

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,520
And you're too powerful to be killed by an invasion

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
So like natural disasters are the the only thing that can like

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,600
Like make it tense again, but they're also annoying to deal with because of how many things break

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
Yeah

62
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Well, I mean, that's the that's the point you that that's the point but like you're annoying yourself. Yeah

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,440
There's a point in in a lot of these games where like I haven't reached that point in even colony

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm sure it'll get there where like

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,040
There's no challenge or it's too challenging and too stressful

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,920
My favorite, uh, just like real life

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,760
Yeah, my favorite city building things are one where like

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,680
The it's it's more casual, but like the real fun is going down into your city and exploring it

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,560
Oh, right you can do that and some of these kind of like how

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,760
Kind of like how

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Or couldn't you do that in the roller coaster tycoon?

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Yeah, all of the tycoon games where you can

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,120
Uh, like theme park world as well

74
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
Yeah, you can make your theme park you can make your roller coasters and then you can ride them

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
You can walk around zoo tycoon. I love all those fucking

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
I've I've also never played a I've never played a tycoon

77
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
I never played what I cool

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,040
Zoo tycoon's good because you can get a lion and you can just pick it up out of the enclosure and put it

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,720
Into the normal part of the park and people will scream

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,440
Will they die they'll scream and run and the lion will not really kill anyone

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,280
Unless no wait, I think the lion can kill people

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
What's the point of a lion if it can't kill people?

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
I think it can kill people and then like the park rangers are like, oh shit

84
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,720
They dart it. That's what I would shoot it shoot it with sleep darts and then it gets put in a cage

85
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,280
And suddenly it becomes an RTF suddenly becomes tower defense as you put more lions out of the cages

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,160
that there was this zoo tycoon like like expansion pack

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
for like

88
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,680
Like dinosaurs where you could make you could unearth like fossils go to a research station

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,000
and then like ala pokemon create dinosaurs with the fossils

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,360
And and then you can just have dinosaurs and then if you break the thing the dinosaurs will go on the on the rampage

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,440
And try to kill people just like Jurassic park and then you can go down into first person view

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,400
and like use like the the the special harpoon gun to like

93
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Like put it to sleep again

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,160
And that's what I used to like doing. I used to like getting a bunch of dinosaurs and then becoming an fps in zoo tycoon

95
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
That's just great

96
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,160
Just play just play a game that works. You're supposed to shoot dinosaurs. No because then they're hard

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,320
They'll they're like, oh the dinosaurs have a lot of hp and they'll kill you. It's like that's not what I want

98
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
No, no, I want

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
It's not games to be easy and never challenging

100
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,560
I can't get off to shooting dinosaurs in a context where I'm supposed to be shooting them

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,600
I want to feel like I really shouldn't be shooting these dinosaurs. That's that's what does it for me

102
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
uh

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,440
It's the transgressive element of it that really gets my that really activates my neurons

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah, uh

105
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm trying to think if I ever play at any fucking any good video game in my in my whole damn life

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,760
No, uh, yeah, I have the old really old sims on my old ass computer. Um

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
No, I've just played fucking jrpg is like a fucking nerd

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,080
I mean those can be good

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,360
No, they fucking can't you could you can have like an a story and it's like you've watched a a movie

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,760
That's the worst over the course of like 170 hours. God. I would

111
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I would never watch a movie

112
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Uh, uh

113
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah, I fucking hate movies

114
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,720
What a waste of time am I right? I hate me. Uh true movies movies are always like in that

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
awkward spot of

116
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,120
Like they're too long to just casually put on and like I need a break

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,280
But then you're you're like fucking up the pacing of the movie if you take a break

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,720
So you feel compelled to like watch it all in one go, but it's a little bit too long to watch all in one go

119
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,320
I actually watched uh, I was cajoled into watching a movie

120
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,480
I was I was plied with alcohol and then coerced into watching a movie that I would never have consented to

121
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Is it the my old pony movie?

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,720
No, no, no, this was on halloween. Uh, we watched uh, we watched uh house or house or house or you know the japanese

123
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
Uh horror movie the old one. I do not know that

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,200
Um, I had heard of it. Uh, I don't like horror movies and I was I don't watch horror movies on halloween

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
I know ha ha that's what you do on halloween, but like I hate that shit. I don't want to do it

126
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
Uh, but they got me to do it and it was fine because it's it's a movie

127
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,800
It's old enough that like the special effects are not convincing at all

128
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,360
And so it's just kind of silly

129
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,640
Well, I mean it was legitimately creepy at times because you could tell what they were going for and what they were going for

130
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
was pretty creepy, but I wasn't like

131
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
You know, it was fine, uh and uh

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
very

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,560
Very compelling the cinematography was very weird and interesting and they did

134
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,000
The movie started with like just lots of like

135
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
It starts really weird it starts

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
in like a very self-aware sort of like

137
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
parody

138
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
Of like of like a like a like a lighthearted drama

139
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
But they have all these uh, they have all these these scene transitions of like

140
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,440
The the one thing we we kept noticing was that the the there are all these like painted background

141
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,360
There's like very obviously painted backgrounds in like every scene you can really tell like that's not a real sky

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Like that's a painting and then at some point they start like

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
putting characters in front of

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
Paintings and you think oh, it's more painted backgrounds

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
But then the camera will move and you'll see like no wait

146
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,200
They're actually just standing in front of like a mural at their school

147
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,320
Uh, uh, that was one weird thing that was very disorienting about it. Uh, uh

148
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I don't know it's hard

149
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,280
I could probably talk a lot about house, but it's really interesting. I've seen I've seen the poster of this cat

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
with the big lip

151
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
teeth

152
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,440
Yeah

153
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
Yeah

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
The cat was just kind of

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
There at the end only at the very end was I like oh, I guess that's why the cat's on the poster

156
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Okay, sure

157
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Is it if I just search house movie I typed in house japan movie and I got it. Yeah

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
um

159
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
What else could I there were there were

160
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Yeah, the the the

161
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Like the kills are very

162
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,880
It's not like a slasher like people don't get like killed by a person. They basically get like

163
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
they basically get like

164
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,960
sort of

165
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,680
separated into pieces by some sort of like

166
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,840
the the

167
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
magical force

168
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
of the house itself and like their

169
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,880
Pieces will like keep doing things that like they were doing while they were alive like uh

170
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,960
The the the the girl who eats all the time like

171
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,640
She like falls down a well and like her head gets separated and like they find the head and the head tries to like bite them

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
And like one girl is like playing a piano

173
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,000
And like the piano eats her and then they find like they find like her disembodied fingers like are still like are still like

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
You know playing the keys of the keyboard and stuff

175
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
This is a spoiler but like

176
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
One of the girls is named kung fu

177
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,800
and she's just like tough and does karate or whatever or kung fu I suppose and um

178
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,160
She's like the last she's like one of the last ones to die

179
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
I think like the house is going like crazy the house is like really like

180
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,960
You know the ghost is like all right. No more fucking around. It's time to kill all you motherfuckers

181
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
And uh, she starts like she does she's like doing karate

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,080
But like she gets sucked into like a closet or a mirror or something. I don't even remember but like

183
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Her like but like after she does like her like legs and her like hands like come out and her legs just like continue doing

184
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Like karate kicks like against like the ghost

185
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,320
Uh, I just started like bloody disembodied like legs just kicking

186
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
Very amusing. It was very cool. It was very cool

187
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,840
Uh, yeah a a rare w a rare w for cinema as a whole

188
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,960
I thought you were gonna say a rare w for the nation of japan

189
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,200
That that too that too. Yeah, finally they've contributed something to culture

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,200
Um, apparently the director also made a live action the girl who leapt through time

191
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
Which I guess is based on a book

192
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,880
Oh, you know that that that anime movie go through like time

193
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,120
I've seen the anime. I think I thought it was an original. I didn't know it was based on a on a book

194
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Did the live action version come before the anime?

195
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,240
Uh, 1983 so I think so

196
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Uh girl who

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah, the movie was 2006. Oh, I didn't know that I had no idea. Um pretty neat pretty neat

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know. I don't know what else to say about it

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,680
Um, is that the same guy who did summer wars right summer boys some it's not summer boys

200
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
Summer boys and that was okay. Okay. Am I crazy?

201
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,200
But the summer wars is the movie by the guy who made the digimon movie

202
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
But like the digimon movie was really good

203
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes, you're thinking of it's the right person

204
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,080
And then and then he was like, wow, I wish I like I wasted my great idea on the digimon movie

205
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm gonna go make the movie again, but not digimon this time

206
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm gonna make it my own movie and that was summer wars, right, right

207
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,400
I

208
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Think so

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
This is a story that I feel like I've heard repeated many times

210
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Uh

211
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,720
Uh, yeah, yeah, this is all it's all the I have the pieces of this story in my in my mind

212
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,120
But but but scattered but separated you might say into their various pieces and they continue to do

213
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,720
They continue to do things in the house of my mind. Hmm

214
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
curious

215
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Yes, he did the digimon adventure. He did the go through it through time summer wars

216
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,440
Yeah, and then wolf children more recently

217
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,840
Uh another one I have not I have not seen wolf children wolf wolf children wolf children is that one that has

218
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,640
That scene right didn't like Trixie talk about that scene one time where like

219
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,120
It's like the kids growing up and it's like one shot from like the side of the house

220
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,680
And like you see them like living their life in the house as they like get older or whatever

221
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,320
I have no recollection and it's like one shot from one one side of that

222
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,720
It's just one like cut out shot of the house and you see them dude

223
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,640
I filmed this anime movie in a single take and yeah, they did it in one take

224
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
They drew it in one take

225
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
No, we're racing

226
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Yeah

227
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
House is cool house was a good movie

228
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,640
I got

229
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,120
I was I was I was getting drunk, but I didn't start drunk and I and I was uh and I

230
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
Even even at the beginning while I was mostly sober. I was like, oh this

231
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,800
The tone of the tone of this movie is very weird very interesting and and and I'm engaged

232
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,760
And so I was

233
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Yeah, do you do anything on Halloween?

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
Uh, oh

235
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
you know

236
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,000
Not really in fact, I was we were recording the pcp on halloween. Yeah, we recorded it in the in the morning

237
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Uh, but for me that was like

238
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh, right. It was like 3 p.m. Going into like going into the beginning of the afternoon. Obviously it was dark

239
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,600
So like it was trick-or-treaters happening near the end

240
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
And I will I really there

241
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Oh, that's pretty really like maybe just after we'd finish recording. It gets dark at 6 p.m. For you. Well. Yes winter

242
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,800
I mean it gets dark pretty early. I think it gets dark around like seven or eight this year

243
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Uh

244
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
I forget how long we went but yeah, that was happening and I

245
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,400
Earlier in the day had carved the the jack-o-lantern and I was like that's that's a good one

246
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I think I was it was pretty good

247
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,160
And then that was put outside and that's it. I didn't really answer the door because I don't like doing that

248
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,320
I didn't have a costume because I never remember to do that through the whole of october

249
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
And I was like, well, whatever

250
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,240
And then as soon as halloween was over I was like, you know what I'm ready

251
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm ready for halloween now

252
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,560
And that's how it always goes. I'm always ready for halloween after halloween is over

253
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,640
Well, it's easy to be ready when it's too late and you can't do and there's nothing to be done

254
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,800
Yeah, but like spooky stuff Howard's way out spooky stuff is fun

255
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,680
Like like quote-unquote spooky because I you know, I have a pumpkin oc is my main character that I use for things

256
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
So I just use I just do that all year

257
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't feel compelled to only do it during halloween. So I can just do it now. I can just do halloween

258
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
You know november if I wanted

259
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,160
And it would consist of me watching a scary movie

260
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,600
And drawing a picture of a scary thing

261
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,760
It's it's true. It time is merely an illusion. The calendar is a human invention

262
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,000
It's merely a it's merely a social construct in fact

263
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
You know, you could dress like a goth whenever you want

264
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,880
That's true. You don't have to do it. That's true specific night. And you should do it all the time

265
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
If you want to be cool

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Just like me in high school

267
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Um

268
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,800
How how goth where are you been? I was uh, I was not the most goth. I was a bit of a

269
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,120
I was a bit of a poser, you know, I had some I had some trip pants

270
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,240
I had a couple of pieces of hot topic jewelry

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,960
I spiked my hair a little bit, but uh, I wasn't like, uh

272
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,280
I didn't like go to like I had a couple friends who went to like like, you know rock shows and stuff

273
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
Like like, you know local bands and whatever. I didn't really do that

274
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
uh

275
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
uh, I just

276
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I was I was like

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Five out of ten goth, you know

278
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,960
Uh, so like I was a bit of a hanger on just kind of all my friends were doing it. So I did it too. They I'll be I'll be honest

279
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,560
trip pants. I never actually had trip pants

280
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,120
No, you should get some you should fucking get some I they they look like like

281
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,400
The goth equivalent of like flares, you know, you know, uh, uh, what do they say? Uh, they say, you know, the millennials

282
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,840
Millennials are still wearing, you know, um, skinny jeans

283
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,480
But like among zoomers, you know, the big like baggy jinkos are coming back in style

284
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,000
I feel like the trip pants should come back along with that trend

285
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,240
I think that would be some of them look cool

286
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,200
But some of them definitely look like restrictive in an in an annoying way like chains connected. Well, they're not they're not built for

287
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
They're not built for performance skip

288
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
But they're built for performing honestly, I'm feeling I'm feeling

289
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
Stupid I oh I feel like maybe I should get some

290
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,000
And just wear them. Well, I already I already look I already looked like a fucking moron in public

291
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,120
I already dressed like a fucking child like a complete imbecile

292
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
Why not just go all out, right? Yeah

293
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
they're funny

294
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
I

295
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:20,400
Have like always been like, oh fashion that's for like if you're look at look at this shit

296
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,680
I've never really been like, oh, I'm gonna do like a an outfit. It's like too

297
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,280
Feels like too much of a statement. I don't want people to notice

298
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,960
But I I feel like I should not necessarily trip pants, but like

299
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,480
Something a statement, right? Yeah, make it. Yeah making a statement some of those like huge puffy like cute like sneakers

300
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,920
That I've seen I guess these are like girl pants

301
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,920
I guess these are like girl pants, but like what's the difference like who who would

302
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Who would see you wearing these and be like?

303
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,040
Those are girls trip pants idiot. I don't think anyone would wait. What are you looking at this picture?

304
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
I just posted in the general. Oh

305
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,800
I think it's the midriff, but like the pants themselves are yeah, the pants themselves. I don't think you genderless

306
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520

Some people some people get excited when it gets chilly because it's sweater weather for me. It's trip. It's trip pants season

311
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,120
nevertheless

325
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
lame

326
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,560
T-shirts that are just black or whatever

327
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,400
I need some real shit. I have a lot of uh, I I have a lot of clothes from

328
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,200
Before my transition by which I mean my transition from uh, uh fit ben to fat ben

329
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
um, so now I have

330
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
Well, I have a bunch of like things that don't fit me, but also

331
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,000
But also I'm losing weight again because I'm working out again and I've

332
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
But also just kind of the stuff from before just I sort of don't want like I don't have anything

333
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
That's like really good and I'm like excited to wear it again. So like

334
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Fuck it. I should just get some new shit

335
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,680
Um, but maybe I should wait until I lose a little more weight because I am on I'm on I'm pretty on track with that

336
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,480
And like what would be the point of buying, you know

337
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,000
Fat pants at the moment when like if they'll be too big for me in like a couple months

338
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,520
Well, that's why you get trip pants because they got like they got belts so you can adjust. Yeah. Yeah, true. Yeah, true

339
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,880
Um, you can tighten it with the belts halfway down if you want to show off your knees

340
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,320
Um the shape of your knee or something

341
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,120
But every every I don't know every time I go

342
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,960
It's been it's been it's been a while since I've like gone

343
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,160
Clothes shopping and and it's been even longer since I've gone clothes shopping and found anything that I like

344
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,760
Usually I'll go someplace and I'll be ah, I'm gonna look for something like yeah

345
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,920
I'm gonna look for something that's cool and that is like my vibe and then like makes a statement

346
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,600
Right and I know, you know, that sounds like such an easy thing

347
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,720
But then like it's so hard to actually find something like that

348
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I feel like to find shit like that you have to be like making an active effort

349
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,120
You have to be like going out and like clothes shopping like regularly and once in a while you will come across something that is like

350
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
This is just what I'm looking for

351
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,960
This is something that I'm like excited to wear and then I think is is gonna like, you know

352
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,640
Bring my ensemble together. That's not something you can just casually stumble upon which is sad and demotivating

353
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,200
Because it's like damn. What if I just go out to the garment district or whatever and I look around and like

354
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,640
There's just nothing good there because usually there's just nothing good

355
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
That's like, what was the point? Why did I even leave my house? Why do I even get out of bed this morning?

356
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Nobody knows no one can answer that you could you could learn to build your own clothing out of

357
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
scratch

358
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
That's a hole. That's a hole over here

359
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,480
That's a whole other fucking can of worms right there and even harder

360
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Even harder

361
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,640
Let me complain I'm gonna complain about something. Uh, yeah, nobody

362
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Nobody wants free money

363
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,080
I haven't I have been preaching I have been preaching the word about free money

364
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,640
for months now

365
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,040
And nobody cares nobody listens

366
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,360
Because I'm offering the car journey. It's it's car. Yeah. I I um

367
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,600
I asked on twitter

368
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,960
The other day it was a bit stew. I felt a bit stupid asking but I couldn't think of a good reason not to ask

369
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,440
So I made a tweet a tweet about like does anyone want since I've been talking about credit cards

370
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,080
Does anyone want to sign up for a good one? I have a bunch of good ones that I recommend

371
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
And if you sign up for one with my uh, uh

372
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,320
Six with my referral code, I will get they will give me a bonus

373
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,920
So you the sign-upber will get, you know

374
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,520
Cashback offers and you know the the um, what's the word?

375
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, the sign-up bonus, you know

376
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,240
For instance like $200 bonus cash when you spend $500 with the card for instance. That's one of the good sign-up bonuses

377
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
Uh, so it's good for you and also they'll give me like a hundred bucks if if I sign you up

378
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,160
And so I don't know I would really

379
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,880
I have a I can make I can make up to like $500 if I find five people

380
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,520
Who would sign up for such a thing and I think

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,960
That there are probably people who aren't who don't use credit cards who should be using them

382
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
I genuinely feel like I would be doing people a service if I got them to sign up for

383
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
Many people not everyone most people if I got them one of these cards

384
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,440
And so I don't feel like I'm like trying to scam anyone

385
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,680
I feel like it's a mutually bad, but nobody nobody bit nobody bit

386
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Nobody wants free money

387
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
Maybe they assumed that to do it they'd have to start shurning as well

388
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
You can just you can just turn one card

389
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,680
Churning is when you get is you get one is you get one card after another after another and you get all the sign-up bonuses

390
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,640
Churning one card is just getting a card

391
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,960
I don't know I feel like I can't be the only one

392
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Who made it into their 30s without ever

393
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
reaping the benefits

394
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
of uh of of credit

395
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,400
And I feel like there's definitely people who probably should

396
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,160
have it

397
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,760
Uh, but that it's okay. They're shy. It's okay. They're a little gun shy. That's okay. You know what?

398
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
You know what listener

399
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,040
The girl listening right now. That's okay. Take take your time. You know come come to me when you're ready

400
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,520
Uh, oh you can you can ease you into it. No no pressure. No pressure

401
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
um

402
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,400
I assume it's like american only I couldn't

403
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,120
Uh, I I think so probably I'm gonna say probably

404
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I don't know

405
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Michelle asked me

406
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,920
For a recommendation. I gave I gave her

407
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,840
A link she has not used it yet. Just like I just once again once again

408
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,520
Michelle walks right up to the brink of wisdom

409
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,200
And then just and then spurns it and turns away at the last minute

410
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,800
Just like when I gave her a copy of a conquest of red

411
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Two christmases ago

412
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
And she never read it

413
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Spit in my fucking eye. Why don't you?

414
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,320
Uh, and now I give her I give her this referral bonus for the capital one saver one

415
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
A beautiful card

416
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,240
She's and she says I'll get around to she asked me

417
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
Motherfucker she came to me and asked me for for it

418
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
And she didn't even do it

419
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
No respect no respect. I tell you

420
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,360
Um, you know of all that I think that PayPal credit has no benefit at all that I was talking about earlier

421
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,200
Yeah, I looked it up and I believe that it does not like

422
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,760
Report to like credit bureaus. I I don't think you can like build a credit history with PayPal credit doesn't seem to be any

423
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,960
Sort of number associated

424
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,840
It's just like if you need to pay for something you don't have all the funds in your account right now

425
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,640
Yeah, you can do it. Yeah. It's okay. Well, whatever

426
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,800
Which is which is like the most the most basic function of a credit card is that it does that

427
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,560
But also credit cards have other benefits aside from that which PayPal does not

428
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Yes, I should get something

429
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
I I need to I I was looking at like

430
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,280
like

431
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,320
British

432
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,960
YouTubers, uh with their British, uh, you know credit card information and I'm like, okay, but you're wow

433
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,280
You're so boring and I don't I just want it to be for dummies. Please. I put on I put on um

434
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,120
I put on some like finance credit guy some youtuber the other day

435
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,200
I didn't watch him for a long time

436
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,680
But I watched like one or two of his video and I was a bit disappointed because he didn't really tell me anything that I

437
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,880
Didn't already know so I was like, okay. I think I get the picture

438
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,800
um

439
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,360
But I was curious like if it's like if I

440
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,640
If there is anything else that I could be knowing right now that would be I did learn actually that the

441
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:09,200
This is not helpful information, but I did learn that there are certain cards that you cannot sign up for that like

442
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,520
If you if you have like a million dollars in in in a bank the bank will contact you and be like

443
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Hey, do you want to sign up for our like super ultra fucking premium?

444
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,320
like

445
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
gold star platinum card

446
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,760
And then you say yes, and then it gives you better benefits than any card you can just get as like a normal human rich get richer

447
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, basically

448
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,200
um

449
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
We'll give you a free horse every year

450
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,720
The guy the guy said that guy it was oh actually there was an interesting thing. He said he said like

451
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,160
For many cards like for a bunch of the cards that I have like you need a good score

452
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,080
You need a good credit score, but you don't need to have like an amazing credit score

453
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,800
There's no there's no card that like demands that you have like an 850 plus

454
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,880
You know credit score like most cards that are choosy

455
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
Like they just want you to be above like

456
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,920
Six something right maybe 700. Yeah, they're not they just they want a pretty good score, but there's none that are like

457
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,120
The really exclusive ones do not exclude based on like do you have perfect credit score?

458
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
They exclude based on like how much money do you have like are you rich basically?

459
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
I mean the point of a credit

460
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,640
Is in theory like to just make sure that the person

461
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,840
You're buying something from or whatever selling something to you. Um has some understanding that you can

462
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Get the money to them

463
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,600
Yeah

464
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,680
Basically, and if you if you're if you're at all capable then most people will be like, okay, you're a normal person. Yes

465
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,240
Did you see that guy on twitter some fucking nft loser made a whole thread about how like

466
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
Job hiring could be done on the blockchain

467
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Yeah, I have no idea what he meant

468
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,320
He just it assumes that like the blockchain would allow people to get hired instantly somehow

469
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,240
It's a it's a half-baked idea. The idea is that like the blockchain is a permanent

470
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,800
record of transactions

471
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:19,680
therefore your entire like life history and financial history should be recorded on the blockchain therefore like

472
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,720
interviews would be unnecessary and like the

473
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,480
Like the hiring company could just check the blockchain instantly know whether you were hireable or not

474
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,160
And I mean his idea is that it like saves on like time and energy and effort

475
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,600
but like

476
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,400
You know at the at the cost of there being an indelible record of a person's life that may or that you know

477
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,160
May or may not be accurate and can never be changed ever

478
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Yeah, so you know

479
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,520
It's they didn't quite grasp the idea that like

480
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
That would be very bad for certain people

481
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
Someone was like

482
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
You know, you know that meme of like the soy face is like angry at the one thing

483
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,160
But then like make it he's soy soy facing at the other thing. That's the same but slightly different. Oh, yeah

484
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Yeah, I saw that one that was like

485
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Social credit system. Mmm social credit system on the blockchain. Wow

486
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
Yeah, literally. Yeah, literally literally

487
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
Just put it on the blockchain. I like that's the answer to everything

488
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,680
I like uh social credit because I assume I would be at the top of the food chain in that one. Hmm. Yeah

489
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
I said there's no way it could go wrong for me

490
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,640
If we did have a dystopian social credit on the blockchain system

491
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:42,480
I would simply I would simply have a clean record and and and not have any problems with it

492
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,840
I would simply not uh, I would simply not encounter any difficulties. Yeah

493
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Six society six society

494
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
uh

495
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,360
We're talking about fuck. I've completely lost track

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,600
Uh, you wanted to complain about not oh, yeah, nobody wants my free money. I'm I'm out here

497
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm I'm trying I'm literally peddling free money

498
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,600
Some people probably couldn't take me up on the offer. Some people probably don't have credit scores that are good enough

499
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
uh, which is a shame, but uh

500
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,640
If you've got if you you listening if you've got like a decent credit score

501
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,480
And you don't have a credit card, but you've been considering

502
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,760
Getting one and you want my recommendation

503
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,480
And you want to give one of my referral links to try I can I can uh, I can hit me up in the dms

504
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I can I can help us both out

505
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,920
I'm winking I'm winking into the microphone if you can hear that if you can hear my eyelids my eye my eyelash is brushing against the

506
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Against the microphone

507
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
um

508
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,880
Buh, I know it's pretty it's pretty gauche. It's pretty gauche

509
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,760
It's pretty gauche to be peddling like credit card referral links on your podcast and on your twitter

510
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,640
But you know what but you know what I just don't care anymore

511
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,400
It's no more it's no more gauche than being at least I'm not an nft bro, right? Sure. I might

512
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,120
That's what I'll do

513
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
I'll be like at least I'll be like committing

514
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll be like committing committing high treason committing mass murder at least I'm not an nft bro, right?

515
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
um

516
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
accidentally accidentally like uh

517
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,200
Accidentally like drop my phone in the toilet before I shit and like accidentally upload a video of me

518
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,840
Of my asshole just shitting into the toilet

519
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,360
And I look at my I look at my timeline blowing up as people go lull cringe and I go at least I'm not an nft bro

520
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,840
At least I don't have a lazy line for my pfp

521
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,360
People saying lull cringe to like a scat video accidentally uploaded by ben sing

522
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,560
It goes viral it makes the rounds it ends up

523
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,600
They talk about it on lull cringe. Oh, no, they would just say lull. They feel lull. Great. Can you believe this guy?

524
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
What a nerd

525
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,240
That's what that's what I would do and that's what a dork

526
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,760
What a dork, uh, what a look I can you look at let's look at this guy

527
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
pause as they consider

528
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,760
The asshole the feces emerging from the asshole

529
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,760
Dang man. I boy would my face be right?

530
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Fucking reaction video circuit

531
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,600
People couldn't yeah keem star keem star comments on on on asshole gait

532
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Like I said, I've been

533
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,880
Think of like the situation that would lead to that like your your live streaming on your phone

534
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
And then you say hang on i'm gonna go take a shit

535
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,400
You drop your phone that you know your live streaming you drop your phone in the toilet

536
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,480
And continue to shit anyway forget don't notice that I drop my and just keep shitting onto the the phone camera

537
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,920
Which continues to operate while it's in the toilet bowl underwater

538
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
You know it could happen

539
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,240
Oh, yeah, totally. Why not? Why not?

540
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Uh

541
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,880
I

542
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Right I was gonna say sorry

543
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm I'm I've lost a little bit of weight in the last couple weeks. I went to the doctor the other day. I had a I had a check up

544
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Uh, uh, they didn't do anything

545
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,400
I thought they were gonna like have to like test my blood or something test my cholesterol now

546
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
They didn't do it. They were like now you're not old enough for that. I was like, okay

547
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Uh, uh, they gave me uh

548
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,680
the

549
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Oh, they weighed me right and I have lost I have lost a few pounds in the last couple weeks. I've lost like 10 pounds

550
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,400
Uh, which is pretty good. That's a decent rate. Uh, considering when I started

551
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,400
Uh, uh, working out again and stuff. I was hoping to be down to like 175 by Christmas

552
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,560
I don't know if I'm gonna hit that goal, but uh, I'm I probably won't be too far off

553
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,400
Christmas is the season to be getting fat again

554
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Uh

555
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
What happens?

556
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,560
Yeah, but like whatever

557
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
at the end of the day

558
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,280
It doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter

559
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,280
Uh

560
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,320
If I if I eat a bunch of Christmas gain a few pounds

561
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,760
Whatever, it'll be it'll be less than I've lost on the way there

562
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
It's insulation from the cold

563
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,960
It'll all just it'll all just go to my gains anyway, you know as long as I'm lifting as long as I'm lifting

564
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,000
It doesn't matter that much because even if I overeat one day or another like it just goes to your gains

565
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,640
It just goes to fuel your muscle growth and turn you into a a metabolic furnace

566
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Uh, uh

567
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I've been I've been my deadlift has been skyrocketing but yesterday. I think I hit

568
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
I think I've hitting a wall with it. I think I finally

569
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,000
Experienced I like oh this deadlift doesn't feel that good. Oh, my form is not great. Oh, I probably shouldn't have done

570
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,120
That I probably should not have attempted to complete that

571
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
Uh, it was 285 285 is the wall

572
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,640
Uh, I will I will maybe have to uh a slow down on it. I've been going up 10 pounds per per like

573
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
lift like every time I deadlift, but I've

574
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,080
I have to slow down

575
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I had I was hoping I would hit 300 but I'm not quite there and I'm in my forms my form is breaking down

576
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,920
So I gotta

577
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,880
I gotta cool it. I gotta cool it. Um

578
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,760
Talking about how much I lift is probably about as interesting as talking about what bitcoin is worth right now

579
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
Yeah

580
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,800
To react to it like oh cool nice cool nice number, bro

581
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,360
Yeah, um

582
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Newton

583
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,040
Newtons

584
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
force

585
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,960
Pound mass times mass times acceleration of gravity

586
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
divided by

587
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Something area no

588
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,760
Uh, you just gotta go to jupiter and then lift a small amount and then it'll be a lot easier to gain

589
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
Because the gravity that's this DBZ method. Yeah

590
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,920
You gotta go to well you gotta go to the moon and then you can lift six times as much and you go

591
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,840
Oh, I deadlifted I deadlifted 1800 pounds on the moon

592
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,920
Wait, no, it wouldn't be pounds because pounds is a measure of force

593
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Pounds is weight. It's not mass

594
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
but so you could say I deadlifted, you know, like

595
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,440
2000 kilograms on the moon and then that's out of the sound that would be accurate and sound like a lot

596
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,560
So uh, but then if you stayed on the moon for too long you've become like

597
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,360
Jelly your your your muscles will get too used to

598
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,440
And lifting yourself, which is which way is less

599
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,000
I bet your bones would become brittler and you'd you'd elongate

600
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
I bet did did the astronauts

601
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,840
Did the astronauts do like resistance training?

602
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
In space they must right

603
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,240
Uh, I've heard I've heard the space stations. Yeah, they do something to keep them. They must they must do some kind of exercise

604
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,640
To prevent like muscle atrophy from like the low gravity, right? Because I've yeah, I have heard that like

605
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,920
If you're in space your muscles like atrophy because like

606
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
You don't use them

607
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,480
So they must do some kind of resistance training. They do like like Naruto fights

608
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,120
with each other

609
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,800
I mean, I mean, yeah

610
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,320
I mean, yeah, but that's that's cardio. That's cardio. It doesn't count

611
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,520
They try to do like the samus morph ball. They're all just nerds up there

612
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
They do the samus morph ball

613
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Wait, why why do they do the samus morph ball? Well, it's it's really really stretches your back muscles

614
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,080
I mean, which is uh, actually it's a way to do something. Okay, you know how you know like

615
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
You know how when you like spin something

616
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,720
Maybe you spin something that's like long

617
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,120
But then you like contract it and it spins faster. Do you know what i'm talking about?

618
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
Uh centrifugal

619
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:19,920
Something I vaguely understand. Yes, like yeah, it's it's it's concentration of angular momentum. It's like if it's like if you um

620
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,120
Oh, oh like that playground thing the thing on the playground where it's like a wheel

621
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,720
But it's like a flat like wheel on the and there's there's handlebars to hold

622
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,560
And you run around it and you get it spinning and then you jump

623
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,640
On to it and then you move to the middle of it and it moves like much faster

624
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,320
No, it moves much slower in the middle

625
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,760
No, that's not true

626
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,120
If you if you get on it if you get it if you get it spinning while you're standing at the outside of it

627
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,760
And then you move to the middle of it. It'll spin faster

628
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Oh, if you move it'll spin. Yeah

629
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,360
Yeah, if you if you if you if you move if it's spinning and you're standing if you're on it on the outside

630
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
And then you move to the middle of it

631
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
You'll move it'll spin faster

632
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,200
Yes, because if you're trying if you're trying to grab and walk towards the middle it'll feel

633
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,880
You'll slip off if you don't increase the the strength by which you grip the handlebars because it'll speed up as you're doing that

634
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,120
There's there's also okay

635
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,560
There's the things you can like they're a little thing that sits on the ground

636
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,680
And it's like a little like disc that you sit on and then there's a little like handle of a wheel that you hold

637
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,000
and you twist kind of like the thing at the middle of like the teacups ride at like disney world

638
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,560
and

639
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,360
Do you know this thing?

640
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,440
It's a it's a it's a little thing that you sit on and you hold the handle and you twist it

641
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,520
And the disc that you're sitting on will spin

642
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,840
And and so you're you can make yourself spin while you're on this disc

643
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,960
And you do that with like your hands and your legs out like you spread them out

644
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,560
And then you get yourself spinning and then once you're spinning you pull your arms and your legs in

645
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,120
And then you spin like way faster

646
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,920
Do you ever you don't know what i'm talking about? I I do I understand now

647
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Okay, I have hold on um

648
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
Sit is it just called the sit and spin?

649
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,600
Is that what that is? I don't know what it's called. Yes, it's called the sit and spin

650
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,200
uh

651
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,720
The one of uh

652
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,240
The shit and spin

653
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,000
uh one of uh

654
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,840
I guess I might as well post a picture in case

655
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,760
Oh my god, please fucking load. Oh wait. I don't know what this is

656
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
It's like a tiny baby toy

657
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,440
There is yes, it is it is a tiny baby toy

658
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,600
Um

659
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,640
Here I'll post a picture in the so if you're if you're you put a baby on that and they spin really fast

660
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
Aren't they just gonna be flying off and hit their head? I don't I don't well

661
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,280
No, you put your legs around the like middle thing

662
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,400
So like you're you're like in the middle of it. You're not on the edge of it

663
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,320
You sit on it um and and and I mean a baby wouldn't have the fucking hand-eye coordination to like

664
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,480
Actually make it work

665
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,560
But yeah, you sit on one of these and you spin and then you pull your arms and legs in

666
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,400
And due to conservation of angular momentum, you spin way faster while you're when when they're

667
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
contracted in than when they're extended out

668
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,120
Um, why the fuck did I start talking about this? What were we talking about that made me start talk?

669
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,880
Well, we were talking about people in the space station trying to maintain. Oh the morph ball

670
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,920
That's what I'm saying

671
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:29,120
So if you were in if you were an astronaut and you were in the space and you are floating in a in a you know a room

672
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,440
And you get

673
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,360
By some means by pushing off the walls or whatever you get yourself spinning

674
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,800
Rotating forward extended and then no no no no

675
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,360
Specifically specifically think about this you you you're rotating forward, right?

676
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Like you're going like head going forward

677
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,200
and down

678
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,000
legs going backward and up right and you're and you're fully

679
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,520
And then you and then you yeah you crunch and you curl yourself into a ball, right?

680
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,920
You curl yourself into a morph ball you would suddenly start

681
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,280
You would you would start uh fucking screw attacking

682
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,040
Right, you would because your moment your angular momentum would increase so much

683
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,560
Well, it would stay constant

684
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,840
But your speed would increase to conserve angular momentum, then you would be a little fucking screw attack morph ball

685
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,040
Oh my god, samus is real

686
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,080
It really it really works it really works if you think about it

687
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,840
God I wonder if I wonder now that I'm thinking about it like I

688
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,760
I almost wonder if like they had that in mind when they came up with that idea for like the screw attack

689
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,960
It's like

690
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,640
Yeah, if she put if she pushed off if she gave herself a bit of rotation

691
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,840
And then she curled herself up in a ball her angular momentum would stay constant and she would spin really fast

692
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,440
I I I I wonder I mean

693
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:54,640
Potentially, I think also it's just the fact that if you're like doing trapeze jump trampoline jumps

694
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Curling up in a ball makes you spin around faster and that's just sort of common knowledge

695
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,280
You see people jumping and spinning like that. I guess it's the same. It's the same principle. Yeah

696
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yeah

697
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Curious

698
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Fascinating fascinating uh

699
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,280
This is what my this is what my physics degree. Let's me do let's me think about uh,

700
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:29,280
Samus's screw attack is actually scientifically accurate. And here's my here's my 25 minute long youtube video explaining why

701
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,840
um

702
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,080
That video would probably do pretty well on youtube, right?

703
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,960
Yeah, it'll it'll be like. Oh, wow video game

704
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,840
samus screw attack physics

705
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Hmm

706
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,280
It feels like the sort of subject matter that a game theory would be about like years ago

707
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,600
Yes

708
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Like a classic game theory before they

709
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,120
Were almost entirely about why a scary game has lore that makes sense. I'm on

710
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,960
I'm on the wiki troid. I'm on the the metroid

711
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,760
Uh wiki on the screw attack page and I have control f'd momentum and no results

712
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,720
So apparently no one has ever thought about this before

713
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,920
We're misbusters and we're gonna see if morph ball could really work

714
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,560
Answer yes answer. Yes. It's real answer. Yes

715
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
No

716
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
No, I'm the first one

717
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,360
I'm the originator. I wonder if hang on morph ball

718
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,000
Uh cosplay has somebody done a morph ball and rolled around

719
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,640
I don't know you find anything

720
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,160
Uh, well, I can see okay. I see people walking around with a morph ball somebody getting into it

721
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
But not as a morph ball. I think that maybe they just have a ball with them

722
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's what I'm seeing. Uh, oh, I found uh, I found this this is good

723
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,360
Um posting that right there

724
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
That's a winner

725
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
This one this one

726
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,240
No, no, no, what what is going on here? What is going on here? Now?

727
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,280
Why would samus be with a morph ball samus should be in the morph ball?

728
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
That doesn't make any goddamn sense

729
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,800
Uh, it's it's it's samus's twin sister samus

730
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,800
She took it she took the suit off and hit the like auto morph ball button if you know for for store for easy storage

731
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,040
Yeah, is that is that ball just like placed into the

732
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,360
It's photos if you look in the background. There's an orb like a

733
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
Concrete orb in the back. So it's probably just that

734
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,280
That they photoshopped it over

735
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,560
I okay

736
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,440
Yeah, now that you mentioned it. Yeah, it is a bit weird that there's another orb in the scene

737
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,120
I feel like they didn't need to like sample the orb

738
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,880
Okay, right. I think they did it for the shadow on the ground

739
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
But but look there's like

740
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,920
There's like some shit in front of the orb though. They would have had to like photo edit the

741
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,120
I don't know. I feel like that's like wait what more and more effort than it's

742
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,360
Well, look the orb in the back. There's like shit on the ground. Yeah, that's because it's really there

743
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,520
It's a concrete orb in space. I'm saying that would make it really needlessly hard to like

744
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,120
Sample that orb. No, they didn't suck a bad orb. There's the orb that the morph ball is

745
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
There's just a separate orb

746
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,760
Oh

747
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,400
You're right that has orbs around if some reason

748
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,840
Is this okay? Is this uh, is this baltimore? Is this the baltimore convention center?

749
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,040
Um, you know those trees and that thing in the back. It looks a little it looks a lot like that fountain area

750
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,000
By the fucking brony con. I don't it could be

751
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Is that an ice cold water truck?

752
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,760
Ice cold water that guy didn't have a truck. Uh, not a truck. They're like a little cart

753
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,400
Yeah

754
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
No, it's just a

755
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
somebody's pushing a pram

756
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,760
That has

757
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,000
cartoons on the side. I don't know what the hell that is like a

758
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,080
uh

759
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,920
Hold on. Hold on. I guess I got to check google maps. I gotta check google maps and see if there are orbs. I've got a geo guess for this

760
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,080
We've got a geo detective find this location

761
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,880
Have you seen any of those videos by that by the straight line mission man?

762
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,640
Oh, you uh, I've heard about them and I think you've talked about them

763
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,080
Yeah, but I haven't really has like pictures from his patreon of people

764
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,920
Uh, who have taken a picture or just sent him a picture of them in a place and he uses like geo guess our knowledge

765
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,160
And google maps to triangulate and like find exactly where they are as a challenge

766
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,200
So like if you take any given picture you could probably do it if you have

767
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,560
Then the the wits to like notice. Ah, this is probably this kind of a country or that kind of a

768
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Something or other

769
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,280
Hey, what was the name of the place that the that the that brony con was at?

770
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,960
It wasn't was it just called the baltimore convention center? I think so

771
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,640
Well, like i'm i'm i'm google mapping baltimore convention center and it doesn't look like it. It doesn't look like the same place

772
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Uh

773
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Was that the gay lord hotel nearby?

774
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Like connected to it was there

775
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,680
well, there was um

776
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
Well, there was uh

777
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,360
The the horse there was the horseshoe in right

778
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,680
That was a little not. Yeah, that was somewhere. I don't know where it was in relation to the convention center

779
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
Hmm

780
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
Well, we we would pass it on the drive

781
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,360
Brony con baltimore

782
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Location this is not interesting. I just i'm just

783
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
Ball yeah, the baltimore convention

784
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,240
It doesn't look like

785
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,080
I must be looking at like the wrong side of the building or something because like this doesn't look

786
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,080
Like I remember it maybe i'm thinking of like the harbor area

787
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,960
Maybe i'm thinking of like maybe i'm thinking of like when we're hanging out or like around the port

788
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,920
Ah, whatever

789
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,240
I'm i'm just gonna google brony con. I just i i just want to see

790
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,760
The fucking the fountain area. Okay. Okay. This is the

791
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,920
Oh, this is the area. I'm looking at the this area of the map right here and this is where okay

792
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Yeah, this is where um

793
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,520
I sampled this image

794
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,720
for

795
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,400
the scene

796
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
of slime and punishment

797
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
Uh in which they activate

798
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,480
The device the the trans dimensional

799
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,040
timeline

800
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,120
Device uh for the for the pseudo finale s revert

801
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,920
This is the this is the the scene that I that I photo bashed into that

802
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,360
That that hole that hole kerfuffle

803
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,800
Uh, I literally just want to find

804
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,360
the fountains

805
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,120
and see

806
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,560
The orbs

807
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,120
I just want to see if there's orbs there. I'm going to scream

808
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,520
I'm going to fucking scream

809
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,280
Because google is just not is just like it's simply not it's simply not

812
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
It's totally impossible

813
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
uh

814
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,320
Okay, whatever I don't care about this. I don't care anymore

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,040
Uh, unless you do in which case I also I'm I'm still looking wait, so the

I'm at the bolt more conventions center

817
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,240
On google maps

00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,080
I see you remember you remember the fountain area the found the fountain area

819
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,560
I don't really remember the fountain area. Is it was it near the front?

820
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
Or was it just yeah, we hung out. Yeah

821
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,000
It was like it was out front and to the right of the

822
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,120
Of the of the main convention area. There was the like funny little like

823
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,560
There was the funny little like cave tunnel you could sort of walk under that had like little waterfalls inside

824
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,760
Oh the cave tunnel I do remember that

825
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,960
What was that? That was like sort of down the road a bit

826
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
A little bit

827
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,640
I don't know which direction this would be in

828
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
Hilton. Oh, yeah, there's the hilton that it was connected to

829
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
With the walkway

830
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
Sheraton inner harbor

831
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,000
You okay, you couldn't you couldn't see the harbor

832
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,920
And there's the harbor. Yes

833
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,840
Well, yeah, I mean it was it was near the harbor. It wasn't it wasn't on the harbor. Um

834
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,520
I'm trying to remember I'm remembering like the time when it was like dark after the convention

835
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,480
Okay, I'm switching rck people sitting on the the harbor

836
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,560
I'm switching to photo. I'm switching to photo view instead of map view. All right. I'm looking around

837
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
The the convention center

838
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,640
And I

839
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,240
Okay, there's a

840
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,440
I guess there's a baseball dime and like right near it. I don't even remember that

841
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,120
Okay, I remember the bubblegum shrimp company. We would walk by that all the time

842
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,240
Oh, and uh, and then

843
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,960
Oh, oh the kona grill

844
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,600
Okay, we would walk past the kona grill

845
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,040
So it must have been down in the easterly direction. Oh, there it is. Uh, yes

846
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,440
yes

847
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,120
It's a mckelden square and mckelden plaza

848
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,040
I believe this is the the

849
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,360
Region I'm looking for

850
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,200
Okay, now we got it now we got to find these orbs

851
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Hmm

852
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,480
Hmm

853
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,520
On my back

854
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,280
Yeah, did you leave I disconnected uh for a second

855
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
Okay, what am I looking at

856
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,840
This is

857
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,600
All right

858
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,680
Yeah, there's the pnc bank. Yeah, this is familiar. I remember this street

859
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
but then

860
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Like there's supposed to be

861
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,240
I feel like I'm looking at

862
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,120
The exact place

863
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,520
But there's no fountain

864
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,160
How old is this uh, uh, mckechted november 2020 so yeah, it's not

865
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,360
Probably not yeah, I can't be that old

866
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Well like hold on like

867
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,120
I'm gonna show you this this street view

868
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,400
And tell me I mean tell me if you're having the same sensation as me

869
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,760
I feel like this is the corner

870
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,480
where it was

871
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,520
And and and there was a fountain

872
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,920
Like maybe that like concrete thing over on the left

873
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
Was part of it. Was it like in from the from the

874
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,680
Wait a minute

875
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,600
Wait a minute

876
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:11,840
I remember you it was like there was a wall of water and you went down steps to see it

877
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,120
Maybe it's hiding. Yeah

878
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,360
I'm losing my fucking mind

879
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,520
I'm losing my fucking mind over here

880
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Uh

881
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,600
Was it past like we got to go back to brony con to find out looks like we got to go back one here we go again

882
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,280
The real last brony con this time. Um, all right, I'm going insane

883
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,520
I feel like I found it and it wasn't there. This is like some this is like some mandala effect

884
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,200
I swear there was like a cave and a waterfall

885
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:57,040
And like a a magical fairy gave me a magic sword while I was down there. It wasn't just a dream mom

886
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,880
Um, okay. Well, that was stupid

887
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
Um, if you could find it

888
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,840
Give us a yeah, like give us a comment about that comment in the description saying like

889
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,440
Where is this fucking fountain? Where is this looking in the wrong direction? Where are these fucking orbs?

890
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,640
Where are the orbs? Where are they find the orbs?

891
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,520
Find the we're on orb hunt

892
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,880
We're on this is this is an orb hunt if you can find the orb

893
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,280
Send us a voicemail and uh, we will voice grail you telling us you didn't don't tell us unless

894
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,600
Unless multiple people do it and then we won't voicemail voice grail you all that would be stupid. Um

895
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,560
Okay

896
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,400
Okay, I found

897
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,560
I just found something there is some okay. There is something in mckelden square

898
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
That is called mckelden fountain

899
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,000
uh, but it's like

900
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,560
Street view is like, you know, it's like too far out

901
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,520
From the the square that like it's hard for me to actually see it from the street

902
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,840
So like that's gotta be it. That's gotta be the thing we're thinking of

903
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,000
It's just you just can't see it with street view because like they didn't take pictures inside of the square

904
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,800
Or wait, no did they?

905
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
There are some

906
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,080
It like

907
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:25,920
It looks like there are spots it seems to suggest to me that there are spots inside of the square

908
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
that you can

909
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,920
That you can drop your little man your little street view man into

910
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,280
Oh, wow, they took like a drone shot

911
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,240
What the fuck

912
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,680
Wow, I wish uh, I wish I had had this drone shot

913
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,800
For slime and punishment this look look at this

914
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
This looks great

915
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,480
I would have used the shit out of this

916
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,920
It's surely it's surely the thing we're talking about. You just can't see it at all in this fucking uh

917
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,800
In this app, but oh, oh well, I mean I feel like mystery sol

918
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
No orbs though

919
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,400
The question of the the question of the orbs remains unanswered

920
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,480
um, okay, so um

921
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,440
What else what else what else?

922
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,480
Uh, well, I've been working on oh, yeah go on

923
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,320
Yeah, I mean, I haven't really got much to talk about

924
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,600
because this past week I have

925
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,240
Oh, excuse me

926
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,240
I have been working

927
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,560
uh tirelessly

928
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
and I say I but like I

929
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,600
There's a secret project that I talked about

930
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,120
A while ago, and I've been working on it

931
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,040
And it is going well and if you want to know I know what it is

932
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
Ben knows what it is if you want to know more about it

933
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,400
I do reveal what I what I'm talking about in my latest money spenders podcast

934
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,840
Over on give and take a patreon.com slash give and take well now. I don't feel special for knowing anymore

935
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,120
No, that's okay because I am a money spenders

936
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,800
You are a money spender. Yeah, I am a money spender

937
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,040
Um, I haven't listened in a couple in a while. I should go catch up

938
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:18,160
Yeah, they're all the secrets. So all the things I I want this one. I will this one. I definitely want to listen to

939
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,280
uh, so yes

940
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:27,520
It's it's unfortunate for pcp because I don't have anything to talk about yet because I want to keep a little under wraps

941
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,400
Until I'm ready to be like hey everybody. This is what I've been doing this whole time

942
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,360
I was uh

943
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,560
My project is not a secret. It's uh phantom's revenge

944
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,680
But I was I was working on it yesterday and I was posting in my

945
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,040
In my patron discord server my server is public

946
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,400

951
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
They're each different. Um

952
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,960
And I've been making the background art and I took a break from that to draw some

953
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,120
character portraits for like the talk sprites that I'm going to need for the final

954
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,960

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,080
And uh, I have to I have to save them

Yeah, I I don't know if I go into like a lot of depth

970
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,400
With regards to the process or what I'm currently like exactly working on

971
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
It's more of like an announcement and like a

972
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,640
vague plan of action for that release

973
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,360
Okay

974
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Okay, I should go into it. I mean I do want to know another at some at some point I do

975
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,600
Yeah

976
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,680
Yeah, I kind of want to know. Yeah, like what I want to know about like

977
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,080
The the the the without without revealing anything. I say, yeah, the the details the nitty gritty of it

978
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,560
Because I don't understand

979
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,800
I mean I kind of do but I I don't

980
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,360
I don't know. I don't know. I'm curious

981
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,200
Um

982
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,040
Yeah, pretty good pretty cool. Um

983
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,560
Does that like

984
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,680
Didn't you say that it's getting kind of close to being done?

985
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,720
Yes, I started it this year

986
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,400
And I wanted it to be over finished by the end of the year

987
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,440
So I'm really you know working hard to make it a reality

988
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,360
Then I will announce it and it'll be it'll be uh

989
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,920
Good, I don't know how to to like not spoil

990
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:31,120
Yeah, yeah, but also mention things about it in a vague fashion that would make people interested to go to money

991
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
To patreon.com slash give and take

992
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
To find out

993
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
That is the goal. That is the goal

994
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,080
Speaking of

995
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:48,720
Patreon I want to I want to our our our patreon the pc patreon has continued to increase

996
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,600
Uh since the uh since the uh the the the latest drama bomb

997
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,960
Uh that was uh

998
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,160
It what do you mean you guess

999
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
Well, it's like drama bucks

1000
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,280
Are they really gonna stay for really anytime at all? I don't know

1001
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,680
But can I actually oh but oh drama bucks

1002
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,760
Can I actually pay for things with them though?

1003
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,440
Like won't they turn me away at the store and say no you can't pay for no

1004
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,240
Oh this is drama money. Oh, it doesn't matter. Ew. I mean I mean like the staying power of it

1005
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,080
It's probably not very it's probably gonna dip back down unless there's more drama

1006
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,120
But I don't I don't want to do more drama if I can

1007
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:33,520
Well, it might it might a bit it might a bit. I don't mean we'll see. Um, it's nice to see you go up. That's for sure

1008
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,640
Um

1009
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,760
You know there was actually a bit this isn't like full-on drama

1010
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:46,800
But there was people people were telling me after um the last one that in the the follow-up episode of um

1011
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,640
Who are these podcasts? There were there were

1012
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:55,680
You know they they read out a bunch of like comments from the subreddit all of many of which were very like

1013
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,160
Trixie sucks don't have her back on

1014
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,720
And they got one voicemail

1015
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,200
About it and I thought that maybe I could play

1016
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,240
There that voicemail that they received

1017
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,600
Just in its entirety. What do you what do you think? Do you want to hear it?

1018
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,040
I have heard it, but yeah, oh you listen to it

1019
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,680
I think it was something like

1020
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,160
The one I think you're talking about is the guy who says

1021
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,880
If you have Trixie back on the the who are these podcasts

1022
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,560
um

1023
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,320
Then I'll un

1024
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:31,840
Patron who are these podcasts and patron the guys she hated. She's making fun of us. Yes

1025
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:37,040
He does say that here. I'll I'm just I'm just gonna post it. It's only like a minute long

1026
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'm doing it. Uh

1027
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,360
Here we go

1028
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,360
Is it a minute? It might be like a minute and a half

1029
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,000
It is yeah, it's a minute and a half. Okay. Here we go three two one go

1030
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,600
Uh, all right last uh voicemail

1031
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,960
When my former co-host didn't need to retweet me tweets from me

1032
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,200
When these same people that unpaid me are

1033
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,280
Okay, sorry, that that is true, but did you let that's the funniest part?

1034
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:17,680
Which is that those people just one guy that was giving him one dollar a month and he was gonna unplug anyway

1035
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:22,160
So he took his former co-host co-host Ben St. up in his office

1036
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,800
So Ben paid him two dollars to unplug one dollar a month on patreon

1037
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,800
Like if you're that if you're gonna like screw out that hard or one dollar a month

1038
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,400
if

1039
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:37,920
Make these make something give people something that they'll want to pay one dollar a month for like I I

1040
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,640
I pledged five five a month to

1041
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:47,200
Patreon because most episodes are great if the ladies from the vanished or a southern john or some someone who just

1042
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:53,920
Wanted to give me six dollars to stop giving carl five good bucks a month. I say no because

1043
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:01,600
You've given me something worthwhile. I'd rather give them six to five bucks for what I get and then then get six bucks and stop

1044
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,160
Handing to all right. I think we get the point. Yeah

1045
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,040
Took a while to get there, but very good point

1046
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:13,920
When trixie brought that up they were gonna pay people who are subscribed to their show to unsubscribes like people won't do that

1047
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,880
They enjoy subscribing to that right they enjoy the content

1048
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,840
I'll give you 20 bucks to stop getting net flex like well. No, I'm in the middle of squid games. So what are you talking about?

1049
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,480
Yeah, I'm enjoying. Okay. That was different from the one I had heard. That's pretty oh

1050
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,720
Oh, okay. I weird. I thought it was the same one, but I guess there was another one that uh

1051
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,200
That I that I missed uh, this is the one the the the

1052
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,120
There's not there's nothing. I don't know. There's there's something that particularly rankles me. There's a certain

1053
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,520
There's a certain kind

1054
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:52,160
Of of a of a of gig head or trixie defender or just or just loser in general on the internet who will

1055
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Who will get really offended?

1056
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
get really offended

1057
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,160
About the uh, the like pay pay someone to un

1058
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,800
Unpledged thing like it's like it's crossing some kind of boundary

1059
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,240
Like it's like it's like oh you can say what you want, but you can never you should never affect

1060
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,200
Someone's money in any way if you should never like do anything that affects

1061
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,760
A person like materially

1062
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,640
That's like too fucking far and it's uh, it's very cringe. It's very stupid

1063
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:28,640
You'd have to be a complete moron to think that like it's it's it's like it's like oh if if someone

1064
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,280
If someone is getting money

1065
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,720
They always deserve it, right? They they they they they they must they must deserve it

1066
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,480
No matter what and if you and if you say hey this person doesn't deserve

1067
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,960
Literal literal it's literally the same it's literally the same as if like a guy is like running a scam

1068
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,400
The guy is just is just scamming people and you go hey

1069
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,240
don't

1070
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:58,240
Support don't pay this guy this guy is a scammer and someone goes um you can't that's his income

1071
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,640
That's his livelihood. You can't how could you how could you do that to him?

1072
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,760
Because it's literally the same because Trixie like promises a product

1073
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,440
She promises that the the patreon that she runs supports her anime content. It doesn't it all goes to weed

1074
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,840
She spends it all on weed. She doesn't need the patreon income

1075
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,120
Anyway, because she just like lives for free in in her well now in her in her boyfriend's house

1076
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,840
But whatever she's just a moochie. She doesn't need the money for anything

1077
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,280
The money just goes to weed which makes her content even worse actually just makes her worse at what she's supposed to be doing

1078
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,600
So there's literally no reason to support her and I have ever and I would never ever feel bad

1079
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:38,640
Uh for this uh, even if it worked even if my my scheme to pay people to unpatron worked

1080
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,440
Uh, which it didn't you know, it was one dollar

1081
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,640
But even if it worked I would do it and I wouldn't feel bad if I could drop $1,000 right now

1082
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,800
Just to make her patreon go to zero

1083
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,920
I would do it just out of spite and I would feel good about it

1084
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,880
I would think it was the morally right thing to do and I would be correct in that

1085
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,720
uh

1086
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,720
Yeah, it's because like

1087
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,600
In in the hypothetically if people are willing to not pledge to Trixie anymore. It's because

1088
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,560
They understand that it's because they don't value because they don't value the thing that they're supposedly pledging for enough

1089
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,640
It's not like you're paying them

1090
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:21,520
And that's somehow coercing them to do something. They didn't know how to do anyway. Like there's it's the free market

1091
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,000
It's the free fucking market, baby libertarian for life

1092
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,960
Uh, yeah

1093
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:36,720
Yeah, it's cry. It's it's crybaby bullshit. It's crybaby bullshit to cry about it and say like, oh, you're not that's too far

1094
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,200
It's you're not allowed to do it. I think it's even crybaby or bullshit to say it about someone else

1095
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, I think people are just scared of you ben. You're just too dangerous. You're too powerful

1096
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,400
In their eyes, I am too there was that one moron on twitter the other day

1097
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,120
that one moron on twitter was like

1098
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,680
Yeah, they were they were like um

1099
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,760
They were like it makes me scared. It makes me scared that ben's allowed to do this

1100
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,520
Good

1101
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:10,000
Good, it's like, yeah, it was what this is cancel culture ben. You're canceling someone. What if what if someone wants to cancel me?

1102
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,520
It's like, well

1103
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,880
Then you'll be fucking kid then the market will cancel you. I'm sorry. This is the

1104
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,160
The invisible the invisible hand will will smite you

1105
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,000
um

1106
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,400
I am the invisible hand of the free market

1107
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,960
and um

1108
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,320
um

1109
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,640
Uh, wait that guy that guy said something else that guy said um, oh really funny that guy said like

1110
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,720
It he made a bunch of like reply tweets me and one of them he was like

1111
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:43,120
I just don't think ben is actually doing this out of like genuine concern for tricksy. I think ben's doing this just out of spite

1112
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:51,840
No fucking shit my dude. No way. You are you are you are you are you serious?

1113
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,360
Are you really what would the difference be?

1114
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,280
And then final note about that guy because I really fucking hate that guy that guy's a huge loser. Um, uh, uh

1115
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,320
The final thing that guy finally was like

1116
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,240
Was like block the guy finally he made one final tweet was like well, I'm gonna okay ben

1117
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,000
Well, guess what? I'm gonna go patron tricksy now just to spite you block and then he blocked me

1118
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:24,800
Uh, and then I checked a little later to see if tricksy's patreon had gone up by one person

1119
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,880
Uh, it didn't the guy's a fucking liar. I hope you're listening right now. You fucking loser

1120
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,720
Eat shit. What a fucking bitch. What a pussy do it pussy

1121
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,360
He won't

1122
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,160
I'm really mad about that guy. Can you tell yes?

1123
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,720
That guy ruined my fucking day. He was I saw him and he was

1124
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,520
It was very much like

1125
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,960
I don't know

1126
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,960
I I thought it was like status quo like there's a status quo in the tricksy is getting mad. You're trying to change that

1127
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,080
Yeah, true

1128
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,680
You're trying to change the status quo dude. You're trying to affect something in the real world and that's frankly that offends me

1129
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,680
um

1130
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,680
Wait, I was gonna say something um

1131
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:09,680
Oh, yeah, I thought I thought I had burned away like every person who might still be following me who might like

1132
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,320
Get offended on tricksy's behalf. I thought they were all gone

1133
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,760
But this guy had somehow managed to escape the purge

1134
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,560
And survived this long uh good good riddance I say

1135
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,720
um

1136
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,840
Anyway, I thought that was funny and infuriating

1137
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,920
um

1138
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,920
What else what else?

1139
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
The the the the portraits

1140
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:41,200
The port i'll say i'll say this the portraits that I was drawing for phantom's revenge that I was so happy with that I wouldn't show anyone

1141
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,160
where um

1142
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I won't say exactly what they were of

1143
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,440
but they were of someone uh uh screaming

1144
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,840
and I

1145
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,840
I realized as I was drawing this I was like

1146
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,520
I'm I'm drawing this character

1147
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,840
screaming

1148
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,320
And I'm like making the face myself like I'm

1149
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,200
I'm like grimacing and like and I'm going like

1150
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,720
I'm like

1151
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,920
Do you do that? I think a lot of people do

1152
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:18,320
I I I I I don't know. It felt great. I loved I loved it. I loved it so much. It had such a good time just

1153
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,680
Like I was like not screaming, but you know grunting like you're making rage sounds. Yeah, it's like um

1154
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,360
Even when I'm like writing dialogue or something

1155
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,360
Or I'm thinking about how they would say it or what their expression would be

1156
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,840
I I realized that I'm doing the expression in my head. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah

1157
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,960
Like a flower head says this and he's got like, you know, I'm like, oh wait, I'm doing it. I'm doing the flower head face

1158
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1159
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,200
Oh, but it felt great. It was a it was exhilarating

1160
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,760
I was just like what is like the angriest that I could possibly be well

1161
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,240
Let me just try and conjure that

1162
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,720
In my soul right now and then translate it

1163
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:06,320
Into um into onto the the the the digital page and that's what I did and it was uh it was beautiful

1164
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,280
um

1165
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,520
Can't wait for fucking finish the game. I think

1166
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,440
I'm really crank. I'm really cranking it out. I feel

1167
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,280
I I rue every minute

1168
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,160
every minute that I spent on like

1169
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,240
Funny little graphical flourishes

1170
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,400
I don't know. It's hard. You're some of them. I really like I sort of regret them. I feel like

1171
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,640
Honestly

1172
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,800
The reflections in the floor are nice and all

1173
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,720
I don't feel like it was worth the time that I spent making the floor reflective. It was

1174
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,040
A big the the blood effects the blood effects are good

1175
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,440
The blood effects look good and I think they were a worthwhile inclusion and I spent a few days on them

1176
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,040
But like I think they were worth it. The reflection in the floor

1177
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,360
Was harder and it continues to it continues to be a thing that eats up development time

1178
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,600
It continues to be something that like I

1179
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:10,640
Keep finding new like ways in which it fucks up and having to fix it and it continues to be a drain on me and I

1180
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,520
Find myself being like I wish I had just not

1181
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,960
Added this feature. It's it's nice and all but it's really not the game would have been fine without it

1182
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,280
It doesn't add enough to justify

1183
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
All via the work that I put into it

1184
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,400
Oh, oh well

1185
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,120
You know, I really should have focused on just delivering

1186
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,480
The minimum viable product just making the good the game

1187
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:40,560
Just as good as it needs to be to be the complete product as envisioned. It didn't need floor reflections to be that it was

1188
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,600
But it's got them

1189
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,440
I mean, they look pretty slick

1190
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,640
They look pretty slick. I don't really care about the game looking slick. Well, I mean, I sort of do a little bit

1191
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,280
Yeah, I'm too I guess

1192
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,080
I

1193
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,080
Just wish it was I just wanted to be done

1194
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,080
I feel I feel like getting it done should have been should be the priority

1195
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,640
and I feel like

1196
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,520
adding something like that is counter to the

1197
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,160
The real goal, which is just yeah, you gotta be careful about finished. Yeah feature creep. Yeah

1198
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,680
That was a do you have like a list of like things that need to functionally work?

1199
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,240
For it to be considered playable

1200
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,880
Do I have that?

1201
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,640
Yeah, because like if you have a list of things and you if you notice

1202
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,440
You're like, oh, I could add this then you add it to the list and if the list is growing then you realize

1203
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,840
You're never gonna get it done if it just keeps growing. You've got to strike things off the list

1204
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Yeah, I

1205
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,800
Yeah, I do have a list

1206
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,360
Sometimes I will sometimes I will just think of something and be like, hmm

1207
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,360
What if I did that and then I will

1208
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,240
Kind of you know, if it's an interesting idea and I think yeah, floor reflections was one of these things

1209
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,640
I will fuck around with it a little bit

1210
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,320
And then if I like the results I'm getting from the fucking around I'll be like, okay

1211
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:07,040
Sure, I'll go with it and floor reflections was like I added a simple version of it initially and I thought yeah, that's good

1212
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,080
And then I and then I kept working on other stuff and then I was like

1213
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,200
Hmm

1214
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,040
I think I could make the floor reflections look a little bit slicker and then I got a bit

1215
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,760
I fell a bit down a rabbit hole of like making trying to make them look as slick as possible

1216
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,680
and

1217
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,920
I I eventually did figure out like a hey, that's pretty good. Hey, I'm pretty happy with that

1218
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,760
Uh

1219
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,480
And it so I did I did it in pieces. I didn't do the whole thing at once. I first I added the

1220
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,160
simple version

1221
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:39,440
Then I like went back and refined it more and then I went back and refined it more and um

1222
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah

1223
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
it's it's just something that like

1224
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,920
I have a list

1225
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
But if I think of something that is interesting

1226
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:53,760
I'll divert I'll divert from the list and fuck around with something else and then if it turns out that I like it I will

1227
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,800
It gets de facto added

1228
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,960
To the list. I don't really I don't

1229
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,120
I had a big list of things. It's like I got to add this. I got to add this

1230
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,960
I don't really have any like features that I need to add anymore. I do have a

1231
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,200
A spreadsheet not a spreadsheet. I have a text file that just lists like bugs that I have found

1232
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,080
And like things that I need to make like I need a couple more sprites for this or that

1233
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,480
I need um and then lists of like

1234
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:25,600
You know if I do this the game crashes like if I do this like the sprite disappears

1235
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,680
Like if I do this the the character the the sprite draws in the wrong place or something

1236
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:36,160
And I I'll have to go down through that list at the end and be like make sure that like, okay. This is fixed. This is fixed

1237
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,160
This is fixed. Um

1238
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,920
Uh

1239
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,920
Do I I have I have it open right now

1240
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,920
um

1241
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,880
Yeah, but all the features are in all like the all like the things the game the features the game needs are in

1242
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,200
It's just the content that needs specifically the the enemies all work

1243
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,920
I think all the main enemies function as intended

1244
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:01,440
I have one or two that I want to make a few small tweaks to change their sprites around a little bit

1245
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,680
Uh, and then the lat and then I have the the the the the the boss basically is like the thing

1246
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,520
That right the thing I was drawing the the the portraits for uh, the that's not really like adding features

1247
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,600
That's just like I sort of have to build a I have to build a scene in the game

1248
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,960
You know a cut scene basically that is like has dialogue and it has sprites moving around and it has uh some

1249
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,960
Custom responses for certain commands that only happen in that in that particular

1250
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,880
scenario

1251
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,080
Uh, there's a lot to do there's a lot to do and I wish

1252
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:40,160
I think if I could go back I would trade in the time that I spent on something like floor reflections just to

1253
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:46,640
Have have more done of like the essential things that the game needs to have to be done because like like

1254
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,080
Like I started mine at the end of last year

1255
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,680
And I really would like to have it done by the end of this year to say like yeah, I worked on it for a year

1256
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,760
I don't want it to go on more than that

1257
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,360
I didn't want it to go on for a year in the first place, but it did

1258
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,280
um

1259
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,640
Yeah

1260
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,240
I think it was december 19th that I started working on it last year

1261
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,560
I think that was the game

1262
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,280
How much of what you've done has been like you learning how to use the program?

1263
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,480
and then doing um

1264
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,760
Not

1265
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,360
Not really learning how to use the program

1266
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,240
The program is easy. Well, I mean like and I understood techniques and like yeah, how do I make floor reflections?

1267
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,920
How do I make blood splatters like you didn't know what to do?

1268
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,880
Initially, you just have an idea, right?

1269
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,720
Yeah, I mean I

1270
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,680
I didn't like I mean I I would

1271
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,400
The the only thing that I like looked up how to do

1272
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,280
Was building a like menu

1273
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:59,680
Combat system. I looked I did look I looked up a tutorial that somebody made about how to create like an rpg

1274
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,560
battle menu system and I implemented

1275
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,440
I basically copied theirs

1276
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
And then after that

1277
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I would look up like certain

1278
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,080
Commands like, you know, you code it in this uh, uh gml language

1279
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,000
And I would have to look up like what certain commands do in gml

1280
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,600
But I didn't like look up guides or like research anything. I just kind of just made it up

1281
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,240
As I went along

1282
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,360
Yeah, what I mean is um

1283
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,920
The the skill you have as a game developer

1284
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,600
Is something you were working on as you were building the game

1285
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,040
So like in the future if you were to make another game like this, you'd be able to make it a lot quicker, right?

1286
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,080
Uh, I would say

1287
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,560
Yeah, probably. Yeah, probably a lot of what I have been doing is transferable. I I think that

1288
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,480
I think that if I were to do something like this again

1289
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,800
I would have a better idea of like what not

1290
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,240
to

1291
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
Bother with

1292
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,400
Yeah, I think it okay. I have learned

1293
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
It has it has taught me the value of like

1294
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,160
scripting by which what I mean is like

1295
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,880
A lot of the like old code in the game is like

1296
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:23,440
It's similar code on similar objects that do similar things and I think next time if I if I did another project like this

1297
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,600
I would really want to emphasize in my mind like ben make sure

1298
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,800
You use external scripts that like do certain functions

1299
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,800
And do certain things like I did I did this for the floor reflections like I did eventually build like a

1300
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,320
A a repeatable script that I could apply to different in-game objects that would give them the same

1301
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,120
you know floor reflection

1302
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,360
effect I so I didn't have to like

1303
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,360
Custom code the like the floor reflection for each individual

1304
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,600
object

1305
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,160
Certain objects I do because they move in a certain way that the the regular the script can't handle

1306
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,000
But like stationary objects can all all refer to the same like

1307
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
A floor reflection

1308
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,480
Algorithm

1309
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,960
So I would make more use of that

1310
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,640
Kind of thing and and try to consolidate things so I can just get away with making something

1311
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,680
Once and then reusing it and reusing it as much as possible

1312
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:27,120
Uh the original menu the the tutorial that I followed it had it included a bunch of like other

1313
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,320
Shit that I didn't need like

1314
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:35,760
My game does not have like it has items, but it doesn't have like magic. It doesn't have like like spells

1315
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,120
So his whole his menu included like a spell system

1316
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,400
So my code had my menu system. It has like a spell system in it

1317
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:49,600
It's just like that option is just disabled and skips over and there's just a bunch of like ghost code in there

1318
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:55,680
That doesn't do anything that it like would support a spell menu if I wanted to add one, but I don't

1319
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,200
um

1320
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
So I mean I just I wouldn't

1321
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,760
I would exclude

1322
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,800
Things like that. Uh, yeah, I think I just have a I have I have built up a sense of like

1323
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,120
how to look at

1324
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,680
code and know what it does and mostly what that does for me now is I look at my

1325
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,400
I look at my code and I think

1326
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,480
Like wow, this is a fucking mess like wow

1327
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,840
This is like this is like this thing is like under so many like if then statements

1328
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,720
This is under so many like conditional modifiers

1329
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,640
It didn't need to be buried this deep

1330
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:33,760
It could have there could have been so many fewer like branches to this like logic that I created here

1331
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,960
I'm not going to go back and fix it because it works

1332
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,960
But I could have made it a lot simpler if I had just had a

1333
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,480
Clear idea of what it should look like when I had started

1334
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,560
out

1335
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,680
Uh

1336
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,880
Oops

1337
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,200
Oops, so it's so answer your question. Yes

1338
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,640
Yeah, so to answer your question. Yes, I do think probably like if my the things I have learned

1339
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:01,440
Would be transferable to another project on this one. So that's pretty cool

1340
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,680
Yeah, although I mean there's plenty that I don't know like, you know the the the guy who made the original menu system

1341
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:09,360
He used a lot of um

1342
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,120
Like arrays

1343
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,880
And I just don't

1344
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,920
I like don't use arrays. I feel like probably I could

1345
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,160
And it would make things certain things easier. I just like don't I find them awkward to think about

1346
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:29,840
Uh, and I just haven't like like lists and arrays and stuff are things that you can just make in and I kind of just don't use them

1347
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,800
Maybe I don't really need that many of them in what way lists like in the in the way that like

1348
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,520
In the way that like um

1349
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,040
I don't know what I what I will do

1350
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,320
With a thing if I want like an object to perform an action is I will basically just make like a new

1351
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
variable that exists in

1352
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,440
The object

1353
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,440
And I and it will be toggleable true false

1354
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,680
And if I wanted to do the thing I will just be like, okay set this to true

1355
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:03,280
And then he will you know, he will do that thing

1356
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
You know and then

1357
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,880
So I end up with it has all these different like true false true false true false

1358
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,920
Probably maybe I could have used something like an array to like, okay

1359
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,080
There is an array of possible states that he is in

1360
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,640
And we can switch from one to another

1361
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:23,600
Instead of having like, okay set this one to from true to false and set simultaneously set this one from false to true

1362
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,040
in you know like

1363
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,920
Just that's just one example at the top of my head of something that like

1364
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,720
probably I could have made that

1365
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:37,440
Probably could have made that simpler probably could have I could have like uh future proofed that sort of thing

1366
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Yeah, and what I from what I see

1367
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,720
a lot of coding is

1368
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,440
Like you can do a lot

1369
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,400
Uh at a very low skill level, but that's me

1370
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:55,440
The the real like the the the progression of skill is not so much being able to do more complicated things

1371
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:02,640
It's being able to like do simpler things a lot simpler like with a lot with less lines of code with less like

1372
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,120
spaghetti everywhere

1373
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:11,520
Yeah, I think so I think so my code my shit is not clean my shit is not clean and it's a mess and it it

1374
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,240
Oh man, there was um

1375
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:24,080
Again, this was the thing it was another problem I had this week with um with reflections there was a

1376
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,760
Uh, what was it? What was it?

1377
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,400
Uh

1378
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:36,480
Shit there was something with a character object in the game that was

1379
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
What was it doing?

1380
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,840
What was it doing it was doing something? Oh, I remember it was like it was um

1381
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,320
When the when the turn ended he would not

1382
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,880
It would not

1383
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:02,800
Increment a certain variable a certain a certain counter was supposed to count at the end of each turn

1384
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:09,360
So such that at a certain effect would last a certain number of turns and after all the enemies were defeated

1385
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:14,320
You're supposed to be able to continue to take turns like in preparation for the next

1386
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,240
room and so but the way that I had it

1387
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,920
um

1388
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,760
I had written a script that would if there were no enemies

1389
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,840
It would simply repeat the turn

1390
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:31,440
But it didn't consider the turn to have ended and a new turn to have begun thus iterating the counter

1391
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,680
It would simply like revert back to the beginning of the turn without actually ending it so the timer didn't increment

1392
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,080
so I had to

1393
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,160
So I knew that this was the problem

1394
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,840
and I knew

1395
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:49,600
How to fix it and it was simply a matter I just had to comb through all the code to find like where did I put that

1396
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:55,120
Instruction to repeat the turn. I just need to find it and delete it and I just

1397
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,800
Couldn't find it. It took me like an entire day or like a day and a half actually to find this

1398
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,400
I knew exactly what it was

1399
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,720
It was a one it was a one-line solution and I just couldn't find where to put it and in the end

1400
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:13,040
The reason why I couldn't this is a bit stupid the reason why I couldn't find it was because I had put it in a script

1401
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,200
It was in a separate script

1402
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,440
That was handling that instruction. So I eventually when I thought maybe it's in a script

1403
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,600
I look through my scripts and then I found ah, there it is

1404
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:27,520
There's the like turn repeat script that I just have to go in and I have to take out that

1405
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:34,000
I was I was looking for the instruction itself itself when I should have been looking for the instruction to

1406
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,720
uh, you know, um

1407
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:38,720
You know refer to this that script

1408
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,600
So I eventually found it and then it was easy to fix

1409
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:47,200
But this is you know, messy. This is this is the kind of thing that happens when your shit is messy sloppy

1410
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,400
Uh, but that's me I guess

1411
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
Code talk

1412
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,920
coding

1413
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,920
coding

1414
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,240
Time to be coming on the pcp to talk about his coding

1415
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,800
Tom I'm calling out tom. I'm calling out tom. I'm doing it

1416
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:14,560
I saw people in my discord were asking like, where is tom? Why isn't tom on the pcp?

1417
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:19,520
What why did you change the the pcp recording time to 10 a.m?

1418
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,880
Now tom's never on the podcast and I said no

1419
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,640
tom was first of all tom was hardly ever on the podcast before

1420
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:34,800
And second of all, I specifically asked tom. Hey tom, do you mind if we change the pcp recording time to 10 a.m?

1421
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,360
Would that be a problem for you and he said no, it's fine

1422
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:45,440
And then tom, I got you tom. I fucking got you and then someone in my discord was like

1423
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:51,520
I'm just I'm just saying what he said and I think he posted a screenshot. I think it was from like the im games

1424
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:57,200
Discord server or something where they asked and like hey tom, how come you're never on the podcast anymore and tom said

1425
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,800
Uh, well, they changed it to 10 a.m in the morning and that's too early for me. So I don't do so

1426
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,800
That's why it's because ben changed it on me

1427
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,160
And like no, I fucking asked you

1428
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,680
I fucking asked you and you said it was okay

1429
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,960
This is excuses excuses excuses

1430
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,080
Just say you don't want to be on

1431
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,760
What the fuck this made me mad. It's actually made me a little bit mad

1432
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,880
It's talking about two sides of your mouth talking on two sides of the mouth. It's weaseling

1433
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
It's weasel words what it is

1434
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,280
Got them caught you

1435
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,240
owned

1436
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,440
I'm diligent, you know, I I I

1437
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,920
I uh, I check I I take care. I take care

1438
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,160
Not to fuck people over. I really do

1439
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,280
Uh

1440
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,800
A little a little credit a little credit would be nice. Um, but it's fine. It doesn't matter

1441
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,520
um

1442
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,960
Duh

1443
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,960
All right

1444
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:07,200
That's probably enough code talk. That's probably enough code talk for now. Um

1445
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,760
What's up? What's what what do you think? What's on tell tell me?

1446
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,320
I don't know. It's really just the secret project is like full-time job hours working on it and then I've been

1447
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,280
stupidly

1448
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,880
Fetching out

1449
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,800
Doing like idle games and listening to red letter media like usual like normal. It's not good

1450
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:39,760
I was a brief stint where I was like, oh, I'm gonna like watch some actual media. I'm gonna see some anime that I haven't seen

1451
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,120
I watched a few but then as soon as I started getting to like

1452
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,760
I was watched a few movies

1453
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,760
But as soon as I started to get to like the tv shows the anime shows

1454
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,480
20 episodes of something I'm like

1455
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,680
Uh, you know what? I'll get around to it. It's just that there's too much of a time investment even though individually

1456
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,480
The episodes are shorter

1457
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,760
I don't want to watch a show

1458
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,720
I could be doing I was I could be doing better things

1459
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:11,520
I was starting to watch uh kino's journey, which was sort of interesting

1460
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,400
It's about I've seen a bit of that

1461
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,040
Get on a motorbike and the motorbike can speak to him

1462
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
He's like wait is kino a boy

1463
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,400
I think so

1464
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:29,120
Oh, he doesn't have a he doesn't have a feminine voice. He looks he's got that 2000s anime like androgynous face

1465
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:36,240
I'm like 90% sure kino's a girl. Well, I don't know maybe I I only watched one or two episodes

1466
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Wait now I'm curious uh

1467
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:44,240
Oh wait. No, I noticed they they didn't have like any

1468
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,280
Oh, kino's kino's area. Okay kino's

1469
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,240
sex is ambiguous in the beginning

1470
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,200
She okay. She is a girl

1471
01:37:54,560 --> 01:38:00,400
Okay, well, what do they don't they it's like deliberately ambiguous. Okay, whatever. So yeah, all right

1472
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,840
I've seen a a bit of it

1473
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,640
It used to be on anime network

1474
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,200
On demand. I watched a few episodes of it

1475
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,240
I think it could be more interesting

1476
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,720
It's just sort of quite slow and

1477
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,200
melancholic

1478
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,200
Yeah, and like uh

1479
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:25,280
Talking about like exist existential stuff and I'm like this feels teenagery. I'm not really interested yet

1480
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,600
Like like big brain like what if the universe is like

1481
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,160
Stupid what if what if what if life doesn't mean anything? Huh?

1482
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,240
Yeah, a little bit of that, but it's not like a stupid version of that. It's it's like it's earnest

1483
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,560
So maybe it'll be like cool

1484
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,920
I just I wanted to finish it before moving on to some other anime that I have on my list of things to watch

1485
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,480
But finishing a show is too hard

1486
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
Because you have to watch it

1487
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,600
And there's a lot of that's true

1488
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,680
That's true

1489
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,360
So I don't know what to do. Should I continue to watch kino's journey?

1490
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,000
Tell me in the comments of what you thought of this anime

1491
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,640
You just gotta you just gotta follow your heart

1492
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:14,160
You just gotta let your heart might know my heart is stupid because it leads me to play idle games and look at numbers go up

1493
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,040
Damn that is stupid your heart sucks. My heart is like like

1494
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,880
I just need to rip it out of me

1495
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,200
My heart doesn't like art

1496
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,560
I'm ripping out another seltzer

1497
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,560
I'm ripping out another sparkling water with a twist of triple berry

1498
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,080
What flavor berry refreshing

1499
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
Huh, what flavor berry?

1500
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,280
um

1501
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:48,560
Well from the packaging it seems to be blueberry strawberry blackberry

1502
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,840
uh

1503
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,840
Yeah, so there you go. That's the answer triple berry

1504
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:05,600
All right, uh, I had one last thing to mention on my weak notes. So I was listening to

1505
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,800
I was listening to the uh

1506
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,240
Anamorphon time I was catching up on anamorphon time

1507
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,280
I was a few episodes behind

1508
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,560
and

1509
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,960
They they started doing a voicemail segment. I think I might have talked about this tyler from

1510
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,120
Anamorphon them asked me how we do our voicemails and I told him about speak pipe

1511
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,040
and um

1512
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,040
They started doing voicemails

1513
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,560
And I am pretty sure that one of our

1514
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,520
shit poster

1515
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,160
voicemailers

1516
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,480
Shitpost voicemail them as well

1517
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,160
I should have shut up. I don't remember exactly what his question was

1518
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,520
But there was one guy who voicemailed them and he had what I think

1519
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,800
Was like a some kind of hispanic accent

1520
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,680
but he talked in like a very

1521
01:40:54,240 --> 01:41:01,280
Very drawing kind of low voice and kind of slur his words a lot

1522
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:06,720
And I don't remember exactly what he was asking, but he just he's I think he's just asking like

1523
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,000
He goes on this like long like tedious

1524
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,160
Like uh

1525
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:18,720
Like tell me about life like I don't know what to do about my life. Give me advice about relationships

1526
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,720
Uh never had sex and that's the end of the voicemail

1527
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,400
And like there it's the episode where they have um

1528
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:34,880
They have chris grine, which is a like the graphic novelist who is drawing the official like animorphs

1529
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,360
Like graphic novels

1530
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,240
And like need to listen to that

1531
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:45,120
Yes, and he has and I'm and I'm pretty sure that guy has called into the pcp before so

1532
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,760
Fuck you guy

1533
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,840
Uh

1534
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,840
Yeah, I don't know

1535
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,160
I think I think it might be my fault because I um

1536
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:59,920
Tyler was asking on twitter like people to leave voicemails for the show and I like retweeted that so

1537
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,400
Um, it's probably my doing

1538
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,400
Yeah, oops

1539
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,480
insanely toxic pcp audience

1540
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,680
Exactly exactly

1541
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:17,440
Uh, I thought I'm I'm like I'm I'm like 99 percent sure that same guy has called his voicemail thus before

1542
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,400
Hmm

1543
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:24,400
Um, yeah, that's all I got for this week on my list of shit to say

1544
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,680
I know the list

1545
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,760
I usually I write stupid

1546
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,960
I write like a little note or two throughout if something interesting happens like oh, I'll put that on my little text

1547
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,960
No, let me bring it up on the show

1548
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,400
um

1549
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:46,480
Oh, you want to go to voicemails? Yeah, let's go to voicemails. I didn't really okay. Okay. Um, sure. Well, let me let me pull them up here

Happy birthday. Whose birthday is it?

01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
Happy birthday

1561
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,120

1564
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:38,800
God

1565
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,400
Next one is called fancy for the love of god

1566
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,800
Please for the love of god three two one go

1567
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,880
Go back to uploading the pcp mp3s

1568
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:58,160
I need them to listen to the fucking show and they're not on any of the new episodes and fucking all the youtube mp3

1569
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:01,840
Websites aren't working anymore. God listen to the podcast

1570
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:10,080
Um, what did we do about that? I thought we um, we stopped doing that because they're on itunes or something

1571
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,360
Or I don't I don't know. I don't I don't remember. Um

1572
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,520
Yeah, they're on like itunes and are they on spotify?

1573
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,160
There's just there's just itunes

1574
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:25,440
Apple podcasts, maybe the wait they're on the

1575
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,040
Okay, you can download the mp3 from a website, right?

1576
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:36,000
Of the procrastinators.com has all the episodes and I believe you can download them as mp3s from the website

1577
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
Let me check that

1578
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,600
The procrastinatorspodcast.com

1579
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,720
Um

1580
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,400
Yeah

1581
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,960
Yeah, you fucking nerd you can literally download them from the website. That's where you go

1582
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:56,320
There's no google doc. There's no google folder anymore. Just go to the website. Oh, yeah problem

1583
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:02,880
Problem solve problem solve. Maybe you didn't know that now, you know, I mean most probably don't know that there's a website for that

1584
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,160
but yes

1585
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,160
Check that there is a website

1586
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,240
by the way, um

1587
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,280
Oh

1588
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:15,120
So I wanted some point to release the um the pdf version of road to radcon

1589
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,080
I guess I should put that on the website. That seems like the appropriate place to put that

1590
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:25,120
I don't actually I don't actually know how to edit the website though. I don't know how to make a post there

1591
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,880
I've never done it

1592
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,840
um

1593
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,640
Still got the like default like plant at the top

1594
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,960
uh

1595
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,320
Yeah, I mean Tom uploads uploads the things you know what?

1596
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,400
I yeah, I guess I could just ask tom to post the pdf

1597
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:49,440
Uh, yeah, I think I'll do that. I'll I'll ask tom about it. Um

1598
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,640
Okay, the next one is called

1599
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,040
Uh, shit. Where did I lost it? The next one is called. Uh, it's janez

What do you think someone should do if they want to improve their commenting skill? Uh, let's play or stream

1603
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,160
They're commenting skill

1604
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Hmm

1605
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,720
Uh, I think a lot of it

1606
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,520
Yeah, do do a lot of it

1607
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,560
Do a lot of it

1608
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,720
I I would say aside from that

1609
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,880
It might be a there might be a mindset thing

1610
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,800
Try and maintain the mindset

1611
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Of that there are no

1612
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,640
There there are no, uh, uh

1613
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,880
Trying to be the mindset of not caring too much

1614
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,560
Uh, be like be like, uh, what if I say something stupid?

1615
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,200
I think some people

1616
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,200
Are like shy. I think some people maybe

1617
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:57,120
Would be shy in that situation and would hold back. Sure

1618
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:00,800
You should you should not hold back. You should say even if something's stupid

1619
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,400
You should be of the mind so that if you say something stupid, that's okay

1620
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:09,040
Because you can just you can just make a joke out of it and laugh at yourself

1621
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,000
And uh, and I don't know learn learn not to this learn not to give a fuck about looking stupid

1622
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,440
Which is is good advice, uh in general for life

1623
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:22,880
True that in practice are probably too. I'm trying to think because like in in a let's play

1624
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,800
I mean, nobody really does let's plays but if you're doing like live streams

1625
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,520
um

1626
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,160
It depends on why people are watching or what you're trying to do if you're trying to just be a gamer

1627
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:40,080
You don't really need to commentate that much as long as the gameplay is interesting or like high level stuff

1628
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,720
I mean if you just haven't fun saying something

1629
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:49,520
You don't well, I mean you do in some certain stances, but like speedrunners don't need to not that you know

1630
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,080
It's it's it's nicer if you can

1631
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,680
Commentate while you're playing but like if you have okay, well that if the trouble is like

1632
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,200
With trying to play a game and speak at the same time

1633
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,840
I yeah

1634
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,440
Just try to do it and then you'll get the hang of of doing that

1635
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,880
But like I don't know if there's like a specific way to get good at it other than that

1636
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,840
I don't think I don't really think so and I guess if if if you've got like a

1637
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,720
A friend who could be in a call

1638
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:23,520
They could like ask you questions to force your hand for your react

1639
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:30,000
Yeah, I think doing it with another person is a lot easier than doing it by yourself

1640
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,360
um, if you're doing it by yourself, yeah, you might

1641
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:39,760
You might just run out of things to say you don't have anyone to bounce off of you have to keep coming up with shit on your own

1642
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,000
Um

1643
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,240
Yeah, the only thing with oh, yeah, that's that's a good

1644
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah, that's a good fallback if you if you are having trouble doing it on your own doing it with someone would be a good uh

1645
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,360
Yeah fallback

1646
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,600
Next one next voicemail is an image or an imager album

1647
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:05,120
Riley the type of geezer to go down on a chick and be the first one to come

1648
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,280
Oh

1649
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,800
That's funny

1650
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,400
Uh, is it true?

1651
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,640
Uh, well, I mean the meme says the meme says it's true. So I have I have to believe it

1652
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:20,000
I have to take it at face value. Well, it's it's not really saying it's true

1653
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,440
But he's saying he's the type of geezer where that would happen. Oh

1654
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,240
Oh, well, that's

1655
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,320
Well, that's true. Obviously

1656
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,640
He seems he seems the type

1657
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:33,120
Next one is uh

1658
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,520
Is this an image it's a paste ben wait, why is this a paste been?

1659
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,120
What the fuck okay, whatever. It's a text file for summary. Why would you

1660
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,000
Okay, ben you should make a pcp lecture on the rise and fall of digi, bro

1661
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:53,280
I bet a lot of people would be interested to know what happened to that anime youtuber from 2016

1662
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:56,000
You know, you're not you're not the first person to suggest this

1663
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,720
um

1664
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,280
Yeah

1665
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,120
I mean, I would

1666
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:10,400
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's not a time I'd consider it. I'd consider it. Maybe it's it's doable. I mean, there's plenty of interesting facts

1667
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:15,760
There there are yeah, there's enough there to make for something of a lecture

1668
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:22,480
I mean genuinely the the problem is just organizing a lecture like when would I have the opportunity to do a lecture?

1669
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:24,320
right

1670
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:25,840
Yeah

1671
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,840
That's the biggest obstacle

1672
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,600
It'd be like rad con with me and you and tom

1673
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,800
Yeah, maybe night. I don't know that that's like I don't know either

1674
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,040
I just don't know I just don't know um

1675
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,800
Yeah

1676
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,080
Honestly, if there was like something

1677
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,240
some

1678
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:59,840
New rad con or spiritual successor to a rad con. I probably would I probably would like attempt to do something like this

1679
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Just because like why not?

1680
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,480
Uh, it would be funny

1681
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,560
um

1682
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,040
I actually be a lot I'd have to like go back through like

1683
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:17,440
Okay, there were there would be a lot to say there's a lot you could say about the rise and fall of digi, bro

1684
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:23,520
But the hard part is separating the wheat from the chaff because a lot of it would be boring

1685
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,160
a lot of it would be like

1686
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,840
Oh, and then

1687
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,840
you know shit talking about like uh

1688
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:37,680
Like digi bro's turntable or like the hentai samurai. Oh, no, I know what nobody cares about that. It would be entirely like

1689
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,600
the drama

1690
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,600
People only really want to know about the fall

1691
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,040
I mean, yeah

1692
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,040
You know, you're kind of right actually

1693
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:53,280
The the other rise would be like youtuber begins and then grows in popularity is like a story everyone knows

1694
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:59,760
Yeah, like you can you give the you give the you give the broad strokes of the rise the rise kind of speaks for itself

1695
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:04,800
Like, okay, this is what they did. This is why they were popular and then what happened. Well, yeah

1696
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,200
Honestly, yeah, honestly. Yeah, it's not about it. It's not a bad idea and given the opportunity. I probably would do it

1697
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,400
um

1698
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,400
Q the Q the

1699
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,560
Suddenly yig studios

1700
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,240
Is is alerted that I said that and then they become uh, they they

1701
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:33,920
They their new mission is to stop stop the stop rad con at any cost. We can't allow we can't allow another rad con to happen

1702
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,280
to be devastating

1703
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:37,760
They have a history of stopping lectures from existing

1704
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,920
Yeah

1705
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,520
true

1706
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:45,920
They've got a proven track record. They can do it. They love it. They love

1707
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:51,120
They love it. Uh, next voicemail is oh god, it's

1708
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:57,520
You know, I guess this I guess this is a way to get me to read your text message

1709
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:59,760
um

1710
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,040
Okay

1711
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:05,200
I'm sorry if you've been told this already, but you don't seem to understand

1712
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:11,040
That mining cryptocurrency and processing cryptocurrency transactions are exactly the same thing

1713
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,040
The miners are rewarded a set amount of currency for processing transactions

1714
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,240
I don't believe you. I don't think you're right

1715
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,040
You have to mine the currency before it can be traded

1716
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,560
Trading trading currency

1717
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,680
No, you're you're you're wrong

1718
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:34,000
You're just wrong. Do they mean the same thing in terms of energy usage or whatever?

1719
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:40,240
Because that may have been what we would know this guy this guy says they are literally the same thing which they cannot be

1720
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,320
It can't that can't be the case. So

1721
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,040
dismissed

1722
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,880
Next

1723
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,920
Oh god, okay. The next one has a video attached to it. Um, but here i'll i'll put the

1724
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,800
Here's the voicemail

1725
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,160

01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,400
Okay, three two one go

Hey, ben I heard you like ridiculously long video essays

1728
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,200
This dude just posted a seven and a half hour fucking analysis of this

1729
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,040
great

1730
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,040
British tv show is it hose

1731
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:14,480
Okay

1732
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:20,960
Wait pyrocynical. Okay. I know I vaguely know pyrocynical the best and worst show you like a shitty reaction

1733

channel

1734
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,640
That has a lot of drama around him

1735
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,920
Okay, didn't this guy get like uh, this guy get canceled for grooming or something

1736
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,520
It's it's in that bull park of like a bunch of bullshit that i've heard vaguely

1737
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,720
I don't know. Maybe they're all right, but I doubt it

1738
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:46,000
Okay, this is the this is the kind of video that I like I like seven hour long videos about some bullshit

1739
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:49,920
I wish it were about a video game instead of about a tv show, but

1740
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,080
Wait, let me let me hear this guy's voice. Let me listen to this guy's voice

1741
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,920
Shut up no, let me hear the the guy's voice stop playing clips

1742
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:12,560
Okay, his voice sounds fine some people I can't watch uh because their voice is bad uh bread sword

1743
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,280
uh super eyepatch wolf

1744
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,960
uh nightmind

1745
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,960
uh joseph galler

1746
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,760
I can't watch any other shit because their voices are too obnoxious

1747
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,640
Wait, this this is he's going through but this guy sounds okay at a time

1748
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:29,120
That's why seven hours long. Yeah

1749
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,560
Yeah, which uh one like a doctor who

1750
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,280
Um jody woodiker

1751
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:41,840
Like breakdown episode by episode why the writing sucked and the characters have nothing to them and that was good

1752
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,920
That was a good ride

1753
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,840
Okay, the name

1754
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:46,960
the

1755
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:51,520
The the the go through every episode. It's a bit of a cheap shortcut

1756
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,160
To length pat out a length. Yeah

1757
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,600
It's a bit of a cheap shortcut. It can still be good

1758
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,240
I'm a bit it's a bit

1759
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:05,200
Dodgy, but I might give it a shot. Maybe I don't know it's one of those things where like

1760
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,080
Something that's true in one episode

1761
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:13,280
Will often be true in multiple episodes, but they end up seeing it multiple times

1762
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,320
Um didn't uh, oh god that guy um

1763
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,680
I think the guy ls mark

1764
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:27,760
He did a video where he goes through every single like all like 700 episodes of the simpsons

1765
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:33,760
And he gives like a little he doesn't give a long summary, but he does like he summarizes like each one

1766
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,800
I watched that whole thing

1767
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:39,520
I mean he does you know after a while I

1768
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,040
It was pretty good because it wasn't that could get really annoying

1769
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:50,640
But he eventually he starts being like, okay, there's only so much I can say about each of these

1770
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:53,520
Like he doesn't he doesn't like repeat

1771
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,640
Hems his his point over and over again for like

1772
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,480
Each of the new one like it gets to a point where he's really like rapid firing them like bam bam bam

1773
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,200
And like, you know, that's how you got to do it

1774
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:09,520
Um, yeah, I like that one. I like that video. Um

1775
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:15,520
Okay, the next one is called help. I can't figure out how this thing works

1776
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:22,000
Uh, why didn't it hold on please post in the okay help. I can't figure out

1777
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,560
How this thing works

1778
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,680
Solaru plus it keeps asking for an email at egg.com. You've you've sent voicemails before

1779
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:32,960
Whatever three two one go

1780
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:40,480
Hey, y'all, it's me again. I just wanted to say that last week's pod was really good and thank you again

1781
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:44,640
Oh, so I wanted to leave a comment for the guest Advil you had on

1782
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,480
Hey there

1783
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:54,640
You're a complete coward and I honestly feel sorry for you. Hmm. I watched the video you made and gave up 31 minutes and four seconds in

1784
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:01,920
You talked about looking at things in context and yet you were more than happy to protect a complete garbage of a human

1785
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,080
Who's done actual harm to my community?

1786
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:07,200
Just to try and get a dub against pina or whatever the fuck

1787
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:10,480
I'm not going to be cute about it. Go fuck yourself. Hmm

1788
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,520
yeah, um

1789
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,560
I wouldn't I wouldn't collaborate with antunes under any circumstances

1790
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,160
personally

1791
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,160
I didn't actually go back and watch

1792
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:31,120
Or listen to the part of the that episode before I arrived. So I don't know what was talked about. Oh

1793
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:37,840
But I don't really care. So that guy. Yeah, that guy. Yeah, he did a he did a video where he talked to

1794
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:43,360
Ethereum and antunes about why daft pina is bad

1795
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:49,040
Yeah, there's there's no way that daft pina is anywhere as bad as antunes. So like

1796
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,480
It's pretty stupid. Uh

1797
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,480
Yeah, a bunch of people in my discord were

1798
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:05,200
I haven't didn't actually watch the uh the daft pina takedown video or whatever that guy had a bunch of people in my discord

1799
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,120
Complained about it and said it was bad for various reasons

1800
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,520
Uh

1801
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,960
But I don't know that's that's not me talking. I don't have an opinion

1802
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,520
um

1803
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:22,000
Okay, next voicemail is another image. So here we go what we got

1804
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,880
Okay, what is I think I think this speaks for itself

1805
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:40,160
That arm goes like that's like a triple jointed one piece. Yeah, she's got a she she's she's from the long arm tribe

1806
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,480
The long arm. Yeah

1807
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:51,840
What what more is there to say it's my my friend. It's my friend ben sain. It's my friend ben sain

1808
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:56,480
You know what i'm referencing there. Yeah, I know what you're referencing. It's just okay

1809
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,040
Okay

1810
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:10,320
Next one is uh nnn week two reddit.com slash r slash no nate at gmail.com

1811
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,120
Uh, here we go

1812
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,760
Three two one go

1813
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,400
Hey guys go in one week strong

1814
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:22,800
I haven't made it all week long and I feel better than ever to clarify from last week

1815
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:29,360
Participating in this challenge is to not watch listen or engage with Nate bestman or any of his content for the whole month

1816
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,960
Wow, anyone just joining the challenge. I know it can be tough

1817
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:37,920
Yeah, so i'm gonna read an excerpt from an inspirational reddit post about this month's challenge

1818
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:45,520
This comes from reddit user ihdn 2012. He writes. I was addicted to Nate for 20 years

1819
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:51,680
I was lonely miserable and desperately wanted a part sometimes so badly. I wanted to die

1820
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:58,000
Skipping ahead a little he says about two weeks after I stopped watching Nate. I met an amazing woman

1821
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:03,040
I knew that if I was still a Nate addict, I would not find her attractive

1822
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,800
She doesn't have the enormous intellect that Nate has

1823
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,760
And she is an incredibly perfect person. She is so beautiful to me and I'm way happier now

1824
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:19,840
Wow, isn't that inspiring? I know I'm ready for another week of not nating until next time

1825
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:25,280
No, Nate. Yes watch change change your life change your life the powers in your hands

1826
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:30,240
Lesson is you you just have to take that change your life doesn't really work

1827
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:34,240
Unsubscribe change. Yeah, we're yeah good enough

1828
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,800
Um unsubscribe change your life

1829
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,160

1830
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,560
Nate even once uh

1831
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,400
next

1832
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,560
What what what can I say but that I wholeheartedly endorse no, Nate November

1833
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:50,880
um

1834
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,880
Next next voicemail is called

1835
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:55,600
Trixie's dignity equals

1836
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,720
All right, three two one go

1837
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:05,520
Oh nothing, I get it. It's nothing

1838
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:11,200
There's nothing I thought it was gonna be like I thought it was gonna be like a quote of somebody yelling something

1839
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:13,920
Oh, I thought it was gonna be a fart noise

1840
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,320
Yeah

1841
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:20,560
No, okay. All right. I got it. I got it message received

1842
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:29,440
Uh, this is the last voicemail. We didn't have that many this week. Uh, this is uh, Australian father finds out how much pcp makes on patreon

1843
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,840
Three two one go

1844
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:38,720
$900 dues

1845
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:40,480
Tobias

1846
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:44,720
Did you send money to patreon.com slash the procrastinators?

1847
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,520
Yes, but it was an emergency

1848
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:51,360
Trixie was talking mad shit to a bunch of dickshits

1849
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:55,680
So Ben and Gabe had to react true. Oh my god

1850
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:59,280
She didn't go and get herself ratioed now did she?

1851
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:05,440
No, that's a cool dad

1852
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:11,680
Cool as fucking damn, I wish I had an Australian father

1853
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:15,120
We are up to uh

1854
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,280
$954

1855
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,360
dollars, I think um

1856
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,360
Dollar reduce if we it

1857
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,080
It's over

1858
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:25,280
900

1859
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:29,520
Um, if we could get to I think if we could get to 1,050

1860
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:37,040
So if we got another hundred dollars, we would have tripled our patreon in over the last like three months

1861
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:43,760
Uh, which would be really now. I mean we're all we've almost tripled it, which is pretty good. Thanks everyone for your pledges. Um

1862
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:48,560
Yeah, hey what I would suggest what I would suggest

1863
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,080
And I mean this in an entirely legal

1864
02:03:55,280 --> 02:04:00,160
Way and that I am not responsible for anything, but I would suggest uh, I would suggest goading

1865
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:04,320
I would suggest goading Trixie into into making more

1866
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:07,520
podcast appearance into uh making more uh

1867
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:13,200
Making more statements against us. Uh, I really want more of those. Uh, they've been a

1868
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,920
They've been a huge boon

1869
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:21,040
Uh, uh, uh to us. So, uh, uh, I want more you want more

1870
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:25,760
Um, send send her like I don't know send her like lies about us

1871
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,080
Tell her that she that we said things we didn't say

1872
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,720
And have her get mad just make her mad

1873
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:34,880
Um

1874
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,520
I don't like you disavow you disavow

1875
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,880
um, I think it's funny but like

1876
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:44,880
It's it's like I don't know. I don't think it'll work

1877
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,680
And I'd rather not

1878
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:50,240
Lies being flung around even in a joke way

1879
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,960
I would like for lies

1880
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:57,040
Who knows how many dick show fans will latch onto that and agree with it

1881
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:03,520
Maybe even two maybe three people three care in any way about the procrastinators

1882
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,600
Then we can't have that we can't have that we can't have that

1883
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:17,200
We're we're we only need every one. It's really funny because like like if if if it results in like Trixie's spreading lies about us who

1884
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:25,040
Will pay attention and also who will care. It's really no one so I know but it's not much of like a reason not to do it

1885
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,120
Exactly. That's what I'm saying. I don't know. I'm just

1886
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:35,840
I feel like all right. All right. Trixie is a person of very low intelligence, but I think even even she

1887
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,600
probably

1888
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:42,560
Noticed that like hmm when I tried to attack the pcp

1889
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:46,720
I made a fool of myself and gave them a bunch of money

1890
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:50,560
Uh, I won't do that. I shouldn't do that again and

1891
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,080
And you know that chill that chilling effect is unfortunate

1892
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:02,480
Because I want it to continue, uh, but I feel I feel like maybe it won't I feel like even she may have learned the lesson and that's a shame

1893
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,280
Uh, so I don't know

1894
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:08,080
of

1895
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,760
I don't know

1896
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:14,640
Can't can't force her just can't force her to make a fool of herself, but uh, I don't know. Oh, she'll do it

1897
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,880
Just give her a chill. She'll she's

1898
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:23,680
I really think that she the the the the recent spate of like the recent spate of of uh

1899
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,480
outspoken

1900
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,640
attacks and and and

1901
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:31,520
She's because she's become more active on twitter and I and I think

1902
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:37,760
I sense that I sense that something is is something is shifting there something is is

1903
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:42,080
Things are things are hitting the fan or things are coming to you ahead and and uh

1904
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:45,840
The the the the the

1905
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:47,600
The the

1906
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:52,800
There will be there will be hostility. I feel like I feel like we are coming to a point where there may there may be greater hostility

1907
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:58,640
Um, because I mean once once she's lost everything like what else will there be for her except to like

1908
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:03,840
Lash out, right? So, you know, hopefully that day comes soon

1909
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:06,640
Uh, but I guess we'll see

1910
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,040

If someone calls you a gay wizard. Hey, you know what I was thinking yesterday

1919
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:35,600
Uh, Rowling said

1920
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,320
that Dumbledore

1921
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:39,360
was gay

1922
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,120
and he's a wizard

1923
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:44,400
And you know, he didn't he he didn't deny it

1924
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,200
which made it true

1925
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,840
Well, and I just

1926
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:53,520
That's all he was in the grave when that happened

1927
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,360
Damn

1928
02:07:55,360 --> 02:08:01,760
If only he'd if only he'd been alive to say if only he'd been alive to well, I won't say I won't say what he should have done
