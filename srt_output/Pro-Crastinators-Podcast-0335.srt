1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,180
I won't bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:23,400
The year is 2022. The year of Jorts the Cat's milkshake ducking. Welcome to The Pro Crastinators

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,560
Podcast. It's November 6th, and this is America.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,520
Well, I'm not in America.

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:45,560
This, I say gesturing wildly around me, is America. How's it going?

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:54,240
It's going quite well. I'm having a good day.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,120
Well, that's just great.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
It is.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm really happy for you.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,320
And why Ben Saint, are you unhappy today?

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm not in a good mood. I'm not in a good mood.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,440
What happened with your lecture?

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:22,200
Oh, yes. What happened with that was the render, it's an eight hour video, the render

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,800
was going to take about 100, 120 hours. And basically, I should have done this sooner.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,040
I should have done it right away. I would have caught the problem.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,800
I had uploaded a draft version to YouTube because I went into the description to add,

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,920
what do you call them, chapter markings?

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,560
Right, yes.

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,160
And so I was adding them on the draft version, and I just noticed an editing mistake that

20
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,840
happened a bunch of times, and it was unacceptable. So I was like, well, I fucked up. I have to

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,920
restart the render. It was already almost done by that point.

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Dang.

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,560
That was like five days of rendering, and then it finished. And then I just like, well,

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,880
I got to fix the error and just start it again. So it's going again, and it is now at 52%

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,320
of the second pass.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Oh my God.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,880
It's quite far.

28
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:34,800
Yeah, yeah. I think it's been going for about a day and a half? No, closer to like two and

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,760
a half, two and a half days.

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Well, you know, whatever. Doesn't really matter if it comes out last week or this week. I

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:56,000
said last week, it'll definitely be out unless something fucks up, and it did. So, oh well.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
I was a little surprised that you spilled the beans on what it was on Twitter before the

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,040
video was like uploaded or rendered, at least.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Were you?

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Yeah.

36
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Were you?

37
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know. I just felt like I would have expected it to be like keeping it a secret

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,680
until it was ready to be shown.

39
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,600
I thought I thought clueing people in early would build a little bit of anticipation. The

40
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,000
reason why I didn't want to say anything about it earlier was just because like, what

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,240
if I lose motivation? What if something goes wrong and I can't do it? I revealed it as

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,800
soon as I was like, well, there's no stopping it at this point.

43
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Right.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Yeah.

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:59,080
Yeah, like I kind of always meant to tease it. So I guess I'll say it again. It will

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,040
definitely be out this week.

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,920
Unless a terrible catastrophic thing happens again.

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,560
Unless a terrible catastrophic thing happens again, which you probably won't.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Yeah, there was a visual effect that plays every so often, and basically for the first

51
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,840
half of the video, the effect was playing like 10 seconds early, which is like completely

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,360
wrong. So it was pretty bad. So I was like, well, I can't leave it like that. If it was

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,320
like maybe one time that it happened, I'd have been like, fuck it. But it happened like

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
10 times.

55
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm in a terrible mood.

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:55,680
What's so desperate to feel better that I did body weight exercises this morning. I woke

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
up and I was like, I have to move. I have to do something. So I did body weight squats

58
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,160
and push-ups. They have not been working out, unfortunately. I think I remember feeling

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,040
better when I did workout. So if I start exercising again, maybe it will improve the situation.

60
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,120
It is a pretty guaranteed thing, just blood pumping through your veins and stuff.

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,280
That's does do something.

62
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:32,400
That's what they say. That's what they say. Yeah. I went and hung out with an old college

63
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:40,640
friend of mine the other day, and that was fine. But I felt like I had very little to

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,760
talk about, and that made me sad.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
That's it.

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Like things currently going on in your life or just like topics you didn't have anything

67
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,800
particularly interesting to say about anything?

68
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,680
Things currently going on in my life. I'm not doing anything. I'm not meeting new people.

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm not even like reading or watching anything. I don't know. I'm not doing anything.

70
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:27,040
They are making a video. Got my stupid video. Yeah. Yeah. But it's been like five days since

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,440
I was working on that. It's been basically done for almost a week. Now what have I got?

72
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:39,680
Well, I started editing the Slime and Punishment book again. Man, I started this year. I started

73
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,440
this year being like, I got to finish the Slime and Punishment book. And now it's years coming

74
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,640
to an end and I'm just like, all right, got to finish that Slime and Punishment book.

75
00:06:48,640 --> 00:07:03,360
Everyone says Twitter's going to die. I hope it does. Yeah. I regret every moment I've

76
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:13,600
ever spent on Twitter. Twitter, like doom and gloom. It seems rational enough. I feel

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,640
people are like, I don't know, getting a little too worked up over the idea of Twitter not being

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:29,360
around anymore. There was a time before Twitter and we liked that. That was fine. We're just too

79
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
used to it, I guess. I don't really believe that anything is really going to change.

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:47,040
No, I don't know. I think Elon Musk wants to make good on the extreme money he put towards it,

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,720
so he's going to try and make it as appeasing to advertisers as possible. So the whole free speech,

82
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
all the bad people coming back, I don't think that's going to happen. I think it's just going to be

83
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,400
the same until it just becomes untenable and then Elon might try and sell it.

84
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:14,160
The things that are the most bad, the worst things that I'm seeing for Twitter's future

85
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,040
prospects are that it'll throttle your metrics. It'll throttle your visibility if you aren't

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
a $8 checkmark. If you aren't paying for Twitter, if you aren't paying for Twitter Gold,

87
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,680
then your results will be not favored in searches, even if people are following you or something.

88
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:48,240
I don't like people having checkmarks. I also don't like the idea that anyone can buy a checkmark.

89
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I think they should just get rid of checkmarks if they really wanted to improve the website.

90
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,760
I mean, checkmarks have some utility in the proving that this is the actual person,

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,920
because there's something for that if it's like a politician or something.

92
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,680
I guess so. But the fact that you can just buy it removes that utility and adds nothing.

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,880
It does make it worthless. Any questionable value it might have had, it makes it worthless.

94
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah. I mean, all you'd really need to do, though, to make it completely useless,

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,120
but even more so, is to just download a browser extension to block

96
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,160
checkmarked people from appearing on your timeline. It doesn't matter how high up in

97
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,160
the search results they are, they'll just be destroyed. I mean, if everyone did that.

98
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,840
I'd do that. I'd do that immediately, because all the cool people do not want to pay $8 a month

99
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,400
for Twitter. Yeah, but the average Twitter user is not going to do that.

100
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,680
Well, sure. I can't remember exactly, but the idea that if you're following someone,

101
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
even if you're following them and you're not following this other person,

102
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,520
their tweets might appear first, just because they have the money, they have the checkmark.

103
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm like, well, that's essentially the same as like a promoted tweet,

104
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,280
which I block anyway. I block as many of those as I can, because I don't want to see

105
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,920
things that I'm not following, because they're ads. And so people paying for Twitter,

106
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,280
they are become the ad, so I get rid of them.

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,520
Hmm. I mean, my tweets already don't do well and nobody sees them, so throttle

108
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,680
away, I guess. I won't even notice a difference. Yeah, that's another thing.

109
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,840
I don't think of Twitter as a career prospect for me. It's just sort of like a place

110
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:04,240
where I post something stupid. And if it's funny and make someone laugh, that's pretty good.

111
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,360
But it's not for like, it's not like a stage where I'm trying to put on a performance,

112
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,080
it's just sort of like a like a waste paper basket where I'm got like a bunch of like shit

113
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm thrown at the wall and throw it like just thrown it in there. And then sometimes there's

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:34,480
a banger. And I'm like, hey, yeah. I guess there is like the like posting art is useful,

115
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,000
letting people know about things that are going on with your work. Yeah, because people don't

116
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,840
really subscribe to newsletters and email lists. And it's funny how many artists use Twitter as

117
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,240
their main platform, even though it's like it's really not it's really not designed as like an art

118
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,320
platform. It's just it's just where the people are. So yeah.

119
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,520
She's got a post there. I'm seeing all like that. Where are you going to go? Where are you going to

120
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,760
put your stuff? And I'm like, geez, I don't know. I guess Tumblr because that's the only one I've

121
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,280
had experience with. And I guess I'll just try and I never used Tumblr. I'll put like, well,

122
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,080
no, that's not true. I use it a bit, but I never like was attached to it.

123
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,560
I got kind of attached to it. It just sort of it. I mean, it's kind of the same as Twitter.

124
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,440
You just sort of like you follow people and sometimes you see things that are stupid and

125
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,400
people overreacting about something. And then you post your things and then sometimes you get a lot

126
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:47,840
of likes. It's the most analogous. Yeah. Yeah. I feel you, dog.

127
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know. I don't want to use Tumblr. I should stop. I should stop using Twitter. It's

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,280
a waste of time. I don't even like it. I don't get anything out of it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of

129
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,200
it. I have discord with people I can talk to, which is a finite resource if there's no new people

130
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,080
entering. But I don't know. When it comes to like talking to people, having like a community,

131
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Twitter is not the place for a community really. No, it's really not. I should have made more

132
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,040
videos. I should have put more videos on my channel instead of making all the like thousands and

133
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,320
thousands of tweets that I've written. Should have applied that time a lot better.

134
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah. Coming up on 10 years I've spent on Twitter.

135
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,840
Wow. Maybe nine. I mean, some of those times I was more on it than others. But yeah,

136
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,120
I just want the 10 years back, please. I think I started a little later. I was on there in like

137
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,640
2015, 2014. I was looking through some of my older tweets just because

138
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,160
and I remember that I would only do puns. I would do puns so often and so many of them

139
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,040
that I'm like, wow, I was funnier. These are like, they're so all over the place and a lot of them

140
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,920
feel like I was funnier. I feel like I used to be funnier. They require a lot of like setup,

141
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,480
but they're like, yeah, I read that and I'm like, that's funny. The things I do now are like,

142
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,800
what if I was cringe, but actually not? What if I was base? I don't know,

143
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,080
like the tweets I'm posting now, they're sometimes funny, but like the style of humor is different.

144
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm like, wow. I see. I see. I've just, I don't know, I haven't just haven't really been

145
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,760
making tweets lately. I don't really, I was, I was, man, I was scrolling through.

146
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,120
It was for the Simon punishment book. I'm formatting the notes. I'm at, I had written like

147
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,920
notes in Erata, but I decided that I want to add in some records of like me and Chris's DMs

148
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,560
and like the images that she made for me, like like the cards that she made out of the

149
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,200
out of the comic panels and stuff. I decided to put a section or add that in. So I was going through

150
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:28,960
my old Twitter, you know, replies and stuff looking for those. And oh my God, I just hate,

151
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,680
I'm so annoying. I'm so fucking annoying on Twitter. I'm so terrible. I hate myself.

152
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,960
You have been very aggressive with the, the, the replies to people being stupid.

153
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,960
I, I don't, that's not, I don't, that's not even what I'm, that's not even, that's the,

154
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,880
if anything, that's the one thing that I like looking at my tweets is times that I mean to people.

155
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah. Sometimes I do, I have enjoyed like going through a thread where you've gotten into a

156
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,520
scuffle with someone, like read up everything that's happened and they're always in the wrong, but yeah.

157
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm always in the wrong. No, no. Well, I can't remember. Sometimes, but most of the time you're

158
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
not. Maybe sometimes, maybe sometimes. I mean, I feel like usually when I'm mad, I'm mad with

159
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,120
purpose, but that's not even what I'm talking about. I'm just talking about, I don't know. I just,

160
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,720
whenever I, when I have like a genuine opinion to express, I don't know. I always feel, I,

161
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,960
reading my old tweets, I'm always like, I'm so ham-handed. Like I'm so, I'm so like, I'm so like

162
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,200
bluntly expressing just like a completely banal opinion, but I'm saying it in a way that like,

163
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,560
it feels like I'm doing something and like it's so stupid. I should have, like I should have just

164
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,320
not said anything. Was it banal at the time or is it just sort of like, like, I mean in hindsight,

165
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,560
it seems banal. I don't know. My fucking stupid, when I was like really like,

166
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,040
when I was really like election posting around 2019, it's like, shut up.

167
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,360
When I'm really, at times when I made some like really stupid, I don't know, you know,

168
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,640
some garbage that no one cares about, like trans rights or something or like, that Bernie Sanders

169
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:29,200
is good. You know, it's like, why did I, why did I bother? What was, what was the thing you did

170
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,320
by Bernie where Yang or something? Oh, I don't know. I might have said, yeah, that sounds vaguely

171
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,880
familiar. Like, like, how's, like, what's, what's the joke? What am I, what am I doing?

172
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,080
What's the bit? I think the bit was that you liked Yang for a bit and then you're like, wait a

173
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:57,280
minute, nah. I know. That's not even, I know. That's not funny. It's not funny. It's just sad.

174
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,880
It's just sad. I don't know. So I felt really just terrible. I felt just really terrible reading

175
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:14,000
through all my, a record of my thoughts and opinions from the last several years. And it

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
just made me think like, what am I doing? What's, what's the point of me?

177
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:28,960
Oh, no. What's the point of Ben saying? It's not good. It's not good, dog. I don't know.

178
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,800
Well, I mean, Twitter's always been, I don't feel too good about it. Twitter's always been like,

179
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,640
the quickest and easiest way to be the worst version of yourself.

180
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,080
It is.

181
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
So don't feel like that represents you entirely.

182
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:52,000
Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I should live in the real world more. I just, I just don't know how.

183
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
I've forgotten how.

184
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,880
I think a lot of people have forgotten how. What do you do? You just, you walk around and you,

185
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
you bump into someone and then you say, oh, sorry.

186
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,240
That's what I do. Yeah. What do you do? You walk around, you walk around, you walk around outside.

187
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,120
Do you like, I don't know, I take me and me and my, me and my buddy. We went to a bar,

188
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,240
but like, we just, we just sat there. We just sat there and chatted, same as we would have at the

189
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,640
house. Like they say like, Oh, be social, like go out to a bar. Well, we just sat there and talk

190
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,680
same as we would at the house. We might as well not have left the house. Like, what's the point?

191
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
Uh, what is the point?

192
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,760
Nice drinks, a nice atmosphere, maybe. Sure. Sure. I guess. Sure. I guess.

193
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,720
Just saying it wasn't, it wasn't like, I don't know. It wasn't like an opportunity to meet people.

194
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
No. It never, it never feels that way.

195
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,680
It, I've never experienced a time like that in a bar.

196
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,280
No. It's, it's sort of a bygone age sort of thing. People already have their friends and

197
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,200
go to the bar with them. Yeah, it seems that way. And they meet them earlier in life at school or

198
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,800
at work. And yeah, that's the only two places that seem like the normal place to meet a person

199
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
that's not artificial. Yeah, that's right.

200
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,120
Bleak. Bleak.

201
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,560
There was a little bit like with social media, like Twitter or whatever,

202
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,000
you would find like-minded people, you would retweet this stuff. If it was good,

203
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
they might find yours and retweet it. And then you'd have like a Twitter buddy.

204
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,480
And then, yeah, and then, uh, you know, hypothetically, you go to a convention,

205
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,640
they just happen to be there or that, you know, you can do some sort of like,

206
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,800
like breaking ice first contact through social media and then become out in the real world later.

207
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,240
Doesn't happen a lot, but it's like, it's something.

208
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,320
Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I don't really have that. I don't have Twitter buddies.

209
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,440
I have people whose posts I admire, but it's not the same.

210
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,840
Yeah. Think about the way the PCP formed. It was kind of that, but on YouTube specifically,

211
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,200
we made videos on a social media platform and it's like, you're good at those videos.

212
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,160
Let's meet up on the internet and we got a Skype.

213
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
Let's do a podcast or whatever. Yeah. Let's record a-

214
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
We're content creators.

215
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,080
A conversation between all of us. Yes. We are content creators.

216
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:52,240
Uh, yeah. That was, uh, that was pretty good. You know, I feel like maybe these

217
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,280
problems, the problems of not living in the real world, not having opportunities to

218
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,000
socialize, I feel like maybe those would solve themselves if I could find somewhere inside of

219
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,080
me some sort of passion for anything. And then I would naturally pursue that. And then,

220
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,080
you know, things, things would happen around that. But alas, there's nothing there. It's just void.

221
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:29,760
Void void. So, you know, it's a truly, truly is a vicious, a vicious and self-compounding

222
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:39,440
a cycle that I find a vortex that I find myself in I mean and that's why I did pushups this

223
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,600
morning to cope with that cope pushups are good all pushups are good and yeah they felt all right

224
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:58,000
I would do them again I obviously can't speak for you but like surely um passion for certain

225
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,080
things exists it's just it's just that like they might not be a creative endeavor they might just

226
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:15,680
be like a video game or like I don't know some probably that you could get into I guess I like

227
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:29,120
making gummies yeah I guess I like that uh it's it's it's fine it's fine at all I don't know

228
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,160
finding I don't know when you feel like you have not because I felt like that before as well like

229
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,920
seriously like lacking in in a passion for anything it's like wow why would I do anything

230
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:50,000
hmm what is and like like nothing is gonna lead to anything and it's gonna and I'm fucked to no

231
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,120
matter what it sucks you know it's like they're all like depression talking points you might just

232
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,040
have a big depression that you need to work through and then you'll you'll remember that

233
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,760
you actually do like things but the you know working through depression by yourself is very

234
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:18,320
difficult because you're in a you're in a bad headspace of space where like your your conclusions

235
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:28,480
are faulty and based on uh on like exaggerated negative like outcomes that you're imagining

236
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,920
are definitely gonna happen or have already happened and you know yeah your brain's compromised

237
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:47,920
I think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well I mean I guess so I guess that makes sense

238
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,520
uh I don't know get you a therapist for real

239
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,800
oh no there's there there there it is you've got a passion for not getting a therapist

240
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,040
see yes yes the one thing that gets me out of bed in the morning is the idea that I can spend the

241
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:20,560
whole day miserable like hell yeah another day that's gonna suck it's really it's really like

242
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,280
the obvious thing and the fact that you don't want to do it means it's good it's good for you

243
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,560
hmm well I don't want to do a lot of things I don't want to jump off a bridge

244
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,040
yeah but you don't think you don't stand by a bridge and be like ah jumping off the bridge

245
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,000
I know I should jump I know I should but like I just don't want to not yeah no that's not what I

246
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,240
mean it means it's like um uh when you're like scared of an outcome of something that means you

247
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,640
want to do it because you wouldn't care at all if if you if you weren't scared of failure or scared

248
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,720
of of it being fucking worthless perhaps I'm scared of my video failing yeah so that means

249
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:13,840
you care about the video yeah I really do yeah I actually like um on on the one hand you know I

250
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,120
sort of in the video I explained this and then I restructured my patreon and stuff I explained

251
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,040
that like okay I want to like focus on these more I can make more of these I can make you know I can

252
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,000
do a reward as like a like we can have a vote I'll let people choose a topic for me you know I want

253
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,560
to lean more into this um and that's like so on the one hand I it's kind of scary like okay well

254
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,240
if the video completely flops it's just going to be really embarrassing and I'm going to be like

255
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,680
well I guess my whole plan had no legs and I overreached and committed a strategic error

256
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,680
and now I got egg on my face what a rube on the other hand it's like oh well if it does succeed

257
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
of the video does really well a lot of people pledge like yes I want to see more like this

258
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,680
I love long youtube videos I want to vote on a topic for this idiot to explain it's like well

259
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:20,880
then I got to do stuff and that's scary yeah uh so yeah but I'm but I'm just I'm just um

260
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,440
the way the way things have been going uh cannot continue you know like once the once like other

261
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,680
than the slime and punishment book which I have been encountering hurdle after hurdle for

262
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,160
like what am I really doing like I'm not really working on any any videos or something

263
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,280
not I'm not like actively drawing comics although I do intend to do more of that in the future so

264
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,360
it's like well if I can turn if I can turn my big hit if I can turn my biggest hit the lectures

265
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,000
into like a a sort of semi-regular thing that I do for a semi-stable income it's like that seems

266
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,040
like that seems like a positive direction to be moving in so at some point I just decided I'm

267
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,600
gonna I'm gonna make this that I'm gonna do that and do my give it my best shot and I just

268
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,600
committed to it followed through on that notion even even though I wasn't really feeling it a lot

269
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,120
of the time even though I'm like oh this video is so embarrassing like oh I look really bad like

270
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:30,160
oh what am I talking about like oh I I'm repeating myself I sound like an idiot uh I just kind of

271
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,800
had to step outside and look at it from like an outsider's perspective and be like you're kind

272
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:41,760
of you're those things those things don't matter the object objectively the thing to do is just

273
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,600
is just follow through on this thing that you've already like sunk you know so much effort into

274
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:57,200
you you can't you can't give up yeah and I didn't it's good it's good to keep busy I would say if

275
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,800
you if you're like um you have you're in between projects that's a moment where your motivation

276
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,760
can like plummet because you're not currently working on anything you have to think yeah um

277
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,600
so you should try doing a small thing that can sort of bridge the gap between the megaman lecture

278
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,600
being released and whatever you do next if the lecture is a big hit you can work on start working

279
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,480
on the next one if it's a big flop you might have to do something else maybe go back to one of your

280
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,880
comics yeah but you should have something going on in the background something you can be saying

281
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,680
you're you're working on you could do commissions that's quite an easy little thing oh I hate

282
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,760
commissions I know that sometimes they're they're really rough because it's like but like it's

283
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,320
something I could I could do them like I could I could do them you I don't really like doing them

284
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,360
so I've I've avoided it mostly yeah uh you could do like a really small short project like a short

285
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:10,000
comic or uh I guess it's nano-rimon national novel writing month you could write something

286
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,200
I do feel I've been saying this for a long time I do feel like I should write more I feel like I

287
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:25,360
should try to write essays yeah but make sure you're on the one hand right now on the one hand

288
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,720
I feel like maybe I should write I should write essays but but simultaneously I'm like well but

289
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm but I'm but I'm leaning into the lecture thing that's that's mostly unscripted so that's

290
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,640
kind of like two two different things why can't you do two different things I I don't know it's

291
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,440
just impossible for reasons I don't understand you could have lectures and essays yeah I could

292
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,800
I mean I guess there's no like there's no like expectation of like a lecture every month or

293
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,840
anything like that yeah I don't know I would like to write essays but again it's like I just don't

294
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,680
care about anything enough to write thoughts about them I don't know I wish I wish I had something I

295
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,080
was like really excited about and I'd be like man I have thoughts about this thing I'd like to get

296
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,480
them down in like written form and then maybe record those that writing in audio and put it on

297
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,600
YouTube or something that would that would be pretty that would be pretty great I was talking I

298
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,640
don't know if I talked about on the PCP I probably did a little while ago I had an idea for a

299
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:50,240
hypocrite video I spent a little time um thinking about like how I would go about getting the data

300
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,640
necessary to come to the conclusion because it was like a it was a lore-based video it was like

301
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:04,320
trying to stitch dark cloud and dark cloud two together in a way that they're deliberately

302
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,000
unconnected timelines could connect in a hypothetical sense and it was just sort of like

303
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,640
okay so I'd have to play both of the games and pay close attention to all the dialogue maybe I'd

304
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,360
have to go to the Japanese version you know there's there's lots of things I could do and I was

305
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:30,240
stunned to write like a plan I never really got into actually thinking I was gonna do it

306
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:39,440
but that was that was an enjoyable little like a thought experiment like the the concept of that

307
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,760
I don't know why why I thought of it but like it's a game I like and the sequel is like notorious

308
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,560
for being similar in so many ways but completely divorced from the original story from the first

309
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,480
game the sequel so it's like so why why are they why is it why does it look so similar why

310
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,320
does some characters exist but the story is completely different universe so you just had no

311
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,120
intention at any point of actually doing it I I still might do it it's not like I've abandoned

312
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,800
the idea it's just sort of like that's that's the the the nexus of like a cool idea is something

313
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:28,000
that I'm familiar with from my childhood I mean I mean it sounds in I'd want to see that video

314
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,360
yeah I mean sounds like a good idea to me I think I might do it it just would require a bit of like

315
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:43,600
planning around playing the game imagine a hypocrite video in 2022 2023 it'd probably be at this point

316
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,280
just because I've got I've got like um focus on on Clarissa first oh yeah how's that going

317
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:58,720
um this past week since the last pcp I've hadn't really had a lot of time because I

318
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,840
went traveling for a few days on halloween and I came back and I was tired from that and then

319
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,280
I just sort of didn't work for the rest of the week I was so like hey whatever

320
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,120
so I'm gonna work properly we're gonna get back to it properly next week

321
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,080
um it's just like a mini holiday I suppose

322
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,480
but it's it's it's close to the end like it was last week

323
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,960
close to the end of the like sketching out and sketching yeah

324
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,520
sorry I should know this remind me how many pages how many new pages sketched are there

325
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:47,520
like do you say like 30 or 50 there's like uh I'm trying to remember uh sketching hasn't started

326
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:59,200
like the the ending is what Clarissa but blocking it's like 100 and something new pages

327
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,840
maybe 130 I'm not sure I'll have to properly count them because I still might add like a few

328
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,360
on close to the final few shots and then I'm gonna have like a an epilogue bit which would be like

329
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:21,680
five pages maybe um so yeah it's a lot I might stream it I might stream the line art or something

330
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,880
maybe the sketching I don't know sketching is also quite mentally taxing because you're

331
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,880
it's not that you have to figure out where the panel sits in the page layout and what

332
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,760
information is being explained in the panel but you do need to think of how the body looks how the

333
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:48,080
pose works the what parts of like how best to portray the thing that I've already decided must

334
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,720
be portrayed in this panel that's a lot of thought it goes into that probably gonna have to draw and

335
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,640
redraw things a lot so maybe I shouldn't stream the sketch but the line art would be like

336
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,320
hopefully very nice and chill and like just hang out it could be something

337
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:16,960
you know I tried uh streaming uh the uh the other day for rfck and it was mostly successful there was

338
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,320
like a moment where the stream died in the middle uh because my internet just like stopped working

339
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,080
for a sec still disappointing I I don't know what that happens

340
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,040
huh do you know what that happens that that seems to have happened just in calls like you can't

341
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,800
access web pages but you're still in the call yeah it oh god I'm damn it I'm connected through my

342
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,600
I just checked and I've forgotten yeah even even right this moment I am connected through my

343
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,400
mobile hotspot which is terrible it's seriously like every day that like some shit happens and

344
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,280
my internet dies and I have to switch to my fucking phone hotspot and even in that fails

345
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,920
sometimes as well it's it's honestly like unacceptably bad and I don't know why like

346
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,840
it's been allowed to be this way but like I don't hear anyone else complain uh and I don't know who

347
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:22,480
to complain to and I don't know if it would accomplish anything uh because I mean we have

348
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,480
internet service it just sucks yeah I guess if the plan is not good enough you would just need to

349
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,720
try and improve the plan get a different maybe I can just tell that guy like hey I'll just pay

350
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:44,960
extra for a better plan yeah that's that's a solution honestly do you have like the thing

351
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:56,240
that goes in the wall that the booster um yes but it didn't uh like the guy the guy told me

352
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,840
that they already have one that's like okay I don't really understand all right I don't know

353
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,400
what he the the extender is supposed to like extend the signal he told me that like they've

354
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,840
already got an extender but it's like in his room like right next to the the the the router

355
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,840
or the modem or whatever you call it and it's like well what's the point of an extent the

356
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,560
point of an extender is that you put it further away to extend the signal yeah so like I think

357
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:39,360
I'm already picking it up out of an extender uh I don't know uh so you know what as I as I explain

358
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,600
it I'm thinking maybe I should try it regardless of the fact that he told me it was unnecessary

359
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,200
maybe I should try setting it up I tried setting it up before and it didn't work and I don't remember

360
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,120
why it didn't work but maybe it's worth another shot I don't know yeah I don't know I don't

361
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,400
know if it would even help because it's like I'll have a signal it'll tell me that I have a signal

362
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,160
but then like web pages will just stop loading or like discord will just die or the voice call

363
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,600
will die or the stream will die even though it says the signal is strong and and other other

364
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:18,560
times it says like no signal or like interrupted signal uh internet Wi-Fi is confusing I tried

365
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,480
to figure it out a while ago but I don't think I really gained any knowledge I think the one thing

366
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,240
is that there's two types of things there's a plug in the wall like booster that uses the

367
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:40,320
electricity the house and there's an extender which is different and it extends the Wi-Fi signal

368
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,480
somehow with a little antenna and the the booster you plug the router

369
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,280
into it and that goes into the wall and then you use the houses like electricity grid and then

370
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,360
out of another socket you can have the Wi-Fi like be transmitted through the you know wherever you

371
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,360
put the the other socket thing and that's what I have in my room and my internet's fine

372
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,200
shit otherwise the Wi-Fi doesn't reach yeah you can plug like a LAN cable into like the thing that

373
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,080
comes out of the wall so I can have wired boosted internet that's not actually connected to the

374
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,760
router but I don't know too much about it I don't know whether that's a specific brand that's able

375
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,720
to do that or I don't know I thought I thought the internet I guess at my last place was bad

376
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:46,960
this place is like at least as bad so that's disappointing yeah what were we talking about

377
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:55,600
before we got on that subject streaming Clarissa oh yeah yeah yeah I guess I was just talking about

378
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:02,080
stuff that I was doing uh that was it I was yeah Clarissa

379
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,440
oh I did those commissions you know I only got three commissions when I when I had that thing

380
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,720
I did them like immediately and I was like okay I'm on top of things and I got no more so if I'm

381
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,360
still they're still open because I have you know the time I can I can you know nestle them away

382
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,920
as long as I don't get like 50 and I don't expect to judging by the response

383
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,880
so like one or two more I can do so go to Twitter if that still exists and see my commission thing

384
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:51,680
it's still pinned at the top of my page yeah go to youtube.com slash ben saint slash megaman lecture

385
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,440
to and check to see how many views it's got and if I if should I be embarrassed of myself

386
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:08,480
or not well every journey every youtube video starts with a single view a single view a single view

387
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,440
and that's your own the uploaders when you're checking it I see I think that video is probably

388
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:23,280
going to accrue views like steadily over like a long period of time it's I don't think it's

389
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:31,440
going to be like a smash like hit out the gate but I think more people will like discover it

390
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,800
maybe it'll get a boost for the 35th anniversary later this year you know you know

391
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:53,280
I do know yeah that's my hope it won't solve my problems but even if it does well it won't

392
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:02,160
fix my life what are you fighting for what am I fighting for how does he how does he say

393
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:15,040
far he's kind of you know here's a here's a fact I I talk about the what am I fighting for

394
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,720
clip a bit in the lecture well there was a new running shine there was a new running shine video

395
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,200
this week that just had like the most briefest little like cutaway reference to a clip of zero

396
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,560
going no this can't be happening he didn't even he didn't even play the the what am I fighting for

397
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,240
and I realized that I'm that I'm a hack and I'm a loser and I'm not funny because that guy

398
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,480
he's so far beyond my level he doesn't even have to show the thing he's talking about we all know

399
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,480
we all know about what am I fighting for it's passé to even mention it oh you feel like yeah

400
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,880
you're bringing it up would be like um yeah then we know what we're fighting for

401
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,920
yes oh no yes exactly yes exactly it should it should it just it doesn't need to be stated

402
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,040
it it she goes it goes without saying frankly well I mean there's always the person who's never

403
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:15,600
seen it before god it doesn't hurt to be comprehensive in a big huge hour long hours long video on the

404
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:23,440
subject yeah I yeah I mean I'm sort of kidding because like I know that like sort of the whole

405
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,680
point of the video is that it's comprehensive but also it just doesn't I just don't feel very cool

406
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:39,680
oh no but but my mom said if I made an eight hour long mega man lecture I would be cool

407
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,680
the only thing that can make me feel cool is if it gets like a million views

408
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,520
the only the only thing that will be cool is if it does really well and I look really famous and

409
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,240
then everyone will be like well yeah this video is stupid and cringe but like it performed really

410
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:04,480
well so I guess the guy knows what he's doing I'm serious I'm totally serious everything I make is bad

411
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,160
by default the only the only way that I can prove the only way that I can even suggest otherwise

412
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,040
is like is if it does well in the market and then market logic trumps like you know gut intuition

413
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:26,800
and like feeling in your heart feeling in your heart the feeling in the heart is that this guy

414
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,160
sucks this guy's not funny uh dude I hate this video but gotta respect the view count

415
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,400
it literally yes literally yes it's my only hope

416
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,680
uh I feel completely differently I think if something's cool

417
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,080
and nobody knows about it I just feel cool that to have known about it it's like hell you know who

418
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:56,960
I you know who I think might suck um the uh I'm a little I'm not saying this for sure but I'm a

419
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,000
little I'm a little sussed I'm a little sussed by the umami guy the guy who makes that clown cartoon

420
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,480
uh clown I don't know I think he might be a crypto head like Elon musk fan who I don't know who umami

421
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:25,200
um um here you will recognize the character uh let me just get an image here for you

422
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:41,360
yes yes posting now oh I think I've seen like the first like video in this series or whatever

423
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:49,200
with the weirdo I've seen a bunch of them yes I think I think he might be like an NFT Elon guy

424
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:58,800
well yeah don't we're not gonna ruin my day I'm not I'm not I have to find that a bit disappointing

425
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,920
because this guy this guy makes pretty cool this guy makes pretty cool videos that are awesome

426
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,080
I don't know this is just I just I just see him I just see him liking some things on Twitter

427
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:23,680
that I'm like why would he like that well think he emoji no exactly um I hope I'm I hope I'm wrong

428
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,200
maybe he'll maybe he follows Elon musk ironically which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do

429
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah I guess at this point it is very funny seeing him say anything Elon's being very funny on Twitter

430
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,920
he's he's really going for it he's having a he's having a good one

431
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,360
it's it's almost so absurd that it's not even worth talking about it's like yeah of course

432
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:58,800
there there he goes again posting a soyjack meme posting a like an obvious cope post yeah

433
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:07,920
some obvious cope like 2008 like reddit meme tier thing about like the blue haired Twitter

434
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:16,880
sjw's won't pay $8 cringe you're right I won't what are you gonna do about it you're you're right

435
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:28,160
actually uh you know I you know I was I thought it was dumb because obviously I'm not paying $8

436
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:36,560
for Twitter but and and I hate to say this maybe it's actually good because

437
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,680
I won't I won't pay for Twitter but other people might and if other people do and it makes Twitter

438
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,960
work fine then it's like okay other people are shouldering the burden that I don't have to

439
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,120
but no that's not that's not good it's that's not good if it like throttles the views and like

440
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:04,640
no yeah makes it uneven so never mind it's bad it's it's it's so it's one thing if it was like

441
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,200
there was a tip jar and you could donate to Twitter to keep it afloat like how Wikipedia works

442
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,480
that doesn't compromise the utility of the platform yeah just keeps it online and that's

443
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,880
that's sort of fine it's the it's the it's the way he's trying to entice people to do it by giving

444
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:31,840
them all of these things that make them like like uh what's the word like more equal than

445
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:38,080
everyone else yeah it's like yes that's stupid it's like it's like look at all look at all these

446
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,240
perks you get if you guys buy twitter blue you'll have you'll have priority tweets like that's

447
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,320
great right don't you want more perks for your purchase and like no I want there to be fewer

448
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:58,880
perks I want everyone to have the same amount of perks which is zero like uh I think he was talking

449
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:07,120
in like a uh uh investors thing about like the idea of like long-form video on twitter if you pay

450
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:16,640
um genius and like streaming and podcasts but on twitter like people are going to stop using like

451
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,200
these other platforms like youtube twitch and Spotify to put their stuff on twitter

452
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,360
where they have to pay for the privilege to do that where whereas like the other places you

453
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,480
don't really have to do that at all at least with spot I think you have to pay for Spotify

454
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:42,720
but not on youtube on twitch tremendous tremendous what what a what a concept he's gonna he's gonna

455
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,400
build x the everything app just like just like just like dr. light he's gonna he's gonna spend the

456
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,760
last years of his life you know on his ultimate creation x which will be an app that has free will

457
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:04,960
and can decide for itself right from wrong uh been waiting to make that joke it's a good one

458
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:15,040
thanks uh I think it's I think it's got legs um anyway uh yeah he's just like ooh what what

459
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,840
what functions what what new weird stupid things can we make twitter do and it's like twitter already

460
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:27,200
does what we want it to do which is a little place to post like short snippets and pictures

461
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,320
snippets and pictures and bits I follow a lot of people who do comedy they just make funny tweets

462
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,480
I'm like haha it's just that some of them are a hit and miss the fact that that it's just sort of

463
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:49,760
like so easy to like just make a bunch of jokes it's like I'm gonna stand up the the the trend of uh

464
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:58,000
the trend of people uh getting verified and then uh changing their name to elon musk oh yeah

465
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,640
has been very good I've seen so is that active like that the pay for eight bucks is that already

466
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:14,480
active I saw emails about it I think so I think it might have happened already um I'm not sure though

467
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,320
so you can just buy the thing get the checkmark change your name in profile picture and just

468
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,600
say something like haha pee pee poo poo I I dump in my diaper I meal on musk and then you get

469
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,480
immediately terminated and then you get 10 000 followers of people that think you're the real

470
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:41,520
elon musk is like elon send me doge please uh did you see it how's going doing I don't know who

471
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:49,040
cares let's let's I care I want to see it go down it is doing I mean it's just hovering around 20k

472
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:59,440
as it's been for a while never mind have you seen um the the firings at twitter he sort of oh he

473
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:05,520
fired them based on the number of words they written and he kept the ones that wrote the most

474
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:13,600
in the coding that's so smart which which means that the the the the most inefficient coders

475
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:18,960
the ones who needed to write tons and tons of lines of code to get something to work

476
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,000
are the ones he kept and all the ones who were efficient and were able to do things smaller

477
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,080
were let go the exact opposite of what should have how do you how do you come up with such a

478
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,960
fucking boneheaded scheme I don't know I don't know why he thought I mean I thought he would know

479
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:43,840
I mean I would say I would yeah it's possible that maybe the least efficient ones would have

480
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:52,720
written the most I would say at at best there's just like just no correlation yeah yeah like it

481
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:00,240
depends on what tasks you have to do and like what jobs you're a part of that the amount of

482
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:08,160
code you write would differ yeah it's just sort of I mean I guess that that's that's really what

483
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:14,480
happened he just fired like half the staff just based on like how many words or lines of code or

484
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,720
whatever I heard it was lines of code maybe it was more rigorous than that but knowing Elon it

485
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,200
probably wouldn't have been that much more rigorous I half of them are gone half of there's like 7400

486
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:37,920
people that work there and that half of them have been fired that's very smart uh I have to be honest

487
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:45,760
I don't really care that much about the individual employees of Twitter my heart does not exactly

488
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,120
bleed for them just because they got fired like boo-hoo whatever everyone gets fired deal with it

489
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,320
yeah that's not but it does but it is dumb it's it's obviously like a dumb way to manage your

490
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,320
business it doesn't make any sense I mean it's it's the way it reads to me is that he's like

491
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,920
he's so fucked and he's like that Twitter loses so much money all the time because of how many

492
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,680
employees we have and how much money is not coming in oh god please pay for Twitter blue

493
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,640
like we gotta get rid of so mostly stuff just get can't pay all these salaries oh my god

494
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:29,440
I'm $44 billion in the red or whatever what a freaking idiot what a freaking nerd it's so it's

495
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,560
so funny I mean I I guess part of me will feel a little bad if like it does end up just like

496
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:43,520
making Twitter unusable sure yeah so I hope it doesn't come to that I hope it just doesn't do

497
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:51,760
anything uh who just gives up but he probably won't yeah I don't know like people have speculated

498
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,880
a lot of different things people are saying that he's going to eventually just sell it at a loss

499
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:06,000
to someone yeah because he can't like he's but like $44 billion like nobody's gonna pay even

500
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,560
anywhere close to that for Twitter no no I mean it was so it's gonna be a huge loss so like it was

501
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:21,600
try his best to get like the $8 a month thing going Elon simps will do it maybe normal people will

502
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:27,920
think fine I guess and then they'll do it as well but in the long term I don't think that's gonna be

503
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,800
that sustainable I just I just don't know uh I mean

504
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:44,240
I guess I guess we'll see no I mean it the the wasn't like the original amount just like a meme

505
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:53,360
offer like he just offered like ha ha for $420 or whatever per share per share oh yeah it was

506
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,560
like oh it was like he made he made enough he made you know it was literally like he was like

507
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,920
lol I'll buy Twitter at like $69 per share Lamar or something and they and then he just like

508
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,480
played chicken with that and then he meant it until he eventually was legally obligated to

509
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,560
have meant it the whole time so like yeah it's definitely a huge loss and it was always going to

510
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,240
be like I don't really remember like the announcement at the initially of like haha I'll buy Twitter

511
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:31,280
um I have so much money like that's vaguely what I remember it but like I read I read some

512
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,360
some some think pieces about it what was his what was his thought process behind even making the joke

513
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,880
it's that he was just complaining about like Twitter's bad there's too many bots

514
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,560
Twitter's not profitable I could run Twitter better than this

515
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:56,080
but basically just that I wonder if he was like you know he found this really hot person on Twitter

516
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:02,160
and he was like DMing them but it was a bot it was a sex bot and he was like fuck my wife left me

517
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,160
and I want to have sex this sucks Twitter still has too many bots I keep going up in there and I

518
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:15,440
find bots fuck it I'll buy the whole thing and then get rid of the bots so I can find hot uh

519
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,320
desperate mills in my area the yeah the uh the the bots thing was like big that was like a big

520
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,960
part of the thing like he claimed that like Twitter was being dishonest about like the

521
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,360
number of bots that like have accounts on there that that was his initial way to try and get out

522
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,640
of it which leads me to believe that he was like already stuck it was part of his original

523
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,640
complaints about Twitter and yeah then also when he was trying to back out he's like no no they lie

524
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,840
they lied about how many bots they have there's there's more bots than I was led to believe

525
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,800
like how did he let it even though like his initial reason for buying the platform

526
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,600
was that what part of it was that like there are too many bots and I want to solve the bot problem

527
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,920
and then they're like well okay now you have to buy it and he's like no no I can't buy it

528
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,400
I didn't know there were all these bots

529
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,760
like how did he how did he let it get to the point where he had to start making excuses in

530
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:21,520
order to back out and it didn't even work what did he sign what yeah I don't know like yeah why would

531
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:29,200
you be why would you sign stuff there must yeah there there was like actual documentation there's

532
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,920
like there was at some point illegal obligation and he just went like lol

533
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,960
which is pretty funny I guess

534
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,520
broken man it's really it's just really funny how like Elon simps are like

535
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,200
lol he owned them he really bought it he owns twitter now and it's like yeah

536
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,280
he really bought it for like five times what it's worth because he like way more than five times

537
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,560
yeah because he like couldn't not do it he didn't want to do it but he had to so like he really

538
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,600
truly who owned who here I genuinely don't understand he played himself completely and utterly

539
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:19,760
yeah the the the the the Elon I don't understand the Elon is playing 5d chess people

540
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:26,800
truly it kind of not not to not to really compare them because they're not that similar but it sort

541
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,960
of reminds me of the people in Maryweather's comments who were like angry at someone suggesting

542
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,520
a gender swap and then when he did the gender swap they said like he owned them he owned them by

543
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:45,120
giving them exactly what they asked for like ah he owned the haters what are you talking about

544
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,440
boy oh boy do not make fun of my idol I tie my self-worth to this man

545
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:02,640
I mean a lot of people it's a lot of it is people that have like financial

546
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:08,080
stake like they own share in Tesla or they own bitcoin or they own doge and those people I mean

547
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,280
I don't agree with them but I at least understand that like I have a financial stake in this man's

548
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:21,520
reputation as like a wildcard genius or whatever I at least understand the motivation for those people

549
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:32,960
oh yeah yeah hi yeah yeah how was your halloween

550
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:40,000
oh my halloween was pretty all right I just uh I was just hung out with um

551
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:51,120
munchie kazzie jones and uh I think that was it and uh we watched um we watched a movie called

552
01:01:51,120 --> 01:02:03,600
The Ritual that was not particularly good it was okay that's good that's nice yeah but you know what

553
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,800
it wasn't that it wasn't that spooky it didn't it didn't it didn't spook me too bad the way that

554
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:16,720
like Midsommar did so it was all right um I made gummy worms I made like halloween gummy worms but

555
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:25,440
I made like way too many of them you made like piles I mean I left them at their place so they

556
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:34,000
still have like piles yeah I made like a big bowl of them and like they already had food so like

557
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,600
you know a pretty limited amount got eaten you know oh well I just I discovered something I discovered

558
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,560
hack I was making those halloween gummies and I made a couple different flavors I made black cherry

559
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:59,440
and I made orange and then I made lime and the lime ones came out much softer and I liked I didn't

560
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,320
like them as much I like the the tougher chewier ones and the difference was and I think this is

561
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,200
what made that they had the exact same ingredients the exact same amounts of everything in them

562
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:15,120
the difference was that the black cherry and the orange I had microwaved because you have to

563
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,320
combine the ingredients and then you have to microwave them and get them hot to like melt

564
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,640
melt it all together I had microwaved those in a much bigger vessel because you put it in this

565
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,440
vessel and then you put it in the microwave and then boils and the bubbles rise to the top and then

566
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,240
you let it cool off uh the the lime ones I had cooked in a small container because I had only

567
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,880
made half as much so it had only bubbled a little bit the other ones I had made in a big

568
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,480
vessel and it bubbled a lot and I think one just cooked more water off uh and led to them being

569
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,520
denser and chewier so that made me think like damn there's really like to get like a really

570
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:58,880
consistent result you you literally have to control for like how much how much do you not not just

571
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,680
like what temperature but like how long do you do you heat it to that temperature because like the

572
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:11,280
amount of boiling makes a noticeable difference I wonder how you could like could you like um

573
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:18,800
weigh it before and after to get to to know exactly how much water is has been lost you know

574
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:26,720
you probably could yeah yeah you probably could that's uh that that's that's something that I've

575
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,480
sort of been meaning to do is like I sort of have the recipe memorized in terms of like

576
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:39,440
tablespoons I would kind of like to convert that at some point to like milligrams so that I can

577
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:46,160
have like a more precise like yeah it'd be more it's more more precise that way because a tablespoon

578
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,840
is a little bit you know you can buy different measuring tablespoons and like they're not all

579
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,760
exactly the same they're a little bit they're a little bit sloppy a little bit rough

580
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:04,320
yeah I'm getting hungry have an eating today maybe I'll go make some after this podcast is over

581
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,800
hell yeah the one thing the one thing that I still value in this world the one thing that'll never

582
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:20,160
let me down this gummies my my gummy worms will never abandon me like unlike everyone else would

583
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,480
you still love me if I turned into a gummy worm would you would you still love I would love you

584
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,280
significantly more if you were a gummy worm actually

585
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:40,080
I got Heidi Klum's worm costume I did it was pretty neat that was a crazy looks like bacon

586
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,560
looks like it's a little bit strips of bacon over the face just fucking lying on the ground talking

587
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:56,480
about it hmm you were no no I assume I'm thinking of the same thing you're thinking about like somebody

588
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,800
was interviewing her she was writhing on the floor oh I didn't see that I saw her like walking on

589
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:10,720
like the red carpet yeah yeah I saw her like dancing behind like a DJ's table this fucking worm

590
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:16,080
costume pretty great honestly yeah it was really convincing that she like

591
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,040
did the the whole like makeup around her face so that it doesn't like it doesn't feel separate

592
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm gonna say that that worm costume was really it was very much like in line with the zeitgeist

593
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:38,560
it's just like exactly what 2022 needed it was a real a real hit it fit the time so I mean good job

594
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:48,320
I'm proud of her oh um there was a uh new new got me his last page by the way

595
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:58,320
oh hell yeah yeah so um yeah news news chapter is done and I think that means that all that's

596
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:05,600
missing are that one page that I think simsie is not doing anymore so maybe I'll just maybe

597
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:11,280
maybe I'll just ask kaiju if he wants to because kaiju was asking me for more pages but I gotta

598
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,720
get on kaiju's ass because I haven't heard from him in a while he said he was gonna draw the cover

599
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:21,600
and like one other page so maybe I'll give him like another one or two on top of that

600
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,480
and then that and then that's like done yep although I see I see just today

601
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:35,120
munchy message Nate literally half an hour ago I was wondering about this too because Nate had

602
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:41,120
showed us the timeline for the project had started and I haven't heard anything from him in a month

603
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,360
yes he said he was working on a thing and now he's made a video which has just come out which I

604
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:55,440
assume is what he was working on um so he means like it was like a stream right did he make like

605
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,440
a real video he put a video on where he's talking with Sekiro footage about one piece

606
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,960
scanlation stuff hmm okay so I assume that's his project maybe it's not but well I hope you said

607
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,400
he would focus on the the OVA I mean he said he yeah I mean he said he was gonna finish what he

608
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:24,320
was working on a month and a half ago and then focus on the OVA so I don't know I mean I okay well

609
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:34,800
I guess maybe that was it and he just said that it was done but he he I whatever I hope he fucking

610
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:47,360
does it yeah we just gotta add like 40 months 50 months frustrating because because because back

611
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,440
when we initially talked about it he said oh maybe I'll have it done in six months and we were all

612
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:57,520
like it should not take six months but like I think it's like been six months yeah and he still

613
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,480
has doesn't have it done even though we all said that we should act we should accelerate the pace

614
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:10,800
faster than that maybe it hasn't maybe it hasn't been six months I think it's been no it's only been

615
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:17,680
like two or two and a half or three maybe three months since he said six months

616
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:29,120
still it's just still yeah um whatever I hope I hope Nate gets back to uh you know what I'll

617
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:34,320
I'll post a little message in there I'll agree and then I'll say yeah what's up and that will let

618
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:42,080
everyone know that I'm on the side of good and not evil hey just see that new uh is it a new

619
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:54,560
Jenny Nicholson video uh I did not what's it about it is about a weird theme park it is about the

620
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:06,080
history and the bizarre operations of a theme park called evermore uh it's pretty good I name

621
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:14,320
dropped Jenny Nicholson in the mega man lecture video and uh I hope nobody uh holds that against

622
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:20,960
me and makes fun of me for it I hope she sees this bro um I mean she probably won't

623
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:35,440
it's okay whatever it's not really it's not for her it's for mega it is it's for mega it's for

624
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:42,560
it's for my boy mega man shout out to mega man shout out to mega man gotta be gotta be one of my

625
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:50,640
favorite genders shout shout outs to reploids no it's not no it doesn't work no it doesn't work

626
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:57,600
what's a reploid I forget I think you've told me before what's a reploid um if only there's a

627
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,560
lecture I could find out if only god you you need to fucking be lectured about it for eight hours

628
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:09,920
if you don't know what a reploid is it's a reploid is um it's x is the first reploid reploids are the

629
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:18,480
robots from x series the ones with free will uh so do you know the do you know the difference

630
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:25,920
between mega man and x I do so mega man doesn't have free will no it's just being controlled

631
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:33,280
by a player character with a control let me tell let me tell you a funny story uh in mega man seven

632
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:41,200
uh there's a part where at the end you beat wily and wily's like sorry mega man looks like you

633
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:49,440
beat me and mega man says I'm sick of this I'm killing you I'm killing you right now and wily's

634
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:56,720
like what you're gonna you're I'm sorry you're gonna do what huh and uh in English in English

635
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:03,680
well wily says a robot can't kill a human and and mega man says well in in Japanese he doesn't say

636
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:11,360
anything in English he says and this is a famous line I am more than a robot die wily yes I've seen

637
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:18,000
that before yes but he doesn't shoot he doesn't shoot and uh I talk about this in the lecture

638
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:26,480
obviously but in my opinion uh his line implies that he can do it but the fact that he doesn't do

639
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,040
it means that like he's wrong like he thinks he has he thinks he can do it but he can he thinks he

640
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:38,720
can go against his programming but he can't but yeah yeah uh in Japanese he's just kind of like

641
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,400
dot dot dot which reads to me like you know frustrated acceptance that yeah wily is right I

642
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:56,320
can't do it no the robots and mega man they like they have they have personalities

643
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:03,520
and stuff they have like human intelligence but if they're programmed to do something they have to

644
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:12,720
do it and it might even be that like they have to like obey commands so it might be that like if

645
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:21,280
wily tells like if wily tells metal man like come here bow to me right now give me tribute metal

646
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:28,560
man he's like simply must immediately obey because like he can't go against the will of his uh his

647
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:37,600
creator is it the creator or is it was it just humans uh it might be it's it's sort of the thing

648
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,760
about like that like the the Isaac azimov like rules for robotics or is it different in English

649
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:50,560
wily seems to specifically be referencing the uh the Isaac azimov rules of robotics in Japanese

650
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:58,800
he's not he just kind of says that like a robot just can't disobey a human yeah it might it might

651
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:05,360
be the case that like mega man robots just simply all obey any command that a human gives them

652
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:14,320
and they can't harm humans they cannot they cannot harm humans except is dr wily allowing them to

653
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:21,520
do that that's why they're trash in the place uh there's i mean there's no there's no point in

654
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:30,400
the games where like it's like uh oh wily has made a robot that can hurt humans uh so it seems to me

655
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:39,520
that it's all of the violence is robot on robot uh yeah so all the humans are just chilling while

656
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,760
like robots are punching each other yeah yeah like they're humans are just like doing living their

657
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,960
lives or whatever and meanwhile over in the old over in the old you know car factory or whatever

658
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,800
the robots are like going going haywire like blasting each other into into molten scrap

659
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,440
and humans just like oof well if i'll just i'll just leave them to it i guess like what

660
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:09,440
cars are gonna what do i care whether like you know whether wily's like robot uprising like

661
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,880
whether he takes control of the old bean factory or not like who do i care which rich industrialist

662
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:21,200
ends up owning these uh these mech these mechanized facilities well if the mechanized facilities are

663
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:28,240
being bombed and shot with like things are going to rip in the wires out then the factory's gonna

664
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:34,800
be at a commission and i'm not gonna be able to get my latte oh no prices prices are going up

665
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:46,320
i can't believe these prices and values uh yeah i i think that like i think wily's robots they

666
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,720
they wreak havoc and they do destruction but i'm pretty sure they don't like kill people

667
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:59,040
even like gremlins in in x uh i mean reploids reploids are basically human they just don't

668
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:05,760
have like you know blood uh and like reploids die in x but humans never do like they're just

669
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:12,640
simply like aren't any humans around anywhere in in x except for dr kane he's like literally the only

670
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:23,520
one and then he stops showing up in x4 i suppose it's a smart too because like it's a it's a cutesy

671
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:30,640
looking robot series for kids mostly you can't really have humans dying a lot so you just don't

672
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:41,120
show them yeah i think they they use they use the fact that like this is a story about robots

673
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:48,880
to be like well we can have that we can have them die and and they can kill each other yeah

674
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,240
like it can be like really dramatic but for babies and and yeah but it's little kids and that makes

675
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:01,760
them cry we can get it we can get away with more with more uh grim dark violence a little bit

676
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:07,680
because like technically they're not human they don't have blood or whatever if bambi was a robot

677
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:15,520
they would actually show the bullet entering it wouldn't just be off screen oh bambi's mom i

678
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,600
should say bambi's mom was a robot but bambi's normal and then in uh and then in zero like they

679
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:29,360
just give the reploids blood anyway uh you know i didn't even mention damn it i could have mentioned

680
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,840
that as like another thing that like reploids are more are more human like in zero yeah they

681
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:42,000
literally bleed blood do they have to like add the blood from like a blood bank it might not

682
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,680
literally be blood it's just like when you slice one with your with your z saber a big like geyser

683
01:17:47,680 --> 01:18:01,520
of red fluid like spurts out it's just uh it's like chili oil um um delicious uh yeah zero has the

684
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,160
cool um anytime when you kill like anything with your z saber it like it has like a custom

685
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:10,640
sprite where like its body is like split in half and like you can sort of see it's like

686
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:18,960
red robot innards like along the like the split line and it like falls in two pieces it rules uh

687
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,600
uh

688
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:35,680
that's it that's all i got that's it watch the my fucking video please okay thanks

689
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:46,240
oh man i i don't know if i'm i hope there's no more errors in it i mean i found those errors

690
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:52,480
going through it you know adding the uh the timestamps there i mean it's possible that

691
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,800
there are some that i missed but i mean how many times can i how many times can i watch through

692
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,600
the video looking for more and more errors like it there comes a point where i just have to be like

693
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,480
i can't i can't i can double check and triple check and quadruple check but like is a quintuple

694
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:19,680
check like just too much am i is it just a diminishing returns at that point i think as

695
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:28,640
long as you can hear your voice yeah um and it you know you didn't like accidentally cut like a

696
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:35,760
five minute thing completely out and it's just black video of no no audio as long as it's like

697
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:42,800
functional as a video i don't think you need to worry too much yeah there there i had thought that

698
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,920
i had already watched it through and like noted down every error that i found and went in and

699
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,640
fixed all the errors so like i kind of i like already had double and triple checked it and then

700
01:19:52,640 --> 01:20:01,120
just in doing the uh timestamping i just discovered like oh some new error was introduced at some point

701
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,560
bummer yeah it's it's kind of a difficult thing because like if you've got like

702
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:14,800
tons of different layers and such a long timeline and you move stuff and you don't move

703
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,200
everything like every time you go in to change something there's a chance that you'll create a

704
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,200
new error that you'll not know about until you're watching it for the next time yeah and like um

705
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:30,320
i'd really i just tried to be really careful and like make sure that i was like carefully

706
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,200
selecting everything and like nothing was not getting moved and just i tried to move everything

707
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:42,560
in like as big chunks as possible to avoid like some small part getting getting knocked out of

708
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,920
whack uh i mean i think it i think it was fine it should be all right the the the worst errors

709
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,960
that i found were there were there was one little bit it only lasted like a few seconds

710
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:03,360
where like it cut to black in between cuts and there were a few times when there like a clip

711
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:10,160
would be like cut off a little bit early or a clip would fade into the next clip when it was

712
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,560
supposed to be a cut there were a handful of those and those and those are like not even

713
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,520
very concerning like you almost wouldn't even notice those if you weren't paying attention

714
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,480
so if there's a couple more of those like i don't even really care no but there's um

715
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:34,800
every every time every time that i like pause the video and i have myself play

716
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:41,280
in an audio clip where i recorded a line like clarifying something i had the flash stopper

717
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:47,120
sound effect and visual effects start playing over the footage and the problem was that for the

718
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:54,240
first like three and a half hours the the sound would play at the right time but the visual effect

719
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:58,880
would start about it would start about 10 seconds early and it would end about 10 seconds early

720
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:09,040
and it just looked i mean it just looked wrong uh yeah so i guess just like part of that one

721
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,640
layer that that one effect was on just got jostled

722
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,880
and that's how that's that's how that's how it happened probably

723
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:30,960
damn that's that's the way the cookie rumbles true damn we're only an hour we're only only an

724
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:38,560
hour and a half in and i feel like i've run out of things to say oh just like just like talking to

725
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:48,000
just like talking to john just doesn't got nothing to say of my life empty void void void void

726
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:56,560
void void um there's not even any like juicy tricksy drama to be upset about

727
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,480
damn now what what without that what do i have

728
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:11,040
yeah you gotta you gotta manufacture some yes yes

729
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,240
what devilish plan is cooking in ben sainte's head

730
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,280
what if i went to her house and lit fire to him

731
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,240

733
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,000
yeah i don't know i uh i guess i don't have too much to talk about

734
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,240
i was just i was just having a week it was very good week i was very happy

735

742
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,480
i saw you you announced the money spenders podcast and i said i think i know i think i know what's

743
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,120
yep patreon.com slash give and take

744
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:47,760
yeah uh do not do not watch the mega man lecture listen to gib's money spenders

745
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:56,320
podcast yeah you can only do one or the other yes one is like 45 minutes right but it's such a

746
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:10,160
roller coaster i haven't listened to it actually um buh yeah it's it's uh it's um yeah you know it's uh

747
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,760
i don't know i don't know how to approach the subject on the pcp uh i guess i i yeah i get you

748
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,880
yeah it's private it's private and that's why it's on the money spenders podcast go there if you

749
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:29,200
want to learn about that um not a great pitch because you no idea what it is but that's fine

750
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:38,000
yeah i mean it seems reasonable to me um well i'm trying to scrape the bottom of the barrel

751
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:44,240
of any uh thoughts that i had this week or uh new new shit going on and there's just not

752
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:51,680
anything yeah the biggest thing has been elon and the twitter stuff yeah which i have kind of

753
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,720
i have not been posting much on twitter and i think i should keep it that way

754
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,000
uh i will i will post a um oh um a teaser announcement when the when the lecture is

755
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,680
out i will i will make a little post about that but other than that i don't really want to be

756
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:18,240
on there much anymore uh inscription soli got me inscription as well who did so uh soli i think

757
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:25,920
solis oh solaru solaru there's many names they go by right right right um

758
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,800
yeah i played that for a bit i don't think i don't think i have gotten to

759
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:40,880
like the big twist but i've died twice and i think i get the gist um there's there's like

760
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:46,640
room to talk about it i would love to hear how far you've gotten and what you think about it

761
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:58,560
well um i i enjoyed my first run i felt like i was pretty smart um using the using the things

762
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:07,280
getting the getting the wins dodging the bad things and i died it's like you know you you

763
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:13,120
you have little animals and they do damage and i have health and you can block enemies

764
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,240
and some of the enemies can fly over you and hit your life points like in yugio

765
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:26,480
well it's more like magically gathering it's more like everything yeah

766
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:35,280
and i'm like okay cool you have you have to sacrifice your little little guys to

767
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:42,560
to get blood that you use to put down a big guy there's a wolf he has two blood

768
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,920
and so uh the the the thing of like drawing from your hands your deck or getting a squirrel

769
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:58,480
which costs nothing to put down but can be sacrificed to get one blood is sort of like

770
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:03,120
it's a that's a that's a cool choice that's a cool dynamic because like you're guaranteed

771
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:07,840
something or if you get a secret mystery prize that you already know what it could be

772
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:16,000
yeah and you build your deck as you go yeah yeah uh there's items and things and it's like the

773
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
squirrel can this this like do you need to pay for something well then you got to get the squirrel

774
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,960
but like what if you the stuff in your hand is too expensive maybe you'd be better off drawing for

775
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:34,000
like a less expensive creature card like something that costs one yeah or maybe you just need a

776
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:40,000
chump blocker maybe you just need a squirrel for a chump to block and attack this round or something

777
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,920
and you might as well just use a squirrel for that because you don't want to sacrifice like a real

778
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:56,880
creature yeah yeah so yeah um it's got a nice level of of uh our consideration thought process

779
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:01,920
what's the word i'm looking for you have to think a bit and it's not totally down to what card you

780
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:07,200
draw you before you draw a card you make a choice and i like that yeah um

781
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:17,840
strategy strategy uh and then i got to the angler i beat the first uh first boss on my first try

782
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:25,600
and i was like hell yeah prospector mule got him uh i got all the way to the angler and then i didn't

783
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:35,520
really have any good cards and i died and then okay then the guys he grabbed me and i know that you

784
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,640
could i knew that you could get up off the table and walk around a bit and there's like yeah there's

785
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:46,240
like puzzle you hadn't really done that i had done that because he asked you to get the candlestick

786
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:53,440
or something wait wait that was your first run you made it to the angler yeah hmm i enjoyed

787
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,080
further than i made it yeah i felt like i was doing pretty well because after the first boss he

788
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:07,040
gives you two health i think i'd lost one health um or one life yeah and uh yeah he restores your uh

789
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:13,040
your candles yeah so that was fun he makes you go and like get the candle off the the the table

790
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:19,200
right he's like go get yeah go get the candle you can walk around and i saw that there was a

791
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,840
clock you could fiddle with i saw there was a globe that you could spin other little things you

792
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:30,960
could click on couldn't do much but i'm like okay so there's puzzles here um yes and then i lost at

793
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:37,360
the angler and he dragged me away and this is the first death so it's like it's not too much of a

794
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:43,120
spoiler but he takes out a camera he takes your picture or before that he asked you to make a card

795
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:50,560
your own death card mm-hmm and so based on the cards you've picked up you have to choose like the

796
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:58,800
cost and the power and lucky for me i managed to get like a zero cost um and like two three

797
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:06,000
because i had the wolf so zero cost two three um what what was the zero cost uh i think it was

798
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:13,120
zero cost card the zero cost was i think i can't remember what it was maybe it was the geck

799
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:18,400
some it was something that's really small that i could use as the cost of the thing

800
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:25,840
the yeah it might have been the geck the geck is a is a free card yeah so and then it says

801
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:32,000
write your name it's like okay it's gib and so i became a card he took my picture and i found

802
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,320
my card in the next playthrough and he's he talks to you like you're someone else so i'm like okay i

803
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:44,400
see how it is uh you play the game and if you lose you become a card and some of the other cards

804
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:50,320
talk to you so they presumably have lost the game before and they're trapped you mean um is it is it

805
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:57,200
stote stote and uh the stote so the author and and the stink bug there's the two i found i found

806
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:01,600
the stink bug you know you know in the safe because i figured out you can look in the book

807
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:08,560
you see the safe thing it's like oh hell right right yeah so i'm like that's that's basically

808
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:16,320
where i am i died again okay and i don't remember what else happened you just took my picture again

809
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,600
but then there was a new thing there was totems and there was bones and i'm like okay you're adding

810
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,840
new gameplay mechanics every time i die so i guess i have to die a lot or something oh right

811
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:35,360
yeah it doesn't you start out not knowing about bones yep so uh yeah i guess i i just sort of

812
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:45,520
have to play a lot what the what the what totem did you get i got a squirrel and it did you find it

813
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:51,920
on a on a table or something i don't remember i did the thing where you go to the little

814
01:32:52,720 --> 01:33:00,320
cabinet and you do that puzzle where you have to like make the thing the counter go to five

815
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:06,480
and then you can open the drawer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i figured all those out and i was like

816
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:13,200
i'm smart yeah and i got all the things from the drawer and uh i don't think i

817
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,600
i think after my second death he says now you will create your own totem

818
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:27,280
choose the face of the totem uh or something and i made a squirrel that turns when the squirrel dies

819
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:34,480
it turns into a bee and it goes into my hand i was like okay oh the beehive you gave it the

820
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:40,960
beehive sigil yeah i think i see which was a bad idea because i want to sacrifice squirrels but if

821
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,440
you sacrifice them they don't turn into bees they have to die so that was the stupidest it's yeah

822
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:50,800
yeah the the bee the bee happens when they get hit yeah not when they die so yeah that's actually a

823
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,400
pretty that's actually pretty bad synergy although it it would be good if it made a bee when they died

824
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:04,800
yes um yeah so that i think i stopped there because i was like a little tired um i do want to play

825
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:13,440
more i do want to find out like like more of a story because like inscription it's like he's

826
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:22,000
inscribing your name onto the cards and it's like i i noticed that you cannot as far as i know

827
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,880
you open up the game there's a guy who says okay let's see what this is all about and it's like

828
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,880
playing on a crt screen some guy's voice so somebody you're playing a game wherein somebody's

829
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:40,080
playing a game diegetically and you can't click new game you can only click continue game even though

830
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:46,800
it is the beginning and there is no like that you click that really that really like frustrated me

831
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,720
at the start it's like why is the i should have been more obvious that like okay this is sort of

832
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:58,720
meant to be this way but yeah i was a little i was a little confused wrong here like i did think

833
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:07,200
something was wrong i asked uh i asked steve and he said uh no that's normal so i'm okay so i'm like

834
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:19,760
yeah you can get you can make some busted busted death cards yeah i i think the i don't know yet

835
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:26,320
because i haven't played through my second life whether or not both of my death cards are like

836
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:32,720
attainable maybe it's just the most the the most recent one um but like they're all they're all

837
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:38,240
floating around okay they all stick around okay so that's yeah so like the better cards you get

838
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:46,000
the more more powerful you can make some of them with the the sacrificing and the and the putting

839
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,080
around the campfire and stuff um like the more powerful cards you might have at the end that

840
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:59,520
you can attribute to your death card and then that can be as a useful progress for later you

841
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:06,160
can build up an advantage over time over deaths so i'm like okay that's that's neat i suppose

842
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:12,720
yeah i managed i think on like one of my first runs i managed to make like like a free basically

843
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:18,880
like a free grizzly bear or something like a free four six and it's that's just yeah that's just so

844
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:26,000
busted it's so busted but the annoying thing is that it's also a card game so yeah you might not

845
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,920
pick it up before you die and i'm like well yeah i still i still lost i still lost even though uh

846
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,080
even though i had that card available because like you know it might not be available at the right

847
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:50,560
time i had i lost a lot on the on the the the the thing after the uh the angler uh me personally

848
01:36:50,800 --> 01:37:01,200
so uh i i just didn't um the the ang the angler is a little the angler is a little tough although

849
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:08,480
what did you did you lose on the angler i did yeah okay so i there's there's sort of a way to kind

850
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:14,800
of solve him yeah i mean i i think i figured it out i think the second time i died was again at

851
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:22,000
the angler and i'm like okay so he's gonna take one card every so often i have to and whenever i

852
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,760
put a card down he changes to that card so as long as i can put down a card that becomes useless on

853
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,040
his side of the board that'll fill up his side of the board with useless cards but then i will need

854
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:38,960
to fight through them in order to hit them so i probably need a bird and i didn't have a bird at

855
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:47,280
time and also fliers are helpful against the angler definitely and so i'm like okay my i don't

856
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:52,080
have a good deck but also i don't have anything to defend myself and i can't really play anything

857
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:57,200
because i had two like my my hand was full of things that were too expensive so i had to

858
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:03,440
keep drawing squirrels and i just lost so i might fuck it and my deck is bad and i hate roguelikes

859
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:11,520
i'm i'm a little disappointed that uh you have not made it further because there are

860
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:22,800
just quite a few things that i can't mention uh but uh so i'm trying limiting limiting myself

861
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:29,600
to non non spoiler talk is a bit is a bit tricky uh but i mean you know you want to you've been

862
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:35,360
playing like the actual like card game card game yeah and like it's good it's a good uh

863
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:43,040
it's a good game the to the totems can be really uh at some point i got a um

864
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,400
you know like the the three blood drops you ever had the you ever had the goat

865
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:56,400
i i want i got the goat in my deck and i never he never appeared i never got him i got a um yeah

866
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:01,360
i got that three blood sigil on my squirrel so all my squirrels sacked for three blood

867
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:08,720
oh my god that's that was really good the the best one i think is um have you found the cockroach

868
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:16,400
i think so i didn't i don't think i chose him when i saw him the cockroach is he's all right

869
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:22,160
his sigil is really good if you can get him on on another creature uh the one that's just like

870
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:27,600
when it dies it comes back to your hand uh if you could like if you can get that on your squirrels

871
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:34,160
like you just you just win uh because like it means you can just you can just reuse your squirrels

872
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:40,720
and oh yeah well then you'd also need to make sure you have like high blood cost powerful beasts

873
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:48,080
available to you actually put down yeah i mean preferably also um field mice give us i don't know

874
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:53,440
what the sigil is called but field mice gives a similar sigil that's like when you play it a copy

875
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:58,720
of it appears in your hand which basically turns all your squirrels into two squirrels uh which is

876
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:06,480
pretty good um have you uh have you i don't know have you found any any cards with sigils that you

877
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:17,120
particularly like um i don't know yet it's uh i like the one i guess i like the one where if you

878
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:22,960
sacrifice the little black cat you get near the beginning oh the cat yeah you sacrifice it he comes

879
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:31,600
back and so you can put him again the sacrifice uh one is that sigil is really good uh the best

880
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:37,360
thing is to is to sack the cat to another card to get it on like a better card that actually

881
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:43,600
does something yeah i think i did that the first time i like or maybe the second time i was like um

882
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:52,720
um confronted with the uh sacrifice combined cards thing um i'm like wait if i put this thing

883
01:40:53,360 --> 01:41:00,960
on this thing the this thing then then it's just a straight upgrade because the thing i think i put

884
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:07,280
it on the geek the geek i think oh that's good something that costs zero and then it can come

885
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,720
back actually yeah that's really good because then you don't even have to pay to play it yeah

886
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:16,640
so i play it and i can kill it i can play it and kill it and play and kill it even just even

887
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:22,480
just putting it on like the stote or the toad is like um it's still good because like then instead

888
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:30,400
of like wasting a space of your board to just have like a sacrificeable cat uh you you actually it's

889
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:34,800
it's on like a it's the same cost because it's one blood and but also it's a creature that is

890
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:43,840
actually like doing something um yeah i have not i've put cards on the fire near the camp fire

891
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:51,360
i have not once had my card get eaten but it's always implied that they want to do that and

892
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:56,720
they almost do it but then i leave can that happen or is that just a they're like a bait and like

893
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:04,000
like a scary thing i i never had it happen to me like during the main game in like the in like the

894
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,800
post game challenge modes i have had it happen so it can happen i don't i don't exactly know how

895
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:18,080
likely it is did know there was a post game yeah there's like yeah there's like challenge modes

896
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:25,600
like you start with a specific deck you gotta win yeah there's different starting decks the rules

897
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:31,760
work a little bit differently like um you can only you can only use the fire twice you can't

898
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:38,000
i think you can use it up to like four times uh but i mean it's it's risky every time in the main

899
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,840
game there's like different uh there's different cards available uh some of the numbers are tweaked

900
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:52,000
it's called it's called kasey's mod is the the challenge modes um have you found uh have you

901
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:59,840
used like a mantis or a mantis god i i think on my third life this says choose your favorite

902
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:09,040
uh team and i chose bug and i got a mantis um i like i've seen mantis is used um you text left

903
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:15,840
to right yeah i didn't really get a chance to play with it though i think that's when i start

904
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:23,280
all my third life i was like okay well uh this isn't going well immediately because i chose

905
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,120
a bad thing for my squirrel so my totem is kind of useless

906
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:37,760
i um at some point at some point i realized the game like kind of mentions this too at

907
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:44,560
at certain points uh sometimes you want less cards some sometimes you want like there's one

908
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,320
that lets you sacrifice a card to like the lord of bones and there's one and the ones that and

909
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,720
the ones that combine two different cards into one sometimes you want to go for those

910
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,240
i mean because the combo can be good but also just because it like means less cards

911
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:05,440
so yeah less you can like get your weaker cards to just like you know you don't you don't have

912
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:09,760
them anymore because like you don't want to draw them yeah that is a thing there's only so much

913
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:15,760
space on the board and one card per turns like sometimes you just get three things that you

914
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,840
can't play like if you're like if you're if you're getting to like the end game and you

915
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,520
still have like an unupgraded like stote and toad like you don't even want to be like wasting

916
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:33,120
turns like spending a blood to play a freaking one two yeah they're just they're just gonna outpace

917
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:43,920
you like that a freaking one two give me a break uh well i will be uh i'll ask you more about it

918
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:52,160
later when you've uh when you've uh made a little more progress and uh maybe i uncovered some stuff

919
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,080
is it gonna be a skeleton so you're gonna be a skeleton at close

920
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:05,760
i'm not telling i'm not telling if there's a skeleton is the crazy guy who's you're playing

921
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,960
with is is it actually a mirror and you're playing with yourself

922
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:19,760
imagine imagine not knowing who that guy is imagine i can't it's five nights at freddy's

923
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:27,680
purple guy it is very it is very five nights at freddy's looking five nights freddy's looking

924
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:36,880
ass looking ass room i do i do like um the when he talks that low like crackly noise

925
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,880
so that's a good noise sound effect

926
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:50,960
the third boss has a has a like music that is like ingrained into my mind forever

927
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:55,120
because i heard it so much because i died so many times

928
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,680
i lost i lost a lot actually i died a lot of times uh

929
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:12,880
man have you uh you probably have not played any ant cards right i i think i got an ant queen

930
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:18,960
and an ant oh at some point and i put them down but i don't think i won well i think they didn't

931
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,920
really do anything i i didn't have like because i could tell what you want is to have

932
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:31,120
many ants uh to bolster all the other ants and the end of the one i think

933
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:38,000
in in kasey's mod one of the starting decks you unlock is like an ant deck and it's it's but

934
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,160
it's busted it's op it's like way too good i think it i think it starts you with like an ant queen

935
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:51,760
and an ant queen and a flying ant and like with just those cards like you play you play the ant queen

936
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,920
you get another ant in your hand or like yeah first and then you play the and then you play

937
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,360
the new the worker ants and the flying ant and suddenly you've got you've got three three power

938
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:11,360
cards on your side and you just win uh it's good i like i like ants

939
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:21,120
all right sick yep sick sick sick sick sick um we'll have to we'll have to

940
01:47:21,120 --> 01:47:29,760
resume our inscription discussion later uh what do you think about voicemails uh yeah let's let's

941
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:41,200
voice let's let's voice um it looks like the first one is an it's two imager links or no

942
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:55,920
it's two of the same imager link for some reason uh it's ben saint bald arc at let'sgo.com breaking

943
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:01,040
rad wait i saw this somewhere i mean it looks good this is looks very good

944
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:09,680
cheesy with a cheesy what the fuck are you talking about that's really good uh this is awesome

945
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:18,080
mess gummy you're in your underwear with the gun the iconic i mean that is

946
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:26,240
is that's a look that i would have in real life i like it i like this a lot it's very

947
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:34,400
nice yeah thank you uh next one is called pedantic acronyms bullshit three two one go

948
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,640
so i just realized there's this big double standard on the accepted pronunciations for jiff

949
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:46,480
and imager like people will say well jib is supposed to be there with a hard g because the g stands

950
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:52,000
for graphics and not geraptics except that's just not how acronyms work because otherwise scuba

951
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,800
would be pronounced scuba since the u stands for underwater or they'll say well it's because g words

952
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:05,600
like gift and girl have a hard g never mind that you know giraffe in other words probably exist

953
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,040
and not to mention like what the fuck kind of word would be spelled with a g u but it's pronounced

954
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,440
g like how we do with imager anyway i think i can say that i settled this debate forever

955
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:26,160
and if you disagree with me then uh suck it losers solved solved uh doesn't doesn't the creator

956
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:32,000
of the jiff format say jiff i think he does i still say gift because i'm used to it and i don't

957
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,680
care it looks it looks like gift to me so i just i say gift yeah i think there there's an argument

958
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:44,960
that because it looks so similar to the word gift is just missing a t and giraffe is a little further

959
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:52,800
away from from what it looks like that saying gift is excusable at the very least it understandable

960
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,800
like assumption to make i mean why why does the guy that made the acronym get to decide how it's

961
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:08,720
pronounced uh he doesn't what who gave who gave yeah exactly exactly i don't know it just looks

962
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:16,480
just looks like gift to me and uh to imager is obviously meant to be derivative of the word

963
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:23,040
image therefore i say imager i don't say imager i did not know scuba was an acronym you didn't

964
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,360
know did did you know laser is an acronym i didn't know that i don't know what it stands for

965
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:40,640
yes well i remember that the u stands for underwater something underwater being

966
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:51,600
uh wait no something okay okay uh forget it technically technically the word scuba is not

967
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:57,840
an acronym but it comes from the acronym for yeah self yeah self-contained underwater breathing

968
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:04,320
apparatus but you don't write it with like all caps you just write the word scuba yeah

969
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:11,920
capitalized normally it has become word yeah pretty much pretty much gives weekly reminder

970
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:19,840
to watch squat cobbler i already forgot what that is isn't it like uh isn't it just like a pie that

971
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:30,320
you sit on squat cobbler better call soul is that is that a spoiler i haven't seen i've only

972
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:39,440
watched the first series of better call soul oh right oh i remember it's just yes it's from a scene

973
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:46,720
in in better call sol i don't know this um i'll get there you know i should i think i've got to

974
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:53,920
watch the last i still haven't watched like the last two seasons but why what if what if what if i feel

975
01:51:53,920 --> 01:52:03,680
something it'd be embarrassing that would be so embarrassing if i cared um you got caught red-handed

976
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:11,520
showing feelings next one is called lemau nate got a video out before you ben get right yeah a video

977
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,920
that he fucking spent like six months working on instead of doing the ova i don't care uh next one

978
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:28,320
is called am late on the episodes three two one go he's the paladin aesthetic moral rowdy or

979
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,880
killer thing paladin

980
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:40,080
uh obviously it's killer killers are holy warriors for god

981
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:47,360
but they're evil they're evil holy yeah yeah they're opposite of a paladin a paladin would

982
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:52,160
have arrived in a new los angeles city and would be disgusted about everything you see is and would

983
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:57,520
want to to cleanse it just like they're blaggards they're blaggards who think they're paladins

984
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:05,680
and they're right yeah i guess i guess i guess if if there's like a an aesthetic similarity it would

985
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:11,920
be more killer than rowdy rowdy would be like the drunken barthog in in a dnd campaign the the the

986
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:20,960
barred more so than the paladin a barred or a barbarian yeah definitely the pinkie pie of the

987
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:27,200
group definitely killer definitely killer uh next one is called cave three two one go

988
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:35,040
have you seen man cave man in cave no usually cave empty

989
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:44,880
have you seen caven man he's the new boss in mega man mega man 12 caven man he makes the

990
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:51,600
roof fall on top of here and there's no way to escape no he just he brings the whole house

991
01:53:51,600 --> 01:54:01,040
down on top of both of you uh the next one is uh it's a youtube link but i do say please weigh in

992
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:05,600
so maybe it's weigh in all right let's let's let's see what it is at least there's a question

993
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:11,440
which main six is the most thick okay i'm not gonna watch this on the podcast but i'm not

994
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:18,880
gonna watch a video from quantum hypologists why the most the most thick is um i would say pink

995
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:26,560
oh my god i'm scrubbing through this number is involved this algebra wait really this data

996
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:35,440
collection this is funny this is probably funny um i would say it's a toss up between apple jack and

997
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:42,000
fluttershy i think apple jack just because of her leg when you when you think of thick

998
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:49,600
usually think thigh bigness and apple jack is usually portrayed as having a huge ass because

999
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:54,960
of all the bucking she does well i think it's pinky pie because she's black

1000
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:02,800
she's got because she's got because she's got curly hair she's got type type four hair or whatever

1001
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,680
also could she eat also yeah i've seen like an i've seen like an index for like

1002
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:15,520
curt like curliness of the hair she's she's she's into she's into the black hair territory i would

1003
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:22,240
say text texturally but more importantly she just eats a lot of cakes at sugar cube corner

1004
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:27,360
she's always yeah but i would always eat in confections i would always say that makes her like

1005
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:35,760
like more fat in the belly than in the thighs necessarily it's both you could argue it's both

1006
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,320
i would yeah i would say pinky pie is close i would say apple jack is the thickest

1007
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:46,720
actually no hmm she's she's more lean she would be more lean because she exercises more i i think

1008
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:50,640
she would i think she would be more lean i mean she would be more lean she'd be kind of musculine

1009
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:55,120
but big big and muscular but still lean i guess pinky pie is pretty good of a choice

1010
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,800
i could see fluttershy but i think it's i think it's pinky

1011
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:08,880
yeah that's my pick though yeah you know i i'll say pinky pie as well oh my god

1012
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:14,720
sorry this is not relevant to anything but i just see uh two days ago the real gyms uploaded a video

1013
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:22,080
called the simpsons versus death note so that's oh yeah wasn't there like a simpsons episode that

1014
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:29,120
was a death note parody or did i imagine that what there's like a simpsons episode where lisa

1015
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:35,920
gets a fake death note that's that makes something else happen but it's like drawn in an anime style

1016
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:43,280
that looks awful i hate it it looks very strange i don't like it at all

1017
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:52,240
uh i don't like when the simpsons does things that are too wacky i come to the i come to a

1018
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:56,800
franchise show for a familiar experience and by that i mean i don't because i don't watch the

1019
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:03,440
simpsons anymore i don't want to see that it's just hideous hideous yes they they should have

1020
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:11,840
stopped to miss the sparkle absolutely next one is if tom comes back will you redo the intro um

1021
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:18,800
no redo the intro as in like the music yeah i think that's what they mean

1022
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:24,480
just have a little bit of tom speaking over maybe if he made a new intro

1023
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:31,840
be like okay i can accept a change but i'm not gonna go out of my way to like make a whole new

1024
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:35,280
intro just because tom showed up for an episode

1025
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:41,760
that's my answer did you see tom's a furry now did we talk about that already

1026
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,920
what do you mean now he's been working on his movie for years he's out he's out of the closet oh my

1027
01:57:49,920 --> 01:58:00,160
god i didn't even know he was in well he well he's a he's an owl his son is an owl i didn't see that

1028
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:06,320
which i guess i see it i wasn't i was a bit surprised that it wouldn't be a raccoon but sure

1029
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:13,920
okay owl is fine i guess furry is when you have an oc uh when you have a son i mean furry is when

1030
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:22,160
you have an oc yeah um next one is ben's weekly reminder played yelp delta room chapter two

1031
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:27,520
okay ben's weekly reminder catch up on one piece okay no spoilers favorite character in

1032
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:33,760
description and fave card i mean if it's no spoilers then that's pretty pretty tough

1033
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:44,240
i don't really have a fave yet i i guess i i guess i like the the drawing of that like

1034
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:50,880
pathetic little guy that grows bigger i don't i don't think i've used the drawing of the drawing

1035
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:56,080
of the pathetic little guy that grows bigger it's like uh when you can choose a card from a boss

1036
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:00,000
there's like oh there's geck there's something else and then there's the little guy

1037
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,600
that has the uh sigil that makes him grow after one turn oh he looks like he's like in a family

1038
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:10,400
guy death pose and he's like so pathetic looking and i forget what it's called wait are you talking

1039
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:16,880
about like the uh like the useless insect yeah something useless he's called like a useless

1040
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:24,640
little guy or no wait i don't know i can't remember i think i think you're talking about the the

1041
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:29,200
the useless insect or the or the pathetic insect or whatever it's called which i have like never

1042
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:35,600
successful i have like literally never successfully used that card i think maybe one time yeah i just

1043
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:43,120
like the way it looks it's funny but i never chose a good favorite card yeah i think my favorite

1044
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:55,360
card would have to be i do really like the cat i like the sack sigil a lot um i actually really

1045
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:01,760
like i really like the cockroach and field mice because they their sigils i put their sigil on

1046
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:12,400
something else to just get like lots of reuse out of things um what's what's what's one card that

1047
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:19,440
when i find it i'm like fuck yeah game game over i've won i like my own death card because that

1048
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:26,880
was cool oh you know i like corpse maggots the um it's it's probably not as good as like undying

1049
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:32,240
or whatever the cockroach is called but the one that like when a creature dies the card with the

1050
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:36,800
sigil comes into play immediately that one's actually really good you put that on a really

1051
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:43,200
expensive card and you can just get like a real good card on the board for free i like that one a

1052
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:51,760
lot uh yeah that's that's my answer i can't i can't answer a favorite character without spoiling it i'm

1053
02:00:51,760 --> 02:01:01,680
sorry um next one is called regi drako is made out of crystallized dragon energy hmm yeah make

1054
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,200
sense no it doesn't that's what no that makes perfect sense of course it's crystallized dragon

1055
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:16,080
energy i mean define dragon energy though like what is well you know it's like it's like when a dragon

1056
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:23,920
does something it uses dragon energy to do it like what separates a dragon from a bear or a

1057
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:31,600
lizard or a fucking anything are they are they mythical but they're not like mythical legendaries

1058
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:37,600
they're just a mythical being that they come from space what is so special about fucking dragons

1059
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:43,120
they're just a special kind of guy just like bugs just like bugs are just guys but they're like a

1060
02:01:43,120 --> 02:01:48,560
particular special kind of guy with special energy i would love to see a red bug energy

1061
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:55,360
bug a redgy bug that's made of crystallized bug energy honestly yeah why not uh it's like

1062
02:01:55,360 --> 02:02:02,000
you know it's just like that episode of the power rangers where they cloned the pink ranger

1063
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:07,840
and zordon had to be like we have to put a stop to this too much pink energy is dangerous

1064
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:13,200
there's going to be a freaking like nuclear meltdown if we don't like pair these these pink

1065
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:17,920
rangers down to one well it's the same with dragon energy like too much dragon energy is dangerous

1066
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:23,920
so you have to crystallize it to stabilize it and that's regi draco of course just you just

1067
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:30,160
plug like a little you get you get like little alligator teeth like wires and you clip them to

1068
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:38,160
a dragon tooth you can power your generator with it mm-hmm mm-hmm that's right dragon energy uh

1069
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,960
dragons in series dragons in parallel

1070
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:56,400
what time isn't it it's 12 20 i woke up early time i like woke up before i was i was supposed to

1071
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:02,000
woke up because like an hour before my alarm went off and i couldn't go back to sleep

1072
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:10,080

1075
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:32,000
fr 3 2 1 go okay guys and all of this blabbering

1076
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:41,040
either talk about weed or let's move on to the voicemail we are listening to a voicemail

1077
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:47,680
dear you are a voicemail we're in the voicemails because uh you we have a damn mind

1078
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:55,520
out of your damn mind we would never talk about weed we don't do weed i mean except that one time

1079
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:00,800
i don't do weed everybody else does weed and i just i'm just not i'm just not that big a fan

1080
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:05,360
i've just come to i've just come to accept that i'm just not that big a fan and people say no no

1081
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:09,920
you just didn't do it right no no you just didn't you just haven't tried it enough i'm like no i've

1082
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:20,400
tried it enough no i know what it's like no i'm i'm good i i have enjoyed weed but i think it's a

1083
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:29,200
little uh it's a little hit and miss whether it's like the right dosage and it gets me exactly

1084
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:35,600
how i want whereas with alcohol um it's all the right you know that the right dosage is always

1085
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:47,040
more wow it's it's it's that it's that i can have like an entire beer and um that is it's more mass

1086
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:54,480
per like um inebriation so like you don't really have to think too hard about it you can just

1087
02:04:55,600 --> 02:05:02,560
drink and like it's it's like judge later it's it's the the stopping at the exact right moment

1088
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:10,000
is a lot easier with alcohol because you feel it quite quickly with weed you take um whatever

1089
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:17,200
however you take the weed and then over a longer period of time then you slowly realize that you

1090
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:24,800
took one too many of the thingies and it's like well now i'm just stuck like this that sucks i

1091
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:31,200
wish i would have known a little earlier how much weed was just right um obviously over time you'd

1092
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:37,440
get a sense of it but like with alcohol you can just stop a beer halfway if you're feeling too much

1093
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:43,920
uh yeah i mean beer you kind of have the same i mean you can you can end up drinking too much

1094
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,480
they're not even it they're not equivalent experiences either i'm i'm just saying that i

1095
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:54,000
feel like i'm more in control of having fun with alcohol when you're taken like an edible you pretty

1096
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:00,320
much have to decide completely ahead of time like how much am i gonna take i'm gonna i'm gonna

1097
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:06,000
commit to an amount like right now yeah and i mean you can't you can take more later if you want

1098
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:14,880
uh no i get no i get you i get you make sense um next one is called ben we all knew it was

1099
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:22,800
a mega man lecture lamal three two one go okay there's no audio uh no you didn't i mean maybe you

1100
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:28,560
did i will admit i think people could have guessed because you were talking about doing a big video

1101
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:33,680
yeah and certain things were ruled out and also you were talking about you were you played mega

1102
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:42,880
man on stream a little bit yeah some people did guess it and that's fine but not everyone did and

1103
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:50,960
i saw and i saw other guesses uh that were not right so not everyone not everybody knew not

1104
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:56,320
everyone and even the one and even the ones that did know that guessed it right they still had they

1105
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:01,920
had to doubt they had to doubt themselves and that was the point the point was not that like

1106
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:07,840
no one can know that i'm making a mega man video the point is um but they don't know for sure

1107
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:16,640
they'll never they'll never know for sure until i tell them um next one is called vvv

tweeting with your butt out. Gross. Welcome to Ben St's Mega Man comprehensive

1119
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:52,760
lecture. We will be going into why you should care about Mega Man at all. Mega Man was a

1120
02:08:52,760 --> 02:09:01,440
video game character. You know, one thing that was missing from my lecture was

1121
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:09,080
drawings on the board and diagrams. And then in Saab, Mega Man 04, I'm sorry. It's

1122
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:13,000
so crippling and depressing. I cry every time I get into this game. The next five

1123
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:19,240
minutes of the video is going to be crying uninterrupted. Hey, the end of

1124
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:26,440
Mega Man 04 is wicked good and wicked cool and it's wicked sad and it rules. Man.

1125
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:36,520
I hope you wore this sort of outfit. I unfortunately did not really have like a

1126
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:43,920
costume or anything. I wish I had. I just wore my freaking plane going by. I just

1127
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:51,520
wore my purple suit with the Lord of Ghost pin. Yes. Yes, and I had my rip in

1128
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:58,200
that ghost. Rip in the ghost and I had my Z Saber. Of course. I had my Z Saber and I

1129
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:07,360
had my little energy tank sippy cup that I was drinking gridlock energy out of. So, you

1130
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:14,120
know, I did a little something, something. The idea of using a Mega Man arm cannon as

1131
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:21,120
a laser pointer. Would have been pretty cool. Would have been rather difficult.

1132
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:29,400
Rather difficult. Did you know that Mega Man's Mega Buster does like suck back into

1133
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:34,560
his arm when he's not using it? And he can in fact turn either of his arms into a

1134
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:39,840
Mega Buster whenever he wants. But he can't fire them both at once because it

1135
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:45,920
would take too much energy from his solar core. On the other hand, Protoman has a

1136
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,760
Mega Buster, but he can't transform it back into his arm. He must have to like

1137
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:56,560
unscrew it and put like an arm, a hand like attachment on his arm when he doesn't

1138
02:10:56,560 --> 02:11:03,840
want to be shooting stuff with his protobuster. So now you know. I didn't even

1139
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,000
mention that in the lecture because it's not because it's not really cannon in

1140
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,920
the games. You talk about the similarities to Astro Boy because the idea of the

1141
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:18,520
cannon going back into his arm reminds me that. I do not mention Astro Boy even

1142
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:23,480
once. Dang. That's the only little robot guy I know.

1143
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,400
Well, now you'll know some more.

1144
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:35,640
We all do a fucking lecture about Astro Boy. Do it. Do it. Content for the

1145
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:39,160
content mill. My God. Content.

1146
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:45,880
I guess that's it. That's the last voicemail.

1147
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,280
Yeah. Well, pleasure doing business with you.

1148
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:00,160
Oh, I see an Imgur link to a Bo Burnham saying something that I agree with.

1149
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:03,880
That's fucked up. Oh, Burnham is often saying that.

1150
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:06,720
Things I don't know. I still have not seen inside.

1151
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:09,040
It's pretty great.

1152
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:13,120
Right. Yeah, I've heard all of his specials are really good.

1153
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:17,480
Yeah. I watched the previous ones.

1154
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:19,560
I haven't seen inside.

1155
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:26,000
That's all I got. That's all I got today.

1156
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:27,520
Audience.

1157
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,760
She's got nothing.

1158
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:35,680
What did I manage to only talk for that? Did we even make it to two hours?

1159
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:37,880
Yeah, we did. Pathetic.

1160
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,560
Pathetic.

1161
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:43,160
Remember when the PCP used to be like an hour and a half?

1162
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:45,720
I honestly don't.

1163
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:52,040
Because it was like a larger cost and we went for so much less time.

1164
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:58,600
I feel like sometimes I would be on the podcast and have like an interjection.

1165
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:02,680
And that's it. That's the only thing I did in the entire thing and I was over.

1166
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,520
Yeah, they were short. The old episodes, they would be like an hour 20 sometimes.

1167
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,560
Like it's fucked up.

1168
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,440
That's not content. That's that's not even.

1169
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:17,280
That's nothing. That's that's a puff of air.

1170
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:25,280
All I got to say. Yeah, I mean, I feel like we've got nothing to say.

1171
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,440
I got nothing to say. All I got to say is watch it worse.

1172
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:31,600
Watch my stupid Mega Man video. Yeah.

1173
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:37,000
And pledge to my Patreon if you want to send me the message that this is what

1174
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,200
you need. This is what you need to be doing, Ben.

1175
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:45,280
If you want to be a YouTuber as like someone that makes content as like a

1176
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:48,920
a form of income as a living, this is a this is the response.

1177
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:52,400
I need to see that I need to see that the I need to see that the support is there.

1178
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:58,400
And if I do and if and if it's and if it does well and it makes a little money,

1179
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,200
then I'll be like, OK, well, I'll have to plan the next one.

1180
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:05,760
And if it fails and if nobody pledges, then I will probably just disappear

1181
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,720
in a puff of smoke and never be heard from again.

1182
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:13,720
I'm sorry. I'm I'm not trying to hold anything hostage,

1183
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:16,760
but like that's that's the reality of the situation.

1184
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:20,400
If it doesn't work, I'm going to stop doing it. So there you go.

1185
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,840
I got some phlegm.

1186
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,680
I got some phlegm. Oh, it's the Kovacab.

1187
02:14:27,680 --> 02:14:29,880
Coughing up some of that inflamed heart tissue.

1188
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,960
Gross, gross, hideous.

1189
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:37,280
All right, I'm going to go make some gummy worms.

1190
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:39,080
Yeah, let's end the podcast.

1191
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:40,520
I'm not going to do that.

1192
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:44,200
I also remember to commission me if you feel like having a drawing.

1193
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,800
Oh, yes, that I made.

1194
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:48,720
I'm pretty good at that now.

1195
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:52,240
You've been you've been improving every time I see your drawings.

1196
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:55,440
I think this is this is even better.

1197
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:58,640
The more more detailed, more, more,

1198
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,520
I don't know, a

1199
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,280
structurally sound.

1200
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:06,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, stuff like that.

1201
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:10,560
More anatomy, but not like more anatomy.

1202
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:16,480
More body parts, more muscles, defined, excruciating detail.

1203
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:20,320
Yes, excruciating.

1204
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,480
All right, that's the end of the podcast.

1205
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:23,600
We'll see you next week.

1206
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:25,720
