00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everybody and welcome to another solo podcast on The Pro Crastinators Channel.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I am The Hippocrit and I've never really been that good at doing solos, but I feel, you know, practice makes good.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I'm gonna make one and the first solo I want to talk about is Led Zeppelins, something or other.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I think Celebration Day is the song, I forget the name, but it sort of goes like this.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So that's the solo, it's quite short and it's quite difficult.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Obviously that wasn't the first take, I'm not that good.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But yeah, I really like this song, it's very upbeat, it's very bouncy, it's very quick and fast, and it's fun to play.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The reason I like Led Zeppelin so much is because their guitar bits are just, you know, really cool to listen to, but so fun to play.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like getting down a solo from Led Zeppelins, like the coolest feeling in the world.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And not even just like the guitar solos, Led Zeppelin and all the musicians, their solos are great and they're fun to play.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And that's the thing, the thesis behind a lot of Led Zeppelin songs at least.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It feels like they're just always having a good time trying to do as much cool shit as possible.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it's like, yeah, yeah, 20 minutes solo that just keeps going and it's cool and it's fast and it's energetic and it's great.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And that's the only one I can really do.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's, you know, there's Stairway to Heaven, which I never really figured out.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's probably not as difficult as that one that I just played, but it's like, what does it go like?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I need to turn the distortion off for this, hang on.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A lot of the time I can't remember what a song goes like and how it leads into things without playing it.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then it does the...

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,160
...

21
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, it's uh...

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,360
I mean, it's fun to to to imagine the solo. It's not it sounds terrible when you say it with your mouth

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
But I I've never figured that out

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,560
But soloing is like it's it's cool. It's great and I love solos and there's lots of solos I like but I I don't know many

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Yeah, I guess this really was a pointless podcast if I had more solos to show off

26
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
That would be cool. I

27
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,880
Can make up things in like a in a thing let me turn distortion back on

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You

31
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,520
See that's not really a solo, but it is a riff I could do a podcast on riffs. I love riffs too fucking guitars are cool

32
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Um

33
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,920
Yes

34
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,880
Yeah, I like guitar that the entire joke was I was gonna say I it's a solo podcast and then it's a

35
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
literal about music

36
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,600
solos

37
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,440
When you really you would think oh, it's just a one person in a podcast and that that was the joke

38
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,360
But now I'm standing here with a guitar and I just want to place things

39
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm gonna play some things and tell you what I like. I like things. I like stuff

40
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I like

41
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,120
Let's think of distortion stuff like what's good right like like really what's good like

42
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,960
That's that's a powerful chunky little chunky little power sound, you know all of those

43
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
I'm trying to think of like

44
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Oh

45
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Oh

46
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Oh

47
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,000
Never really quite get that bit I always forget it says who's one of those things, you know

48
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
Yeah, jeez. How's this? How's this gonna work?

49
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm gonna have to compress this to fuck if I'm gonna make my voice sound like it's you know

50
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,080
The right volume level compared to all the stuff I'm doing

51
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
What else is cool? Um I

52
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,720
Can't play back in black even though I really want to because I don't know

53
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,800
Some of you might know that I played back black in back in black

54
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,760
Just with an acoustic guitar by myself in a video on Gibbentate channel

55
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,480
And he got taken down for content ID

56
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,960
They know those chords and they fucking took it down. It was annoying

57
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's just make up a solo let's go all the way up here and then it's just

58
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh, yeah, I'm playing a song this goes

59
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm gay essay is a fucking stupid song and then it's like oh, yeah, and then you go all the way up here and it's like

60
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
I

61
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,840
I'm not good at solos, but I can I tried my best. That's not good

62
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,040
I know what I've just remembered this is one

63
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I

64
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Was a cool little bit I was like that. What do you call it a lick? Do you call that a lick?

65
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
I

66
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't know how that goes. I don't know a lot of songs

67
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,240
I know some parts of lots of songs. I don't know whole songs, you know

68
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I get I get tired of looking up tabs tabs suck. Fuck tabs. They're gay. I can't read them

69
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,640
I mean I can but I don't like them. It's like it takes like 40 minutes to read a tab

70
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
I probably would take longer for me to read notes because I don't know how to read those at all

71
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,520
I just listen I listen and figure it out. I guess

72
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Oh, I'm I'm gay

73
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Oh

74
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Oh

75
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Oh

76
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Wow

77
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh

78
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Oh

79
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh

80
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,680
I can't sing I hate that the reason I haven't made any music is because whenever it comes to singing and lyrics

81
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,880
I fail. I'm just bad at it. I don't know what to do

82
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Text to speech maybe

83
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Oh

84
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
And I'm here

85
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Now I'm there

86
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's just

87
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
I

88
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,880
This podcast is not even real. I'm gonna cut out everything

89
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
I

90
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
I

91
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,280
Really I don't know what I'm doing here

92
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,920
I guess I'm showing off, but I'm not really good at that because I don't prepare for anything. I don't I don't plan

93
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,200
For like what I could talk about. I don't have anything up on the screen to reference

94
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,240
It's really a shit show and I never do it. I never plan. I never do any planning for anything

95
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Every podcast I go on to every PCP. I just jump in and have try to think of something while everyone else is talking

96
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,520
And then I say it and if I don't have anything to say then it's nothing's coming out

97
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
Even on the podcast like I read the chapter once

98
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Nate reads it like a million times and he takes notes and then he comes in and does the thing and he has like stuff to say

99
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm just like

100
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm I'm a lazy

101
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm uh

102
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
It wouldn't be cool if I knew lazy by deep purple and then transitioned into that

103
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,400
That would be a great fucking thing, but I don't know how to play it. Oh, I fucking hate

104
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,360
This this this almost talent this almost skill

105
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,640
Like it's pretty good. I admit. I know how to do some things

106
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,320
But gosh darn it. It's not always great. It's not always the sort of thing that would make somebody say wow

107
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,520
You know you say wow because oh, I didn't know he had guitar talent not oh wow

108
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,480
His guitar talent is really good and I would like to hear music from him

109
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
Like I'm I'm just mediocre enough

110
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
To be uh, whatever

111
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,280
I try to do things, but I don't work out

112
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm really annoyed with my current output

113
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,040
It doesn't seem to get better only seems to get worse

114
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Soon I'll be in a hearse

115
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I

116
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I

117
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,360
Don't like you you smell like poop

118
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,400
See that's what I mean when I fucking can't lyrics

119
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
I know you're not supposed to come up with them off the cuff

120
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,400
But I can't come up with lyrics and then put them on a song that I already made because I can't really make a song without lyrics

121
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,400
To to structure it and I don't know fucking how to do any of this

122
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,640
I hate music and I wish I could make an album and it's hard and I don't know how to do it

123
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
I don't really know what to do

124
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
I can't stay on beat with myself

125
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I tried like playing guitar and then playing bass and it wasn't the same speed

126
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,920
So what would you fucking everybody just has to do it in fruity loops and make not real instrument noises

127
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
But I don't like using a computer when I'm making music. I hate music editing

128
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
It's the worst thing in the world just sitting there with hunched over

129
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,160
Trying to like sit on a chair with a guitar so that it's close enough to the microphone

130
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
Fucking it's it's fucking the worst. I mean and now I have a microphone arm

131
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,120
So I can stand up and play like right now, which is it's great

132
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,640
I could probably make an album now just because I have a microphone arm

133
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
So I don't have to sit down while playing anything, but it's just I fucking hate it

134
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
I fucking hate everything about music production

135
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,840
I hate the sitting with the the headphones listening to something and then trying to play along

136
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,640
With another instrument. It's impossible. It's impossible and no one has ever done it and no one will ever do it ever

137
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,880
It sucks. I hate fruity loops because it's entirely that you don't have anything in your hands

138
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
You're just clicking you're just clicking and putting notes in various places and then listening to it

139
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,040
And yeah, it's you know, it's cool, but I hate it. I hate that process of making things

140
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,280
Digitally

141
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
It doesn't appeal to me as a person who plays guitar

142
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,800
Because the whole reason I like playing guitar is because I'm holding something and I'm going

143
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,680
You know, I'm going dilly dilly dilly with my fingers and it's great. That's fun

144
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,840
It's like the difference of like shooting a gun in a game and shooting a gun for real

145
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,280
Like I've never shot a gun, but I can imagine people who actually play, you know

146
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,560
Own guns and go to gun ranges and shoot

147
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
Like stuff

148
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,360
They they know the difference and it's very, you know, it's it's a different sort of feeling

149
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,680
I'm not saying that digital music is bad. Obviously. It's great

150
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,800
It's just I can't do it and it's so difficult as a single person to make a music without

151
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,000
Fucking using extensive digital

152
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,560
shit

153
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,440
I don't know what to do about it. It sucks

154
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
God damn it

155
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Damn it god

156
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,600
Like I wish it was as easy as just like walking up to a thing going boom boom boom on the drum

157
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,200
And then switching over to the guitar and going. Oh, yeah, I'm listening to the it's just difficult

158
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,760
I wish I was in a band, but I don't know any human beings. I don't know anyone. No one is in a band that I know

159
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,640
No one is even playing music. I don't know anybody. There's no one in the world that I know

160
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
That lives nearby nearby at all
