00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,160
The show on the internet about a bunch of people who make stuff talking about stuff.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm the best guy ever, and today we're joined by Digibro.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm alive, for you, I'm alive, for you, I'm alive, I'm alive, for me, we're all alive.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's true.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,880
Which after our podcast yesterday, Mumkey, that's a good sign.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
I can't believe it.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
That's very true.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Though this will be a week and one day when this goes up, but no matter.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,760
Okay, let's get right to it.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
Alright people, topic for today, incest.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Uh oh.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
We're talking about incest.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
That's what it is.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,600
So let me get, let's get some dictionary definitions off of the urban dictionary, of course.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,360
Okay, there's two dictionary definitions that are good for this.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Okay, first one.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
Having sex with members of one's own family, fine.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,760
And the second one is, it's very direct, the way the British royal family keeps itself

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
permanent.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,880
I like that a lot.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,240
One of the few times the urban dictionary was actually funny.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,480
Yeah, they did it good this time.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,720
Well shit, fam.

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Let's just launch into it.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Literally, fam.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh yeah, that's true.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Very well said.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Um, okay, where do we start with this?

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,840
I do want to say that I'm the one who said we have to do this episode because two weeks

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
ago we had the fetish cast and all the comments were bitching, Mumkey, why didn't you talk

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
about your fetish is Mumkey?

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
I said, fuck it.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
You know what?

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,480
Let's just do a whole goddamn episode about incest so I can just get it all out there.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,240
So I beg completed and got this to happen.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,480
And I was also demanded to be on this by Mumkey.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,620
So Mumkey, since you wanted to, since this is your podcast and you tend to get short

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,760
changed on the dialogue in these, why don't you give us the big intro?

40
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Oh boy.

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,720
Well, I do have a big incest related story about my personal life that I've been waiting

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,120
to tell if we want to just start off with that or if we want to wait for later.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Let's do it.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Now, let's do it now.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Oh, okay.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,340
Okay, folks, this is going to take us all the way back to my freshman year of high school.

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,920
The story of how incest changed my life forever in a either positive or negative way that'll

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,080
be up to the viewer to decide.

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,440
First of all, the question for you folks at home, let's go around the horn.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,360
And I mean, you guys, not the fucking audience because I can't reply.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
Do you think it's okay?

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,320
And I was under the impression that it is okay after reading Harry Potter.

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,920
Do you think it's okay to date your best friend's siblings?

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
That's a tough one.

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Yes.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,480
You know, it's a sticky situation.

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
Is it possible to do it right?

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Yes.

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
It is possible.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
It can be done.

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,320
I mean, I think it's definitely okay.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,000
But if your best friend has a problem with it, then it's going to cause friction in your

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
relationship.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Like, yeah.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My siblings who won't care.

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go ahead.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Fuck my sister.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't give a shit.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, that was one of those situations.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was in.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was a freshman.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,480
My girlfriend was a year younger and we met because I my best friend to, I guess, will

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,400
call Harper because I have a Harper Lee book right in front of me.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
So my best friend Harper, you're older.

77
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Is it to kill a mockingbird by chance?

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,240
No, it's to go to the only two because I stole a copy of Ghost at a Watchman from the

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,880
store I was working at because I was like, oh, there's a bunch of controversy.

80
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,640
I wonder if this is even worth it.

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
And then I never even opened it.

82
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,440
I just have it sitting on my shelf to kill it turns out it's the prequel actually.

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Yeah.

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,400
Well, I guess Finch a little bit racist, a little bit racist.

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
It's not actually a prequel.

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,240
It's like the original incarnation of to kill a mockingbird that she wrote and realized

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,080
it was shit and then scrapped it and used the same characters to write a better book

88
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,720
because in this one scout is like an adult, even though scouts like a child and to kill

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
a mockingbird.

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
But enough about that.

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,200
There's no Atticus scout incest unless you go to a certain part of Tumblr, which I have

92
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,640
definitely been to.

93
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,080
So I'm dating my best friend's younger sister, two years younger than him.

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm just picturing Scout now.

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
You're dating Scout.

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm dating Scouts.

97
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Very tomboyish.

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Yes.

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,560
And her older brother, Bo, Bo is, you know, not in appreciating this.

100
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Are you picturing like your imagination of Scout from reading the book or like the movie

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,920
version of Scout?

102
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
My imagination.

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,200
Like this little girl with like a bob cut and stuff.

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Yeah.

105
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Okay.

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Okay.

107
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,720
So, you know, me and the girl, we're dating and like, I'm 15 and she's 14.

108
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,760
So she doesn't really want to do any of, you know, the sexy stuff.

109
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,680
Like we can kiss, we can hold hands, we can hang out, but she don't want to touch that

110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
dick.

111
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
She don't want to show me those titties.

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,760
She don't want to let me go cave exploring if you know what I mean.

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,560
So imagine my surprise towards the end of the relationship.

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,760
I find out that this girl has cheated on me, not only with my best friend, but with

115
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,880
her own brother.

116
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Whoa.

117
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Whoa.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Dang.

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,920
So that's two major betrayals, girlfriend cheating on you and also, oh yeah, my best

120
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,120
friend slept with my girlfriend or whatever the fuck.

121
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
They actually fucked them.

122
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
They didn't sleep together.

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh, okay.

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

125
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,640
So that's two major hurdles for you to get over.

126
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,080
What did they do if not sleep together?

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Well, that's the thing.

128
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,600
The third thing is, you know, I'm always, you know, you know me, I'm a pushing guy.

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,240
So hey, how about you touch my dick today?

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Yeah, I don't want to.

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I don't want to do that.

132
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,000
So I find out that she gave her own brother a big old handy in the living room down when

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,120
the parents are upstairs sleeping, give him a big old handy, make him come all over her

134
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,000
hand, show off those titties.

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Me, what does Mumkey get?

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Not a damn thing.

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,520
I guess she only likes her relatives because I didn't get shit.

138
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
I can only assume where this is going.

139
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Because I know where my mind is going is that you jacked off to this image forever, like

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,640
ever since this is all you've thought about.

141
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,840
It was heartbreaking and it was demented and I'm still friends to, I guess, Beau Harper

142
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,160
Lee Bow, whatever we're calling him to this day.

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,920
And I don't talk to that bitch because, oh boy, do I want to go and I guess I have to.

144
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
I guess I have to.

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,680
It was, it ruined everybody's life.

146
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
It ruined everybody's life.

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,760
Because she told this to me like out of guilt or something and nobody else knew.

148
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,160
And the other important part of the story is that their Mum is the most hardcore Christian

149
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,600
woman in the entire world and we would all hang out because every Wednesday after school

150
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,320
we would go to their place like a big group of friends and then they would take us to

151
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,560
church and we would do like the Wednesday night church thing.

152
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,880
And I was already well into my atheist years but I went just because it was fun and we

153
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,160
did not do any of the church things, we just fucked around because it was great.

154
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,520
So I'm like, okay, this Mum is probably not going to be okay with this happening.

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,280
So I guess I'll tell somebody who can tell somebody to tell her because I'm not letting

156
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,480
this go by, baby.

157
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,280
Also there was like a speech competition sort of thing through the church where like all

158
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,560
these church people would go to like the big arena area in downtown Des Moines.

159
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,400
Did you do a speech about how this girl gave her brother a hand job?

160
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
No.

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Is that how you're going with this?

162
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,320
So like by speech I mean like it's different types of performances so you can do skits,

163
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
you can do music or whatever.

164
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:56,000
And me and Harper Lee, we did an atheist duo Christian rap performance and the judges

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,560
fucking loved it and we wanted trip to Michigan because we were so good and then right after

166
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,800
all of this emerges and the Mum finds out and fucking places both of them in solitary

167
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,880
confinement and like sets up nanny cams all throughout their house to make sure that their

168
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,160
kids aren't fucking anymore.

169
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,840
And so I lost myself a trip to Michigan and she wouldn't let us go because of this.

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,920
Hang on, did you do the rap thing with the girl or with the guy?

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
With the guy.

172
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay, that's what I thought.

173
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Women don't have talents.

174
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,280
I still know the lyrics if you want to hear a little bit of it.

175
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,960
Jesus the one turned a fish into a ton, turned water into wine and he also healed the blind

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,920
by just spitting in the dirt it can make blind eyes work.

178
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,640
If you got a problem he could do a miracle for you.

179
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
And that's most of it.

180
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Hell yeah.

181
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,400
The crowd was pumped, they were fucking chanting and dancing and shit and then the black judge

182
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,120
said yo that's some good shit and we wanted trip to Michigan.

183
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
And that man went on to be Kanye West.

184
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,560
What were you going to do in Michigan?

185
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,640
So it was like the regional part of the contest and then Michigan was like the nationals where

186
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,080
we would perform our rap in front of like with all the other rappers.

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,480
We're like these two pasty wide guys who aren't even Christian doing this shit.

188
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Man what a tale, what a yarn.

189
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,880
So you're still friends with Harper, did I assume you would know if this ever happened

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
again?

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
Does he still fuck his sister?

192
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,520
Well the thing is after this came out and the mom fucking laid down the hammer that

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:36,560
girl is now the most sheltered, like hidden from the society, hardcore Christian person

194
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,800
I've ever encountered and I don't even think I could speak to her.

195
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,040
I would have expected the reverse, I would have expected her to go like full fucking

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
slut or something.

197
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,680
No I think they went pretty hard on her, I think that the parents fucking ended her

198
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,240
life after that shit.

199
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,960
See this is good because this ties into our larger discussion of incest.

200
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,000
No one's life should be you know in a major way curtailed or changed just because they

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
happen to give their brother a hand job one time.

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,320
It's not that big a deal everybody, it's all, we could all relax about that shit.

203
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,440
Well I'm curious right now, I know Monkey's an only child, I have a younger brother, oh

204
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
that's right.

205
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Pachi, of course.

206
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Why do I keep forgetting about Pachi?

207
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
You've got a younger brother, I've got two younger brothers.

208
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Nate's got an older brother, a younger sister, Tom you've got two younger sisters, right?

209
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,800
So most of us, I feel like there's gonna be a big difference in like the perception of

210
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,320
incest between me and Monkey and Nate and Tom.

211
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,400
Yeah I definitely think so.

212
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm sure that's true.

213
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,040
And I also think that it comes like your perception of it is not just affected by like whether

214
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,040
or not you have siblings with the opposite sex but also just like how close you are with

215
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,840
your family and in general.

216
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,680
So I'm very curious to hear- I think I might surprise you, what we'll say, yeah.

217
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:03,080
I want to know, as I know, well anyway, I want to hear from Tom first.

218
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,360
What do you think of this, because I don't know what you're coming into this with at

219
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
all.

220
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah, I mean, I guess as someone who has two sisters I can't even fathom doing that, like

221
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,400
you know, I mean, I don't have any attraction to them, they're good people, I'd go to war

222
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,440
for them if they needed me but I wouldn't do that, sorry.

223
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,040
Well just so we're clear, I mean, you know, only some of us have sisters but we've all

224
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,440
got a mother, we've all got a mother everybody.

225
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
See that's where I draw the line.

226
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,760
Not the best relationship with this mom though.

227
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
That's true, that's true.

228
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,960
And all that sexual tension dude, you know, it's, uh, shut the fuck up.

229
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:46,080
Well the thing is, I don't think any of us would fuck any of our actual family but I

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,000
think the way that you feel about your family affects how interested you are in incest porn.

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,320
So like I'm wondering, Tom, do you like incest porn at all, any of the different relationships?

232
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't find any of that particularly arousing or interesting.

233
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,920
I've seen incest stuff and to me it's completely, I guess it's just neutral because my view

234
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,760
on incest in general is that I feel like we just need to stay out of people's bedrooms

235
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,480
in general as long as there's consent, that's fine, I don't really care, it's not my business

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,080
and I don't see the harm in it, I think there's way worse things to do than to fuck a family

237
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,040
member if they're both consenting and of age.

238
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,360
I mean, yeah people are gonna think it's fucked up, sure but I don't really care, if that's

239
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,960
what you wanna do, that's what you wanna do, if you can fuck dudes who are women, why can't

240
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,880
you, that seems relatively banal in the grand scheme of things that we've allowed to become

241
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,720
culturally accepted.

242
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,320
So I don't see any sort of controversy about it, I think probably if you wanted to have

243
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,560
a kid with a family member, that's when I'd start to draw the line because then you're

244
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,080
talking about genetic issues at some point.

245
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,240
Whenever I bring that up, people always tell me that like, oh actually it's not really

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,280
that common, it's a pretty unlikely thing and you know, at some point, we're kind of

247
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,800
making a calculation, are we prepared to enforce a rule to say yes, you should not have kids

248
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,320
with your siblings because there is an increased likelihood of genetic problems or whatever,

249
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,560
but is that really our business, if they wanna have a fucked up retar baby?

250
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,400
I mean, we definitely let people with genetic problems have kids.

251
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay, here's the thing, we let stupid people breed.

252
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Why do we allow that?

253
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah, that's the thing.

254
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Well, here's the thing, I don't think it should be illegal, but I think it's ethically irresponsible,

255
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,200
so I guess you have to make the distinction between what do I find personally ethically

256
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,240
wrong to do and what do I think should be legally prevented.

257
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,360
If you have, I don't know a good example, I don't know if Down syndrome or anything

258
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,880
is hereditary, but if you had something like that and there was an equal chance you were

259
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,360
gonna pass it on to your kids as incest has of a genetic defect, do you think it's also

260
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,440
ethically irresponsible to have kids if you have Down syndrome or something of that nature?

261
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,160
You know, is it unethical to have a child with Down syndrome like at all?

262
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,240
Because that is a person who's alive and can live and stuff, so it's not like it's

263
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,360
like evil to have a person with that and they're pretty much just gonna live their life and

264
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,480
probably not really hurt anybody and die, but they're kind of like a burden on the state

265
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,600
or on their parents, on their parents, I guess, but there's nothing like immoral about it,

266
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,640
it's just like we don't really want to incentivize it, I guess, you know?

267
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:53,400
Maybe, I guess at the same time though, it's like this is a person who has no say in even

268
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,520
being born in the first place and it's like-

269
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
True, true.

270
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,440
You're purposely and knowingly hobbling them with a lifelong incurable condition and like

271
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,400
do you have more responsibility to do something about that because like it's not just you

272
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,240
saying like I'm prepared to deal with the consequences of having to raise a child with

273
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,480
this condition, it's like I am willingly, you know, kneecapping them with this condition

274
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,840
and I know it's going to happen, it's going to make their life more difficult and I'm

275
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
gonna do it anyways.

276
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,640
You know, just to make that question even more frustrating and complicated, like it's

277
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:33,280
not exactly like if you do one thing, you'll have a baby who like might-

278
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,360
Okay, like if you have the genetic potential for Down syndrome and like you have sex or

279
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,800
you have a kid with someone else who is also likely to have that and then you have a kid

280
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,760
with Down syndrome versus like if you have sex with somebody else who that's less likely

281
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
and then you don't, it's not actually like you're changing the baby that was born, it's

282
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
that you're just making a different baby.

283
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,640
So actually in like the moral implications of that are that what you're doing is you're

284
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,640
sort of just choosing to not give life to one person who would just live a life with

285
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,360
Down syndrome and you're instead choosing to give life to a totally different, separate

286
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,320
person since like, you know, the same sperm won't probably be the thing that impregnates

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
the same egg.

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,320
This is fucking with my head dude, like, this is like a really philosophical way of thinking

289
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,240
about childbirth that I've never considered and it's fucking with my mind.

290
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
That's me baby.

291
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,240
It's a lot to think about, it's a complicated multi-layered issue because like the ethical

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,880
ramifications of taking a position are complicated.

293
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
Every woman you don't have a kid with is a kid you are choosing not to exist.

294
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
It's true.

295
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
It's true.

296
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Interesting.

297
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,120
By the way, let me just, I don't mind being totally clear on here, I fucking love incest

298
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,280
in my porn, I'm so all about it, I think it's great in most of its forms.

299
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,160
I like Mother-Son, I like siblings, not as much into Daddy-Daughter, that can get a

300
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
little strange.

301
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,520
That's the interesting, that's why I was interested in leading up to this podcast because we've

302
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,760
discussed incest plenty of times in the chat and we were talking about it in there.

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,120
You like Mother-Son and I like Daddy-Daughter, but not so much the opposite in both of our

304
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
cases.

305
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,400
Yeah, I would like to hear this from both of you because I'm into siblings and cousins,

306
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,320
but when it comes to parents, I think it is horrifying, so I would like to hear both

307
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
of you justify this.

308
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
It's the fantasy.

309
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
It's the fantasy.

310
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,760
I don't mean you're going to fuck your mom, Nate, I just want to know what is, is there

311
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,640
any logical thing behind it?

312
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,800
Before we do that though, Monkey, when you think siblings, who do you want to be the

313
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
older one?

314
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Boy or girl?

315
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Doesn't matter.

316
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Doesn't matter at all?

317
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Okay.

318
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Both have their benefits.

319
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
I like the big sister.

320
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,480
I definitely like the Onesan or whatever.

321
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,560
Okay, because I'm more into little sister for the same reasons, I think, as I am into

322
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Daddy-Daughter.

323
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,560
What's interesting to me about that, Nate, is, and I think I know, this is the best logic

324
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,360
I can come up with and this is going to sound real gay for both of us, but I'm an older

325
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,640
brother and you're a younger brother and you're closest with Ben, I'm closest with Victor,

326
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
you know?

327
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Yeah.

328
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Yeah.

329
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah.

330
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
So you're the Daddy and I'm the son in this sort of, in this-

331
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,880
No, what I'm saying is that you would be interested in older sisters because of the fact that

332
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,920
you were closest with your older brother and maybe you've always had, in your mind, what

333
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:37,120
if my older sibling who cares for me and stuff was actually a hot chick I could fuck, you

334
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
know?

335
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Yeah.

336
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Because that's how I think of little-

337
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Sure.

338
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,560
Like, if my little brothers were a hot chick I could fuck, like how much better would my

339
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,080
life have been, you know?

340
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
That makes sense to me.

341
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Yeah.

342
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Well, see, that's kind of what-

343
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
That's a sound bite right there.

344
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,960
That's what I was going to say that I like about, like, mother and son stuff.

345
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,480
What I like about the mother and son stuff is that it's actually pretty similar to the

346
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
older sister thing.

347
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,640
It's that like, okay, so you're just going about your life and you've got a mom and

348
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,360
like, she's a woman, you know?

349
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,040
She's always a woman and that doesn't change and it's like, always below the surface is

350
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,520
this question that like, you know, we totally could fuck.

351
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
We totally could fuck if we wanted to, you know?

352
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
No, it's not.

353
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I'm trying to say, is that?

354
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
I've never-

355
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Well, no.

356
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
It means it's possible.

357
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
It means it's possible.

358
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
God damn it.

359
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
God damn it.

360
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
You keep saying you when I think you're talking about us.

361
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
You keep saying you when I think you're talking about us.

362
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Well, I can't speak for you guys, but it's not, you know-

363
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Please don't.

364
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,800
It's the fact that like, there's a woman just in your life all the time and society says,

365
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,120
you're totally not allowed to fuck her, but then you could.

366
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
You totally could.

367
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,600
And I'm saying you in the sense of in this fantasy, you know, hentai verse.

368
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
And that's it.

369
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,480
Which is similar to like, the older sister thing.

370
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,160
And like, you know, there's like the, it's a little different, like the old, the mom

371
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,920
thing is more like, oh, dad's always away.

372
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
No one's here to satisfy me.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm a woman.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I have needs, blah, blah, blah.

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Then they fuck their son.

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Whereas with the older sister, it's more like, the sister, I always picture like Kesha when

377
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I think about this.

378
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Like, oh, she-

379
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
She's like-

380
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
A black woman?

381
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Kesha is white, dude.

382
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Kesha's white, dude.

383
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Oh.

384
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
She's fucking Mick Jagger's daughter.

385
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
She's fucking a number sign in her name.

386
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,280
I thought it was a black person.

387
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
I think so.

388
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Let me double, I could be wrong about that, but, but like the point is like, she comes

389
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,880
bombing and drunk from the club.

390
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,320
I'm getting a hard no from someone who knows Kesha.

391
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Okay.

392
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
All right.

393
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Fine.

394
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Maybe I'm wrong.

395
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
But so she comes bombing in from the club.

396
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,000
She just collapsed on the ground.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,040
She's like, yeah, I was out just like clubbing and, and I'm such a slut.

398
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Look at me.

399
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,240
And she's like, you're trying to impress her little brother and little brother's like,

400
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
oh, whatever, dude.

401
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,960
And she's just like, no, you don't understand.

402
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,760
Like I do this because, because I want to get your attention, I want to get your attention

403
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
because you're always there.

404
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,680
You're the guy who I really want to impress.

405
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
And then they fuck.

406
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,360
And that's, you know, I, I, I, uh, I don't dislike like mother son or sister, older

407
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,720
sister, but like if it's older sister in both cases, I prefer if the son is like at

408
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
least a teenager.

409
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Oh, yeah.

410
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
I can't stand the show to shit.

411
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Yeah.

412
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
Like, because it's always those tiny dicks don't do it for me.

413
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,080
The tiny dicks don't do it.

414
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,880
And just like the woman being like just like massive and smothering, like that's definitely

415
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,200
a different fetish is like just wanting to be like tiny and to just be like encompassed

416
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,320
by a woman like how in those ones, it's always like a little show to and then like a mom or

417
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,200
sister with like just giant tits and like a huge thick body that's just like covering

418
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,360
the little boy to the point of like, you know, and that I feel like is a whole different

419
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
thing.

420
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,080
That just reminded me that after the fetish episode, somebody did make art of hippo as

421
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,440
Jesus in the pieta and it's really great.

422
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Oh, yeah.

423
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
It does.

424
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't hippo is listening into this podcast.

425
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah.

426
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,400
I don't know if he wants to be in, but I've gotten the impression he's more into show

427
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,360
to than we are because he seems to like those big women.

428
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
So I think yeah.

429
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,640
He likes the big encompassing women it seems like so he can type in the chat if that's

430
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
how he feels.

431
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
I'm not entirely sure.

432
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Yeah, there you go.

433
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
It's good.

434
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
There you go.

435
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Okay.

436
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
You've got the word the official word from on high.

437
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
He's good.

438
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
Everybody.

439
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
We've got confirmation.

440
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Yeah.

441
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,160
Hey, Nate, I have a question for you since you don't like a mother's son.

442
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
I do.

443
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
I do like.

444
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Okay.

445
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,280
Well, since you do as a kid, did you watch Malcolm in the middle?

446
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
I did.

447
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,320
I did very much because as a kid watching that in the way that Lois would terrorize her sons,

448
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,600
I think that is what scared me away from ever even thinking about something like that

449
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
because it's terrifying.

450
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
Well, you know what?

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Okay.

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,960
I feel like with something like that, I don't feel like that even necessarily would have

453
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,960
like drawn me away from it because the whole thing is like, this is like a fantasy.

454
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,680
But like, like what if like my mother was like this, like super hot slut and she needs

455
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,440
sex desperately and I'm a man, God damn it.

456
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,520
Like, you know, like you're putting yourself in this, in this fictional situation where

457
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,960
like if your mother was like this kind of person, then you know, it would be sexy times.

458
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Okay.

459
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
You know, so yeah.

460
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
So it's like a departure.

461
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,720
So I can see why like seeing a like a female, not role model, but like a female character

462
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,440
or like a mother specifically acting in that way, like as like a terrorizing, you know,

463
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,000
bitch of a mom would, would like turn someone off.

464
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,320
Well, there's that episode where she, she walks around the house topless and I was wondering

465
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
if you.

466
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Topless.

467
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Episode one.

468
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
Yeah.

469
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
I'm pretty sure that's episode one.

470
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I was wondering if you were into that.

471
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,240
Um, I remember as a little kid finding it, you know, eyebrow raising like, oh, what's

472
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,600
going, what have we going on over here?

473
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah.

474
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,000
And I remember distinctly, she opens the door and Malcolm's teacher is there and she's

475
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
not wearing a shirt and she's like, the teacher's like, uh, no, no, no, she's like, they're

476
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
just boobs, lady.

477
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,440
And I'm sure yours are much nicer than mine.

478
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
I remember that.

479
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
I remember that very nice.

480
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,840
And she's like, no, no, I swear they're not.

481
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,840
They're really not.

482
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:55,240
I think, uh, well, I'm not that into like, uh, mother, son, but I am totally into moms.

483
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,840
Like in general, like, like, like in my porn, I'd prefer it be like if a guy is hooking

484
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,000
up with someone who is a mom, that's harder to me just because I don't know, there's

485
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
a fucking that kid.

486
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,760
There's something like, like, I like to feel the baby inside when I'm, you know, I didn't

487
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
say pregnant.

488
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:20,640
Well, I'm taking it to that place for some reason, whatever I see, whatever I see, like

489
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,000
mother, son stuff, I always have this like weird feeling like the mom is being irresponsible

490
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
somehow.

491
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh yeah.

492
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,920
That turns me off a little bit for some reason, even though I like the daddy daughter stuff.

493
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,160
It's definitely a bad idea guys, to fuck your son.

494
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah.

495
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,760
Moms should definitely not have sex with their kids unless absolutely necessary.

496
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
Important PSA from Nate Bestman.

497
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah, that's right.

498
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Unless absolutely necessary.

499
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
I definitely put that caveat in there.

500
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
That's important.

501
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,360
I shouldn't have to think what the reason for absolutely necessary would be.

502
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,400
Like if they've got a gun to my head, man, what can I do?

503
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,960
I did have a gun to your head question for you, Nate, but I think Digi wants to finish.

504
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

505
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,200
Oh, no, I think I said, okay, Nate, incest question for you.

506
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Okay.

507
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Gun to your head.

508
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,560
You have to get a handjob from one of them.

509
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,800
Ben are your sister.

510
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
Well, obviously my sister.

511
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
So fuck off.

512
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I'd get a handjob from Ben immediately.

513
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I don't even need the gun.

514
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Don't even need the gun.

515
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I'm just looking for an excuse.

516
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Nate, do you think your sister is hot?

517
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Well, I don't want to be rude to her.

518
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah, she looks sort of like me so totally.

519
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
You know, I don't want to be, it's weird for me to even think of her in those terms.

520
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,200
She is a perfectly attractive young lady who I have deep respect for.

521
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
That's really the extent of it.

522
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,200
I feel like I know of a lot of stories of like siblings who do end up doing more sexual stuff

523
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
like if they're close in age when they're much younger, you know?

524
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Sure, sure.

525
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Me and Victor never did anything like weird together, but we did look at porn as kids

526
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
together.

527
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Sure.

528
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,360
Like we would, and just like, I don't know, I sort of tried to teach him how to grind

529
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,200
his cock against the ground, which is what I was doing, but he didn't seem to get it.

530
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
But like, I definitely have known lots of sisters who've done stuff like that as kids,

531
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
you know?

532
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Yeah.

533
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Lena Dunham, my hero.

534
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,200
It doesn't count if your sister's a fucking baby.

535
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
Oh, I think it counts.

536
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
That's the thing.

537
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I feel like incest, when you have close siblings and you're all going through that sort of

538
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,200
pubescent age together, it would almost be weirder for me to think of it never happening,

539
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
you know?

540
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Like if you're like a year and a half apart from your sibling.

541
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Or even twin-cessed.

542
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah, or even twins.

543
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Sure, sure.

544
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
And you're like eight or nine.

545
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
I refuse to believe there's any twins who haven't fucked.

546
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
At that point, it's just masturbation.

547
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, they've definitely done something together.

548
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
You can't be twins and not do anything.

549
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Because you're experiencing it at the exact same time.

550
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Your bodies are both changing.

551
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Both of you are quizzical about it and you're extremely close with each other, so who else

552
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
are you going to share this with?

553
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah, that's the thing.

554
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
If you keep that in mind as you watch The Sweet Life of Zack and Cody, it really has a different

555
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,200
narrative that's forming before your eyes.

556
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:26,200
For me, a lot of my incestuous fantasies come from that age.

557
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Discovering your body and being like, who can help me understand this?

558
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Who is in the best position?

559
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
It's not a stranger.

560
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
And the schools don't teach you enough.

561
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Society doesn't teach you enough.

562
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
You're just quizzical about your body.

563
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Who's going to help you learn about it but your big brother?

564
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Who's going to help this cute little girl figure out?

565
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Who else but Lena Dunham is going to take this burden off?

566
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Why is she so hot down there?

567
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
It's interesting.

568
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I have a different approach to it.

569
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:07,200
I notice in the stories I gravitate to, it's more like the mom notices like, wow, you've

570
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
really become a man.

571
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,200
You've really become a man now with them.

572
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
That sort of angle.

573
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
I get that too.

574
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,200
That's interesting because we're looking at this from very different age ranges.

575
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,200
When I think I like little sisters and daughters, it's just like a lolly thing for me.

576
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm picturing age 8 to 12 and you're probably picturing guys age 16 to 20 or something.

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Yeah, something like that.

578
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,200
What turns me on about the little sister or the daughter is that they look up to you.

579
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
It's someone who's really close to you, who looks up to you, who thinks you're the coolest

580
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,200
person in the world and all they want is to be close and make you happy.

581
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm with you and I feel you on that.

582
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,200
That particular idea sort of strikes me as sort of emotional manipulation.

583
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
You really shouldn't fuck your 8-year-old sister.

584
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,200
It's just more sage advice from Nate the Best.

585
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
It's not the best idea.

586
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
It's a fantasy.

587
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
That's fine.

588
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I feel like I'm doing something bad which I don't find attractive.

589
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Yeah, well, the best part about incest is that none of us would do it with our real siblings.

590
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Right.

591
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't know.

592
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
If Patchy came over and I was kind of drunk, a bro job.

593
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
What's going to happen?

594
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
A bro job.

595
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
What was the thing I was saying I wanted us to do?

596
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Cock handshakes.

597
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah.

598
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Cock handshakes.

599
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,200
Which someone then pointed out to me is just jacking each other up and I legit had not

600
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
put that together when I came over.

601
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I was like, no, you just grab the cock and shake it like you're shaking a hand.

602
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,200
You're just masturbating them and I'm like, oh.

603
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,200
I always thought it was sort of like entwining the dicks together and then kind of gyrating

604
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
against each other.

605
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
That's how I was interpreting it.

606
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
No, I was just picturing everybody, like everybody standing in the circle, grabbing each other's

607
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,200
dicks and just giving it a firm handshake like once.

608
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Just like, hello.

609
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Just one pump.

610
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Right.

611
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Yeah.

612
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Okay.

613
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Okay.

614
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Well, shit, I don't know.

615
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Still on the table for Radcon 3.

616
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah.

617
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
We got plans.

618
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
We got plans.

619
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
It takes a lot of preparation.

620
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
It takes a lot of preparation.

621
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
So where do we go from here?

622
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Hippo says you're leaking a first leaking.

623
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
That's correct.

624
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
He's correct.

625
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
First leaking.

626
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
We really covered the main stuff there.

627
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I just wanted to talk about there's so many different varieties of incest.

628
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
I don't know.

629
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,200
You know, Mumpkin mentioned sort of like more distant family members things like cousin

630
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,200
fucking and stuff, which is actually kind of socially acceptable, you know, depending on

631
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
how far away they are.

632
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Yeah.

633
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I mean, that's how anime gets away with all of it, is that it's always a cousin.

634
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Unless you're looking at, because that shit pisses me off because I feel like you're just

635
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
trying to get,

636
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
They're being fucking cowards.

637
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Yeah.

638
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Just commit.

639
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,900
Well, it's because they want, because the appeal, again, the appeal of the little sister

640
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,200
is that she looks up to you, she's been with you your whole life.

641
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
She, and she wants to ride the dick, right?

642
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
But then it's always like, oh, but she's not actually my sister.

643
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,200
It's really my cousin, but she still calls me Oni-chan because I'm like a brother to her.

644
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,200
And I'm like, you don't get to have it both ways.

645
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
To me, that's just cheap.

646
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Did you got to help me with this real quick?

647
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I've been wondering for a long time now.

648
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Is it actually a thing they do where girls just call guys that they're really close with

649
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Oni-chan?

650
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Yeah.

651
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
How legit is that?

652
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Anyone, any guy in the age range of a teenager to a young adult is an Oni-san.

653
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Right.

654
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Oni just means a male of that age.

655
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Does that mean brother?

656
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I thought specifically it was...

657
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Well, Oni can also mean brother, yes, but it means both.

658
00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:00,200
It's like Oji-san can mean uncle or it can mean a man in like the late 20s, early 30s, middle

659
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
age.

660
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Oji-san is middle-aged man.

661
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
I said, oh, G-san is grandpa or old man.

662
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Oh, Jesus Christ.

663
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Okay.

664
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Okay.

665
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
All right.

666
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Speaking of which, what are our thoughts on grandparent incest?

667
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Is that what you guys draw the line or is that...

668
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
You know...

669
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Okay.

670
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Grandma's are out.

671
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Grandma's are out.

672
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Grandma's are out.

673
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,200
There are some hot grandmas out there, but to me, a hot grand...

674
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:35,200
There's some people who are into grandmas, you know, like a fat, flabby, old woman.

675
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Not interested.

676
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
If a grandma is still keeping it tight after all these years, that's hot.

677
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Yeah, like Mumkey's grandma.

678
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
We can all fantasize about Mumkey's grandma.

679
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Mumkey's grandma is more a standard grandma.

680
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
I always think of the grandma from Majlis Chopping Arcade of Inno Bashi.

681
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
You know that one?

682
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
You know her?

683
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
It's been way too long since I've seen her.

684
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Yeah, whatever.

685
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah.

686
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I'd fuck a grandma.

687
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
I'd fuck my own grandma.

688
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
That wasn't the question.

689
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Uh-oh.

690
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Oops.

691
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,200
What I was going to say is, well, grandmas are less on the table.

692
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
There's one porn.

693
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
I don't remember what the fuck it's called.

694
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,200
It's by this guy, Yosino, who does all this great 3D porn.

695
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,200
He's got one where it's these two super old grandpas fucking their super young granddaughters.

696
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,200
I've always got the sense from it that they're doing it out of respect.

697
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Like, oh, these are the patriarchs of the family.

698
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,200
We want to please them because they're fucking old and they deserve it.

699
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Oh, oh.

700
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The girls are doing it out of respect.

701
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Yeah, no.

703
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
The girls are like, oh, we respect our grandfather, so we're going to fuck them.

704
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
They seem to be enjoying it.

705
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
They're like, this is cool.

706
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Isn't that typical of Japanese culture?

707
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Yes.

708
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
That's why I've interpreted it that way.

709
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah.

710
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm not entirely sure if that's what the actual plot is because I don't read.

711
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Hey, man.

712
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
Cultural relativism.

713
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What can I say?

714
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
It's all on the table.

715
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
It's all good.

716
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
It's all fine.

717
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I can't criticize.

718
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I need to look up what that's called.

719
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I've got it on my computer.

720
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
But you guys can talk.

721
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Well, I, yeah, I was going to say the whole, like, I like that sort of thing in my porn

722
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,200
kind of like you're kind of obligated to like fuck within the family sort of thing.

723
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Like kind of like the Targaryen thing, you know, it's like, I don't know, isn't it kind

724
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,700
of sexy that like Daenerys was like raised with her brothers and she's like, and they're

725
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,200
like, yeah, you're going to fuck your brothers.

726
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
You're going to do this.

727
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
You got no choice.

728
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
It's pretty hot.

729
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
It's pretty hot.

730
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm just saying.

731
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
What about Cersei and Jaime?

732
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Like that's, they're like a perfect.

733
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
They're the opposite though.

734
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,840
I really like their incest because of the fact that they are grown adults and they've

735
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,640
like had the kids and everything of the incest and they're still like completely in love

736
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
with each other.

737
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,120
Like it's really interesting to me because usually you see it as like when they're younger

738
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,720
and then you kind of assume that eventually, I don't know, they stop when she marries the

739
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,120
king or something, but no, they're still fucking doing it like in their 40s.

740
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,600
That's pretty cool.

741
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,760
I agree.

742
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,120
And I can't believe I didn't even think of this until right now, but, uh, or a emo or

743
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
a fucking emo.

744
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,320
Oh, Mago Zen Pen is the name of that old man fucking.

745
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,520
If anybody was really, really needed that.

746
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Yeah.

747
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
I'm looking at it.

748
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Can you send me a link after this podcast?

749
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,320
Uh, no, I've got it downloaded.

750
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
So just look up.

751
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,000
Let me just tell you, let me just tell you my general feelings about or emo.

752
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Okay.

753
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,360
So or emo is this fascinating story about a boy who wants to fuck his sister and she's

754
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
dumb.

755
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,800
I think she wants to fuck him too.

756
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,720
And like she slow, like he slowly through this doesn't even start to describe the plot

757
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,880
of or emo.

758
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
It's close enough.

759
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
It's the things that matter.

760
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,360
Neither one of them wanted to fuck each other at the start of the series at all.

761
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,480
They, it was a subtext.

762
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Okay.

763
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,640
But the point is they get to that place and like they develop all these friendships over

764
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,480
the course of the series and then slowly, but surely this is like or emo is where like

765
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,600
incest is at its worst really in like fiction stuff.

766
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,040
It's like what happens is that he's built up all these friends, he's made all these

767
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,280
connections like in the first part of the show when like it wasn't just about the two

768
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,360
of them fucking, you know, they just, whatever they develop relationships with lots of these

769
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,360
people and they just live life and do good stuff and all these other women come into

770
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,800
the guy's life that he could choose from and slowly, but surely in the second half of the

771
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,640
show, he just one by one kills off all those other girls and is eventually just left with

772
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Kirino.

773
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,140
He has sacrificed everything else in his life, all these other relationships for this incestuous

774
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,140
relationship that's going to be a huge problem with a 15 year old girl that is obviously

775
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,740
not going to last and like it just ends with like they kiss and then they break up.

776
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,740
And it's so like, when I look at that, it's just like this guy threw away all this potential

777
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,380
good shit in his life for this relationship that he also threw right in the trash and

778
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,220
that he should have known from the start like wasn't going to go anywhere.

779
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,300
I thought they got married or some shit.

780
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,380
They, I mean it's like different in the manga or like the novels versus the anime or something

781
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,780
like in the anime, which is the thing that I watch, which, which made me want to die.

782
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,420
They just kiss and then they're like, okay, we're done.

783
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Okay, we're done.

784
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,700
And there's some subjects like, ooh, maybe they'll keep dating in secret or something.

785
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Or like, why?

786
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
What the fuck is that about?

787
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:19,260
Orimo is the dumbest way to do because, okay, the, have you seen Genchi Ken, any of you

788
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
at all?

789
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Yeah, I've seen the whole thing.

790
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,260
Yeah.

791
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,020
So you remember that early on, there's like a discussion about incest where, cause Madarame,

792
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:33,500
the character who is my, my, my boy is a big, big into little sisters and lollies and shit.

793
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,620
And uh, Sasahara, the main character guy, he is not into little girls at all.

794
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,100
He's all into big, beautiful bitches and big, big, big boy.

795
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
He's my boy.

796
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Yeah.

797
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Hippo kind of guy.

798
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Yeah.

799
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Yeah.

800
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
He's a big titty boy.

801
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,980
And the reason for that is that he has a younger sister who's like a gen guru who he fights

802
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,180
with all the time.

803
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,460
And so he sees it as like younger sisters are completely disgusting.

804
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,660
Like he's not even slightly interested because he has this contentious relationship with

805
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
his.

806
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:05,340
And um, my friend, Don-san, who is the one who like got me into like deeper, deeper Otaku

807
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,060
shit, you know, he was very much the same.

808
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,260
He had a little sister.

809
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,980
He argued with her all the time.

810
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,900
He thought little sisters were totally out of the picture.

811
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,860
And the funny thing about it is that the way Kirino's relationship with her brothers portrayed

812
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,220
early in the show is exactly that kind of relationship.

813
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,620
Like they're at each other's throats.

814
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,420
They don't like each other.

815
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,100
Like it felt very realistic.

816
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:35,500
And then the show somehow bends over backwards and pretzels itself to make them end up together.

817
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,100
That's the whole problem right there.

818
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,420
It's just the most earth shattering like reversal of like an actually good idea that just fucking

819
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,420
makes me want to die.

820
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,420
It's nuts.

821
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
It's fucking insane.

822
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,020
And like it's weird because like if that's what the dude wanted to do all along, like

823
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,580
why did he take this like weird circuitous path that was actually made sense and was

824
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,980
like the total opposite of the, I don't know, it just, it baffles me to this fucking day.

825
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Anyway, now that you've derailed us with Oriibo for it.

826
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
It's relevant.

827
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
It's relevant.

828
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,980
It's the most interesting thing that happened in an incest related thing to anime.

829
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,540
It's probably the most famous incest anime that's out there other than maybe Kiss Ex-Sys,

830
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,340
which I don't think those are his real sisters in that show.

831
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,740
Yeah, I think you're right.

832
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,940
Have any of you guys seen the shitty Adam Sandler movie?

833
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
That's my boy.

834
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
No.

835
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
No, I have not.

836
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,300
It was the first time and I've, I've never been into Game of Thrones or any of that.

837
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:34,180
So it was the first time I'd seen incest propelled in the mainstream, at least in the US.

838
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,300
The plot of the movie is Andy Sandberg is the son of Adam Sandler and that he's getting

839
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,780
married and then Adam Sandler finds out that the fiance is fucking her brother and it was

840
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,660
played as a joke and I thought it was funny.

841
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,860
And I was the only person laughing in the theater at the big reveal and everybody around

842
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:58,020
me was like this, this awkward really like they're in awe and disgust and they're kind

843
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,140
of horrified by the film and that was the first time that I realized, oh maybe the mainstream

844
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,700
people are more horrified of this than I think because I thought this was funny for a shitty

845
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Adam Sandler movie.

846
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:15,660
I think this podcast right here is probably the most positive that four people have been

847
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,660
about incest publicly ever in history.

848
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
It's quite possible.

849
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:27,220
Like even the guy who has no incest fetishes is like, yeah man, stay out of people's bedrooms.

850
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:33,580
Like granted, Tom is also the guy who wrote the, what's it called, Tom?

851
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,740
How do you want to describe it before I have to describe it?

852
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:44,300
How do you want to salvage the description of your, your, your Pony fanfic about underaged

853
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
or sex?

854
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
No way to salvage it.

855
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Is this not the tricksy one?

856
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
Is this something else?

857
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:55,580
No, the one he wrote about Scootaloo having sex with a like 30 year old guy.

858
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
That sounds great.

859
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
I don't remember it, but that sounds awesome.

860
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
And it's good.

861
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,740
It was, it was a full novel.

862
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,460
It was, it was recede to why to claim, which disgusted me to this day.

863
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
I had no idea.

864
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
What?

865
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,860
But you wrote a full length Pony novel.

866
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,300
He wrote the full length Pony fan fiction.

867
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
2013.

868
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Novel.

869
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
It's horrible.

870
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Holy shit.

871
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
How did you not know that?

872
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,860
Looking up with an older man.

873
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
I don't know.

874
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
I guess maybe I just got confused.

875
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,780
And whenever like it came up, I just kept thinking it was like the tricksy comic for

876
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
some reason.

877
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,900
And I always thought, I always thought you were saying like you'd never written a book, but

878
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
here you go.

879
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Here's your breakout hit, dude.

880
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
That doesn't count as a book.

881
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
That's not real.

882
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,900
It's not a real book.

883
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Is the old man a human or a Pony?

884
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
It's still there.

885
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
It's all, it's all horse, gay shit.

886
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Okay.

887
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Good.

888
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
But um, no.

889
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,420
Um, but the older guy is also like borderline ex-be for Tom himself.

890
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,420
So what was that guy's cutie?

891
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,420
Everyone said that.

892
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
It wasn't even the point.

893
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Yeah.

894
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,580
But he did come off as, maybe just because it's written from his perspective.

895
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,580
So it sounds like you.

896
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Yeah.

897
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,580
Yeah.

898
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Sounds like he was groaning curious for sure.

899
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,580
Yeah.

900
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,580
Yeah.

901
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
That's true.

902
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,580
That's, that's what.

903
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,580
I thought it was.

904
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
I didn't read the whole thing.

905
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I thought it was good.

906
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
Well.

907
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Yeah.

908
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
I don't know.

909
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
What was your, even your question?

910
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,580
Just.

911
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
I was just pointing out.

912
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
What does it have to do with what we were talking about?

913
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,580
I was just pointing out that you, that, that while you are not an incest family, you

914
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,180
are not an incest fetishist.

915
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,580
I cannot pretend as though you're like the normie here who also is okay with that.

916
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Oh right.

917
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
I did it.

918
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,580
No.

919
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,580
Clearly no.

920
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,580
Sure.

921
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Everybody go read that fanfare.

922
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
I don't remember what it's called.

923
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,700
Post a link in the description, Ben.

924
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,500
I know you're going to listen through it when you edit this.

925
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Of course.

926
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,900
Ben, Ben can dig it up.

927
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,700
Hey, if we have, if we're not, you know, super into incest, we can just do 30 minutes

928
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
of questions.

929
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
Yeah.

930
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
I was just thinking, maybe let's just switch over to that.

931
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,060
I actually say more about incest.

932
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,700
If you got it, if you got a thing you want to say, yeah, go for it.

933
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,140
I don't know how deep I want to get into it, but because like, because yeah, you guys

934
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,100
talked about it as like a fetish.

935
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,500
I had never thought of incest as a fetish.

936
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,580
Like it was more just a tag.

937
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,220
Like it's not something I sought out.

938
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,180
I like it, especially like, again, like a older brother, younger sister stuff, but more

939
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:10,260
because like I mostly encountered it so much because I like lollies in general.

940
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,900
So I would come across a lot of that, you know, it wasn't so much that I was seeking

941
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,540
it out.

942
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,140
And so like, I wouldn't have said I had like a fetish for it until recently.

943
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,700
And that's because it turns out that while your girlfriend looks exactly like she'd be

944
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:33,500
your sister, that is, well, that too, and, and she's like way into that idea.

945
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,900
You know, my little sister's name is Grace and Ben's first girlfriend was a girl named

946
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
Grace.

947
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
I'm just saying.

948
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:45,340
But, but it's funny you say that because they were the dick show I was listening to just

949
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:49,380
before like earlier today was about how he was saying like, I couldn't fuck a girl who

950
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,340
had the same name as my sister.

951
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,860
I, Ben's got no problem with that.

952
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
I agree.

953
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,860
I agree with that statement.

954
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,860
I don't think I could do it.

955
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,860
That'd be really weird.

956
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,780
If I met a girl named Patchy, it would just make me harder.

957
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:06,180
But anyways, my perception of incest as a fetish has changed dramatically upon the realization

958
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,940
that you can role play that fetish.

959
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,660
Like all you have to do is just pretend like, okay, you are my sister and it's like you're

960
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,300
fucking your eight year old younger sister just because you say that you are.

961
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,900
And so you can have to put the age in there.

962
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
Could it just.

963
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,900
Yes.

964
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,900
No, I had to.

965
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,900
It likes the little age.

966
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
It's got to be fine.

967
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,260
She's got to be a little girl or else it's not who am I to judge.

968
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:36,900
I shouldn't butt in because if she's her real age, she's just my wife, you know, like

969
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
that's right.

970
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
Still be your sister.

971
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
It's not.

972
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,520
You got to compartmentalize.

973
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
All sisters aren't eight.

974
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
It's.

975
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,520
We can't question.

976
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Yes, they aren't.

977
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
They are.

978
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
They are.

979
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
They are.

980
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
They are.

981
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,520
It's eights.

982
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Eights when they develop sexually.

983
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,520
They don't develop.

984
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Shit.

985
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
They are age eight.

986
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Yeah.

987
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
Girls start developing at eight.

988
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
No fucking way.

989
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I do.

990
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,300
There were girls in my fucking class in third grade who had tits, like real tits.

991
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,620
Like they started eight.

992
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,620
Girls start way younger than guys.

993
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,620
At eight?

994
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,640
Girls start around 10.

995
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Girls start around eight.

996
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,020
They get their periods at like age 10.

997
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,380
First of all, you can start getting wet before you get your period.

998
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,380
So you probably.

999
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,380
Okay.

1000
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,380
The more you know.

1001
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,140
I've interviewed a lot of girls about their sex lives.

1002
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,140
Yeah.

1003
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Keep going.

1004
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,140
I'm learning things I need to know about.

1005
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
This is good.

1006
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,140
This is interesting.

1007
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,140
No.

1008
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,140
There was a period where I was trying to write novels and all the characters I wrote were

1009
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,140
young girls.

1010
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,580
So I interviewed a bunch of women about what it's like to be a young girl when you start

1011
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,300
developing different sexual feelings.

1012
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,300
Pretty consistent.

1013
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,300
Like a fucking mom?

1014
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Who'd you ask?

1015
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,300
No.

1016
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
Like people online.

1017
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,140
Like women I knew in the anime blogging sphere.

1018
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,860
And you know, both girlfriends I've had.

1019
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,660
So the answer I always get is eight.

1020
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,460
Eight is about when you start thinking about sexual stuff.

1021
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,460
And then.

1022
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,460
Are we here on the PCB going to officially say the age of consent should be eight years

1023
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,460
old?

1024
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,460
No.

1025
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,460
No.

1026
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,460
No.

1027
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,460
No.

1028
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,460
No.

1029
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,460
No.

1030
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,460
All right.

1031
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,460
Mexico's got it right.

1032
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,740
I put it like 15, 13, something around there.

1033
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:18,300
The way my fantasy usually goes is you start at eight is when the interest develops.

1034
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,260
But it's not until a few years later that you actually go all the way once their body

1035
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
is ready.

1036
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,180
That's when your dad takes you into the back room and he starts to explain to you and he

1037
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,340
starts to feel you and show you how it works.

1038
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,340
Right.

1039
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,340
Exactly.

1040
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,340
Okay.

1041
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,340
Understood.

1042
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,340
Understood.

1043
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,340
He knows what's up.

1044
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
Yeah.

1045
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
He knows his way around.

1046
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,100
Which I do want to say, Digi, that something was just uploaded to YouTube that I think

1047
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,940
might be the perfect example of the worst video that you could ever possibly see.

1048
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:51,840
Do you know how you and your girlfriend have been doing that series of reviewing every

1049
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,100
Pokemon and looking at the pictures and stuff?

1050
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,300
Well, what didn't you know?

1051
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,860
Our good friend of the show, future PCP member Psy, just uploaded his own version co-hosted

1052
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:09,940
by Asperger and it's two hours of them reviewing just the first 60 Pokemon, so they're taking

1053
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,940
their sweet time.

1054
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,940
Yeah, I guess so.

1055
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,020
They need to move it along, guys.

1056
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,860
I think Digi would get a lot from watching that video.

1057
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,300
It's two favorite people copying his idea and doing it twice as long.

1058
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,860
Are they just like, why would I want that?

1059
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,860
I'm confused.

1060
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,860
I'm confused.

1061
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,860
Context.

1062
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,860
What is the relevance?

1063
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,420
What is the relevance to our topic here?

1064
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,420
I don't understand.

1065
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,420
Are you just trying to shout out that video?

1066
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,420
Is that your point?

1067
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:37,540
No, because I was thinking about how him and his girlfriend do that series and then this

1068
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,780
just popped up in my sub feed.

1069
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,340
I haven't actually watched it.

1070
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,340
Two hours.

1071
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,740
Well, they need to hurry their fucking asses up.

1072
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,020
They should have covered every Pokemon in two hours.

1073
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,020
Yeah.

1074
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,220
I was just saying, I thought that would be like the ultimate video to piss off Digi,

1075
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,620
but I guess I was mistaken.

1076
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,220
It's hard to piss off Digi.

1077
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,660
Anyway, we want to move to questions now.

1078
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,660
Are we done?

1079
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,660
Let's do it.

1080
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,900
I got nothing else to say.

1081
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,900
I don't want to go any deeper.

1082
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,900
Hashtag legalize it.

1083
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,900
Hashtag, you know, let me fuck my mom.

1084
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,900
Yeah.

1085
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,500
You know, just all the hashtags, you know, legalize it.

1086
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Give a check off to your mom.

1087
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,500
At all.

1088
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,500
I can safely say no.

1089
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,500
I can safely say no.

1090
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
Monkey.

1091
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Not even tempted.

1092
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
No, never.

1093
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Tom.

1094
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Never.

1095
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Okay.

1096
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Here's the thing.

1097
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,380
I'm just going to say that at some points in my life, I have acknowledged that my sister

1098
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,380
is a girl.

1099
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,100
I have been aware of that fact.

1100
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,660
If you if you understand what I'm saying, I'm not saying that.

1101
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,660
No, no.

1102
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,660
I'm not saying that.

1103
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:46,020
I'm not saying that when I was like, when I was particularly like depressed, lonely,

1104
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,820
learning about sex, 12 years old, I jacked off to like every woman in my family.

1105
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:56,620
I think every woman I've ever come into contact with, I've like probably jacked off thinking

1106
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,620
about at least briefly, usually followed by immense guilt and realizing it wasn't a good

1107
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,620
idea.

1108
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,220
But yeah, I was going to say like to me, it's weird.

1109
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,420
I felt weird sometimes.

1110
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,420
Like I didn't do that.

1111
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,020
But like I would like into my mind, I would force myself to just concentrate on like one

1112
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,100
of my classmates, like one specific one and be like, yeah, now I fuck this person in my

1113
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,100
brain.

1114
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,100
Same fucking sick.

1115
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:20,580
Actually, before we move on from incest, I want to take you all to the darkest side

1116
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:27,060
of incest, the worst element of it that I hate that has affected me in a very in a way

1117
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,020
that makes me sick and want to cry.

1118
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,620
Have you ever had incest dreams?

1119
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,620
No, anybody.

1120
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,060
Yeah, I think I have.

1121
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,060
I think I have actually.

1122
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,060
Yeah.

1123
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,060
How did that go?

1124
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,060
I'm pretty sure I fucked my sister in my dream.

1125
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,260
I believe I did do that one time.

1126
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,260
Tom, you ever had incest dreams?

1127
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,260
Yeah.

1128
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,260
I've never had incest dreams.

1129
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,260
So I've had dreams.

1130
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,740
But again, I rarely remember my dreams.

1131
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,740
So who the fuck knows?

1132
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,740
That's true.

1133
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,740
I've had dreams.

1134
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,740
That's a terrifying thought.

1135
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,340
Thank you for planting that into my brain.

1136
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:58,740
I've had incest dreams and they are horrifying and they always wake me wake me wake up like

1137
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
feeling like I want to throw up everywhere.

1138
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,740
And it's like the worst experience of my life is incest dreams.

1139
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,740
It's the worst part.

1140
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,740
It's when you have to go clean up your underwear afterwards.

1141
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,620
No, none of them are none of them are the sexy kind.

1142
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,820
They're all like horrible.

1143
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
All my dreams are nightmares.

1144
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,820
Oh, really?

1145
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,500
Like every dream I have is a nightmare.

1146
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,860
So my incest dreams are all like terrifying and bad.

1147
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,140
And I legit wake up like feeling like I actually am going to throw up like.

1148
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,540
Well, hey, why is are you like in a sex dungeon being like raped or something?

1149
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,540
What's what's so bad about it?

1150
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,540
There was one where I raped one of them.

1151
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,540
Okay.

1152
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,540
That was horrifying.

1153
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,540
I also dream about raping Victor, but I don't have the same reaction you do.

1154
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,540
Yeah.

1155
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,540
All right, let's move on to questions.

1156
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,540
Can we all agree that if we could, we would fuck Victor?

1157
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,540
I think we can agree with that.

1158
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,540
Let me let me get it.

1159
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:55,540
I'll be the questions boy today since I asked on the we're taking them from the PCP Patreon

1160
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,540
chat.

1161
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,540
If you didn't know.

1162
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,540
What's the how much that the pay to get into the Patreon chat?

1163
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,540
Just $1.

1164
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,540
Just $1.

1165
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:07,180
If you're a patron at all, you get into our exclusive patron discord.

1166
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,740
It's the only place that discusses this show that is not cancer.

1167
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,740
So true.

1168
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,740
The comment section on YouTube, utter cancer, disgusting, deplorable cancer, the PCP fan

1169
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:23,340
discord that I run discord cancer that existed before this absolute cancer.

1170
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,340
Do not go there.

1171
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,740
You will want to kill yourself.

1172
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,740
Yeah.

1173
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,940
The one that gives us money conveniently is great.

1174
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
Yeah.

1175
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,940
Because of paywall, man.

1176
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
It's only paywall.

1177
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,940
People give money.

1178
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,940
It's true.

1179
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,940
All right.

1180
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,940
From tadpo.

1181
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,540
He asks, how do you deal with backlogs after long stays away from the internet?

1182
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,940
This is something I have a lot of trouble with.

1183
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,940
I don't know about you guys.

1184
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:49,820
You know, I like after like a weekend or something being away, just to look at my YouTube and

1185
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,300
see like all the videos that have piled up, I don't know, nothing fancy.

1186
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,860
I guess I really just try to just break it down and just ease into it one thing at a

1187
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,860
time.

1188
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,340
I'm pretty organized in the way I approach the stuff.

1189
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,540
It's probably categorized it.

1190
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,460
Or if there's like a show that I've missed, I just try to get all the episodes so I have

1191
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,180
them at my fingertips and then I'll watch them when I need to.

1192
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,780
I ended up leaving just a lot of shit unwatched.

1193
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,060
Like it's I can't like it because they're still coming out.

1194
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,540
You know, like I follow enough channels to keep me busy throughout the day.

1195
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:23,900
So if I stack up a week of missed videos and then that day, there's also a bunch of

1196
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,900
new videos coming out.

1197
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,780
It's like, oh, this is never going to happen.

1198
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,060
Sometimes I'll go through and I'll just cull the stuff that I'm like, okay, you know, I

1199
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,180
don't actually need to watch like the new best of the worst, for example, or something

1200
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,180
like that.

1201
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,500
Yeah, I usually skip best of the worst, but I won't skip half in the bag.

1202
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,020
But that's because it's easier to throw on in the background.

1203
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,780
And like ironically, the stuff, the stuff I watch the most on YouTube is the shit I don't

1204
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,540
have to pay attention to because I can just leave it running continuously.

1205
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,700
The stuff that I actually have to concentrate on, I often end up getting to like way later

1206
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,580
or I miss everything or I'll have a day where like, for instance, with hippo, he was doing

1207
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,020
his imgavu a tuatij right when I was traveling the country and a lot of those videos were

1208
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,140
longer and stuff.

1209
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,340
And I felt like I had to watch them.

1210
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:11,460
So I had like a whole weekend of just like all I did was watch hippo videos until I was

1211
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,860
caught up, you know.

1212
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,860
But a weekend.

1213
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Yeah.

1214
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,620
Moving on to another question.

1215
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,300
That never happens to me because I am never away from the internet.

1216
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,500
And also most of the people I follow, like Nate, never uploads.

1217
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
So it's fine.

1218
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,980
Hey, man, Weagua is real.

1219
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,420
I uploaded last night at 5 a.m. for you.

1220
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,900
Yeah, me and Sheep overwatched it this morning.

1221
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,900
And we...

1222
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,220
Which make it 10 out of 10?

1223
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,220
It was...

1224
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,380
Let me say the best part of waking up is not folders in your cup.

1225
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,620
It's Nate on your screen.

1226
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,620
Oh, there you go.

1227
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,140
And I love what you're doing with your Hillary Clinton fucking cut out.

1228
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,140
It's great.

1229
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,140
Oh, I've got big plans.

1230
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,140
We've got big plans.

1231
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,140
It's far away.

1232
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,140
Yeah.

1233
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,140
Monkey, here's a question I'm actually interested in hearing your answer in because you know

1234
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,300
movies and actors a little better than the rest of us.

1235
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,700
Cucked by the laws of aerodynamics asks, which actor would you have playing you in a PCP

1236
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,700
movie?

1237
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
Ooh.

1238
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Ooh, that's a good one.

1239
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
Yeah.

1240
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,260
We should cast the whole movie, all 10 of us.

1241
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,860
Can we get John Goodman to play Gibb?

1242
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,380
I just think that makes sense.

1243
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,220
He's, you know, he's not even British.

1244
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,220
Oh, no.

1245
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,860
We use CGI and we shrink him digitally on the screen.

1246
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,860
It's perfect.

1247
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,860
That's perfect.

1248
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,860
And lipo suction him on the screen too while we're at it.

1249
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,620
I mean, do the actors have to be close to our age because I've heard that I look like

1250
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,940
Martin Freeman and I would like to be portrayed by him, but more likely it would be like Elijah

1251
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,940
Wood.

1252
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,100
Elijah Wood's like 40 now, man.

1253
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,820
Yeah, but he looks like he's fucking 15.

1254
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,580
Yeah, he does.

1255
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,580
Do you like Elijah Wood?

1256
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,580
Would you have him play you?

1257
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,580
Yeah.

1258
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,580
He can play him.

1259
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,580
I'm down with him.

1260
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,580
I don't know if, I don't know if he like is temperamentally similar to you.

1261
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,420
He did one movie where he plays like this creepy kind of serial killer guy.

1262
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,180
So I think he can get into the demented state of Monkey Jones.

1263
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,300
Actually, so I think Michael Sarah should play Davoo for sure.

1264
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,300
Oh, yeah.

1265
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,300
That's a weirdly good.

1266
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,300
That's right.

1267
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,100
He does look in like a weird way.

1268
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,100
In a weird way.

1269
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,340
Yeah.

1270
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,340
Why does that work?

1271
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,020
That shouldn't work at all.

1272
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,020
It's the hair.

1273
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,020
It's really the hair.

1274
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,020
Yeah, I guess so.

1275
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,500
Tom, do you know who you would have play you in a movie?

1276
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
I don't know actors.

1277
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,580
I don't pay attention to like popular culture.

1278
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:36,020
I would just say Christian Bill because according to 4chan, I'm a Mexican Christian.

1279
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,020
I can see that.

1280
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,820
I can see you being perfect, especially like from the machinist.

1281
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,620
I like how we're all picking guys like way more handsome than us.

1282
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,620
All actors are good.

1283
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,180
That's what movies are about, man.

1284
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,900
Nate, you have an actor you'd pick.

1285
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,900
Without a doubt.

1286
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,900
It'd be Tom Cruise.

1287
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,140
It'd be modern Tom Cruise would play me.

1288
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,660
He's the only man strong enough with enough mental fortitude to handle the lifestyle of

1289
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,660
the best guy ever.

1290
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,100
I feel like you're more jacked than Tom Cruise.

1291
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,100
Oh, no, man.

1292
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
No.

1293
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Is he like Jack?

1294
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,100
I'm working on it.

1295
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,100
But he's a little short.

1296
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,100
He's a little short.

1297
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,100
Fuck.

1298
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,100
I mean, like I'm probably the same height as him, actually.

1299
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,100
But like for Hollywood, he's short.

1300
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,100
I thought he was a really short.

1301
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,100
He's a shit boy.

1302
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,100
I mean, have you seen?

1303
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,580
I mean, like Ellen Page to play mage.

1304
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,380
I think Ellen Page is mage.

1305
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,740
Is it mage like twice the height of Ellen Page?

1306
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Ellen Page is tight.

1307
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,740
That is true.

1308
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,740
That is true.

1309
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,740
John Goodman's playing hippo.

1310
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,740
Who fucking cares?

1311
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,540
Digitally shrunk John Goodman.

1312
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,220
I just want the poacher to say, Page is mage.

1313
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
It sells itself.

1314
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,940
I feel like the only answer I can come up with is Jack Black.

1315
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,740
It just seems obvious to me.

1316
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,740
Yeah.

1317
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,780
Not bad.

1318
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,740
I don't know who else it could possibly be.

1319
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,260
So it's got to be Jack Black.

1320
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,260
I don't like it.

1321
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,260
It's going to be a very interesting performance.

1322
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,860
Unless you wanted to look local to play Jess.

1323
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:53,980
A lot of people say I look like that dude from Always Sunny, whichever one.

1324
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,980
Fat Mac?

1325
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,980
Probably Fat Mac.

1326
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,980
I forget.

1327
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,980
Fat Mac.

1328
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,980
Okay.

1329
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,980
Okay.

1330
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,980
So I guess-

1331
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,300
Who's a really like big buff, tough wrestler these days to play Jess?

1332
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,300
Fucking Batista.

1333
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,300
Oh, what's that guy?

1334
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,300
Glorious.

1335
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,300
Batista should play Jess.

1336
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,300
Yeah, okay.

1337
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Batista.

1338
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,340
Guardians, right?

1339
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,300
But Batista, as he is in Guardians 2, should play Jess.

1340
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:20,140
Like literally, it should just be Drax the Destroyer, like in the paint and everything.

1341
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,740
It should play Jess.

1342
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,740
Just with a wig on.

1343
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:30,020
You have never seen anybody enjoy a character more than me and Jess enjoy Batista in that

1344
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,020
movie.

1345
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
Like, he's the greatest.

1346
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:36,540
Hey, what's the guy who played, what's the guy who was an anti-Christ?

1347
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,860
Willem Defoe should play Ben.

1348
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,860
Willem Defoe should play Ben.

1349
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
Yeah, totally.

1350
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,420
That little goblin face going on, that's perfect.

1351
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,020
Wait, who do we got from Munchie?

1352
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,540
That's the last one.

1353
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,380
Oh, Munchie should be played by God.

1354
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,140
We'll see if he can fit it in his schedule.

1355
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,780
We should get an actual gigantic baby boy to play Munchie.

1356
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,780
Yeah, baby boy!

1357
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,140
I think Munchie should just play himself.

1358
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,420
Who else can be Munchie?

1359
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,420
I think that's a good idea.

1360
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,420
He's got time.

1361
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,420
He can be in the movie.

1362
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,420
Okay.

1363
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,420
Is that everybody?

1364
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,420
Do we miss-

1365
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,340
Similar question from Orca.

1366
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:18,300
If any person, fictional or non-fictional, had to join the PCP, who would you want on?

1367
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,860
Who's just like an insufferable, intellectual, pseudo-intellectual asshole like Socrates?

1368
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,660
If we're going non-fictional, I want Max Landis on this show.

1369
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,660
Oh, man.

1370
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,660
Yeah, he'd be good.

1371
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,660
He's a perfect fit.

1372
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,660
He'd be good.

1373
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,580
We would never get a word in.

1374
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,580
I would.

1375
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,580
That's true.

1376
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,060
It would just be me and him and Nate.

1377
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,580
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

1378
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:43,660
And the podcast, we have to start our own splinter podcast so we actually say something.

1379
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,660
That's inevitable anyway.

1380
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,300
I don't know about fictional characters.

1381
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,740
I want to get Donald Trump on the podcast.

1382
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,740
Tyrion Lannister.

1383
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,420
He'd be a good podcaster.

1384
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,620
Trump would suck dick.

1385
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,620
Trump would just fucking-

1386
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,620
No, it'd be funny.

1387
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
Trump's really funny.

1388
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620
Okay, Trump would be funny.

1389
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,620
That's true.

1390
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,620
That's true.

1391
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,620
But he'd fail at making his points coherently.

1392
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,620
He'd talk in circles.

1393
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,940
He's a natural comedian, a natural showman.

1394
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,140
If you watch anything that's not political, he's really funny.

1395
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,140
Yeah, that's true.

1396
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,140
That's true.

1397
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,220
Nate, considering how dedicated you are to Pokemon going to the polls, you have a moral

1398
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,220
obligation to get Donald Trump on here and give him what for.

1399
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
You're right.

1400
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,220
Oh, I thought you were going to say Hillary, to have Hillary join the PCP, which is not

1401
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,220
a bad idea.

1402
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,220
Yeah, she's got those great jokes that would fit right in.

1403
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,220
She's full of them, dude.

1404
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,220
All right.

1405
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,220
Here's-

1406
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,220
Uh-huh.

1407
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Is that everybody?

1408
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,220
I was actually going to read this-

1409
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,820
I did ask questions on Twitter.

1410
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,500
There was just one that I wanted to address, just because it was sort of a logistical thing.

1411
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,300
It was at Fat Man Falling.

1412
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,300
Just asks, when are you releasing this month's bonus episode?

1413
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,300
And I just thought I'd tell everybody.

1414
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,740
We generally release those just on the first of the month, like every week, every month.

1415
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,740
So yeah, that's it.

1416
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,740
That's it.

1417
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,740
Okay.

1418
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,740
So in like three days from now?

1419
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,740
No.

1420
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,740
Like, oh, when this comes out?

1421
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,740
Yeah.

1422
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,740
It'll be like three days after this comes out.

1423
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,740
That's true.

1424
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,740
All right.

1425
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,540
So he asks, best and worst ways you've ever spent a shitload of money relative to whatever

1426
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,020
you think a shitload is?

1427
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,540
I know exactly what it is, but I've already told this story before, so stop me if I've

1428
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,540
told this.

1429
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,420
But like, one day, when I was young and I was really into Vampire Hunter D, and I bought

1430
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,340
this $100 leather hat, you know, I already told this-

1431
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,140
Is that the best or worst way you spent a shitload of money?

1432
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,180
It's worse than both at the same time.

1433
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,540
Well, kind of, but like, it's the worst because like, I never once actually wore it and immediately

1434
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,260
regretted spending $100 on it.

1435
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:30,620
I was just like a whim thing, but for me at that age, $100 was so much fucking money.

1436
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,620
It still is for me.

1437
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,120
It was a complete terrible idea.

1438
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,140
I mean, yeah, it's a lot in general.

1439
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,140
Monkey time.

1440
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,780
Once every other month, when I finally hit the $100 thing for YouTube Ad Revenue, that's

1441
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,300
a big deal, my friend.

1442
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,020
I finally did it for you money for doing that thing.

1443
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,020
You make more than $100 a month.

1444
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,420
Well, only because of me and Digi's podcast, but then I just give him half anyway, so.

1445
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,420
Really?

1446
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,420
Is that true?

1447
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,420
Yeah.

1448
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,420
Do you know how many of those are demonetized?

1449
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,420
Oh, no.

1450
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,420
That's a good point.

1451
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:05,420
Are they monetized because I used some song for like 10 seconds?

1452
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,420
Well, yeah.

1453
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,420
That's true.

1454
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:08,420
But it's fine.

1455
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:13,140
The worst way I've spent a shitload of money relative to what was a shitload at the time

1456
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:22,420
is buying two different $130 Kanan figures for the anime series Kanan, which I'm scared

1457
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,860
to even re-watch, but I've got like $300 in toys for it.

1458
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,820
So just because you're afraid you've wasted your money on these fucking figures, you can't

1459
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,820
watch the show again.

1460
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,740
Yeah, the figures are broken now, so like it's a total wash.

1461
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:40,860
Really all my figures, I have some level of regret for, all the expensive ones.

1462
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,540
Just because they're so expensive.

1463
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:49,220
But the best way I spent a shitload of money was buying several hotel trips in Rochester,

1464
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,380
New York two, three months ago, $600 a week, but totally worth it.

1465
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,060
People are, you know, I hear people say things like, what are you doing paying money to,

1466
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:03,980
you know, for like, why don't you buy local pussy, dude, what are you doing, flying people

1467
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:07,420
around and stuff, you know, as I'm arguing.

1468
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,220
If the pussy that good, then it would work.

1469
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,220
That's right.

1470
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,220
That's right.

1471
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:16,860
I mean, last, I would say, if I had to pick another one, it would like another worse one,

1472
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,860
it would be the second trip to my ex-girlfriend.

1473
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,860
Sure.

1474
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:26,220
The first one was worth it because it was $400 and I lost my virginity and that was nice.

1475
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,980
The second trip, not worth it at all.

1476
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,980
Should have broke up before that.

1477
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:31,980
Understandable.

1478
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,980
So, yeah.

1479
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1480
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,300
Probably spent even more on that trip.

1481
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,900
By the way, that just, your figure story reminds me about how I've been wanting, I've had like

1482
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,660
a fantasy of buying like the perfect commune of figure for years and like they, there have

1483
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,660
been a bunch that come out that are pretty nice.

1484
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,220
And I'm always thinking like, yeah, it's one day I'll buy that.

1485
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,220
I don't know why I just don't.

1486
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,780
I just want to own it and build a little shrine to it.

1487
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:57,500
The worst part about the two Kanan figures is that they're like jumping in opposite directions.

1488
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,700
The idea is that the two characters are like shooting at each other.

1489
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,420
So you buy both and it's set.

1490
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,220
Which is a clever idea, except that if you have them displayed that way, you can't see

1491
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,900
either of them.

1492
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,460
Like they're both jumping away from each other and there's no way to make it so you

1493
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,540
can see both of their fronts.

1494
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:19,660
So it's the stupidest idea of a figure set ever and I hate it.

1495
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:24,300
You know that just, this was another that's both related to figures and like a terrible

1496
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,580
slash great purchase.

1497
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,660
This was both a good and bad thing.

1498
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:30,220
I know I've told the story before, but it's just like how I spent a billion million dollars

1499
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:37,060
in like a Tokyo crane machine trying to win like the second half of my like CC or C2 and

1500
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,060
Collins set.

1501
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,380
A figure that probably cost $35.

1502
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,980
I'm sure it was far less than the amount of money I spent.

1503
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,980
But here they sit before me, link together in this sexy ass pose.

1504
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,220
I'm looking right up C2's cunt.

1505
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,220
It's great.

1506
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
It's great, you know.

1507
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,220
It's all good.

1508
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,220
It's all good.

1509
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,740
So that was both a terrible waste of money, but also it paid off long term.

1510
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,740
All right.

1511
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,500
Spooker asks, what are your most visited websites?

1512
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,660
V, 4chan, V. That's like the number one I'm on on YouTube.

1513
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,660
Tom?

1514
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,300
Well, mostly I go to YouTube all the time.

1515
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,300
I just I've researched tons of stuff on YouTube.

1516
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,380
I have gone on Engadget every day for the last 10 years.

1517
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,380
It's not an exaggeration.

1518
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,380
Whoa.

1519
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,380
What do they do there?

1520
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,380
What is their thing?

1521
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,500
It's just like a technology blog, but they're becoming super political.

1522
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:30,460
So I'm like tempted to jump ship because it's starting to get gross.

1523
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,900
And then let me guess, let me guess.

1524
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,620
They love Donald Trump.

1525
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,620
Oh, the best.

1526
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,780
It's they're the most red-pilled site of all time.

1527
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,780
It's great.

1528
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,780
Yeah.

1529
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,780
I don't know.

1530
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,500
I don't really go to a lot of websites frequently.

1531
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,980
I just kind of just does everything.

1532
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:52,220
You know, Google.com because I've I've constantly needed to learn something and like Google has

1533
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,220
got my back.

1534
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,220
So it's yeah, very true.

1535
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,460
My best friend of all time, monkey.

1536
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,060
Yeah, I just go on all the standard shit.

1537
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,500
I guess I also go to Reddit more than you guys probably.

1538
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,580
Oh, we've got a redditor on our hands.

1539
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,020
Folks, my fucking hero.

1540
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,820
Well, I I'm one of those rare redditors who was mostly on the Donald.

1541
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,820
So.

1542
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,820
Right, of course.

1543
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,620
I got it. Where else am I going to get real news?

1544
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,420
Every other website is fake news.

1545
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,060
Yeah, it's a conundrum.

1546
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:25,780
I the websites I spend the most time on or without a doubt, YouTube and Twitter, because

1547
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:27,780
that's where all my shitposting is.

1548
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,300
But like, I just habitually like cycle through all my bookmarks constantly.

1549
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:38,260
So I check my anime list every day and accept every friend request I get, which is like

1550
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,460
three or four a day.

1551
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,300
I check Gmail, obviously, Reddit.

1552
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,020
I only go to Reddit for my own board.

1553
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,500
I don't actually go anywhere.

1554
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,420
The weirdest one I go to, though, is every day I go to GameFAQs and do the poll of the

1555
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,420
day.

1556
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,660
Oh, I did that for a long time.

1557
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,340
I've done that for like a decade.

1558
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,700
Like I've been I've voted in every poll of the day.

1559
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,820
I feel like I'm going to go see today's really miss it.

1560
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,180
Today's poll is, have you ever fallen asleep while playing a video game?

1561
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,180
Absolutely.

1562
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:11,140
And oh, did I ever tell you my nightmare story about how I had just caught a shiny butterfree

1563
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:15,340
in the bug catching contest and fell asleep and the battery died and I fucking lost it?

1564
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,340
Oh, no.

1565
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I wanted to fucking kill myself.

1566
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,340
You should have.

1567
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,340
I should have.

1568
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,340
It was a nightmare.

1569
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,420
It was literally the butterfree that cucked Ash out of his butterfree, the pink one that

1570
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,420
stole it away.

1571
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,420
I caught her, but I let her escape.

1572
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,340
She slipped away.

1573
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,340
Just like in the show.

1574
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:33,860
God, shiny Pokemon horror stories are the worst.

1575
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,860
I know.

1576
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:35,860
I know.

1577
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,980
I've only encountered one shiny Pokemon in my entire life and I was playing Pokemon Emerald

1578
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:42,340
and it was a shiny wormhole, but it was before you got Pokeballs in the game.

1579
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,340
Oh, no.

1580
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Oh, my God.

1581
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,340
So evisceration.

1582
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,340
Right.

1583
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,340
That's the worst.

1584
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,340
It was like the biggest cockslap I've ever gotten by God in my life.

1585
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,340
I've got a shiny cottony in Sun and Moon.

1586
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,820
It's the only shiny I've seen, but I got it.

1587
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:58,260
I've actually caught kind of a lot.

1588
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,300
I've caught like four or something over my career, which for somebody who just played,

1589
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:05,860
I've like played every game through once, but I didn't like grind for any of them.

1590
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,940
So I guess I'm kind of lucky.

1591
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,820
Ben has never seen any, except for like red carrots, obviously.

1592
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,980
He plays more Pokemon than both of us combined.

1593
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,980
Yeah.

1594
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,980
As far as I know.

1595
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,980
Yeah.

1596
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,980
It's just cray.

1597
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:17,980
Yeah.

1598
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,980
Yeah.

1599
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,980
The game.

1600
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,180
It's pretty much the coolest idea ever.

1601
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,180
I fucking love it.

1602
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,180
It's insane and nuts.

1603
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,020
I love how low the percentage is.

1604
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,020
It's great.

1605
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,020
I love it.

1606
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,020
Let's do one more questions.

1607
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,020
Do we want to keep it going?

1608
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,020
Let's do one more.

1609
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,020
Let's get a big finish.

1610
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,020
Okay.

1611
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,020
The best question.

1612
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,020
You want a real big epic finisher?

1613
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,020
Yes.

1614
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,020
Yes.

1615
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,020
You want one that's going to tear our fucking listeners' ears pieces?

1616
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,020
I'm ready.

1617
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,020
Crafty asks, can y'all sing?

1618
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,020
Oh.

1619
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:53,020
When I was a young boy, my father took me into the city to see a marching band.

1620
01:07:53,020 --> 01:08:00,020
He said something crazy story all about how my life got different upside down and I'd

1621
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:03,020
like to take a minute to sit right there and I'll tell y'all to pretend it's all over

1622
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,020
there.

1623
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:09,020
I pulled up to the house around 7-8 and I helped to get to your home and told you later

1624
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,020
to my kingdom.

1625
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:15,020
I was like, why don't you let us sit around for a little while?

1626
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,020
Let it go.

1627
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,020
Let it go.

1628
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,020
Let it go.

1629
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,020
Let it go.

1630
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,020
Let it go.

1631
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:31,020
I want to change.

1632
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:38,400
I'm not gonna stand here and wait.

1633
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,520
hopefully Our wonderful editor will fade out at some point during that.

1634
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,020
No, we're still going.

1635
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,020
Don't cut it.

1636
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,020
Don't cut it.

1637
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,020
We're still going.

1638
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:54,700
I guess that's true I'm just gonna say goodbye now. Bye. Bye. Goodbye. Fuck you

1639
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
Sorry

1640
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:32,460
My dick I'm jerking myself I'm sucking I am an asshole I am a stupid I've got a deadline don't want to do it
