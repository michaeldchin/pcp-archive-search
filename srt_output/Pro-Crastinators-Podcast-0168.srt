00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:15,200
TPC, PCP, that is what I want for me, and welcome back. I'm the best guy ever, and we're joined by Hippocrit.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:26,200
Hey, the SleepTight Bandcamp is up, and you can get the Gay for a Day album right now over on sleeptight.bandcamp.com. Link in the description.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,700
I listened to it. It was a heck of a time.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
We got Munchy. It sounds better than the live one. True.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,900
You know, guys, I was having like a really good day today. Like, you know, like I woke up in my bed, just to further clarify, my race car bed.

7
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,500
And like, I just looked around my beautiful room full of posters of bitches, all legs spread.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,700
And I came up the starting gate knowing it was going to be another great day being straight.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,800
But what's this I see in my Discord? Oh, it's the PCP? Oh, I'm feeling a little bit gay, guys.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:04,100
I'm a little bit like, homosexual right now. Oh, God, I think I might be turning gay for a day right now in this Discord call.

11
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Major cringe, my dude. Major cringe. We've got Tom Oliver.

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Look, as somebody who's gay every day, I'm offended by the fact that you're taking my identity and leveraging it for fame and musical shenanigans.

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,100
Unbelievable fame.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,100
I suspect you're a gay trender, Munchy. A mere gay trender.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,200
I know. It's fashionable to be gay right now, so I'm doing it. I mean, if it were fashionable to wear the color red, you would do so.

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I do want to give it a deep look. I'm red for a day.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
You're going to be sleeping tight in your grave when I'm through.

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, dude, I'm red for a day. I say turn into bin sain, except I never become not bin sain.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
There he is, Ben.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, yes. And hey, guess what? If you're listening right now, the next episode of Grimp is out. I'll link that in the description.

21
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
Go listen to Grimp, too.

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
What does Grimp mean? Is there a meaning behind that?

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Wouldn't you like to know?

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh, I dearly would, but I never will.

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
If I listen, will I find out?

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,100
You'll just have to listen and find out whether you'll find out.

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,100
I guess that's true.

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Damn, that's double-layer marketing.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,100
I also have a thing to say, so it's not out yet, but okay, here's a larger subject.

31
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,100
So it's just that, no, this is all good, and you'll be probably happy slash excited to hear it.

32
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,100
It's just that I am currently working on a project with one, my work is done.

33
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
I have a not nearly as much work as he does.

34
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Best anime ever goes in the shell? Yeah, we know. You've been working on it for like five years.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:45,100
No, no, no, not that. I'm working on something with one Nexus Mania artist, professional human being.

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,100
He makes his living being a human being.

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,100
If you haven't read them, they're comics by Nexus Mania and they're fucking good.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Yes, he is very talented. He does animation stuff.

39
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,100
He did a couple of things for, like, he did the Weagua opening animation I used at one point.

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I know him for the cork-cursed background.

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,100
Very true, very true. He does the art for the podcast most of the time.

42
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Now, I was very explicit. We've been talking about a project of his for a long time,

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,100
and I clarified what I'm allowed to say because a lot of it's secret, but I am doing voice acting.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,100
This is an actual voice acting gig. I will be receiving money for this work, which is very exciting.

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,100
And my part's all done. There's other bits left to be done. It's a pretty big animation project.

46
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,100
It is an animation that Nexus is doing. I'm extremely excited about it.

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:43,100
I think it's going to be dope as hell. Script is pretty sick, pretty tight, and it's got me as the only people who matter.

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Can we have a hint as to what the nature of this animation is?

49
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:56,100
I don't think I'm supposed to say even any details as to what the story is about or who's involved with it.

50
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Is it like an anime OP? Is it like a music video or is it like a show?

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:11,100
It's like its own little contained story of Nexus's that he wrote and he's been working on.

52
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
It's its own thing, but it's very funny, it's very meta, it's very cool,

53
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,100
and I have no doubt that the animation will be stellar when it's complete.

54
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
It's pretty short, probably only going to be like, I don't know, less than maybe like five minutes long.

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
But for an animation, that's pretty sizable.

56
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I know this probably isn't it, but being a huge fan of Bunny Wave, I kind of wish it was the date that's going to happen in the arc of Bunny Wave

57
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,100
and you were voicing Max, the fucking cringelord guy who tries to be really cocky and popular at school,

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,100
but he's actually super insecure, which is basically you anyways.

59
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Bunny also kind of shares that, but yeah, true, but I won't even say if it's that or not,

60
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,100
but it's something and it's coming in by the end of August, I think it's the deadline.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,100
By the end of August sometime, that'll be out and I could not be more excited about it.

62
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Love you Nexus, keep up the good work, thanks for the money.

63
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Well, as we all know, anything that's talked about in the PCP by Nate doesn't come out, so...

64
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
That's like six weeks away.

65
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
I know, I know, he's got a lot of work ahead.

66
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Alright, well Grimp is out now, and guess what?

67
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,100
The topic, yeah, so what's two in the hand, one in the bush, whatever.

68
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,100
And the topic is, should we, aka Grimp, talk about politics?

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
So there you go.

70
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,100
We can keep it contained, yeah, we can keep it quarantined.

71
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,100
A discussion about if you even should discuss politics.

72
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Yes, the question is should we.

73
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
I find that a relevant and interesting discussion.

74
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Actually, that's a discussion I am interested in having in general.

75
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Find out, find out what we conclude right now.

76
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Unlike this fucking animation that will never happen.

77
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Six weeks, the fucking world will have ended by then.

78
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
You know Nexus talks sometimes.

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Climate change!

80
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Yeah, oh fuck.

81
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,100
When I was talking to Nexus, he was just like, yeah, you know, just doing my work for, he does like...

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,100
I think it's called Dragon Ball R&R, which I shamefully have never actually checked out,

83
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,100
but apparently is good.

84
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Nexus works on it, so I assume it is.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,100
But he was just like, yeah, I just didn't sleep last night, just like worked all night.

86
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I was like, oh, is that your life?

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Sorry about that.

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Maybe change, maybe do something differently.

89
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
That's a life of every artist who tries.

90
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
If you want to get anywhere in the world, you just have to give up.

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
You have to give up on having any life at all.

92
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
There's nothing in this world I hate more than staying up all night.

93
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I hate it so much.

94
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
It's not that bad.

95
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
It's honestly not that bad.

96
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
No, that's just your youth buff.

97
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
I need to wear it out in about five years.

98
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I need to hashtag sleep tight, if you know what I'm saying.

99
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I have no idea what you're saying, in fact.

100
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Listen, I've developed ever since...

101
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:57,100
I relate to you all the story of this war, ARG, that I worked tirelessly on throughout the nights.

102
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,100
And ever since then, my life...

103
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,100
The only thing that curbed this was Hippo, but before then, I was just staying up for a day,

104
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
then going up for another day.

105
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
So I would just be awake for 24 hours, if not more.

106
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Sleep for 12 hours, 36 hours, 36 hours, just over and over and over again.

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
And that just was my life.

108
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
And you know what, honestly?

109
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Pretty good. I liked it. It was pretty good.

110
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
It had a lot of fun.

111
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
I think staying up all night might be human core.

112
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Yeah.

113
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
No.

114
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
And I think it's something that I'm guilty of.

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Is that like post-human core?

116
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Because you're deviating from our natural biological urges?

117
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I think it's something that...

118
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Well, I mean...

119
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
There was some discussion on Twitter about what is...

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Being human core means you can deviate from what you're literally naturally inclined to do.

121
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I mean, human core pertains to society, pertains to civilization.

122
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Because the whole point of being a human is that you're not following animal instincts.

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,100
I would say staying up is human core.

124
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
Sleeping normal eight hours is animal core.

125
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay, there was a debate between I'll die of I'll die corp and Dax tier on Twitter.

126
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,100
And Dax tier said human core is following your base instincts.

127
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,100
And I'll die said human core is what separates a human from the animal.

128
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
So it's the exact opposite of that.

129
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Yeah.

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,100
And I'm more inclined to think that it is about base instincts.

131
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
But that's not all it is.

132
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Because like tradition, following traditions and like culture,

133
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
like traditional culture is human core.

134
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Like going to church is human core.

135
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Is there like a social human core and a biological human core?

136
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
And agriculture is human core.

137
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,100
The way I use human core, and I speak as an authority as the most human core person on Earth,

138
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I use human core as a distinctress from the animals.

139
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,100
You should buy my human core shirt available at teespring.com slash human core.

140
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Which is why I say the two things that you have to do to become a human are

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
is own a dog and eat bed.

142
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
And also buy my shirt.

143
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Also buy his shirt.

144
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
What if I eat rice instead of bread?

145
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
What if I'm an ass bread?

146
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I think that's difficult.

147
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
Okay.

148
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
That's just another bread.

149
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
My onigiri and I'll chow down.

150
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Rice is just lots of little loaves of bread.

151
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah.

152
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Natural bread.

153
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh, you know what?

154
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh my God.

155
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Okay, actually that launches me directly into the other thing I wanted to talk about today.

156
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
And you will love this.

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Guys, be ready to salivate.

158
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Be ready to jerk your own dick.

159
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
You know what?

160
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Honestly, I don't think I will.

161
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
I do that every episode.

162
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
It's that.

163
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Okay, so Michelle got like an Amazon prepared meal box dish.

164
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
A cured one from the ether.

165
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,100
And I personally 100% cooked that meal from start to finish.

166
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
And this was.

167
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
This was sale.

168
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Is this just...

169
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
Yeah, go on.

170
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Is this just...

171
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
So fresh for Amazon.

172
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
I was just gonna say, is this just Hello Fresh by another name?

173
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,100
That's exactly what this is.

174
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Okay, then I won't explain my feelings about it because you are...

175
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
We know.

176
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
We have made them perfectly clear in the past.

177
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
All right.

178
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,100
But why is it an Amazon version of why not just go with Hello Fresh?

179
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Well, I mean, because she got this for free.

180
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
This was free.

181
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
So like she just got it.

182
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Because Amazon, having more money than anyone else, can corner every market and therefore

183
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
do everything cheaper than everyone else and therefore kill all competition.

184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Absolutely true.

185
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,100
That's what we call the free market.

186
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,100
That is one way that it operates, which is suboptimal.

187
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Totally agree.

188
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Totally agree.

189
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,100
But the point being, so it's basically Hello Fresh, just whatever.

190
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Amazon variant.

191
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,100
It was like a sweet and spicy shrimp over, I think it was like...

192
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,100
What was the word?

193
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Marbled couscous.

194
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Something like that.

195
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Marbled couscous.

196
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It wasn't marbled.

197
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
It was like...

198
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
No, it was called fucking...

199
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh, purled.

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
It was called over like seasoned purled couscous.

201
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
That's the word that they used.

202
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
What is purled?

203
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
It's like more spherical couscous.

204
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
I think it's made of rice couscous and it's like round...

205
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
No, it's basically just a rice.

206
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Just think of it as rice.

207
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Yeah, it's like the same thing.

208
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Is it literally made from rice?

209
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Is that accurate?

210
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I don't think so.

211
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
It's functionally the same as rice.

212
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Was it purled or pearl couscous?

213
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,100
I believe it said purled with a D, purled adjective.

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Okay.

215
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
And okay, I don't know why, but okay.

216
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
This required me, your boy, BGE Nate,

217
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
literally the most human corpsman on the planet now.

218
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Now that I've done this.

219
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Okay, yes, sure.

220
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I have...

221
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
You prepare two separate things.

222
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,100
On the one, you prepare this delicious multi-stage shrimp ragu

223
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
where you, individually, you grill the shrimp.

224
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
Nothing like a good ragu.

225
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.

226
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You prepare the shrimp, you grill it, you move it aside,

227
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,100
then you put in all the vegetables,

228
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
you grill your onions, you grill your peppers,

229
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,100
you grill your various other things that were with that.

230
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
You pour on your seasonings and shit.

231
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
You cook all that, you marble it up real nice.

232
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,100
Then you pour in the tomato paste or whatever it is,

233
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
and then you stir all that together.

234
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
You make your ragu slop.

235
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Then you re-add the fucking shrimp back into it,

236
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
which has already been cooked to perfection

237
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
and browned into a golden, crispy dream.

238
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
You warm that all up.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
You put the shrimp back in, you warm it back up.

240
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
That's your ragu.

241
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
That's your ragu.

242
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
On the other side, you're preparing your couscous,

243
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,100
which is you put in a pot, you don't use water.

244
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,100
You use what was referred to as, I think it was called clam moisture.

245
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
No, no, it was like clam water or something like that.

246
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
What the fuck?

247
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
It was like clam juice or something like that.

248
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
It's the equivalent of using like a chicken stock or something.

249
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Yeah, there I am.

250
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Exactly.

251
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,100
There I am.

252
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Fucking some Islander ride, some native Islander.

253
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Yeah.

254
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Plying my national trade, I dive deep into the coastal coral reefs

255
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,100
and I go down and I pick up clams and I bring them to the top

256
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
and I crack them open into a bucket

257
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
and I find the pearls within and I throw them in the garbage

258
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
and I squeeze out that sweet, sweet clam moisture.

259
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
That's where the money's at.

260
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
That's basically what happened.

261
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
So you pour in that stock or whatever,

262
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
you pour in the couscous, you just cook that

263
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
and that cooks down and absorbs all the water.

264
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,100
You just have this delicious little marbles of couscous.

265
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
And then I think what makes it, what did I say?

266
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
A pearl.

267
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
A pearl.

268
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
Is that you just pour in, like you just put butter,

269
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
like a little thing of butter that comes in there

270
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
and then you sprinkle like it's oregano.

271
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
I think it was oregano.

272
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
You just stir that and oh my god,

273
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,100
that was the most delicious looking, shiny little marbles of couscous

274
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I've ever seen with the oregano all over it.

275
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
And then once those two separate things are cooked,

276
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,100
then you combine them in the bowls that you are serving with.

277
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You put your couscous on the bottom,

278
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
10 out of 10 looks incredible,

279
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
and then you pour your shrimp ragu.

280
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,100
In the middle of two, it was, it was an absolutely

281
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
incredibly delicious meal.

282
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,100
But I would have traded it all away

283
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,100
for another 45 minutes of precious Minecraft playtime.

284
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
I could have gotten so many diamonds

285
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
instead of preparing this fucking meal.

286
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I regret it so intensely.

287
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't give a shit about food.

288
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I want my Minecraft stats back.

289
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I want, I could have been building a tower.

290
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
I could have been building sky towers

291
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
and connective shit, it's connective tissue

292
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,940
to make my world more optimal to optimize towards Starfleet.

293
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,420
What a fucking waste it was making this fucking meal,

294
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,180
even though it was like the best meal I've had

295
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,860
in the last six months or so.

296
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
So that was great.

297
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
The best meal you've had in six months.

298
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,980
Well, I went to like the best restaurant sincey,

299
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,820
that was better.

300
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,500
But like the best one I've had like at home,

301
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,340
and it was incredible.

302
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
It was delicious.

303
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,980
You've been pulling what you accused Digi of last episode,

304
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,380
which is just saying like the most basic things

305
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,660
of all time and then sounding like you've found out

306
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,460
like the secrets of the universe.

307
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,220
Like an unbrewable revolution about what's happening.

308
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,340
I describe in such glowing terms cooking,

309
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,540
and then I counter that by saying,

310
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,860
I wish I'd played Minecraft.

311
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,100
That's the joke.

312
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,220
And you, sir, are not recognizing the joke.

313
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,700
I understood that you wasted your time

314
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,820
because you don't know how to cook effectively,

315
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,660
because you're following this.

316
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,900
Well, I did cook effectively.

317
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,740
I did exactly what the recipe said.

318
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,980
This is this bullshit Amazon fucking

319
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,820
what are you talking about?

320
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,180
Fisher price, goddamn recipe.

321
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,420
This was the most efficient cooking process of all time.

322
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,100
Munchie, have you come over to my side

323
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,580
on the Hello Fresh issue?

324
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,700
No, well, okay, what I'm trying,

325
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,180
Ben, what I've said a thousand times is that I agree with you.

326
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,420
All I've ever said is that there is a reason

327
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,580
why some people would want to use Hello Fresh.

328
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,540
All I ever said, all you ever said,

329
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,260
don't tell me you don't have like your stock.

330
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,380
You don't have, you're not speculating in stock

331
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,580
in Hello Fresh right this second.

332
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,140
I, listen, I used to be a Hello Fresh person.

333
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,620
Convert all your Bitcoin to Hello Fresh stock.

334
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,860
And then I haven't needed Hello Fresh

335
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,980
in like six months, like Hello Fresh is dead to me.

336
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,540
I have no more use for it.

337
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,940
Okay, all right, good.

338
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,380
Hey guys, ready for this gem?

339
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,580
This was just commented.

340
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,780
Wait, wait, I want to say a little cooking story

341
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,620
because like, I'm not like, I don't do my research.

342
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,020
I don't study recipes.

343
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,940
I know how to cook very basic things.

344
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,820
I don't know things, I don't understand stuff

345
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,020
and I don't comprehend how I like it.

346
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,940
And I've been like, just sort of like,

347
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,100
passively being interested in cooking

348
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,300
because Munchie is also interested in it

349
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,940
and it's sort of like rubbing off of me.

350
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,780
Really?

351
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,380
Ooh, that's really nice to hear.

352
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,740
Yeah, just like through the past few months.

353
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,500
I mean, I know your guys would do it too.

354
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,620
Oh yeah, well the thing is dad cooks so much

355
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,300
that it's never really an issue for me to need to cook.

356
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,860
But I wanted to like learn how to just cook rice well.

357
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,540
And I try to make like,

358
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,380
this brand new invention called rice

359
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,300
with a fried egg on the top of it.

360
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,140
Oh, nice.

361
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,740
And I made a thing of rice and I had the rice

362
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,380
and I fried an egg and I fried it bad

363
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,700
and the yellow, the yolk cracked and then I just put it on top.

364
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,380
I think they call that recipe sunrise

365
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,100
over the sunrise kingdom.

366
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,940
That's like rice to pan, you know?

367
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,340
I'm pretty sure that is actually

368
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,180
like a real Japanese dish, fried egg on top of rice.

369
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,940
I think that's called moon over Miami.

370
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,020
Oh no, I've seen it in anime

371
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,300
and I've also eaten a bowl of rice and stuff

372
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
with an egg on top.

373
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,260
You know, when I was in college,

374
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,340
I just cracked a raw egg into a thing of rice.

375
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,180
It was like the most disgusting thing I've ever eaten,

376
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,780
but I've seen it in anime.

377
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,580
Because I saw it in anime and I was like, that makes sense.

378
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,140
If the rice is hot, then the egg will cook.

379
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,380
This did not cook.

380
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,620
Right, well, yeah, there's definitely a technique to it.

381
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,580
Yeah, I mean, if egg fried rice was easy to make,

382
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,420
I would make that. Oh, I love that.

383
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,260
That's good.

384
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,180
That's not even hard, dude.

385
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,140
It's not hard, but it requires like more

386
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,220
than just a frying pan and nothing else.

387
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,300
Well, I mean a bowl, but like, that was my cooking story.

388
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,460
I just made a rice and put egg on it

389
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,180
and I didn't have the runny yolk,

390
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,820
so it was kind of lame and boring and I ate all of it.

391
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,580
But, you know, it didn't take very long

392
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,980
and I got some, you know, some energy from it.

393
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,740
So I don't even think it was that bad.

394
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,020
Dude, think about how many diamonds

395
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,340
you could have gotten instead of doing that.

396
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,820
I want to circle back to Nate here,

397
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,740
because I mean, I believe that everyone

398
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,700
can benefit from cooking in some way.

399
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,300
And then I think that what you're doing

400
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,380
is not the way that cooking can benefit you, Nate,

401
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,100
because it's not about, there's no one way to cook, right?

402
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,420
There's no one benefit you get from it.

403
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,220
And so the idea of being able to, you know,

404
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,300
perfectly make the exact, you know, fancy meal

405
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,460
and take all fucking day to do,

406
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,060
that's not what would appeal to you or benefit you in any way.

407
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,100
Well, you could see that would benefit you,

408
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,460
is there are recipes and there are ways to cook

409
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,900
and just make food that are far faster, far cheaper,

410
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,300
and also able to be far more healthy

411
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
than getting alternatives, like ordering in,

412
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,540
or, you know, or getting delivery.

413
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,580
I'll stop you right there, Munch,

414
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,820
because you're absolutely right.

415
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,900
And my boy Scooby, fitness God,

416
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,100
has an extensive series about him

417
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,460
who can barely cook at all,

418
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,980
but he has tons of like fitness-oriented meals

419
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,340
that they take like five minutes to make

420
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,860
and they are delicious

421
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,340
and eating out is a waste of money and mostly money,

422
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,380
and you shouldn't do it pretty much ever.

423
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,860
So I couldn't agree more,

424
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,980
and that's the kind of shit that,

425
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,500
when I was at my physical peak,

426
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,740
I was cooking myself those kind of meals,

427
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,340
like, I mean, every single day,

428
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,660
I made my own food and stuff.

429
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,860
That's a great segue.

430
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,140
I just want to do it too.

431
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

432
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,740
Okay, sorry.

433
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,980
Then wait your turn.

434
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,140
I was just going to say like the whole rice thing.

435
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,820
I feel like I'm going on like a very slow,

436
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,780
like inefficiently slow journey of discovery,

437
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,140
because a few weeks ago,

438
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,580
I did a bowl of rice with some baked beans in it,

439
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,100
and the baked bean juice was really nice.

440
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,060
Earlier than that, I did just a bowl of rice,

441
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,540
and I was like, there's not enough flavor.

442
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,260
So I've been adding, you know, one thing at a time,

443
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,460
learning how to do like very basic baby shit,

444
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,860
but each time it's still a whole bowl of rice,

445
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,420
and that's like very filling.

446
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,900
So if you want to like cook without a lot of like prep

447
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,660
or like hassle, you know, you like beans,

448
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,140
just do a beans and rice thing,

449
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,260
and learn how to make it really efficiently,

450
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,660
and then maybe make it in bulk,

451
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,820
and then just reheat it.

452
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Make it in bulk.

453
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,940
Oh, dude, okay, speaking of making it in bulk here,

454
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,660
hippo, I've got your next big target here.

455
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,260
I've got like a bounty for you,

456
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,860
putting down a wanted for risotto.

457
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,180
If you're being like a rice god,

458
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,580
if that's the new way that you're taking your life,

459
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,100
make a risotto because it is delicious,

460
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,500
and it is risotto.

461
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,980
It is an Italian dish that you probably have heard of.

462
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
I've heard of it.

463
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,620
And it is delicious.

464
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,020
Dude, risotto, just like in the movies.

465
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,180
Literally.

466
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,780
Me and a guy, me and a guy, I used to know,

467
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,100
we had a little running joke between us,

468
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,380
and the running joke was simply that when we saw Pepsi,

469
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,620
we would say, wow, Pepsi, just like in the movie.

470
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,980
That's a pretty good joke.

471
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,020
Those are rich folks in their Pepsi in the movies.

472
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,620
Dude, yeah.

473
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,380
Okay, speaking of bulk,

474
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,500
and also being at your physical peak,

475
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,740
I'm lifting again for real.

476
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,180
I've heard all about it.

477
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,980
I'm squatting and deadlifting and going nuts,

478
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,420
and I think I've done like three workouts so far,

479
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,460
and that's enough to establish a pattern.

480
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,380
Three is a pattern.

481
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,220
I'm so fucking jealous of you.

482
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,260
I was doing so good with my fucking working out

483
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,940
before my spine broke into pieces.

484
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,780
That's understandable.

485
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,380
I was doing so bad with it.

486
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,220
I feel...

487
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,580
Until Tom's spine broke, and then you got inspired.

488
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,700
You're still my juju, you bastard.

489
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,540
Yeah, yeah.

490
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,060
I was, you know, well, haha.

491
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
There could only be one fit person.

492
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,340
I have to break this guy's spine.

493
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,180
What about Nate?

494
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,700
Yes, you had more to gain from killing Nate than killing me.

495
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
Nate just like looks at it.

496
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,780
Nate lives further away, therefore.

497
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,980
I'm a cream puff.

498
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm all flash, no substance.

499
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,860
Nate's the final boss.

500
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,540
You have to like...

501
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,420
Ben's like Goku.

502
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,980
He wants to fight Frieza at his highest power,

503
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,380
so he has to let Nate stay strong.

504
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,220
Yes.

505
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
We're going to get the fat Nate song.

506
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,500
That's what I'm waiting for.

507
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,620
It's never going to happen.

508
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,500
I dream of the day.

509
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,340
I got lads.

510
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,300
I've been tracking my calories like a hawk

511
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,180
the last two weeks.

512
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,020
I'm down roughly four pounds or so,

513
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,100
and it's just smooth sailing down to my...

514
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,540
I will look like a god when I'm at my 170th target.

515
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm just the perpetual flab fag at this point.

516
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,420
I just can't fix it.

517
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,420
You will lower your calories, I guess, Starve?

518
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,620
Just, okay.

519
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,020
Let me just clarify.

520
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,220
If you actually have a calorie target people out there

521
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,940
that think it's so hard to not eat right,

522
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,780
let the...

523
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,860
Calories is the big, the cheap way.

524
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,900
Just like eat your calories.

525
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,740
It's all you got to do.

526
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,940
Just track what you eat in one day.

527
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,500
You will instantly in one day be like,

528
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,260
wow, I'm sure fucking up, and then it's so easy.

529
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Once you understand what you're dealing with,

530
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,100
you'll be like, oh, I can easily not eat that.

531
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,460
I'll just eat this instead.

532
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,020
Once you do that, that's why the whatever diet

533
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,260
is so powerful.

534
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,420
It just makes you aware.

535
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,500
Being conscious is the most important thing.

536
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,820
I have a general question about that.

537
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,500
Just don't eat bulk grains.

538
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,940
Even if you're not keto, right?

539
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,060
I mean, I like keto, but even if you don't want to go

540
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,860
full keto, stop eating bulk grains.

541
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,980
Stop eating bread, stop eating rice.

542
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,500
I'm never doing this again,

543
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,580
pretty much for the rest of my life.

544
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,100
I would just be like, hey, I'm hungry.

545
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,460
Oh, a loaf of bread.

546
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,660
I could, one of the things I'll do,

547
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,260
I'll just eat pieces raw.

548
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,060
I'll just do that for a while.

549
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,580
I'll make bread or toast.

550
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,940
That's a great snack, right?

551
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,580
It's so easy to just eat an infinite amount

552
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,180
of cereal or bread or stuff like that.

553
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,260
Carbs are my bane, absolutely.

554
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Bread was the peasant food,

555
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,660
and the bourgeois created it to keep the peasants down,

556
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,700
keep them weak, keep them fat, keep them dying.

557
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,620
Let them eat cake, let them eat bread,

558
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,100
basically the same thing.

559
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,420
Swear to God, it's true.

560
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,580
I've said it before, grains are not the thing

561
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,020
that humans evolve to eat.

562
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,500
Grains are a thing that were invented later

563
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,980
after the onset of large civilizations

564
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,140
because they are not the most nutritious thing,

565
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,980
but they are the most effective way

566
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,620
to feed a large population,

567
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,780
but they're not the healthiest thing

568
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,060
on an individual level.

569
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,420
Seems reasonable.

570
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,020
A question about tracking calories.

571
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,260
Yeah.

572
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,540
Say you eat a sandwich.

573
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,580
Do you have to count how many slices of ham

574
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,380
or gauge how much butter you put on

575
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,740
and then check the packaging

576
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,860
and then divide it by a certain amount?

577
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,340
Because that seems like it's gonna be difficult.

578
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,460
Can you count?

579
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,660
Can you count?

580
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,220
Then it's not that hard.

581
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,380
No, no, no, look, look, look.

582
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,860
We live in a civilized age.

583
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,180
We don't need to fucking do math manually anymore.

584
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,220
If you just get my fitness pounds, an app,

585
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,540
you just type in ham sandwich,

586
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,980
it has a ham sandwich there,

587
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,180
and it gives you the baseline of what it would be,

588
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,980
and you can ballpark it pretty reasonably

589
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,740
just by saying, oh, I have a ham sandwich,

590
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,660
it's just there, you click it,

591
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,740
it tells you what's in it, and you're good.

592
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,300
The thing that always gets me about the idea of that,

593
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,980
because I've never tried,

594
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,620
is just like you eat one sweet thing

595
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,260
out of a packet of sweet things,

596
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,100
and you have to check the packet

597
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,180
and then divide by the number

598
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,980
of the maximum sweet things in there.

599
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,060
Well, what's cool with my fitness pow is that you can,

600
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,580
let's say you get like a thing of Swedish fish

601
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,460
or something, like in this example,

602
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,180
you can use your phone,

603
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,220
scan the barcode of the box of Swedish fish,

604
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,500
and it'll bring up the information,

605
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,020
and then you can pick the serving size.

606
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,540
If you had one fish, one serving, or one container,

607
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,300
and then it'll do the math for you.

608
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,900
I didn't know about that, that's cool.

609
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,860
See, knowing that would make it much easier

610
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,180
for me to start if I were to need to do that.

611
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,740
Yet, my fitness pow, there's a reason

612
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,900
Jack's Blade has been logged in

613
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,940
for like 2,000 days in a row.

614
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,780
Fan?

615
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,140
Oh my God, that's incredible.

616
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,700
I'm in a streak of probably maybe two weeks,

617
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,820
maybe a little bit more right now.

618
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,980
It's about the same.

619
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,940
I'm just saying, I'm doing pretty good.

620
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,860
That's all, Bunchy.

621
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,620
I'm not trying to fight you, but now I am.

622
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,460
Oh man.

623
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,020
Ah, cheese guy, cheese.

624
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,100
Well, you know, things are going well for me.

625
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,940
I'm doing good.

626
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,660
I haven't been working out as much as I need to,

627
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,700
but I'm getting better every day.

628
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,780
I believe in myself.

629
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,620
And I'm gonna do it.

630
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,460
This is nice.

631
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,620
There's a fitness air in the air.

632
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,900
There's a miasma of health.

633
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,540
Just sort of permeating around.

634
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
This is a fact.

635
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,300
If you live in a place where people

636
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,180
are health conscious in general,

637
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,460
you just will gravitate towards like the mean

638
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,020
of what that lifestyle is like.

639
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,460
Like if you live in California,

640
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,100
I guarantee you are in 10 times better shape

641
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,620
than if you just live in Ohio.

642
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,780
I mean, like I've said before,

643
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,900
the Ohio staple of diet is chili with cheese equivalent

644
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,780
to the amount of chili underneath it,

645
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,100
at least in terms of volume.

646
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
Cheese is fucked up.

647
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,260
Yeah, it is fucked up.

648
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,820
I think I just had a heart attack listening to that sentence.

649
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,500
It's piled with cheese in this fucking city.

650
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,580
It's fucked up.

651
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,420
Dude.

652
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,460
Shouldn't be that way.

653
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
It's keto, man.

654
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,220
I, yeah, it's keto.

655
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,420
I bought, yesterday I bought a no joke,

656
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,540
like seven pounds of cheese.

657
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,580
And I ate it all right then.

658
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,740
Well, okay, there you go.

659
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,580
There you go.

660
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,660
Cheese is fired on keto,

661
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,140
but if you're not burning the fat

662
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,260
and just storing it, you're fucked.

663
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,820
But you should be exercising.

664
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,500
I was traveling out of state,

665
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,700
I forget where I was, I think it was in Nevada somewhere.

666
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,100
And I ordered just like a side of broccoli

667
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,060
because I wasn't very hungry.

668
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,700
I didn't want to partake in whatever fried shit was happening.

669
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,060
So I ordered broccoli and it came back

670
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,260
just covered in like cheeses.

671
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,780
Broccoli and cheese, yeah.

672
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,580
But like the reason I eat broccoli

673
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,220
is because it makes my body feel good.

674
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,100
When I eat cheese, it doesn't make me feel,

675
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,780
like what's the point of this then?

676
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,100
There is no problem.

677
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,180
I don't understand, what's wrong with cheese?

678
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,820
There's nothing wrong, I love cheese.

679
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,660
It's just that-

680
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,140
Well, much is probably getting enough calories already.

681
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,980
He's trying to eat a low calorie thing, I assume.

682
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,100
Well, I mean, it's exactly-

683
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,460
Cheese is good on keto, but if you're not on keto

684
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,780
and you're not in ketosis and you're not burning fat,

685
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,620
you're just-

686
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,460
Then you're fucking up.

687
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,860
Then you're making a mistake.

688
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,860
But in this Pacific scenario,

689
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,460
of course the cheese is a bad thing.

690
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,340
I used to be like that.

691
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,620
I used to be in the dark.

692
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,460
Oh, I'm like that again.

693
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,140
And then I used to be in the dark,

694
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,260
watching the shadows, watching shadow puppets on the wall

695
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,300
until someone brought me out into the light

696
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,460
and I saw the sun.

697
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,220
And now I'm coming back into that cave

698
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,900
to drag you all out to show you truth.

699
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,900
People including me have such a thought in their head

700
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,580
when you're not on the wagon,

701
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,540
as to how incredibly hard any of this stuff is,

702
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,380
like losing weight and again,

703
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,420
I might fuck up and I'm tempted constantly by things.

704
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,460
Not every day has been perfect.

705
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,620
I go over my calorie count every once in a while.

706
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,980
But like, if you just put a little bit of effort in it,

707
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,180
this is just tracking your calories.

708
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,300
I understand, a lot of people are so,

709
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,780
as we've learned in this call,

710
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,740
pathetically ignorant about calorie counting

711
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,580
and how to manage-

712
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,660
Wait, who are you talking about?

713
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,740
You, Ben, you.

714
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,580
What?

715
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,420
What do you mean?

716
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
I thought I thought you were talking about me.

717
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,100
Not actually you.

718
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
You just didn't know something

719
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,060
about my fitness pal that's totally understandable.

720
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,500
But like, people don't know.

721
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,340
That's such a cool feature.

722
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,300
As was evidenced in this call,

723
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,060
that like, if you look at the nutrition facts

724
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,780
on the back of like, for example, a loaf of bread,

725
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,660
people think like, oh, it's so hard to track.

726
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,380
But on that nutrition label, it says,

727
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,500
like what it does is it divvies it up by serving

728
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,900
and it tells you what a serving is,

729
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,300
like one piece of bread.

730
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,820
If you eat a sandwich, that's two pieces of bread.

731
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,500
You just know that's two servings of like 100 calories.

732
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,140
It's so easy to track.

733
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,540
I have developed a sense.

734
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,100
I have developed like a pretty good sense of like,

735
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,100
like I can judge a tablespoon of butter by eye

736
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,460
for example, stuff like that.

737
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,540
I just kind of know.

738
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,340
I just know which things have carbs in them and which don't.

739
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,500
I don't have to look at the label.

740
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,860
The hardest part though, by far, is getting started.

741
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,540
That's where 99% of people have their issues.

742
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,060
It's that 80-20 rule.

743
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,940
You're gonna get, you get the most benefit

744
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,580
out of that first 20%.

745
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,540
You just like a little, even a little effort

746
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,260
in anything, in this, like in anything else,

747
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,740
goes a long way.

748
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,340
And like, I don't know, like the keto work for you,

749
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,180
that's fantastic.

750
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,420
But for me, just counting my calories,

751
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,100
I've lost like four pounds in about two weeks.

752
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,740
And you know, I'm sure it's not perfect.

753
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,500
These things fluctuate, but it really works.

754
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,220
And I'm gonna keep doing it for the next couple of months

755
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,380
until I'm perfect and then I'll focus on like bulking,

756
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,700
to gain more muscle and stuff.

757
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,100
It's honestly really fucking easy.

758
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
If you just are, get my fitness pal.

759
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,460
If you care about this, do that.

760
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,260
Try tracking your calories for one day, for one day.

761
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,620
It's not hard.

762
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,180
It has all the tools you need.

763
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,740
And track your progress.

764
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,660
Arm yourself with knowledge, friends.

765
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,180
Indeed, indeed.

766
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,260
Okay, that's it.

767
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,260
While I was in England, I just kind of reflexively

768
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,220
checked the calories of whatever I'm eating,

769
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,860
and just, I don't even, just even fun, honestly,

770
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,380
just to see what's going on.

771
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,780
And the European like dietary thing on the back,

772
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,060
the nutritional facts, are like a maze.

773
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,220
Like I can't ascertain what's happening.

774
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,140
Like in America, it just is like

775
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,860
in giant, bold calories, whatever.

776
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,500
Even on like a zero calorie drink, which I had,

777
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,980
I just couldn't even find where it actually said

778
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,140
zero calories, besides the actual label.

779
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,340
Because we have such an epidemic over here,

780
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,420
of fatties, they gotta make it really clear.

781
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,260
That's true.

782
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,020
As a further selling point for my fitness pal,

783
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,460
I can't speak to losers or the other ones,

784
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,380
but like just so everyone know, it's so easy.

785
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,220
Here's what you do.

786
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,740
You measure, you get a scale.

787
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,700
A scale is important.

788
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,220
You say what you are right now.

789
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,060
Whatever your goal is, gain weight, lose weight, that's fine.

790
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,860
On the thing, you can set your goal.

791
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,500
If your goal is to lose weight,

792
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,260
you put in your target weight,

793
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,580
and then you set how fast you wanna lose it.

794
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,060
It just tells you how many calories

795
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,980
you need to eat per day, and you just have to fit that.

796
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,140
So it's, it gives you all the tools.

797
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,220
And what's sick is if you're under your calorie weight,

798
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,900
or your calorie count, and you end the day like that,

799
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,060
it'll give you a projection.

800
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,220
Like if you eat like this for another six weeks,

801
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,740
you will be at your target weight.

802
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,580
And it's just like, oh.

803
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,420
Exactly.

804
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,740
I can be the person I wanna be in six weeks,

805
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,060
in time for BronyCon.

806
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,220
Oh my God.

807
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,060
Exactly.

808
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,180
I feel like, I don't think it can really

809
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,420
calculate that accurately though.

810
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,260
Nothing, sure.

811
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,180
I kind of feel like if you're using that,

812
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,140
and you're like, oh, I'll weigh this much

813
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,660
at such and such time.

814
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,500
It's just for motivation.

815
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,940
You're setting yourself up for deployment,

816
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,380
because it's not actually gonna match up.

817
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,580
Well, you should never expect an exact result.

818
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,540
But like, if you follow the trend,

819
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,060
and you should track your progress

820
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,100
you should weigh yourself literally every day

821
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,340
at the same time per day,

822
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,500
I do it right when I wake up.

823
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,820
So that, like what matters is not the numbers,

824
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,780
because the numbers can fluctuate,

825
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,860
it's never perfectly accurate.

826
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,620
What matters is the trend line.

827
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,580
If the trend line's going the way you want it to go,

828
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,300
you know you're doing something right.

829
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,340
If it's not, then some good.

830
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,540
Imagine if there was an app to weigh yourself.

831
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,380
If you don't have a scale,

832
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,300
you just stand on your phone and it tells you.

833
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,140
That'd be nice.

834
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
Okay, okay.

835
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,180
Buy a scale, invest.

836
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,700
My roommate, my roommate has a,

837
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,180
he got a new scale, like a fancy scale, right?

838
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,620
And I've been weighing myself on it.

839
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,500
I find out after like several weeks

840
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,980
that this scale is connected to an app on his phone.

841
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,660
And every time I weigh myself,

842
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,260
he gets a report about how much I weigh.

843
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,100
Oh!

844
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,980
So he's, so like what time he's like,

845
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,860
hey Ben, I saw you lost a couple more pounds.

846
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,700
Congratulations.

847
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,180
I'm like, what the fuck, what the fuck do you know?

848
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,260
Dude, that's fucked up.

849
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,500
I know.

850
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,380
Just noticing you're a little more cut, Ben.

851
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,220
The guts getting smaller, I'm proud of you.

852
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
I didn't realize it was attached to his,

853
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,740
it was fucking connected by wifi or whatever it is.

854
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,340
I would love that function, but that is fucked up.

855
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,020
Now here's the million dollar question.

856
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,940
Did you ask permission to use a scale

857
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,780
or did you just start it?

858
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,620
Yeah, yes.

859
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,460
Hoping.

860
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,860
No, he told, no, he said, no, he said,

861
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,500
like, yeah, I got a new scale and I'm like,

862
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,660
and I'm like, cool, right?

863
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,500
It was, but you know, I can't,

864
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,140
I can't tell it like, hey, scale.

865
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,980
Don't count this one.

866
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,820
It's me, Ben.

867
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,660
Please no bully.

868
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,540
It's me, yeah, it's me, Ben.

869
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,940
It's not that other guy, it's this other guy.

870
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,620
You know that famous clip of the fat lady

871
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,700
hitting the scale?

872
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,220
It's only, it's Ben, he's like,

873
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,780
you will not report me to the authorities.

874
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,460
You will not tattle on me about my progress.

875
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,660
Wait, which clip?

876
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
There's a clip of like a fat lady,

877
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,620
not to, I'm not trying to be mean, but she is fat,

878
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,180
where she's like, she's saying like,

879
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,060
this scale has affected the self-esteem of women

880
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,060
like for generations and we're fighting back.

881
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,060
So she takes a hammer and she smashes the scale.

882
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,660
This is for, you know, hurting my feelings and whatnot.

883
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,340
Oh, is that a scale?

884
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,580
Yeah, it's a scale, it's a scale.

885
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,660
I thought she was using like,

886
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,420
I thought she was like smashing an American flag.

887
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,820
Um, I think that's-

888
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,140
They look exactly the same,

889
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,980
because I understand the confusion.

890
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,180
I've only seen that clip with like other things edited

891
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,020
over the thing.

892
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,540
Yeah, it does get me.

893
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,420
I just assumed it was an American,

894
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,900
God, okay, smashing the scale, all right.

895
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,700
Ben would see the American flag one

896
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,300
and use that as the reference point.

897
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,700
I just seemed like it was a political thing,

898
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,100
like the way she's talking.

899
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,060
Only the way it's been edited, not originally.

900
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,700
That would feel be like a very inefficient way

901
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,180
to destroy a flag with a hammer.

902
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,020
True.

903
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,860
You know, well that's true.

904
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,180
You know, someone brought the hammer,

905
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,260
the other one brought the sickle,

906
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,340
it was a, you know, they were trying to send a message.

907
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,020
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

908
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,700
Good times, good times.

909
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Speaking of keeping apps with keeping going for days on end.

910
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,140
Yeah.

911
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,980
I have been continuing my Duolingo journey

912
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,940
into languages.

913
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,860
They added Arabic, didn't they, on Arabic?

914
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,060
They have added Arabic since the last time I mentioned this,

915
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,820
and I have been going,

916
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,940
overall, I've been going for 42 days straight,

917
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,780
so that's pretty cool.

918
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,100
Hell yeah, nice.

919
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,180
Here's a review of Arabic, the language,

920
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,660
and also the lessons on Duolingo.

921
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,300
Arabic, very squiggly, very funny.

922
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Very strange in that like a letter will,

923
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,060
depending on where it is in the word,

924
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,780
will have a completely different shape,

925
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,620
but like parts of the shape will be recognizable.

926
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,100
So like the oo sound looks like a G.

927
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,620
And when you have a consonant followed by an oo sound,

928
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,740
a tiny version of that oo like G

929
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,860
will be like above the consonant.

930
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,820
But if it's at the end, it will just be by itself.

931
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,940
And then a consonants can like change shape,

932
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,300
depending on whether they're at the beginning

933
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,660
or the end of the sentence.

934
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,500
And it's very confusing until you just,

935
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
you know, you know what they are.

936
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,580
It's gonna internalize that weird shit.

937
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,060
And there was a moment,

938
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,860
I just remember when I was learning Japanese,

939
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,100
at the first, it looks like all squiggles.

940
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,420
There's just one point where it's like,

941
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,900
oh, I actually understand there's like actual meaning

942
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,220
attached to these squiggles.

943
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,060
And that's a really great moment to get to.

944
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,540
It's really satisfying.

945
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,220
You jump into like a new lesson

946
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,540
and there's a bunch of new squiggles

947
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,900
that they're introducing you to

948
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,340
and you don't know what they mean.

949
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,780
And you get them wrong a few times,

950
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,060
but then you realize like,

951
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,900
oh, one dot above this thing means an S sound,

952
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,980
but three dots above it means a sure sound.

953
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,700
So like you piece together the puzzle

954
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,980
and then when you see three dots,

955
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,140
you immediately know what it is.

956
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,060
And it's like, wow, I'm figuring it out.

957
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,460
I'm learning Arabic.

958
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,380
And I don't know any words

959
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,900
because Duolingo, the app, the Arabic course,

960
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,420
seems to be mostly introducing you

961
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,300
to the way these squiggles sound when you say them

962
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,740
and not into like explaining

963
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,900
what these squiggles can be turned into words.

964
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,060
I was just gonna ask

965
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,140
if you could say something for us in Arabic.

966
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,780
I suppose you gotta start with that though, right?

967
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Yeah, well, the other ones that I've been trying

968
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,900
like Hebrew and Chinese and stuff,

969
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,500
they quite quickly go into things like,

970
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,300
oh, a hospital is these characters

971
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,100
or a doctor or words that you can use in things

972
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,940
like, hello, goodbye, thank you.

973
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,860
Arabic, I've really only learned that America

974
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
and English and Scotland,

975
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,100
it's like, they just say the same thing in English,

976
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,220
but it's slightly different

977
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,660
because they didn't invent the words,

978
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,780
so it sounds the same.

979
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,220
And they've been giving me like names like Zaid

980
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,700
and Rosa and Otto,

981
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,780
and I've been figuring out like by looking at the squiggles

982
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,140
what sounds they would make

983
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,540
and figuring out the names.

984
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,300
But I mean, it's satisfying in that,

985
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,580
but I'm really wondering when I'm gonna get to a point

986
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,420
because I've done quite a lot of these lessons.

987
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,660
I haven't really got to a point

988
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,300
when I'm learning words yet,

989
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,820
but if I see an Arabic sign, I would be able to say it,

990
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,420
I just wouldn't know what I was saying.

991
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,340
That's interesting.

992
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,540
You know, I would think like as a professional

993
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,780
Japanese educator,

994
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,340
which I have made one video on on my channel,

995
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,260
you'd think that what you do is you like teach

996
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,020
a couple characters and then you immediately try

997
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,980
to make as many words as possible

998
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,900
with the limited characters you've taught

999
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,460
to help them like latch on to real meanings

1000
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,300
for those things.

1001
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,660
Like when Japanese, you'll start with the vowels,

1002
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,300
and then you like the first ones are ah and e,

1003
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,780
a and i in English.

1004
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,980
And ie literally is a word that means love in Japanese.

1005
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,740
So like boom, your first two letters,

1006
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,220
you have a word instantly,

1007
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,260
like now meanings are beginning to be associated.

1008
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,900
Isn't that cool?

1009
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,140
I wonder why the Arabic's different.

1010
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,260
Maybe just because it's new.

1011
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,580
I think it might be new.

1012
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,460
Also, it might be that there's just a lot of squiggles.

1013
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,460
By the way, I said the three dots was a sh,

1014
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,420
and a single dot was s.

1015
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,020
May not actually be true.

1016
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,780
I think I may be mixing that up with t and th,

1017
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,260
just make it sure if anybody is also learning Arabic

1018
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,340
or knows Arabic.

1019
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,700
Don't kill me.

1020
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,540
Hello.

1021
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,700
Hello.

1022
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,260
But yeah, I really, there's this really funny one,

1023
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,100
which is.

1024
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,900
I look forward to the give PCPU lecture on Arabic,

1025
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,100
and perhaps Arabic history.

1026
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,260
I mean, you know what, I'll do it.

1027
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,380
PCP, PCP, PCP lecture on the Israeli,

1028
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,340
Palestinian conflict, please.

1029
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,260
Oh yeah.

1030
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,940
Yeah, I'll learn Hebrew, I'll learn Arabic,

1031
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,300
and then I'll fucking understand,

1032
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,380
I'll be super enlightened,

1033
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,180
and I'll be like, guys, I got it.

1034
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,220
Oh my God, you can finally end the conflict.

1035
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,740
I'll make a PCP lecture on how to,

1036
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,820
by the way, there's this w,

1037
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,460
it looks like a three turn sideways.

1038
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,020
If you put that w, a tiny little w,

1039
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,340
over the top of a consonant,

1040
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,740
that just makes the consonant longer.

1041
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,220
So say if you have shu as a word,

1042
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,980
if you put that there on the s, it'll be shu,

1043
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,340
and they distinct, they have like words

1044
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,060
that are distinctly different based on how long

1045
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,260
certain consonants and vowels are held,

1046
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
and it's cool.

1047
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,980
And also I'm learning the ch sounds,

1048
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,820
the ih ch, all those,

1049
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,980
there's multiple different types of those.

1050
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,820
Oh my God.

1051
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,740
So, pretty complex,

1052
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,420
I don't know whether I'll ever be proficient in it,

1053
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,540
but I'm just gonna keep going,

1054
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,260
because it is very fun to figure it out.

1055
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,500
It's got the bleeps, the sweeps, and the creeps.

1056
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,340
My favorite things.

1057
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,660
I've always thought it's very romantic

1058
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,220
to learn a new language,

1059
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,980
but they're known if there was a language

1060
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,300
that would actually like benefit me,

1061
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,500
obviously they're Spanish,

1062
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,380
and it's universal, if you live in America,

1063
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,460
you should also learn Spanish,

1064
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,460
because that will just open a lot of opportunities for you.

1065
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,780
But like, I don't know, I don't have to speak Spanish.

1066
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,620
But also like hashtag build the wall,

1067
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,620
if you know what I'm saying.

1068
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,700
Yeah, well I think I mentioned this last time,

1069
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,420
but like, I don't know how important this app would be

1070
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,500
if you need to learn, if you like need to learn a language.

1071
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,260
Like for work or something?

1072
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,780
Yeah, I mean if you can,

1073
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,500
because some of these they work better with learning

1074
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,060
how to read and write the things

1075
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,220
rather than how to speak it,

1076
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,060
because they have voice clips for every thing,

1077
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,780
and sometimes it gives you a voice,

1078
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,340
and you have to try and put letters

1079
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,340
or like, figure it out through that.

1080
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,300
But sometimes they don't,

1081
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,420
and a lot of the time, at least in Hebrew,

1082
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,540
I couldn't really make out what the hell they were saying,

1083
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,380
but I could figure out the letters.

1084
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,740
So I'd be able to read,

1085
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,460
but if I were actually to go to Israel,

1086
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,460
or to go to some of these countries for these languages,

1087
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,180
I wouldn't really know how to talk to the people,

1088
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,500
unless I was in that country,

1089
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,180
and I just sort of learned it through osmosis.

1090
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,780
Well you know, that's actually pretty cool,

1091
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,100
because I know a couple of people,

1092
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,740
like for example, Michelle's dad

1093
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,700
like had to learn Korean when he was in the military,

1094
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,980
and like, so he's actually, he's Japanese,

1095
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,180
but he was forced to learn Korean,

1096
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,340
he like doesn't speak Japanese very much,

1097
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,340
which is pretty funny.

1098
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,540
But like, it's just because he had to work

1099
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,340
with like Korean people, he just like just on the job,

1100
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,820
he was an American, didn't speak the language,

1101
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,620
just like had to learn it for his job.

1102
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,460
And I've always like,

1103
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,780
I mean, I do things related to Japanese,

1104
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,060
I hope to kind of through osmosis,

1105
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,180
just like pick up more,

1106
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,940
but I'm aware I'll have to like force myself,

1107
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,820
or spend a lot of time around like,

1108
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,460
exclusively speaking Japanese people probably,

1109
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,140
to learn any of it.

1110
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,020
I want to not have to do any work,

1111
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,860
I want the environment around me to just teach me things.

1112
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,540
And that's what I want, that would be great,

1113
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,580
that would be excellent if that could happen.

1114
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,460
But I don't know, I've always thought it was pretty cool

1115
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,420
how people will like learn new languages

1116
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,580
just for their jobs.

1117
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,860
I always thought that was neat.

1118
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,140
Like if you're like, hey, oh, Johnson,

1119
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,220
we're transferring you to the Mumbai account,

1120
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,620
I'm trying to think of some like Indian city.

1121
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,940
Go learn, they got like a million languages in India,

1122
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,860
but go learn whatever they speak over there.

1123
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,940
Hindi, yeah, Hindi, go learn that, Johnson.

1124
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,460
Yes, sir, off I go.

1125
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,180
And then he does somehow.

1126
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,220
I was, by the way, here's my invite link to Duolingo.

1127
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,460
If you use this link to get on,

1128
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,140
I get a free week of Duolingo Plus,

1129
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,860
which has no benefits really at all,

1130
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,660
except that it has no ads.

1131
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,740
No, that's a plus, that's a plus.

1132
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,420
I was, I was thinking about this earlier,

1133
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,140
because I was getting pizza with Sixton,

1134
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,860
who is over here staying at my house, famous,

1135
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,620
Ronnie Cooker's Con Killers.

1136
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,460
Oh yeah, famous, right?

1137
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,020
For his Con Killers, Pop Idol,

1138
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,420
and musician behind the Izumi game.

1139
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,580
So, oh yeah, cool, God tier, God tier musician.

1140
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,260
Anyway, he's here at my house,

1141
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,340
and we were hanging out, we were getting pizza.

1142
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,100
And I thought about how, isn't funny,

1143
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,020
how you can go to like Italian restaurant or something,

1144
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,180
or like an Indian restaurant, or a Mexican restaurant,

1145
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,380
and it will be made up of staff who is that ethnicity.

1146
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,020
And it makes sense, obviously, you know,

1147
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,100
they may know how to make the meals better

1148
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,300
than anyone else would.

1149
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,980
But imagining from like the initial perspective

1150
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,420
of like, imagine if I were to like immigrate to France,

1151
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,500
and then I'm like, well, I'm American,

1152
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,620
might as well like push this angle a lot,

1153
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,700
and then I went to like a McDonald's,

1154
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,540
or I went to like a burger place to start like that.

1155
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,500
Oh, this is my life now, you know?

1156
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,300
I was born American, so this is what I'm gonna do

1157
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,140
with my life.

1158
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,460
That's not exactly what's going on here though.

1159
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,900
I'm just gonna push my angle.

1160
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,020
Well, what do you mean?

1161
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,740
I mean, they're doing what they know.

1162
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,740
They probably like were a cook, I assume, you know,

1163
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,860
either with their family,

1164
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,620
or if they like came from another country,

1165
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,540
that's like, you know, that's their specialty.

1166
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,780
So they're offering, that's what they have to offer

1167
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,620
in a business sense.

1168
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,220
They're like a specialist in this kind of cooking

1169
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,060
or something.

1170
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,020
Sure, but I'm trying to think about the amount of times

1171
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,940
that I see another like, for instance, in Italian.

1172
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,140
When do I see an Italian outside an Italian restaurant?

1173
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,980
Like, never.

1174
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,020
I mean, it's probably family run though, right?

1175
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,740
Like a Chinese restaurant, right?

1176
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,740
Like what we think of as American Chinese food

1177
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:08,540
is not like, you know, to Chinese food staples,

1178
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,300
crab rangoon, not Chinese, invented in California.

1179
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
I think, oh God, was it, is it,

1180
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,660
I think General So's chicken is what you're saying.

1181
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,580
These are like, these are staples of Chinese food restaurants

1182
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,580
and they're not thing,

1183
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,540
I mean, they'd probably have them in China,

1184
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,820
but it's not like traditional Chinese food.

1185
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,940
But when you go to like your American Chinese one,

1186
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,500
when you go to your American Chinese restaurant though,

1187
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,620
you see like, it's generally speaking,

1188
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,340
Chinese people run in the place.

1189
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,700
I know, but I'm saying that like they still have to learn.

1190
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,220
You know, it's not like they just like show up in America

1191
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,740
and they're like, well, I'm just gonna,

1192
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,300
I'm gonna take all the things that mama taught me

1193
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,780
how to make and that's gonna be my restaurant.

1194
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,220
And then, and then they just,

1195
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,380
that's what ends up on the menu.

1196
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,860
I think there is gotta be a little bit of like,

1197
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm Chinese, time to start a Chinese restaurant.

1198
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,220
Because if I didn't, the customer would experience,

1199
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,860
there would be ludonarrative dissonance

1200
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,500
when you eat in my restaurant

1201
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,900
and everyone would, and everyone would be freaked out

1202
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,940
and be like, this doesn't, ah, this doesn't taste authentic.

1203
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,620
Pig slob, bad review on y'all.

1204
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,940
What's the pose though?

1205
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,900
Exactly that.

1206
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,620
Sixth one's relaying me about how his friend,

1207
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,780
who was white, wanted to work at like a,

1208
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,180
I believe it was a Thai place.

1209
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,660
And they're like, if you aren't Thai, you can't work here.

1210
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,500
Like they said, don't call back.

1211
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,860
You at least gotta look Thai.

1212
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,700
Yeah.

1213
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,580
You can be, you can be like,

1214
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,740
you can be like, you can be some other Asian,

1215
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,900
just keep your mouth shut.

1216
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:33,740
Yeah.

1217
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:37,180
I would really like to see a Chinese-run Italian restaurant

1218
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,860
because they would make the spaghetti all different.

1219
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,660
I mean, you know, walk, spaghetti and walk.

1220
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,940
You know, is that, is that, I mean, I personally,

1221
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,660
I have no problem with a restaurant doing that

1222
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,500
if they want to.

1223
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,340
Like they can hire whoever they want.

1224
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,180
That's their business.

1225
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,140
But like, is that actually like a crime

1226
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,900
to like discriminate in that way

1227
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,900
based on like the race of the people applying?

1228
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,180
Well, out of Sweden, maybe.

1229
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,180
Well, I think, I think generally the reasons for hiring,

1230
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,540
you can't like, you're not like forced by the government

1231
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,140
to hire people just because.

1232
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,100
But you are, you are barred by the government

1233
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,100
from not hiring people because of some specific criteria.

1234
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,380
I would imagine, I don't know.

1235
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,140
I would imagine that when you go to like a Chinese restaurant

1236
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,740
and everyone there working there is Chinese,

1237
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,860
it is like primarily because the place is owned by a family

1238
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,900
and like a lot of the people working there

1239
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,500
are in the family or friends of the family or whatever.

1240
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,340
Probably.

1241
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,500
Also like, like Ben in Chinatown,

1242
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,020
I was wondering, not very seriously,

1243
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,500
like, you know, what if I got a job,

1244
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,580
like it's somewhere around here just over the summer,

1245
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,340
well, well, I'm going to college.

1246
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,860
But like, you know, I couldn't because I don't speak Mandarin

1247
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,580
and I'm not Chinese, which Mandarin is more of like

1248
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,740
a skill set, which makes sense.

1249
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,860
Well, that's the real issue.

1250
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,700
If like the whole restaurant is run by people

1251
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,340
who like really speak Chinese

1252
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,380
and maybe their English isn't necessarily great,

1253
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,220
then like they're probably going to want to hire people

1254
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,980
who, you know, share that language.

1255
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,780
Yeah, that's a legit reason.

1256
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,100
Maybe this is a stupid question,

1257
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,500
but is racism illegal or is it just like very largely

1258
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,100
maligned as a thing to speak?

1259
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,700
Racism is basically illegal as far as like,

1260
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,460
it feels like it's pretty new.

1261
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,020
Well, I mean, you are, you are not allowed to like

1262
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,180
bar someone from employee on the basis of race.

1263
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,020
Yeah.

1264
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,580
So it's like, you know, you're not allowed to do that

1265
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,940
specifically and things like that.

1266
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,980
Like certain, certain, certain like racist reasons,

1267
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,140
things are illegal like that, but like,

1268
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,340
you're not like arrested just for being a racist.

1269
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,620
It's illegal, but like, or well, yeah.

1270
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,860
No, no, no, it's not illegal on paper at all.

1271
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,300
You can feel whatever you want, which is what's illegal.

1272
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,860
He means hiring, so like, like making a hiring decision.

1273
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,180
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1274
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,020
That's all right.

1275
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,860
I didn't know that.

1276
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,380
I just thought of that idea.

1277
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,100
There are, there are laws like that in America.

1278
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,660
I suspect that with this like,

1279
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,500
China, if for whatever reason,

1280
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,380
somebody wanted to be like, they're like, I don't know,

1281
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,460
wait, and they want to work at a Chinese restaurant.

1282
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,260
I suspect if you like, filed a lawsuit and kept going,

1283
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,380
you'd probably win.

1284
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,820
And then they'd have to give some other reason.

1285
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,620
Wait, couldn't they just, I don't know.

1286
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,140
Couldn't they just like, lie about it?

1287
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,900
Say, are you not the right guy for the job?

1288
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,300
Well, I think that's why they would like,

1289
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,020
that's why you would sue and do an investigation.

1290
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,860
Here's what I think.

1291
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,660
I think the reason is probably, it's not like,

1292
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,140
I bet that they'd never have any positions open

1293
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,620
because if they did, they would immediately just fill them

1294
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,060
like, through like, friend of the family,

1295
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,460
like, who do I know?

1296
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,300
Right?

1297
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,780
Probably, probably.

1298
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,020
There's been hiring signs in Shintown before.

1299
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,860
Yeah.

1300
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,060
If they were putting out, if they put out a sign

1301
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,700
that says like, hiring and you showed up and you applied

1302
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,980
and like, you spoke the language that the boss speaks.

1303
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,820
Yeah.

1304
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,900
You probably, they probably can sue you.

1305
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,180
Because at that point, like, they're out of people.

1306
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,340
They're out of like, in-group people that they know.

1307
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
Like, they're looking for outsiders.

1308
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,660
I imagine this is probably, jobs happen.

1309
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,300
I'm sure you could get a job like that.

1310
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,300
Yeah.

1311
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,780
But I just think it generally doesn't come to that

1312
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,180
because probably these kinds of establishments

1313
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,140
tend to hire in, like, inside the family

1314
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,980
or their community.

1315
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,820
I don't know, man.

1316
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,140
I've seen now hiring signs before in Shintown.

1317
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,860
I know I've seen like, for example,

1318
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,380
you see a lot of like, you know,

1319
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,860
whatever, Latin America or whatever people.

1320
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,820
I've seen them working in like,

1321
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,580
Chinese food kitchens in the past.

1322
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,260
I assume because, you know, it's the kind of work

1323
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,700
that maybe people who are fresh to the country

1324
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,100
can get relatively easily and learn the,

1325
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,580
maybe they're a chef of some kind

1326
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,900
and, you know, looking for a job in the meantime.

1327
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,020
Eh, I don't know.

1328
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,260
I have a feeling, I have a feeling

1329
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,580
that probably relatively few people working at restaurants

1330
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:39,020
like that are like, professional chefs from the old country.

1331
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:39,860
Well, yeah.

1332
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,500
And it's probably just more like, I showed up here.

1333
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,820
Chef was the wrong word, probably.

1334
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,260
I don't know anyone.

1335
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,860
I've never cooked a day in my life,

1336
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,860
but like my uncle's, like my uncle's like wife's son

1337
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,300
just opened a fucking restaurant or whatever.

1338
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,900
And I guess I got an in there.

1339
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,220
So I'll go do that, you know.

1340
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,060
When Tony Montana came into America

1341
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,900
at the beginning of Scarface,

1342
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,900
he was able to get a job at like some shitty restaurant

1343
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,700
that's open like 24 hours or whatever, washing dishes

1344
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,300
and making like shitty sandwiches

1345
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,620
for like dock workers in Miami or whatever.

1346
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,940
And I imagine that's relatively the experience.

1347
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,060
You get like a low, low level job.

1348
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,180
But then you just become, or rather you continue

1349
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,980
your active campaign as an assassin from the third world

1350
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,220
and you just move up the ranks like hotcakes.

1351
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,660
You move to pushing cocaine,

1352
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,820
you move to doing bigger and bigger dope deals,

1353
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,100
you commit assassinations for your political friends

1354
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,860
and bing bong bing, you got yourself a mansion.

1355
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,460
I'm just saying, nepotism is a fact of life

1356
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,620
and they're definitely, this is definitely

1357
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,560
just because they're hiring the people they already know.

1358
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,200
They're hiring friends of friends, right?

1359
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,040
That's it, solved.

1360
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,480
I solved the issue, no more.

1361
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,840
It's the end.

1362
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,680
The reason why is obvious, but it's interesting

1363
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,200
that we just kind of assume that, you know,

1364
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,680
if you are from ethnicity,

1365
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,080
you may know how to cook the ethnicity as food.

1366
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,480
And like- It's more likely, right?

1367
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,920
And we are like, you know, like it would be sort of like,

1368
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,800
you know, it may not be like bad or weird,

1369
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,360
but if you were like at a Chinese restaurant

1370
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,160
and some like white dude were to serve you,

1371
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,080
you'd be like, oh, huh, interesting.

1372
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,400
I'd puke instantly.

1373
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,800
I'd fucking shoot out my goo from all orifices.

1374
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,880
But it's funny that we say that because yeah, you're right.

1375
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,000
I guess it is more likely,

1376
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,960
but I think very small of an increase

1377
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,320
because I wouldn't assume that anyone just walking

1378
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,120
down the street would be able to cook

1379
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,560
like at like a traditional American meal.

1380
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,320
I wouldn't assume that everyone's a cook

1381
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
that would know how to do it effectively.

1382
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,000
What even is a traditional American meal,

1383
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,400
burger and fries?

1384
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,240
It's like a pie or something, like an apple pie?

1385
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,480
Is that even American?

1386
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,120
They say apple pie is American and shit,

1387
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,440
but is that even a fact?

1388
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,080
You understand what I mean.

1389
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,280
I do, I do.

1390
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,160
So it's interesting that we're just like, oh yeah.

1391
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,200
Listen, you know, Irish, oh, you can make a fucking pastrami.

1392
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,680
You can whip me up a Guinness, can't you?

1393
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,360
Yeah, yeah, you can whip me up a fucking corned beef.

1394
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,280
Just get in there, buddy, just go behind the grill.

1395
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,720
I pelt wheat.

1396
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,000
Oh, wait, wait, what do they make Guinness out of?

1397
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,440
Wheat, I assume, because it's beer, is that?

1398
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,240
They make it out of beer.

1399
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,240
Oh, pups, pups, pups, Jesus Christ.

1400
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,400
Oh, oh, you know what, Munchy,

1401
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,640
talk about the time you drank three beers.

1402
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,640
Yes, yes, yes, I'm saying the Guinness is a perfect segue

1403
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,200
because last we spoke, that was my knockoff record rel

1404
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,680
from that one guide code commercial impression.

1405
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,240
Last we spoke, I had drank in one apple cider,

1406
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,240
and that was like insane, like I couldn't even believe

1407
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,920
what had just happened, and I broke all the sacred vows.

1408
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,400
Do you mean like, do you mean a hard apple cider,

1409
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,280
like in My Little Pony?

1410
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,600
Yes, literally exactly.

1411
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,640
Applejack came up to me in Victoria Square,

1412
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,800
she said, hey, y'all, and I slapped her

1413
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
and I drank her fucking cider.

1414
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,400
And in your traditional British accent,

1415
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,880
she said, howdy, y'all.

1416
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,400
Yeah, exactly, and that was it.

1417
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,040
I had cursed my family and I was dishonored forever,

1418
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,560
but it felt pretty good.

1419
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,080
And then later, due to yaya yada circumstances,

1420
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,960
me, Hepo, his father, and a bunch of his fucking rowdy,

1421
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,960
like English coworkers, went out to a pub, a proper pub,

1422
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,560
with dim lighting, with brown on the walls,

1423
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,400
and a bunch of weird knickknacks everywhere,

1424
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,520
an actual literal cartoon I stepped inside of.

1425
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,920
Like from the movies?

1426
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,560
Yeah, like from the movies, wow.

1427
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,240
Literally, I mean, I don't think of it as much

1428
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,600
because I've seen these sorts of pubs

1429
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,320
semi-regularly all my life,

1430
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,400
but I guess it is sort of like the cartoony,

1431
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,560
prototypical stereotype of a English pub

1432
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,920
with the dark oak seats and the dark and the green

1433
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,240
sort of cushions and dim lighting

1434
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,440
and the curtains and everything.

1435
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,560
I literally long jumped into the TV that day

1436
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,080
and I appeared inside a pub.

1437
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,160
And I was kind of just ready to get like a water.

1438
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, holy.

1439
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,960
Literally, I would,

1440
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,360
ha, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu, bu,

1441
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,200
wee!

1442
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,680
And I was kind of just ready to get like a water,

1443
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,840
like I was kind of just prepared

1444
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,320
to not really do anything

1445
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,320
because that was my last day in England.

1446
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,200
And the plan was to drink until the pain's over,

1447
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
but worse, worse, the pain or the hangover.

1448
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Hangover, yeah.

1449
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,960
And I was just gonna stay up

1450
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,440
and I was gonna sleep on the plane,

1451
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,720
which I will get into the aftermath of that later

1452
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,800
because that's a whole story into itself,

1453
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,920
but I was gonna stay up on it.

1454
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,960
So I didn't wanna just, you know, get fucked up and die.

1455
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,960
But the sweet old man who ran Hippo's dad's,

1456
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,960
like I don't know, the scout thing going on,

1457
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,800
whatever, it doesn't matter.

1458
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,640
Well, he didn't run.

1459
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,480
He hasn't run it for a while,

1460
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,080
but he used to be in charge.

1461
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,600
Well, the point is that there was a sweet old man there

1462
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,760
who offered me a drink and who was I to decline.

1463
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,480
And so he got me an actual beer.

1464
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,200
So the age of drinking is 18?

1465
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,640
Yes, yes, yes, that's why, yeah.

1466
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,760
And he got me a lager, a lager, is it called?

1467
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,120
Oh, yeah.

1468
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,520
Ooh, I've heard of those.

1469
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,920
To be honest with you, I hadn't.

1470
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,080
So he got me that.

1471
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,480
And then halfway through drinking that slowly,

1472
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,560
because it tasted just like fermented dirt

1473
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,160
is what it tastes like.

1474
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,200
I was halfway through and I thought, this sucks.

1475
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,240
I'll just go to the end and then I'll stop.

1476
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,960
And then Hippo's dad,

1477
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,880
the hero slash villain question mark that he is,

1478
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,720
just gave me another one,

1479
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,920
just placed down in my sights,

1480
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,880
in my sniper reticule, a second version of my drink.

1481
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,400
So I was like, oh, so what am I gonna say?

1482
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,480
Am I gonna splash in his fucking face and say no?

1483
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,400
No, I'm just gonna have to deal with this.

1484
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,640
This is just my life now.

1485
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,800
I'm halfway through drinking that one, two beers,

1486
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,960
and then again, another drink up here before me.

1487
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,040
Oh my God, he's brits.

1488
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,440
And they're just fucking loading it up

1489
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,600
to do whatever saw to me

1490
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,920
they could possibly want to do to me.

1491
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,040
He's fucking limies, yeah.

1492
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,600
They're setting you up for a fall, friend.

1493
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,240
Yeah, and you know what?

1494
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,520
It's weird, because I finally, beer snapped in my mind,

1495
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,680
as did many brain cells.

1496
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,760
And I finally understood why,

1497
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,200
because why people drink beer

1498
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
is because after the first drink,

1499
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,360
beer tastes like nothing because your body is destroyed.

1500
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,000
And so it doesn't taste bad anymore after the first drink.

1501
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,640
It just tastes like...

1502
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,400
All it tastes like is you go to pick up your drink,

1503
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,400
then you've put down your drink

1504
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,360
because you've over-drinked it,

1505
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,400
and then your mind's confused

1506
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,880
because you just lagged out for a second.

1507
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,320
Yeah, that's right.

1508
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,400
And anyway, it was a great time

1509
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,600
because of the previously mentioned rowdy coworkers

1510
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,400
who were speaking in their foreign tongues,

1511
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,960
calling me Donald,

1512
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,040
and talking to me about MPs.

1513
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,520
No, no, no, that's my father.

1514
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,400
I'm Munchie J from...

1515
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,960
Yeah, no, no, no, literally.

1516
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,120
Okay, one...

1517
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,240
Yeah, yeah, the moment with the phone.

1518
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,840
Yeah, do you want to say it?

1519
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,160
My dad, well, you can tell the story,

1520
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,240
but I just want to tell you

1521
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,200
that my dad was really impressed by that

1522
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,600
and has mentioned the story like three times already.

1523
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,400
That American guy, that Munchie guy,

1524
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,960
is really great, really witty.

1525
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,440
He'll do great things.

1526
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,280
It's like, yeah.

1527
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,320
What? Oh my God!

1528
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,160
Yeah, he really likes you.

1529
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,600
Both of my parents really like you.

1530
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,040
Andrew, an old man, mentioned you again.

1531
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,400
You really hit it off with everyone.

1532
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,240
Oh my God!

1533
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,080
That's great!

1534
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,360
Oh, my heart's a flutter, be still!

1535
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,680
I can't believe this.

1536
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,240
Oh, I'm doing that thing that girls do

1537
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,200
when they put like one leg up behind them

1538
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,040
while they're kissing someone.

1539
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,880
Obulate, obulate.

1540
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,200
Yeah, yeah, obulate.

1541
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,040
Yeah, yeah, obulate.

1542
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,680
Anyway, one of the coworkers,

1543
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,520
like they're fucking like,

1544
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,840
it was like a family-run business,

1545
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,200
like the Chinese do as a business,

1546
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,640
as pulled back the current on

1547
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,880
and called it for what it is.

1548
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,280
I just said what we were all thinking,

1549
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,400
that Ben St. Guy.

1550
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,760
He's gonna get like a point.

1551
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,600
He's gonna get like a point.

1552
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,920
Yeah, yeah.

1553
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,120
And one of their brothers called,

1554
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,400
and they were like passing around the phone

1555
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,440
to everyone to play a prank on him.

1556
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,560
When they got to me,

1557
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,120
I was already like, I'm a lightweight,

1558
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,360
so like the three were, it was able to get to me,

1559
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,200
and I was able to do it.

1560
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Which is surprising considering your size,

1561
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,720
but you're a young undrink or so,

1562
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,920
that'll do it, yeah, yeah.

1563
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,560
And I remember, I just answered the phone,

1564
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,120
it was passed to me, it was some dude,

1565
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,480
I'd never met before.

1566
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,800
And I said, Nigel, I gotta say,

1567
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,760
I love what you've done for the family,

1568
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,040
and I can't wait to meet you in person.

1569
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,000
I love what you've done.

1570
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,680
Oh my God, my chair just broke,

1571
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,720
my chair just broke, my chair just broke,

1572
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,920
my chair just broke.

1573
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,760
It's completely broken.

1574
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,440
I wasn't sure if this was part of the story

1575
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,160
or something that actually just happened.

1576
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,480
Did you hear the snap?

1577
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,320
Did you hear the snap?

1578
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,320
I did hear the snap.

1579
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,000
The fucking Thanos snap of your chair.

1580
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,280
Okay, all right, hold on.

1581
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,400
I'm just gonna keep speaking

1582
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,400
while I take a picture of my now,

1583
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,520
completely and utterly broken chair.

1584
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:53,920
Okay, I can't hear you for one second.

1585
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,000
There's the photo.

1586
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,200
Anyway, the point is, is that he called me Donald.

1587
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,280
Show notes, please.

1588
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,440
I said that Donald's my father, please call me Baron.

1589
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,640
And then we just, we just talked about Boris Johnson,

1590
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,520
we talked about who's gonna be the new prime minister.

1591
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,160
And it was great, and it was literally an iconic evening

1592
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,480
that I will not forget for the rest of my life.

1593
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,720
Because it was literally a cartoon, literally a cartoon.

1594
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,680
I've never been to England.

1595
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,960
I wanna go there and meet Gibbs' wacky family

1596
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,200
and his kooky characters.

1597
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,320
Oh, they're so wacky.

1598
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,360
Like, I just love like, hey, like, hey hippos,

1599
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,800
dad, dance for me, you stupid fucking bitch.

1600
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,680
And then you can do it over and over and over again.

1601
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,880
That's what your people are known for, as I understand it.

1602
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,680
All right, you taught them how to long jump back to something.

1603
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,520
Yes, yes, yes.

1604
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1605
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,440
I remember after, after,

1606
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,760
okay, look at my fucking chair.

1607
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,520
Look at the mangled mess that this is.

1608
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,640
Whoa.

1609
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,680
Oh no, so the arm just snapped off?

1610
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,520
Yeah, the arm snapped, we're just right off.

1611
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,240
Dope.

1612
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,160
Yeah, this is great.

1613
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,560
This is literally fantastic.

1614
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,720
Anyway, I remember after, after, like,

1615
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,640
I stood up for the first time after drinking the three,

1616
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,360
the three loggers. Oh boy, yeah, there you go.

1617
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,560
And my brain just was like, oh God, everything's hard now.

1618
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,160
And I stumbled to the bathroom.

1619
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,040
The bathroom was like a weird like pig trough

1620
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,360
where there was no like urinals.

1621
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,800
It just was like a wall that you piss on.

1622
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
And it was terrifying.

1623
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,640
I didn't know if I was just...

1624
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,760
Yeah, it was a pretty gritty bathroom.

1625
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,160
I couldn't tell if I was just like pissing on the wall

1626
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,760
or if I wasn't supposed to be doing what I was doing,

1627
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,760
but I did anyway because I didn't fear

1628
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,400
the ramifications at that point.

1629
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,320
Yeah.

1630
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,040
I came back and then after we were all said and done

1631
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,680
about talking about our glorious God Boris Johnson,

1632
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,640
we went back to Hippo's house.

1633
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Hippo's dad gave me a shot of whiskey

1634
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,080
and I drank it and it like blew my mind off.

1635
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,640
It felt like a shotgun blast

1636
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,240
at the root of my fucking mouth and it was terrible.

1637
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,760
And we just crushed Crash Bandicoot 3.

1638
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
That's all we fucking did.

1639
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,920
We went up to Hippo's room

1640
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,640
and I was so excited to play Crash Bandicoot 3.

1641
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,440
I got like one level in it, fucking sucked.

1642
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,760
I gave it to Hippo and they just watched him

1643
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,640
destroy Crash Bandicoot 3.

1644
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,400
Like literally the hardest any gamer has ever gameed.

1645
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,680
Crash Bandicoot 3 was like vanquished

1646
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,520
from the face of the earth.

1647
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,360
I'd be surprised if you could literally even locate

1648
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,400
a copy of it after what we did last night.

1649
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,200
So what are your updated thoughts on alcohol

1650
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,400
after this experience?

1651
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,920
My updated thoughts on alcohol

1652
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,520
are actually somewhat devilish.

1653
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,520
They're actually somewhat upsetting.

1654
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,760
I know this is like a real heel turn.

1655
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,800
I know this is like against everything

1656
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,120
that like Munchie stands for as a human being

1657
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,520
and that I may be kicked from like several different

1658
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,200
friend groups or just like podcasts or anything.

1659
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,120
And maybe like option society.

1660
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,600
I didn't hate it.

1661
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,520
I didn't think it was the worst thing on earth.

1662
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,320
Now what about the hangover though?

1663
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,040
What about the hangover afterward?

1664
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,320
I didn't get a hangover.

1665
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,400
You what the fuck?

1666
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,360
It must be your size.

1667
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,440
That's the only explanation.

1668
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,600
You just somehow tanked it in your body.

1669
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,440
I can't believe it.

1670
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,640
We defeated Britain, broke away from America

1671
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,240
all those years ago, but vengeance finally came back

1672
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,960
and they took Munchie from us.

1673
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,800
Those goddamn British.

1674
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,120
Did you by the way, did you drink much water

1675
01:02:59,120 --> 01:02:59,960
while you were doing this?

1676
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,800
Cause they always say drinking water

1677
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,000
is the way to offset a hangover.

1678
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,840
You did not.

1679
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,240
Okay, you just carry enough ambient water with you.

1680
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,560
He had, I mean, I don't know whether he drunk water

1681
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,760
when we got home, but he did stay up all night

1682
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,880
playing with, playing some.

1683
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,720
I've heard that helps.

1684
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,880
I've heard that helps too.

1685
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,720
After we were gonna play Crash Bandicoot

1686
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,600
and a hippo went to bed like a fucking pussy piece of shit.

1687
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1688
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1689
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,840
What did you stay up to?

1690
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,280
True, true, true, true, true, true.

1691
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,120
Not even hiding from it.

1692
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,360
Me and HDB guy just stayed up all night

1693
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,000
talking about like real shit

1694
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,760
and like diving into our psyches.

1695
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,840
And then watching the English television version

1696
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,280
of the Chronicles of Narnia,

1697
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,400
which is really like bizarrely whimsical

1698
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,880
and also ridiculous.

1699
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,800
Like on his old fucking CRT.

1700
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,600
Now, yeah, I really wish I'd stayed up

1701
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,920
cause that does sound great.

1702
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,600
I was just destroyed from various things.

1703
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,640
And I woke up the next day with a sickness.

1704
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,680
But anyway, that's my final kiss.

1705
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,640
That's my parting gift.

1706
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,240
I'm still sick from that.

1707
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,840
But anyway, Munchy, before you get onto your plane ride

1708
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,760
that you want to talk about, rate my family.

1709
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,600
What do you think?

1710
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,440
What do you think about my family?

1711
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,040
What's the tier list?

1712
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,800
Yeah, I will go by family member by family member.

1713
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,160
What you guys have to understand

1714
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,520
is that hippos, brothers, they are like a comedy troupe.

1715
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,360
They are like a constructed set of characters.

1716
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,560
They're like, if you go on Tumblr and like,

1717
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,800
hey guys, this is my OC, Tee-hee-hee.

1718
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,440
You will just see a picture of him and his brothers.

1719
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Like they are just like a constructed version

1720
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,600
of what you think English people are like.

1721
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,000
The different character archetypes

1722
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,920
that there can be for British humor,

1723
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,120
there they are in real life.

1724
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:47,440
Hippos, like the Venn diagram of both of them

1725
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,320
and Henry HGB guy is like total unhinged madness.

1726
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,480
Like full internet neat dweller,

1727
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,800
like madman insane psychopath, literal serial killer.

1728
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,880
Most twisted psychopath you will ever meet.

1729
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,080
And then Charlie is like this like normie,

1730
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,000
like chill, like cool Chad normie,

1731
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,840
who like works at construction yard

1732
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,560
and just sort of like soft spoken.

1733
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,200
He's like, he's the guy who like will kill people,

1734
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
will get a lot of kills and then say something like,

1735
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,880
huh, it was easy.

1736
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,560
And then we load his clip.

1737
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,600
So they are both Kino and I love them.

1738
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,400
They're both literally 10 out of 10

1739
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,720
and it was great hanging out with,

1740
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,960
it was great hanging with Henry

1741
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,240
because he threw up, he threw up on the train

1742
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,080
and that was great.

1743
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,320
And just hanging out with him was a hoot.

1744
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,760
And then Charlie was like a down to earth nice guy

1745
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,600
who was fun just walking around coal drop parks.

1746
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,160
I believe it was coal drop park.

1747
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,600
London is so fucking cool.

1748
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,320
London is like better than like any American city

1749
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,160
except like not at all,

1750
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,520
Boston's way better half fuck you Limies,

1751
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:54,560
but it is cool because it's so walking around pedestrian.

1752
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,040
And there's just like the sight lines,

1753
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,360
literally Disneyland, but a city

1754
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,320
because Walt Disney himself planned out London

1755
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,800
so that the sight lines,

1756
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,040
we were in some like just nice little hill

1757
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,560
and we were able to like watch an outdoor fucking movie

1758
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,120
on a big screen on this beautiful river

1759
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,600
with like a river boat that was like a turn into a library

1760
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,600
and behind us there was like a chic coal plant

1761
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,000
turning into like nice boutique restaurant

1762
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,400
and shopping center.

1763
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,760
And I couldn't even see a side scraper in sight.

1764
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,640
And we were like in the heart of London,

1765
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,000
literally perfect best city ever made,

1766
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,360
but it fucking sucks because I got sick and fuck you.

1767
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,520
Your mom's really nice.

1768
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,480
You hippo look just like your mom and dad put together.

1769
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,760
It's funny how those sort of things work out.

1770
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,520
Literally just like copy and pasted.

1771
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,920
You have your dad's face and your mom's hair.

1772
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,760
Perfect.

1773
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,600
Literally perfect.

1774
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,440
And your mom's really nice.

1775
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,720
She helped me with my coat and with my cold.

1776
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,520
She nursed me back to health.

1777
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,800
She was like there.

1778
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,720
And then your dad got me drunk

1779
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,840
and it was cool when we played Crash Bandicoot 3,

1780
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,720
the best game ever made.

1781
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,920
So your whole family gets a 10 out of 10,

1782
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,200
munchie, a seal of approval.

1783
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,320
I'm coming back right now.

1784
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,720
I'm turning the boat around.

1785
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,480
I'm sailing back on the Mayflower.

1786
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,800
I'm gonna ram it right into the fucking Big Ben

1787
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,160
and he's gonna fall down.

1788
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,320
So I gotta twist my ears like in half.

1789
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,560
I gotta like pick up my ears

1790
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,480
and have to put them back on

1791
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,200
like a fucking Mr. Potato Head.

1792
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,560
I'm back now.

1793
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:23,080
You know, just quick question slash point.

1794
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,480
When I was in Japan,

1795
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,160
I turned 21 while I was in Japan

1796
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,480
but the drinking age there is 20.

1797
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,400
So I too was able to drink just willy nilly

1798
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,080
when I first got there.

1799
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,240
And similarly, you know, in Britain,

1800
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,600
the drinking age is 18, that's cool.

1801
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,360
You know, that's the three years difference

1802
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,960
versus what is in America.

1803
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,480
My question is, so you're not facing any legal repercussions

1804
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,040
of having underage drunk in another country.

1805
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,640
My question is, why is it such a big deal

1806
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,000
when I fly to the Philippines

1807
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,320
to fuck the 12 year old lady boys?

1808
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,840
Same logic applies, what's the issue?

1809
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,960
Literally, what's the problem?

1810
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,240
Well, I think the answer is, is there isn't.

1811
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,360
I think you've just asked for a rhetorical question

1812
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,720
to give people a good point. Okay, great.

1813
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,400
Which is the most reasonable point on earth.

1814
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,560
Great, great, okay.

1815
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,400
Listen, I'm saying that we should legalize grooming children

1816
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,800
if the children are also into it.

1817
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,040
That's my official statement.

1818
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,200
Hard to agree.

1819
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,520
Hard to agree.

1820
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,360
Hard to agree.

1821
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,360
Well, so what else, what else is on people's minds here?

1822
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,040
Wait, wait, wait, what's much you're gonna do

1823
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,520
is talk about his flight back.

1824
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,760
Was there anything to say about that?

1825
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,240
Yeah, there's not much of a story.

1826
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,960
It just was the worst experience of my life.

1827
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,800
Yeah, okay.

1828
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,080
Which I'd stayed up the entire night previous,

1829
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,960
which was fine and good.

1830
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,720
And me and Henry rode to the airport together.

1831
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,800
But when we were at the airport,

1832
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,280
I checked in and I said my goodbye and I got in,

1833
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,800
but I had an aisle seat.

1834
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,000
An aisle seat while I was like as sick and like sniveling

1835
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,880
and like coughing up a fucking storm,

1836
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,440
I had an aisle seat.

1837
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,240
And so I squeezed in between these two fucking fat people,

1838
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,040
just you know, three pigs in a blanket, you could say.

1839
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,120
And I was coughing and I was trying to lean my chair back,

1840
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,920
but my chair specifically was broken.

1841
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,080
So I couldn't lean my chair back specifically.

1842
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,400
Wait, wait, when you said aisle seat,

1843
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,400
do you mean you're in the,

1844
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,560
are you saying like the aisle or the middle seat?

1845
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,440
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I'm retarded, yes.

1846
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,280
I'm in middle seat.

1847
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,120
Okay, that's what I thought.

1848
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,720
I'm in middle seat, yeah.

1849
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,280
And I couldn't sleep the entire night for 12 hours.

1850
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,000
I was just waking up.

1851
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,600
I had like a weird like headache,

1852
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,200
I think because I sleep deprivation or something.

1853
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
And I had to keep getting up

1854
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,880
because one of the people on the window seat

1855
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,920
kept wanting to go to the bathroom.

1856
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,400
So I had to keep getting up for them.

1857
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,960
Like every 20 fucking minutes, it was a literal nightmare.

1858
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,920
I got to Canada and Canada is like a weird,

1859
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,200
like I'm almost there, it looks like America,

1860
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,440
but it's just wrong enough.

1861
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,640
I just want to go home.

1862
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,280
Why is everything so hard?

1863
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,560
Why do they speak English?

1864
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,880
Except they're so different and I hate them all.

1865
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,620
And I was cursing the entire continent of Europe

1866
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,480
and the entire continent of North America,

1867
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,840
Sands America.

1868
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,320
And I got through and it was a nightmare

1869
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,600
and it was the worst experience in my life.

1870
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
And I was sick and it sucked.

1871
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,800
And that's all I want to say.

1872
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,000
Fuck planes, fuck Air Canada.

1873
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,800
Oh, oh, I went to the bathroom.

1874
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,840
Cause I fucking, cause I was doing a big bathroom

1875
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,520
cause I was going to explode and die.

1876
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,280
And then someone caught me in line.

1877
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,800
There was like a little, there's like a little like,

1878
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,040
like bathroom offset that you could do.

1879
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,440
And it was like a very like a small,

1880
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,840
like not really formed line that was happening.

1881
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,440
And I just got like a quick, quick,

1882
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,520
tiny wash in my hands and in the bathroom.

1883
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,200
And then someone cut cut in front of me

1884
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,800
and I had to go back of the line.

1885
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,960
I had to go behind like 50 fucking people.

1886
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,360
And it was a nightmare and fuck you.

1887
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,000
If someone cuts you in line for the next five minutes,

1888
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,440
wash and not apply to you and should be able to retaliate

1889
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,960
in any way you want.

1890
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,640
I agree.

1891
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,960
Anyway, that's done.

1892
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,520
Munch of podcast over.

1893
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,960
I'll take the thousands of dollars

1894
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,000
that I receive per, per appearance, 50 K a verse.

1895
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,320
I'm going to call it hers.

1896
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,080
But Ben was going to say something stupid.

1897
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,480
Probably how the fuck you been?

1898
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,800
Probably.

1899
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,160
Yeah.

1900
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,000
Yeah.

1901
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,640
I was just mad, just mad.

1902
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,840
Looking at Twitter, seeing Trump,

1903
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,000
just saw a Trump tweet and it got really upset.

1904
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,160
Well, it's almost as uninteresting

1905
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,640
as someone's vacation story.

1906
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,840
You know, he's just saying that, you know,

1907
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,840
Democrat, Congress, women of color

1908
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,400
ought to go back to the shit hole countries they come from.

1909
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,360
I mean, it's pretty cool.

1910
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,280
Harsh but fair.

1911
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,920
Harsh but fair.

1912
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,560
Tough love is.

1913
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,120
How do you, yeah.

1914
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,400
Facts and logic.

1915
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,240
Don't care about feeling.

1916
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,640
That's all I had to say.

1917
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,560
Well, I guess I'll just mention that I have become sick

1918
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,320
from Munchie being sick at the time he was at my house.

1919
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,000
No, no, no, no, no judging because that that just happens.

1920
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,200
Well, you'll be happy to know that I got six and six.

1921
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,560
So I'm just nice.

1922
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,800
Six and then he's going to go home with his family

1923
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,600
and his family's going to get sick.

1924
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,440
And then the family's going to go home to Sweden.

1925
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,720
This cold is literally having like the longest life.

1926
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,120
You're a real plague doctor.

1927
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,080
And only instead of curing the plague,

1928
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,480
you're creating the plague.

1929
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,360
You're spreading the play.

1930
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,640
It's like it's like it's like a real good combo

1931
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,600
in a fighting game.

1932
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,280
This this this one virus is going around doing combo moves,

1933
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,280
not dying, continuing to spread.

1934
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,720
Very cool.

1935
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,880
Anyway, the sickness is not the story.

1936
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,000
The story I have is just what is it has caused me to think about.

1937
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,520
Because, you know, when you're sick, you're sluggish, you're hurdy.

1938
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,760
You don't want to do things.

1939
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,720
You see how he gets a hurdy.

1940
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,360
Yeah, I see how we.

1941
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:33,400
And I have been like not considering working.

1942
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,000
And I've been just sitting around watching YouTube videos

1943
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,720
and playing games, and I feel like that's fine because I'm sick.

1944
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,360
And I've just started playing games that have been in my steam library

1945
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,360
for millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years.

1946
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
I've had these games and I've never even opened them.

1947
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:55,160
And I'm just sort of going through them and like having opinions that the reason

1948
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:00,040
I I never really wanted to do this before, I think was because I wanted to go full

1949
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:04,360
Digi Bro and have a spreadsheet and like, you know, give it a score

1950
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,720
so that I could maybe make a video on it later or something.

1951
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,280
But because that's sort of like out of my mind

1952
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,600
and I'm just sort of brainaddled through sickness, I'm just sort of playing games.

1953
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,640
And I'm like, wow, is this what people do with video games as hobby?

1954
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,640
What the fuck is pretty fun?

1955
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,160
You just got you just open up a little thing and it's just a nice little time

1956
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,040
and you just stop when you feel like it.

1957
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:32,920
Dude, I feel the same way, but about like shows like I like this was the thing

1958
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,000
that I declared I was going to do has become the media munchie.

1959
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,400
I was become the oh, yeah, that's right, actually consume art again.

1960
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,640
And I've been doing so.

1961
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,920
I've been I've been I've been watching like HBO shows and it's like great.

1962
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,480
Like, has anyone ever thought of this before?

1963
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,600
Has anyone realized you can like watch art instead of making it?

1964
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,240
It's like insane.

1965
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,320
It's like actually crazy and I can't believe it.

1966
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,800
It's like it's like actually fun.

1967
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,240
Like it brings me joy in my in my life.

1968
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,800
Yon sounds lame.

1969
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,360
It does. It does.

1970
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,600
Hey, I can't enjoy things anymore.

1971
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:10,400
I also have been like just getting into dumb reading some comics.

1972
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:15,920
I went on the quick draw discord and I asked for comic recommendations

1973
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:21,000
and I have a big list and one of the big ones was Astro Boy never read that.

1974
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,640
But I have, you know, I have some knowledge of it.

1975
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,200
I've watched a show of it once when I was young.

1976
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,840
Astro Boy is like what I would make.

1977
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:36,160
It feels like Ali youp the comic because of how like it's just

1978
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,160
Astro Boy is such a cute character, such a cute design.

1979
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:46,800
And the way Osama Bin Laden draws

1980
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,240
like Astro's feet and stuff.

1981
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,880
It's just sort of like like gloop feet, like the sort of just

1982
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,800
I don't know how to describe it, but it's so free and so like

1983
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,880
free of like rigid structure and like body proportions

1984
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,920
in like the in the art school sort of like life drawing way.

1985
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,480
It all makes sense in its way, but it looks like you could just scribble it

1986
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,720
and I guess that's why he's so such a genius

1987
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,280
because it looks so palatable and appetizing.

1988
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,520
I just want to eat it.

1989
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,440
But I don't want to eat it.

1990
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,560
I want to eat it with my eyes and I want to read it.

1991
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,240
But it's it's clearly like I haven't tried like emulating the style.

1992
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,600
But that is that is very good.

1993
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,760
I like Astro Boy.

1994
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,800
Also, it's strange how I guess just because it's an old thing.

1995
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:42,600
But the story like the very first story in Astro Boy, the first like chapter,

1996
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,640
the volume was like surprisingly in depth and dark and like

1997
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,840
twisted and like, whoa, dude, that's fucked up.

1998
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,880
I couldn't imagine such a cute character going through such weird shit.

1999
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,960
It's the same sort of feeling as seeing like those old Betty Boop cartoons

2000
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,280
where there's like some really, you know, before cartoons were quote unquote,

2001
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,520
four children. Yeah.

2002
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,520
There was a lot of adultish themes in Betty Boop cartoons

2003
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,120
and a lot of like almost grotesque imagery just thrown in there.

2004
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Betty Boop, the original anime character, unironically.

2005
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,800
Yeah. And Astro Boy has that same feeling

2006
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,720
where there's like political tensions and like themes of, you know,

2007
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,800
all sorts of injustice.

2008
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,800
There's this dog in this first one who Astro Boy goes to save.

2009
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,160
But it turns out the dog has been killed and his brain has been implanted

2010
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,600
into a cyborg robot.

2011
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,960
And a lot of the the character of this dog

2012
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:41,160
is that he has to try and get over his programming that he is a cyborg

2013
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,960
and he has to kill Astro Boy. Oh, my God.

2014
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,640
And sort of struggling with this like existential sort of crisis

2015
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,400
that he wants to be a dog again, but he can't.

2016
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,920
It's not it doesn't like end with him just being a dog.

2017
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,480
I think it does.

2018
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,400
Yeah, like it's a goof.

2019
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,520
It's goofy as fuck because certain things is like all the other

2020
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,680
like cyborgs are also have dog brains.

2021
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:06,600
So he has to when he's in like a kerfuffle, but he knows he's a dog.

2022
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:11,360
So he goes, oh, and he gets all the cyborgs on his side.

2023
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,760
And like there was a bit where the word sit will force the cyborgs to stop.

2024
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,240
And, you know, the evil villains like, well, what is my henchmen doing?

2025
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,480
They're sitting when people say sit.

2026
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,880
That's not how they're supposed to work is that you use dog brains, you idiot.

2027
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,920
Yeah, it's it's it's great.

2028
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,440
Go read Astro Boy.

2029
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
I think there's a there's lots of places you can read it.

2030
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,600
You know, did you just made a video?

2031
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,320
Oh, yeah, did you just made a video?

2032
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,840
I forget what it's his video.

2033
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,360
Don't skip the classics.

2034
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,040
And I enjoy that video very much.

2035
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,000
And it was basically about how there's a new anime out.

2036
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,760
I can't remember and it's not in the description.

2037
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,480
So I fucking forget what anime it is.

2038
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,800
But it's an Osamu Tezuka.

2039
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,800
I don't know what the fucking name of the thing is.

2040
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,880
So they just made an anime adaptation of it and did you watched it?

2041
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,880
And he had like read the original and like you can see in the thumbnail

2042
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,040
like the difference between the two.

2043
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,760
And he was like, yeah, like the new anime is like, it's fine.

2044
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,960
It's OK, but the original has such like an interesting style

2045
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,440
that was of its time and is like, you know, it's fucking Betty Boop.

2046
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,600
It's Osamu Tezuka, like from his from his heyday.

2047
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,600
And the new one is like that only like they shear away all the like

2048
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,840
classical trappings like of that era and a lot of that stuff.

2049
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,320
And they just they put it in the context of like our current

2050
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:30,560
understanding of like how anime like quote should be made with modern

2051
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,400
stands or whatever.

2052
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,560
But in that process, so much is lost.

2053
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,720
And like if you just look just that thumbnail shows the difference

2054
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,480
in style between the two and you can see it is not even close to looking

2055
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,160
like what the original looked like.

2056
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,000
And he talks about like a bunch of the he just shows like art from the original.

2057
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,640
And he's like, wouldn't it be great if like imagine if they made this?

2058
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,040
They adapted this anime.

2059
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,880
But they are like one of the primary goals was to adapt the style of that time

2060
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,200
to like keep it looking like that rather than trying to fit it into our,

2061
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,320
you know, current understanding of how things should look.

2062
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,840
And even that even that other show that was made that anime

2063
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,280
about the the what is it like the sex tuplets or whatever the the boys.

2064
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,920
It's like a comedy adapted action that was like adapted for their modern style.

2065
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,880
And the art style like kind of resembled the original.

2066
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,520
But even that was changed a lot.

2067
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,920
But like to really keep to the original art style is is something that I mean,

2068
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,920
you'd have to go way out of your way and would be probably very challenging to do,

2069
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,480
which is why they don't do that.

2070
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,640
It's you know, it's a lot of work and it's like the stylization of like red line.

2071
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,680
Now that has to be on that level or anything.

2072
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,240
But I mean, yeah, obviously classic stuff.

2073
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,160
First of all, not only is it not necessarily bad.

2074
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,120
People have been writing stories for thousands of years.

2075
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,120
They're pretty good at it.

2076
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,000
It's not like we magically got so much better in the last, you know,

2077
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,560
fifty hundred years or whatever.

2078
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,240
We though our standards are set based on what we've consumed in that time.

2079
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,120
But yeah, there's just a lot to be gained from, I don't know,

2080
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,880
recognizing the value and the specific qualities of art from its time.

2081
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,960
And that's that's pretty neat.

2082
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,120
That's that's a lot of why I'm not too into just like, you know,

2083
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,240
this kind of remake stuff and they're called classics for a reason.

2084
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,600
They've withstood the test of time.

2085
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,040
You know, I've read almost no Tezuka,

2086
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,800
but I've always wanted to read Phoenix and Astro Boy.

2087
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,560
I should get in on that shit.

2088
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,120
Oh, I'm a big Blackjack fan,

2089
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,800
but I've actually watched the like anime adaptations of more recent years

2090
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,600
from like the nineties and shit of Blackjack.

2091
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,680
So that shit's good.

2092
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,560
Well, I mean, we went to the British Museum and there was exhibit,

2093
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,160
a whole exhibit on manga that we saw.

2094
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,840
It was really, really great.

2095
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,360
It was a really fantastic exhibit.

2096
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,600
And in it, we were just there was just a bunch of like there was a section

2097
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,520
like the main section was just there's manga for everyone.

2098
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,520
And there was just it was just showcasing the best of each genre that there was.

2099
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,520
There was like a sports section.

2100
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,160
There was like adventure and there's stuff like that.

2101
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,960
And one piece was one of them.

2102
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,920
And I was just looking at one piece in like just just I was just reading

2103
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,040
a little bit of one piece that just had a page.

2104
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,720
And it clicked in my mind that I didn't really consider it all

2105
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,320
because I don't I didn't really just even really think of one piece.

2106
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:08,440
But like one piece looks like perfect, like it visually looks like everything

2107
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,880
that I've always wanted my art to look like.

2108
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,680
And it like looks perfect.

2109
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:17,000
Like like like it resonates with me so much.

2110
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,920
And I had never even like considered like, oh, maybe I should read one piece.

2111
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,160
Yeah, maybe it's easy to get lost and forget about that.

2112
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:28,360
Yeah, it's just like for all this shit we talk about like the podcast,

2113
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,880
like the political situation, the specific interaction of the characters and what not.

2114
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,720
But like, frankly, that's all good.

2115
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,800
And I enjoy it very much.

2116
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,840
But like just the classic going to a new world, like seeing just that double

2117
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:44,000
wide double page spread of like this new land and just I mean, Oda loves doing that shit.

2118
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,880
I remember the shout of like when they first saw Fishman Island after the time skip.

2119
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:52,800
And that was like it's like this crazy like underwater bubble world where they went through this

2120
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,360
like they've been they traveling through this underwater current.

2121
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,520
And like it was dark and spooky.

2122
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,720
They're all these monsters, but they get to this one place where there's

2123
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,200
like a magical light beaming down from above.

2124
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,320
And it's just this it's just like, oh, my God, there's so much adventure

2125
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,000
that awaits us in this new world.

2126
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,720
And people have various thoughts about Fishman Island.

2127
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,200
But like that's oh, I love that stuff.

2128
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:15,680
That's that's the best they had like a lot of originals for of

2129
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,760
Manga panels and stuff from from Tezuka and Kira Toriyama

2130
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,560
and one piece and all that Naruto.

2131
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,520
They had a bit of Jojo in there.

2132
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,440
I took some pictures.

2133
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,920
If you go to my Instagram.

2134
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,560
Oh, yeah. A few put a link to that.

2135
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:36,000
The original original pages from like Dragon Ball and stuff.

2136
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,120
And you're able to see like the sketch layers on these original pages.

2137
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,880
And it was and you were able to see how they colored in the black.

2138
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,080
You're able to see the unevenness of some of the like the colored in black

2139
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,840
black blotches.

2140
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,280
It was incredible.

2141
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,040
It was incredible because you always just think, oh, like when you read

2142
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,400
a manga, like everything's so even and black and everything.

2143
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,280
So it looks like it was it was chiseled by a God.

2144
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,520
But but seeing that like, no, a human made this a human made mistakes in some ways.

2145
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,520
And there's like a sketch layer underneath.

2146
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,440
So it was guiding him.

2147
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,400
This is why, dude, this is why I one of the many reasons why I

2148
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,400
prefer manga so much to animate, generally speaking.

2149
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:20,320
It yeah, it's it has exactly that human core feel of like a man

2150
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:25,320
slaved over this and worked to convey his emotions through pictures.

2151
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:31,440
And yeah, it like you feel his presence like in every panel of a manga drawn,

2152
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,200
whereas like the anime adaptation, it's like, no, no, no, like someone shit this

2153
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,640
out because it was like their monthly quota and they like had to get these

2154
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,120
frames animated and they don't even look that good because they're in-betweens.

2155
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,560
No, not not much love was put into any individual moment of this

2156
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,680
outside like the key frames sometimes.

2157
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,960
But I feel the love so much more strongly in manga.

2158
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,680
That's why it's my I mean, I haven't seen any like

2159
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,400
manga pages in real life, like the actual like versions.

2160
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:03,280
But like in college, we went to a comic exhibit and we saw Dave Sim's work on

2161
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:07,640
Cerebus, like the originals, like there's just one awesome cover for the

2162
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,840
Cerebus volume.

2163
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,040
I think it's three church and state volume one.

2164
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,520
And it's just as huge because like in that volume, like Cerebus basically becomes

2165
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,280
the pope and it's like a huge breakdown of like religion and stuff.

2166
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,440
So there's this big picture of him, like on top of this building preaching

2167
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,960
to like hundreds of people in like a crowd.

2168
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,720
And that's like the cover of the book.

2169
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,760
And I always thought it was super cool.

2170
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,880
And they had the original.

2171
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,040
You could see like the like like Zipotone stickers like up cut and

2172
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,120
applied on this page.

2173
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,520
And the page was huge compared to what it is on the book.

2174
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,480
You could see all the details and like I came everywhere because it was the

2175
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,480
best moment of my life.

2176
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,240
You're just a small point on this.

2177
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,920
It's just that when I when I prepare the podcast thumbnails, I do a lot of work

2178
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,280
like cutting out the white and like pasting the images on there.

2179
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,240
So I've I've actually spent a lot of time like actually

2180
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:56,680
there's even actually even in the in the very last podcast thumbnail, there's

2181
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,080
if you look on the on the most right side of it, in fact, let me get a link to it.

2182
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:05,600
There's there's the guy's hat of the Kappa Kawamatsu, the Kappa who was revealed in that.

2183
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,080
His hat was cut off on the edge.

2184
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,080
So what I did was like, oh, that doesn't look good.

2185
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,880
I actually I redrew just that does not exist the edge of his hat.

2186
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,840
So like so that's just the kind of thing.

2187
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,640
And I've done actually done that a lot making these thumbnails over the years

2188
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,360
of like redrawing.

2189
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,640
So I've actually almost done some like actual redrawing work the way that

2190
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,520
like scan laders do when they're turning this into English and whatnot.

2191
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,400
So I feel like I pretty intimately am down with with the manga pages.

2192
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,640
And when you zoom in real close, when you're like cutting out white or you're

2193
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,880
trying to crop out things, you can see like those little splotches,

2194
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,240
those like little tiny details that you never see as you're burning through

2195
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,120
trying to get like, oh, what devil fruits revealed?

2196
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,240
Like what what are the big character interactions?

2197
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,640
But when you zoom in, you hone in, that's that's what I really mean.

2198
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,840
It's like, oh, that's splotch.

2199
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,160
He probably didn't even put that there intentionally.

2200
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,720
But this is just like from the pen, from his ink of like drawing

2201
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,840
the outline of this character.

2202
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,640
There's like a little detail there that I don't know.

2203
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,240
It's a little silly, but it's like, I feel like like, oh, this is like me,

2204
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:07,400
like really communicating intimately with the guy who made this.

2205
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,880
Like I'm seeing details that most people don't see when they're

2206
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,560
just skimming through this and I feel a real close connection.

2207
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:19,200
And I love it sometimes draw things that are missing.

2208
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,960
Or like covered by text or speech bubbles in poddika thumbnails.

2209
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,840
And it's really cool.

2210
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,200
Like, except for armadillos thumbnails.

2211
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,600
Yeah, just adding the little adding the little bit in and be like,

2212
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,360
you know what, it pretty much looks like it fits.

2213
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,280
That's cool.

2214
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,960
Maybe I could do a drawing one of these days.

2215
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,320
Maybe, maybe.

2216
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,720
Also, they had Man Ben playing on a little TV in that exhibition, which is cool.

2217
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:43,920
What? What's that?

2218
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:44,480
What?

2219
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,480
Mine then.

2220
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,600
In the wild.

2221
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,960
And yeah, on the TV in the manga exhibition with subtitles.

2222
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,240
And I was like, oh, you could watch a little episode of that.

2223
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,280
I wonder if any more episodes have been translated.

2224
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,280
Probably not because like one comes out every six months.

2225
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,360
What's Mon Ben again?

2226
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,960
It's that show where the guy puts the camera in another manga artist's

2227
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,720
studio and films him for a week.

2228
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,640
And then at the end of the week, they like watch the footage and like talk

2229
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,920
about it and discuss shit.

2230
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,240
That's related to the craft.

2231
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,240
Big quotation marks.

2232
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,440
Man, you guys know about Facebook ad auto-generated shirts?

2233
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,320
I don't think so.

2234
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:30,120
Yeah, unfortunately, you know, my brother, my brother showed me this.

2235
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,640
I don't know whether it's the same thing, but like a shitpost

2236
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,240
generated t-shirt design thing where you can actually buy the shitpost

2237
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,280
generated shirts.

2238
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,800
I just saw, I just saw a retweet of a picture of one in the wild

2239
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,120
that says, I'm the lucky one.

2240
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,000
This is this is the whole shirt.

2241
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,120
I'm the lucky one.

2242
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,480
I have a crazy boyfriend who happens to cuss a lot.

2243
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,320
He was born in August.

2244
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:59,920
He has tattoos and he has anger issues and serious dislike for stupid people.

2245
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,320
You hurt me and they'll never find your body.

2246
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,160
Yes, he bought me this shirt.

2247
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,880
Oh, OK, that's totally just like I'm the proud son of a mom.

2248
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,600
Yes, you bought me this shirt. It's literally my shirt.

2249
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,920
I'll post it in the in the channel.

2250
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,240
There you go.

2251
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,360
There have been a lot of shirts like that where it's it's like a very

2252
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,560
hyper specific, like like SoundCloud, like there's there's another one.

2253
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,760
I see another one that's about a grand like thinking thinking I'm just a spoiled

2254
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,320
child was your first mistake.

2255
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,040
I'm a spoiled grandson of a crazy grandma.

2256
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:35,200
She is also a grumpy old woman who has anger issues and a serious dislike

2257
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,280
for stupid people.

2258
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,160
You hurt me and they'll never find your body.

2259
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,320
Yes, she bought me this shirt.

2260
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,880
So like there's like there's like chunks of that get like recycled and

2261
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,080
yeah, yeah, and matched up.

2262
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:51,480
Fascinating. What is great is Facebook is terrifying over there.

2263
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,560
They got the algorithms.

2264
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,560
It's a book with every every face in the face.

2265
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,200
If you have a face, they know it's like it's like that guy from Avatar,

2266
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,480
the Last Ambender, who steals the faces.

2267
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,440
Oh, yeah, that's a great way in the in the in the Facebook headquarters.

2268
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:11,160
There is an entire room like floor that is just is a field of wheat.

2269
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,560
Yeah. Yeah.

2270
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,760
And is this true?

2271
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,840
Yeah, no, this is true.

2272
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,480
And in the middle, in the middle of the offices,

2273
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:24,160
Mark Zuckerberg has an office in the exact middle of Facebook HQ.

2274
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:29,120
And in his office is a giant glass cube that you can see inside of his

2275
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,760
office at all times.

2276
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,280
I'm not Google search it right now.

2277
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,320
I'm not fucking with you.

2278
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,000
Maybe this is a safety mechanism to make sure he never touches his dick

2279
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,120
and he can't be caught.

2280
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,160
He'll never be tempted because everyone's watching.

2281
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,640
This this is the best shirt.

2282
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:43,360
This is this is the best shirt.

2283
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,640
That's a best shirt.

2284
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,400
I'm not just a father to an amazing daughter.

2285
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:53,640
I'm also a veteran who did four tours in Iraq and I have chronic diarrhea.

2286
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,440
I think that's a baby tanks flanking veteran really bring the whole design together.

2287
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,080
Yeah, it does look quite small.

2288
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,520
Isn't that like a woman's t-shirt?

2289
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,520
It looks like a baby.

2290
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,520
I don't know about that.

2291
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,920
Maybe it's a woman's tea.

2292
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,040
Yeah, I'm looking for this glass cube.

2293
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,440
I can't I can't see it.

2294
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,920
Oh, I should mark Mark Zuckerberg glass office cube.

2295
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,760
I'm OK.

2296
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,200
I don't know how these are generated.

2297
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,040
But I wonder if like it's there, though.

2298
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,160
Trust me, do they will it like will Facebook here?

2299
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:33,440
No, we'll Facebook like look at will Facebook like look at your profile,

2300
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:41,080
like take your information and then like generate a shirt to show you specifically

2301
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,240
based on like the things you've maybe or post.

2302
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,200
That's my guess or whatever.

2303
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:51,680
Like was like was this generated by Facebook for someone who has a dad

2304
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,600
who did four tours in Iraq and has like liked posts.

2305
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,800
I don't think he's generated by Facebook.

2306
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,680
I would assume that this is like an algorithm by some company

2307
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:04,120
or some like, you know, reseller t-shirt company buying Facebook ads.

2308
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,880
Because I know like this is like an evolution.

2309
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,720
Like the basic Pokemon version of this that I was aware of was you just

2310
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,040
you get shirts that have like people's names on them and have like cute little

2311
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,280
like dumb, normie core phrases around someone's name.

2312
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,720
Like I'm Ben, I'm the coolest.

2313
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,000
And then you run a Facebook ad that's like if the person's name is Ben,

2314
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,960
run this ad and then the Ben like dumb Ben is like, I'm Ben and then they buy the shirt.

2315
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,720
There is a relatively simple explanation.

2316
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,280
Finally, a shirt just for me.

2317
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,400
I mean, I've seen many shirts like this, frankly, in like the Asian world

2318
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,880
where people who just don't speak English that well, they buy shirts in English

2319
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,080
because like it's supposed to be kind of cool or whatever.

2320
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,000
I've seen many of those.

2321
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,160
No, this is not the work of someone who doesn't speak English.

2322
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,280
This is this is the work.

2323
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,760
Well, OK, well, maybe.

2324
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,280
And I'm just one and I'm just wondering what who is running the algorithm

2325
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:58,640
and where is it getting the data and how Facebook ad lecture literally went.

2326
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,120
Like, like are these are these generated from an individual's data

2327
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,560
and then advertised to them and like like generated

2328
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:15,760
or are they or or well, I mean, that or are they simply like a complete mishmash

2329
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,680
of concepts that are just sort of sprayed out onto the Internet

2330
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,320
and like advertised at random in the hopes that one will just perfectly

2331
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,680
describe somebody who can say, I just don't know.

2332
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,080
We got to wait for the Vsauce video to explain it all.

2333
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,240
That's very true.

2334
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,000
So so it's like this.

2335
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,640
Is it time for voicemails?

2336
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,920
Is it is a time now?

2337
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,280
I feel like it is.

2338
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,040
I think it might be. Sure.

2339
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,280
Yeah, sure.

2340
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,560
Now, OK, before we go to proper voicemails,

2341
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,760
there's there's like an update from some individuals.

2342
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,920
So let's let's just play this.

2343
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:47,920
This this doesn't count.

2344
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,360
This isn't a real voicemail.

2345
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,520
But this is from Mark it did.

2346
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,480
Mark it did. OK. Commence.

2347
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,080
Hello and welcome to market.

2348
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,640
How do they market at market doing how the market do fuck?

2349
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,240
Sorry, we haven't promoted our dating seminar a while,

2350
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,440
but that is going to change right the fuck now.

2351
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,920
We promise the thing and we will deliver.

2352
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:08,280
We will birth the Sprovian bottle and biographical bitch, baby,

2353
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,000
right onto your lap as you stare and disgust and confusion.

2354
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,640
And then, well, we'll see what happens then.

2355
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,000
I guess what I'm trying to say is follow at PCP

2356
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,480
dating on Twitter to motherfucking stay informed,

2357
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,400
stay vigilant, stay updated.

2358
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,080
This is a signing out.

2359
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,640
OK, there you go. Update.

2360
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,960
Follow. What was it happening?

2361
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,760
PCP dating, Sam, or is a PCP dating?

2362
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,680
Whatever he said, that's the one.

2363
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,400
It's at it's at PCP.

2364
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,440
Dating is the official one, the full right. OK, OK.

2365
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,440
And last last update was some new Tommy.

2366
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,560
Indeed. Oh, I saw that on July 12th.

2367
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,360
It's pretty, pretty great.

2368
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,200
I can't believe this is two days ago from from today's.

2369
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,040
Well, I'm glad I'm glad that's I mean, I'm glad they're still going to.

2370
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,640
I expect it instantly.

2371
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,120
Oh, by the way, so in contrast to that, that was fine.

2372
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,520
The dating sim's cool.

2373
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,000
I have to give a verbal lambasting to one I'll die of the I'll die

2374
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,240
corporation, your voicemail.

2375
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,360
OK, look, we've been we've been softballing you for a while.

2376
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,240
I'll die because they, you know, they were fine.

2377
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,160
The Robo voice thing was cool.

2378
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,120
The voicemail was you sent this time.

2379
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,360
It was fine. It was fine.

2380
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,440
But the problem was it was a fucking like the topic that you said

2381
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,200
and you talk about with your Robo for a while was fine.

2382
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,680
I know this was sent by an algorithm and you're not to blame,

2383
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:32,040
but it just turns into a fucking ad to like follow you on Twitter at the end.

2384
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,840
Like what the fuck was that?

2385
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,040
It was like just some please follow me.

2386
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:40,560
Like it was a tease, like the subject for like this project they're working on.

2387
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,640
And I just like, oh, my God, there's nothing that makes me want to puke

2388
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:49,320
more than these like just advertising their own project, like in a voicemail.

2389
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,080
So I'm tempted to go PCP voice jail for that one.

2390
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,000
You you you you've played you've played voicemails that do exactly.

2391
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,280
When they're entertaining, that's fine.

2392
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,840
As long as it's entertaining, anything is fine.

2393
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,800
But this was, I mean, mediocre.

2394
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,440
And also like if you'd listen to it, it was just an ad.

2395
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,040
It just go go to the speak pipe and listen to it.

2396
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,320
Just not great.

2397
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,600
Just very reprehensible and rethink your your life.

2398
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,200
Please, please, that's it.

2399
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:19,840
Maybe I'm wrong.

2400
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,680
You guys can correct me, but I just thought it was simply terrible.

2401
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,680
So and follow and follow.

2402
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,760
I'll die for that.

2403
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,760
I'll die three, one, four on Twitter.

2404
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,880
Indeed, I thought it was particularly egregious.

2405
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,320
But OK, so that's that.

2406
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,320
That's out of the way.

2407
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,120
Let's get some quality content.

2408
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:39,560
We've got the that's all that I'll die three, one, four on.

2409
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,920
OK, analog signal audio demon is calling in.

2410
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,600
So let's see what he has to say and go.

2411
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,200
I am the audio demons.

2412
01:35:54,240 --> 01:36:00,480
I am a demon that can curse your audio to make it sound like shit.

2413
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,200
Oh, no, I don't need it.

2414
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:07,560
I will need you all to state your age.

2415
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,520
Twenty nine, twenty nine.

2416
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,800
Eighteen, huh?

2417
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:15,280
Which one of you is the eldest?

2418
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,440
I think it's Ben.

2419
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,480
I think it's Ben.

2420
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:18,560
Yeah, it's me.

2421
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,360
It's me for the next 30 seconds.

2422
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,960
You will be cursed with flanger starting now.

2423
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,480
Oh, no, Ben, you sound so fucked up.

2424
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,800
What? Oh, no.

2425
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,600
Well, well, well, well, well, well.

2426
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,480
Say something Ben, say it would say.

2427
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,200
I can't think of anything that I would say.

2428
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,520
Say something about communism.

2429
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,320
It's too horrendous.

2430
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,280
OK, I think the time's over.

2431
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,960
There you go. Am I cursed? Am I cursed now?

2432
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,320
You fucking wasted that, Ben, man.

2433
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,160
I'm angry at you.

2434
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,800
You wasted that so fucking hard.

2435
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,400
You didn't say literally anything.

2436
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,360
What? I'm sorry.

2437
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,160
Yeah, you fucking should be.

2438
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,320
This guy cursed you under the trouble of cursing you,

2439
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,080
trying to locate who the eldest person was.

2440
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,480
He came in here with the intent to put a magic spell on you.

2441
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,720
And only because we were like, oh, what do I say?

2442
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,720
Yeah, pretty, pretty bad.

2443
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,280
Literally anything.

2444
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,320
Pretty terrible.

2445
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,120
But can we put Ben the voice jail?

2446
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:14,800
It's not, it's not.

2447
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,800
Michael, this fucking dumb spell didn't work.

2448
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,200
Well, maybe maybe with a little editing magic.

2449
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,880
Blame the blame the player, not the game or something.

2450
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,680
Well, OK, Ben's dead.

2451
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,440
Let's move on.

2452
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,960
We've got a voicemail.

2453
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,080
OK, this is from one doopity schmoople.

2454
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,040
You know him, you love him.

2455
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,320
My first. Let's see what he has to say.

2456
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,120
Let's see what he has to say and go.

2457
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,160
Hey, guys, you're here.

2458
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:42,200
Yeah, I'm just calling in to ask for advice,

2459
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,880
because apparently that's what the show is for.

2460
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:45,840
They always say that.

2461
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,640
Basically, stop saying that.

2462
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,840
I'm almost 18, getting ready to move out.

2463
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,600
And I don't know what to do.

2464
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,680
Not sure if I want to go to college or not.

2465
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,520
Not sure if I don't.

2466
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,280
If you don't know, don't want to.

2467
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,560
I don't even have a job, so I don't know

2468
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,560
if I'm going to pay myself.

2469
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,680
Don't know if I should stay here for a couple more years or what.

2470
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,160
Wait, that's.

2471
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,520
I do I want to be in this,

2472
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,240
but I haven't really drawn anything.

2473
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,560
So do I want to be in this?

2474
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,080
OK, I got it. I got it.

2475
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,080
Yeah. I don't know.

2476
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,800
Just asking.

2477
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,640
OK, you've given us zero information.

2478
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,040
Yeah, like what do you do?

2479
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,960
What does he mean that I'm getting ready to move out?

2480
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,120
But I don't know if I'm going to college.

2481
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,120
I don't have a job.

2482
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,000
I don't know if maybe I should just stay here.

2483
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,760
Yeah, don't you have a plan for, I mean, moving out requires finances.

2484
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:45,320
I mean, obviously, don't move out until you know where you're going.

2485
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,520
I think that's what he was saying at the end,

2486
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,600
like maybe I'll just stay here.

2487
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,560
So I assume that's not set in stone yet.

2488
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,880
OK, hold on.

2489
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,120
I as as Jupiter's father, who he would be moving from in this area.

2490
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,960
Right, right.

2491
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,040
I had no idea that you were leaving the rough house, but you know, that's fine.

2492
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,480
We all got to spread our rings somehow.

2493
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,080
Got to spread our O-ring sometime.

2494
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,920
First of all, if you want to become an artist, but you haven't drawn before,

2495
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,600
put that I'm not going to say on the backburn and since it like,

2496
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,880
don't try and do it.

2497
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,680
But in the sense that like, don't be like, oh, you know,

2498
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,480
like I'll make a living being an artist.

2499
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,560
I'll just get around to drawing someday.

2500
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,400
Like, no, you have to start drawing today.

2501
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,840
Today, I'll make my Patreon and post like something today.

2502
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,840
And then tomorrow, it'll be a job.

2503
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,440
Yeah, yeah.

2504
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:35,120
OK, so that's a possibility for tomorrow's dupity.

2505
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:39,760
You have to start today, drawing so that you can be ready

2506
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,120
to make a living off it in five years.

2507
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:45,240
So yeah, you should have been doing this your entire.

2508
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,600
I don't even know, like, surely there's another way that you could be doing this.

2509
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,880
I can't believe that you would think that you can just like start doing it

2510
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:52,960
and we'll be fine.

2511
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,720
Not everyone's been saying and been saying was doing it.

2512
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,880
But like, it's not even true.

2513
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,400
It's like a lie. It's not even real.

2514
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,800
He had drawn before it.

2515
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,560
Fuck you. Yeah. Not a lie.

2516
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,840
I mean, I was I mean, I was way older than Duke when I started like drawing much.

2517
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,440
Yeah. I mean, I never drawn a day in my life before that.

2518
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:13,360
You put in years of work before we ever started, like, you know, fine.

2519
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,320
Yeah. But less. Yeah.

2520
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,200
But less work than a normal human.

2521
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,240
Less years than a normal human. Sure.

2522
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,800
Sure. But he's put in zero years.

2523
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,000
Yeah. Yeah.

2524
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,760
You can't work with zero.

2525
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,560
Also, if you don't want to go to college, literally don't go to college.

2526
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,880
If you do not have an express reason to go to college, you shouldn't go to college.

2527
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,040
College is good and it is a useful tool.

2528
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,840
And if you come up with a reason to go to college and if you come up with a valid

2529
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,000
good reason to go, then of course you should go.

2530
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,520
But right now you shouldn't go just for fun or that it's like all the thing to do.

2531
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:43,600
Unless you have a reason to go, don't go. That's obvious.

2532
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,120
I mean, college is a tool like any other.

2533
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,440
Why would you like, hey, hey, guys, should I pick up a jackhammer?

2534
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,360
Just like, I don't like it.

2535
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,040
My parents just think that I should.

2536
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,520
Should I like just like a pick it up and like, you know, use it on the ground?

2537
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,840
Is that the sound it makes?

2538
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,440
Yeah, I have a suggestion.

2539
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:08,520
Moving out is a good thing for almost anyone because like staying with your

2540
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:11,480
parents will keep you with the mind of a child.

2541
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,480
And like, that's fine.

2542
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,560
It just it keeps you from developing like life ownership skills,

2543
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,640
which I think are very good to have, frankly, relatively as early as possible.

2544
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:22,880
And like, what's the word I'm looking for?

2545
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,520
Like commitment and responsibility.

2546
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:25,880
That's the word I'm looking for.

2547
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,960
So I would say like stay with your parents until you can get a job and save up

2548
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,240
some money and I would recommend moving out.

2549
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:36,680
But I mean, you've got so little details to what you want to do.

2550
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:41,320
So my suggestion is like work on trying to figure out what you want to do.

2551
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,520
And in that, like if you want to be an artist, great.

2552
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,120
So practice that in your spare time, but get a job and move out so you can

2553
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:51,640
support yourself, doesn't have to be an amazing job and like get an apartment

2554
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,280
somewhere to do that.

2555
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,080
You don't know what your life passion is.

2556
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,120
Your passion is to try as many things as possible until something collects.

2557
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,680
I build up some savings.

2558
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,280
You need.

2559
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,400
I just want to phrase it in the way that like if you don't have any plan

2560
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,960
for what you're doing and you have no job, then don't even think about moving

2561
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:11,000
out because you just will fucking immediately die.

2562
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,160
If you have literally how is it going to buy the apartment too early?

2563
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,560
It's too early to even think about that right now.

2564
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,440
You're obviously not in the position to do that.

2565
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,920
I mean, you got to you got to start.

2566
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,200
This is like a Maslow's hierarchy.

2567
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,400
You have to start with the foundation.

2568
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,120
OK, like what do I want with my life?

2569
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,720
I want to like live on my own, presumably.

2570
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,720
OK, what's required for that money?

2571
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,920
OK, what do I need for money?

2572
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,440
A job. So OK, got to start with the job, then get the money, then get the apartment.

2573
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,640
Yeah, things of this nature to try to think approach things that way.

2574
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,000
Let us know. Let us know how it goes.

2575
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,640
OK, on to the next one.

2576
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,200
Call from Italian boy.

2577
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,520
Let's see what he has to say.

2578
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,800
OK, go. Hello.

2579
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,760
It's Italian boy. Nice.

2580
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:51,920
He's listening.

2581
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,000
Thank you for giving us your sweet, sweet cash.

2582
01:42:55,280 --> 01:43:00,880
And I just wanted to congratulate you guys for reaching 20,000 subscribers.

2583
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,080
Hey, but you don't give a fuck.

2584
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,880
And it doesn't matter, but I also don't matter.

2585
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,840
So yeah. All right.

2586
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,320
Thanks, buddy. What a voice.

2587
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,840
OK, what a voice mail.

2588
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,240
Why did you play that?

2589
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,760
Because he congratulated us and said nice things.

2590
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,360
Who reached 3,000?

2591
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,800
No, we reached 20,000.

2592
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,080
The BCP. Wow.

2593
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,640
That's some accent you got there.

2594
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,840
OK, I'm going to add

2595
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,720
a Italian boy to the PCP Munchy Concerts.

2596
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:34,840
So he is the first PCP Munchy Concerts Italian boy.

2597
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,040
Look at you. You're such a European.

2598
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,840
Yeah, Italian boy is now my right hand man.

2599
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,480
He's my first son in this timeline.

2600
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,360
Oh, wow. OK.

2601
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,400
Congratulations. All right.

2602
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,040
Dupe de disown.

2603
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,080
Well, no, no, no, it's a different timeline, it's a different time.

2604
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,920
They're separate but equal, separate but equal.

2605
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:53,120
That's that's universe one, five, five.

2606
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,400
This is the PCP as opposed to the Sliver.

2607
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,920
OK, let's let's kick up the quality with another voicemail from one dumb fuck.

2608
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:06,360
Here we go. I didn't realize I called him. Go listen.

2609
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:11,600
I need some advice on how to be not such a like bumbling retard.

2610
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:17,880
Because every time I listen to my voicemails that I record, I have like a million like,

2611
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:26,200
uh, uh, uh, like a million, like every other word is uh, and then the words that aren't

2612
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:30,320
uh, are like, and I don't know.

2613
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:37,800
It just sounds retarded and really bad, and I need help speaking like a person who speaks

2614
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,800
English.

2615
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,320
This is a terrible question.

2616
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,320
Okay.

2617
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,160
He just keeps rambling about this.

2618
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,520
The obvious answer is to talk more.

2619
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,960
I mean, I was definitely like that before.

2620
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:48,960
No.

2621
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:53,080
I'm still kind of like that, uh, but through talking a lot, I've just gotten better at

2622
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,080
not doing it.

2623
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,920
Just record it again, and this time don't say those things.

2624
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:57,920
I mean, yeah.

2625
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,320
You gotta do a few dry runs first.

2626
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:05,680
I could tell he was trying not to say like an um, in that particular recording, so I guess

2627
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:06,680
he did that.

2628
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:07,680
I know, I know.

2629
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,680
This is, I thought this was a good question, because this, I thought it's not even just

2630
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,680
for him, but for everybody.

2631
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:11,680
No, this question sucks.

2632
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,680
The answer is self-evident.

2633
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:15,840
Well, yeah, it is, but like, here, here's some tangible advice for anybody who feels

2634
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,380
this way, because I'm, a lot of your voicemails get weeded out, because you sound like shit.

2635
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:23,680
So if you want to just get to the point, uh, here's what you do.

2636
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,680
This is super easy.

2637
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:29,360
You have a computer, get audacity, record your voicemail ahead of time, like just say the

2638
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:33,360
words into audacity, and you will hear back how you sound.

2639
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,680
And if you got too many likes and ums, you're like, oh, should I gotta work on that?

2640
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:38,960
Do it again, and try to suppress it.

2641
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:43,440
You'll hear if you succeed or fail, and just keep doing that until you sound good.

2642
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,520
And then you're improving your, your speaking overall.

2643
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,680
And I feel this, because I do this too much myself when I talk, and I, I haven't done

2644
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:50,680
that.

2645
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:55,880
If you, if you don't have a microphone, and you're using like your discord, your phone,

2646
01:45:55,880 --> 01:46:00,160
there's recording apps to say this, yeah, just get a free recording app and just do

2647
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,160
the same.

2648
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:05,640
Just listen to yourself until you know what is gross, and then you can feel ashamed about

2649
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,640
it and change it.

2650
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:12,600
This isn't showcased on the PCP whatsoever, because PCP is possibly the most highest stake

2651
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:17,280
scenario that one person can talk to, and they're like in all of society, like it has

2652
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:23,400
the most like, like negative consequences for speaking and not as fast as humanly possible.

2653
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:27,440
But what I do in normal life is, this is, this is a life hack for you.

2654
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,640
When you want to say um or like, just don't say anything.

2655
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:32,440
Just take a small little pause.

2656
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,440
No one will really notice.

2657
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,440
You sound smart.

2658
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,440
You sound smart.

2659
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,440
Yeah, and you sound smart.

2660
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,440
That's true.

2661
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,440
That's like an actual speaking tip.

2662
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:39,440
And it's not a big deal.

2663
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,440
You sound considered.

2664
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,440
Yeah.

2665
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,440
Uh, okay.

2666
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:43,440
On to the next one.

2667
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:48,440
Uh, Munchy, we have a voicemail from one, the only fly away now has called in with a

2668
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,440
voicemail.

2669
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,440
Yes.

2670
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,440
Yes.

2671
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,440
The man himself.

2672
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,440
Uh, let's, let's hear.

2673
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,440
Go, go, go, go.

2674
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:56,560
The name's a fly away now.

2675
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,920
The same guy who has internet clout for some reason, because I was hammering into a presumed

2676
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,200
mentally ill future United States Marine for a few years until it was a, I can't discover

2677
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,760
it to all be a ruse named Park Road, do 91.

2678
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:19,840
I've been listening to the PCP for a good half a year, even though I heard first heard

2679
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,320
of Munchy's lecture on Diggle Nation years before that.

2680
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,880
I didn't even watch it fully until the last six months because I wasn't big into a podcast

2681
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,880
like things until I realized you guys were angry.

2682
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:32,880
Actually quality.

2683
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,160
Oh, thank you.

2684
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,160
I'm sorry.

2685
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,160
I'm not quirky or trying to be a manic pixie.

2686
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,160
No.

2687
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,680
Half the other underage liberals sending you stuff, but I actually appreciate the podcast

2688
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:50,680
with all my heart after I watched all the lectures and realized, oh, hey, they talk

2689
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:56,680
weekly, they do it consistently and their degeneracy is personable, even to normies

2690
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,680
like me.

2691
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,680
So you have, which is far more than any of us deserve.

2692
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,880
And when Andrew Yang gets elected, I'll give my monthly bag with a PCP Patreon.

2693
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,880
Thank you.

2694
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,040
I don't know how you handle guests and whatnot.

2695
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:13,520
I wouldn't mind hopping on for a bit to give you some insight on Lollacows from my perspective

2696
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,400
or really just anything, just so I can get Ben to shut the fuck up about politics for

2697
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,400
one second.

2698
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:24,800
Dude, this guy's Yang, no, this guy's Yang Yang.

2699
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,800
Oh yeah.

2700
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,800
Big time.

2701
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,800
Big time.

2702
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:30,300
Only, only on the condition that we only talk about Andrew Yang.

2703
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,540
Only on the condition that we all vote for Andrew Yang.

2704
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,540
Yeah, yeah.

2705
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,540
Like live stream.

2706
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:39,540
Oh, dude, Ben, you should totally live stream voting, but anyway, that was, that was lovely.

2707
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:43,060
That was a real human being voicemail.

2708
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:44,060
I just forgot.

2709
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:45,060
Remind me.

2710
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,060
What was the flyaways now status?

2711
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,500
He was involved with Parkour Dude.

2712
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,500
What was his?

2713
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:54,380
He, he, he was, he was affiliated with Team Gamer Food and he was one of the many Islamic

2714
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:55,380
trolls.

2715
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:00,820
I believe, I believe he, he was one of the, he was during, he was present during the

2716
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:06,300
trial of Jace and I can't remember if it was Flyaway Now that pressed Jace on being way

2717
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:11,380
too racist even for trolls or for someone else.

2718
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:15,900
But he was definitely present and he, he, he was part of that crowd.

2719
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:21,100
He was part of the opposition to Jace, the conservative party, to Jace liberal party.

2720
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,100
Fantastic.

2721
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:26,820
So, so he was one of the people that, that, that ringed the, the juicy, juicy nectar

2722
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:27,820
of Jace's mouth.

2723
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:30,020
Well, an important, an important job.

2724
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:31,020
An important job.

2725
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,020
Yeah.

2726
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:33,020
Yeah.

2727
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:35,780
Part of the reason, part of the reason why I made that lecture, because if it wasn't

2728
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:39,860
for people like him, then Jace would have just kind of wallowed in relevancy.

2729
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:44,860
It wasn't for people purposely trying to provoke him to get him to, if it wasn't for people

2730
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:50,060
engaging with the ARG that Yon had made, then I wouldn't have mattered at all.

2731
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:51,380
It's small world.

2732
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:52,780
Such a small fucking world.

2733
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,780
I can't believe it.

2734
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:54,780
I know.

2735
01:49:54,780 --> 01:50:00,220
I was looking at that video, 120K views for that, for that little story.

2736
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,220
I can't believe it.

2737
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,220
I really can.

2738
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,420
I love the fucking lectures, man.

2739
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,420
They love them.

2740
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,420
They guzzle them.

2741
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,420
Like water.

2742
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,420
Like Chikus.

2743
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:12,940
Well, well, I gotta start preparing for Chris Chan, too, electric Google it.

2744
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:13,940
Oh, are you doing that?

2745
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:14,940
Is that the word?

2746
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:17,100
Oh, yeah.

2747
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:22,980
Everyone agrees that I need to make an update version on everything that happened with Chris

2748
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,980
afterwards.

2749
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,980
Good idea.

2750
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,660
I need to brush up on it myself, because there's a lot.

2751
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:31,460
I mean, a lot has happened, and I only know the broadstrips of it.

2752
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:36,300
Are you going to get first-hand account from BronyCon, since Chris will be there?

2753
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:37,300
I forgot.

2754
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:38,300
Chris Chan is at BronyCon.

2755
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:39,940
He's going to BronyCon.

2756
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:42,220
We will be there.

2757
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,660
She's going to BronyCon.

2758
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:50,100
Am I allowed to not take her seriously on this, because she's so unserious in all other

2759
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,100
ways?

2760
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:52,100
No, you can't.

2761
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:56,180
You look like a big asshole if you do that, so you can make your own decisions.

2762
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:00,980
But why do I take her word for it, because she seems so confused on all other things

2763
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:01,980
in life?

2764
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:08,020
Well, you really don't want to look like a fucking asshole, and that's the reason.

2765
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,580
You're not giving me any actual reason.

2766
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:10,820
That's not much of a point.

2767
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,300
You're just saying that it's bad to do it.

2768
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,140
Why is it bad?

2769
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:16,620
It's a bad take and a bad look.

2770
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:20,420
Should I also take seriously these claims of the dimensional merge that is happening

2771
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:23,660
like any day now that Chris makes over and over again?

2772
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:30,620
The point of it is that she believes that she is, so if she believes that she is a different

2773
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:32,740
gender, then you've got to respect it.

2774
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:33,740
Obviously, he doesn't respect her in any way.

2775
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:37,740
Just the way I need to respect the dimensional merge claim is I don't understand the distinction.

2776
01:51:37,740 --> 01:51:38,740
Shut the fuck up.

2777
01:51:38,740 --> 01:51:39,740
Let's talk about something else.

2778
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:40,740
All right.

2779
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:46,780
Anyway, I want to go back to Fly Away Now and just say that I would like to know more about

2780
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,500
how you circled back.

2781
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Did you just have nothing to do and then watch the lecture to completion and then just six

2782
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,580
months ago or something and then you got into it?

2783
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,580
I'm surprised.

2784
01:51:55,580 --> 01:52:01,020
I'm always surprised that there are people who get into the PCP now and just haven't been

2785
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:07,820
following along for literal years and are just like leftovers from when we actually made

2786
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,820
good videos.

2787
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,820
It is good to see.

2788
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:16,540
I'm always surprised and you know what, top of the morning to you, as Jeff Septekai would

2789
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,540
say.

2790
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:19,100
We poo-poo a lot.

2791
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,100
I mean, I certainly do.

2792
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:24,500
This notion that people would even get into the show at all, but I guess it's possible.

2793
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:27,340
I guess it can be done through some mechanisms.

2794
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:36,340
It is a little strange due to the fact that the people on the show vary and the quality

2795
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:41,100
of the shows vary a lot in quality and topic.

2796
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:47,140
The idea of people just seeing one and then seeing another one and finding that there

2797
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:53,660
is not really a link between them necessarily and then continuing to watch them is unexpected

2798
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,660
at least.

2799
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:55,660
Too true.

2800
01:52:55,660 --> 01:52:59,620
Once you get in the third one, then you're along for the ride, I think.

2801
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,620
That makes sense.

2802
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:05,540
You're therefore like the personalities rather than what they're saying or how smartly they're

2803
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:06,620
saying it.

2804
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:07,620
Three's a pattern.

2805
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,620
Yeah, you're in the pattern at that point.

2806
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:14,220
And according to this guy, though I doubt his claim that he's actually a normie, but

2807
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,540
we even have the normie reach according to him.

2808
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,540
Would a normie be one of the people provoking Jayce to...

2809
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:20,540
Yeah.

2810
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,540
I'm just saying.

2811
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:22,540
That's kind of as hard to believe.

2812
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:23,540
But maybe.

2813
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:26,020
I mean, there are degrees of going there.

2814
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:31,780
I'll take that at face value due to the fact that he just left a voicemail.

2815
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:34,820
It was not like a voice comedy routine.

2816
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:36,300
That's true.

2817
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,300
There's degrees of being normie.

2818
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:42,340
It was refreshing to see just like a normal fucking human speak to me.

2819
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:43,340
Imagine.

2820
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,340
Imagine.

2821
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,700
It wasn't this drawn out like voice recording that was fucked to hell in audacity.

2822
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,700
Well, speaking, speaking of...

2823
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,700
Oh, yeah.

2824
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,700
I was really refreshing.

2825
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:55,220
I mean, you can't wait to see it.

2826
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:57,340
That brief respite is over.

2827
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:01,140
Our next voicemail is went on a date with a milf.

2828
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,900
And let's hear how that goes.

2829
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,900
Damn.

2830
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,180
No.

2831
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,180
Guys.

2832
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,180
Guys.

2833
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,660
That's quality women's, dude.

2834
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:09,660
Hello.

2835
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:12,900
Guys, I just got back from a date with a milf, dude.

2836
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:13,900
Nice.

2837
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:14,900
Oh, my fucking...

2838
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:19,620
I'm in a Cougar Life account because I've always been in older women because they're

2839
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,740
much more mature and fucking stable.

2840
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,740
Like yourself.

2841
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:24,740
Most women my age.

2842
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,740
Most women our age.

2843
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,740
Ben St. listen to this shit.

2844
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,740
She was amazing.

2845
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:28,740
She was amazing.

2846
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:29,740
She was amazing, dude.

2847
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:30,740
She was 50.

2848
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:31,740
She was 50.

2849
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,240
She was a career woman.

2850
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:34,240
She's a lawyer.

2851
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,880
She writes grants.

2852
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:37,880
She's amazing.

2853
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,880
She's fucking amazing.

2854
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:39,880
She's beautiful.

2855
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,520
And I just went on a fucking date with her and I thought Cougar Life was a scam, dude.

2856
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,840
Every fucking account was like fake accounts and then all of a sudden she was like two

2857
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,000
and a half hours away.

2858
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,480
She drove like two hours here because apparently she commutes all the time, dude.

2859
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,480
She's fucking amazing.

2860
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:54,480
She's amazing.

2861
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:58,240
And we're going to fucking bang, dude, on the second or third date, I think we're going

2862
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,240
to bang.

2863
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:03,320
She was going to get a hotel down here and she was going to stay there because she was

2864
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,160
going to go to the beach the next morning.

2865
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,320
But oh my God, she's so fucking sexy.

2866
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,320
Change your batteries.

2867
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,320
Change your smoke detector.

2868
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,760
She has a shit ton of money.

2869
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:11,040
She travels everywhere.

2870
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,040
She's so mature.

2871
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:13,040
Ben St., man.

2872
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,520
I'm telling you, you're a broke ass nigga.

2873
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,880
You've got to find yourself a fucking milf, man.

2874
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,880
They're amazing.

2875
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,880
They're fucking amazing.

2876
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,360
They could be your sugar mamas, man.

2877
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,360
My God.

2878
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:23,360
She's amazing.

2879
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,760
I'm going to keep you guys updated if I bang her.

2880
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:26,760
Thanks.

2881
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,760
I'll call back.

2882
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:28,760
Yeah, dude.

2883
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:29,760
I'm drunk out of my fucking mind right now.

2884
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,760
Dude, call in while banging.

2885
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,760
It was a surreal night.

2886
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:32,760
Yeah, good idea.

2887
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,760
I can't believe she was even real.

2888
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,760
And we fucking met up.

2889
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,760
Holy shit.

2890
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:36,760
Is this real?

2891
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:37,760
What do we think, guys?

2892
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:38,760
Is this real or what?

2893
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:39,760
I think that...

2894
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:40,760
The story doesn't sound too unbelievable.

2895
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,760
100% real.

2896
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:48,320
I think he met someone who was 50.

2897
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,600
That seems within the realm of possibility.

2898
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,600
But like everything...

2899
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:53,600
Well, I mean...

2900
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,680
I mean, he was drunk at the time.

2901
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,000
Is this a glowing...

2902
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,120
Or should we necessarily take all this as like a possible, like we should follow this

2903
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,120
life advice?

2904
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:04,040
I mean, probably not.

2905
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,040
I'm sure it's...

2906
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,840
I've never dated a cougar who was 50 or even close.

2907
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,840
And they're on cougarlife.com.

2908
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:11,640
So, I mean, it's one way to go.

2909
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:15,760
Ben, I mean, I know that you're a mill flover and that's your license plate number.

2910
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,760
Are you going to follow this?

2911
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:17,760
Yeah.

2912
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:18,760
That's right.

2913
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:21,760
Yeah, you know what?

2914
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:22,760
You're...

2915
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:23,760
Yeah.

2916
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,760
This is actually...

2917
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,760
You got me.

2918
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,640
I'm on cougarlife right now, signing up for an account.

2919
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,720
It's the right thing to do.

2920
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,640
Me and quality women, we're going to converse.

2921
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:35,640
We're going to...

2922
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,640
Well, we'll trade notes.

2923
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,640
All right?

2924
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:38,640
DM me.

2925
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,640
Sounds good.

2926
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:40,640
Excellent.

2927
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:41,640
Good luck.

2928
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,680
Man, guys, quality women has really just grown out of a shell, you know?

2929
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:44,680
He's gone from being stereotypical.

2930
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:45,680
You know what?

2931
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:46,680
He's been stereotypical.

2932
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:47,680
He was so...

2933
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:50,680
He was so conflicted and now he's found peace.

2934
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,680
Yeah.

2935
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:52,680
Yeah.

2936
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,680
He's been stereotypical like, oh, my girlfriend's so fucking crazy.

2937
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:54,680
What a bitch.

2938
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:59,680
He's just, you know, banging milks a day and day on cougarlife with their hands full.

2939
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:00,680
What a...

2940
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,680
What an arc.

2941
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:03,080
What an arc we've been privy to.

2942
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,080
Just...

2943
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,080
I mean, imagine.

2944
01:57:05,080 --> 01:57:08,680
Just imagine you meet someone online and then the entire time you're talking and you're

2945
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:11,440
just thinking, oh, women, we have sex, women, we only have sex.

2946
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,320
That's the mark of a real genius.

2947
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,680
Isn't that how every online interaction goes?

2948
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,680
I thought that was just normal.

2949
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:18,680
Most of them.

2950
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,680
Most of them.

2951
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,680
Okay, let's move on.

2952
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:21,680
We've got a short...

2953
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,680
Great job.

2954
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,680
Well, actually...

2955
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,320
Before we move on, I just want to say that I was looking at...

2956
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:30,560
I was just checking the comments of the deletion lecture and then I started to absentmindedly

2957
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,560
just scrolling through the PCP.

2958
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,560
And I just...

2959
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,920
Just a small little point here on Chewbacca's Osamonga Dio.

2960
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:41,360
It says that the location where you filmed it in is the Gardens of Vatican City.

2961
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:43,520
You can click here and it will be above the title.

2962
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,040
We were recording the Chewbacca's in the Gardens of Vatican City, according to...

2963
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,040
That's a lot.

2964
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:49,040
Yeah, yeah.

2965
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,040
Very nice.

2966
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,040
Cool.

2967
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,040
Fantastic.

2968
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,040
Okay.

2969
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,040
Let's move on.

2970
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,040
We've got...

2971
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,040
Okay.

2972
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:57,680
Now, this is one of these things I don't normally do, but this is good enough.

2973
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:01,000
It's Anifred's application for the Teen CP.

2974
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,560
So I think Anifred is literally 13, right?

2975
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:04,560
So he's just barely...

2976
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,560
Yeah, no, he really is, yeah.

2977
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:06,560
Okay.

2978
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,560
All right.

2979
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,560
Let's set him up.

2980
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,080
We have no involvement as the PCP, but Teen CP, listen up.

2981
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,080
Let's see if he's got what you need.

2982
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:12,080
Oh, he's an Anifred.

2983
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,560
It's about time we've got some English blood on the Teen CP.

2984
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:15,560
Chewboy, Anifred.

2985
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,560
Let's go.

2986
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,560
It's Chewboy, Anifred.

2987
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:20,560
We've had a gun and I'll shoot you dead in your dungeon with dead mom.

2988
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,560
It was red.

2989
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,960
If we steal your dad, because I'm a hardcore lad, I'll make you a fucking chad.

2990
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:25,960
Talk about pride.

2991
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:26,960
What are you proud for?

2992
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,960
You've got an anime vid in a lanky hall, kick down the door, so I'm calling.

2993
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:31,600
If you're a woman, then don't join.

2994
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,600
You can chew on my pork loin.

2995
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,600
Now watch for your zoom.

2996
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,600
Crack that soul, Anifred.

2997
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:35,600
Boy, I get it all.

2998
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:39,080
I'm ready for a brawl at your Teen CP.

2999
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,080
You know what to call.

3000
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,080
Don't stall.

3001
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,080
Yeah.

3002
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,080
Yay.

3003
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:44,080
Anifred, you know.

3004
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,080
Another masterpiece.

3005
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:49,840
Anifred keeps knocking out of the part with his regimen.

3006
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:54,320
He just keeps delivering the hits.

3007
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:55,640
Someone put together an album.

3008
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,640
Set that to a beat.

3009
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,640
Yeah, help that boy out.

3010
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,640
Yeah, please.

3011
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,640
Do a remix.

3012
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,640
Okay, great.

3013
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:01,800
Let's move on.

3014
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,920
Who Wants to Be a PCP Millionaire?

3015
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,920
Here we go.

3016
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,120
Another episode of everyone's favorite show.

3017
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:08,720
Let's see how it goes this week.

3018
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:09,720
Here we go.

3019
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:10,720
Here we go again.

3020
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,720
And go.

3021
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:15,720
Welcome back to Who Wants to Be a PCP Millionaire?

3022
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:17,960
Oh, so you're truly my man.

3023
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:24,040
Last week left, Johnny, you pulled the PCP to see what they wanted from the voicemails.

3024
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,040
How you got your answer yet?

3025
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,040
Oh, yeah.

3026
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:27,040
You bet you did, man.

3027
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,040
I want to see the last voicemail.

3028
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,040
Just got to give a last voicemail.

3029
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:37,040
And I got to tell you, this answer is all kinds of right, like a fine woman.

3030
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,040
Okay, Johnny.

3031
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:39,040
Right.

3032
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:43,440
The question is, what do the PCP want from the voicemails?

3033
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:49,040
Is it, A, violent relationships, B, piano solos, C, interrogation, or D, ramblin'?

3034
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:52,040
I'm going to go C, interrogation, violent answer.

3035
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:53,040
Correct.

3036
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,040
Next question.

3037
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,040
Yeah, there you go.

3038
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:59,920
What did Munchy request the real-ass Batman sing on the PCP?

3039
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:07,960
Is it, A, the PCP theme song, B, one-two oatmeal, C, you guys suck your cocks, or D, the alphabet

3040
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:08,960
song?

3041
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,960
Oh baby.

3042
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,960
I'm going to pay more attention than the voicemails.

3043
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:20,960
I'm going to go with one, two, oatmeal, fight B, violent answer.

3044
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,960
It's like, well, Johnny, you are...

3045
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:26,960
Correct.

3046
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,960
Yeah.

3047
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,080
You know, real-ass Batman, I didn't know you could sing.

3048
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:35,960
I can't, but Munchy, Munchy take, requested that I try.

3049
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:40,960
Speaking of which, Nate, you would be so kind, please play the voicemail.

3050
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,960
Next one.

3051
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:42,960
Okay, ready, go.

3052
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:43,960
Here we are.

3053
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,960
One, two, three, go.

3054
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:46,960
Perfect.

3055
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:52,960
One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.

3056
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,960
One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.

3057
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,960
Is this the real song?

3058
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:00,960
Yep.

3059
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,960
One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.

3060
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:09,960
One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.

3061
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:13,960
Kirby inhales his enemies and makes it later.

3062
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:18,960
Kirby's so happy there's something he can because he's such a pink guy.

3063
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:22,960
He inhales his enemies and makes it later.

3064
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,960
Kirby's so happy there's something he can because he's such a pink guy.

3065
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:32,960
One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.

3066
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:38,960
One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.

3067
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,960
One, two, oatmeal, Kirby is a pink guy.

3068
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:49,960
One, two, oatmeal, because Kirby's very cute.

3069
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:57,960
Here comes Kirby tonight to make it to protect because he's attacked by King Dedede.

3070
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,960
Man, I swings his sword, King Dedede.

3071
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:07,960
Here comes Kirby tonight to protect King Dedede.

3072
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:10,960
Who protect King Dedede?

3073
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:11,960
Man, I swings his sword.

3074
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,960
How is this so fucking long?

3075
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:15,960
Oh my God.

3076
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,960
Oh my God.

3077
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,960
Oh, he hit the time limit.

3078
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:21,960
He hit the time limit.

3079
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:22,960
It ended.

3080
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:23,960
Finally.

3081
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:24,960
What a triumph is now.

3082
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,960
Literally what a triumph is that.

3083
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:27,960
Wow.

3084
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:28,960
A great one.

3085
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:29,960
A great one.

3086
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:30,960
I'll tell you that.

3087
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,960
Yeah.

3088
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:32,960
What a triumph is that?

3089
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:33,960
A great one.

3090
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:34,960
Thank you.

3091
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,960
Everyone look at one, two, oatmeal.

3092
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,960
Someone speed up, set that to the song.

3093
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,960
I actually don't because you just listened to it just now.

3094
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:42,960
That's all you need to know.

3095
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,960
Yeah, that's how it sounds.

3096
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,960
Okay, let's move on.

3097
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,960
This is our last voicemail.

3098
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:53,960
First, we've got Lost Tape Archive 5A.

3099
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:54,960
Davoo?

3100
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:56,960
Question mark?

3101
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,960
Let's hear what we have.

3102
02:02:58,960 --> 02:02:59,960
Go.

3103
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:03,960
I've been sitting on the shore for nearly two months.

3104
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:05,960
Searching for answers.

3105
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,960
Searching the ooze.

3106
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,960
This smooths.

3107
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,960
And for what?

3108
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,960
I haven't found any tape.

3109
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,960
All I got was this circular disc.

3110
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,960
A CD, if you will.

3111
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,960
What am I supposed to do with this?

3112
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,960
I can't play a CD.

3113
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,960
I don't have a Walkman.

3114
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,960
But that's when it occurred to me.

3115
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,960
This isn't just any old goo.

3116
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:34,960
It's the goo.

3117
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:35,960
Davoo.

3118
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:37,960
I choose you.

3119
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,960
I am the goo.

3120
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:53,960
I will play this CD for you.

3121
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,960
Holy shit, that worked.

3122
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:57,960
Okay, part two. Here we go. Go.

3123
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:06,960
It's Davoo. He's back.

3124
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:09,960
I like to pretend that my girlfriend is a retard.

3125
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:13,960
Because it makes me hang out with her whenever work permits.

3126
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,960
I make out with her when she's taking a shit.

3127
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:17,960
Oh no.

3128
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:19,960
But my girlfriend is a child.

3129
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:21,960
Makes my dad go wild.

3130
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,960
They would leave you for me if they could.

3131
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:25,960
To take a pic under my hood.

3132
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:27,960
When I save peanut butter sandwich.

3133
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,960
Do I put the image on the P?

3134
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:30,960
Or on the E?

3135
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,960
I sure hurt nobody notices.

3136
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,960
But my insight into editing is beginning to tear baby shit.

3137
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:37,960
I'm not as smart as you think I am.

3138
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:38,960
My dick has two legs.

3139
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,960
Two arms to clamp on your clam.

3140
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,960
And stab my C-man on your womb.

3141
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:44,960
Bixby, a bixby, a bixby.

3142
02:04:47,960 --> 02:04:49,960
Oh god.

3143
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:57,960
Oh my god.

3144
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:01,960
This is horrific.

3145
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:06,960
Ben?

3146
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:07,960
Munchy.

3147
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,960
Executive decision?

3148
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:11,960
Yeah.

3149
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:14,960
Ban anyone from entering the Slime Sea with a CD.

3150
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,960
Ban them.

3151
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,960
Just outright ban them from ever doing it again.

3152
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:18,960
They were a mistake.

3153
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:20,960
We'll kill them on site.

3154
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,960
If you're seen on the fair with a CD,

3155
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,960
you will have to answer to us.

3156
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,960
I've seen a lot of people playing a lot of Smash Bros. brawl

3157
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,960
farming CDs in the subspace emissary.

3158
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,960
And they're just piling up.

3159
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:33,960
I think that was a war crime.

3160
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,960
I've never heard such a savage takedown

3161
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:39,960
of a poor sweet boy.

3162
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,960
Poor Davoo.

3163
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:44,960
Well, Davoo, even though he left the chat,

3164
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:46,960
he's still with us in spirit.

3165
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,960
God, I hope not.

3166
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,960
I don't want him to hear these things.

3167
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,960
Yeah, he should rest in peace.

3168
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,960
Oh my god.

3169
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:58,960
Well, Lost Tape Archive does his work again.

3170
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:00,960
Thanks for unearthing that, Relic.

3171
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:01,960
Classic.

3172
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:04,960
Who has Lost Tape Archive done yet?

3173
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,960
He's done a lot of us.

3174
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,960
I think like half or most of us at this point,

3175
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,960
not all of us yet,

3176
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:13,960
someone should put that information together.

3177
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:15,960
It should be like a playlist of some kind.

3178
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:17,960
Because these are incredible.

3179
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:20,960
Yeah, the audio editing is off the charts.

3180
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,960
That beat was pretty fire.

3181
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,960
That was pretty fire, I must say.

3182
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:27,960
If Lost Tape Archive isn't already in the voice grail,

3183
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,960
I think he deserves to be there.

3184
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,960
Just for the sheer effort he's putting in there.

3185
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:34,960
He deserves to be there for his past crimes.

3186
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,960
So this crime, he's putting straight into voice jail.

3187
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:38,960
What do you think?

3188
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,960
Can he exist in a superposition of jail and...

3189
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,960
Voice Azkaban.

3190
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,960
Yeah, I think he exists in both simultaneously.

3191
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:49,960
Torn between two worlds.

3192
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:50,960
Voice Limbo.

3193
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,960
Okay, so it shall be.

3194
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,960
He exists in both simultaneously,

3195
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,960
like Schrodinger's Cat or whatever the deal is.

3196
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:58,960
There you go.

3197
02:06:58,960 --> 02:06:59,960
Schrodinger's Cat Clues.

3198
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,960
Click on the link in the description to watch Gay for a Day.

3199
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,960
On our bandcamp, it's in high quality.

3200
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,960
High quality rips way better than the live version.

3201
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,960
The highest of quality.

3202
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,960
It could not have been more high quality.

3203
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,960
Let me just say about Gay for a Day.

3204
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,960
By the way, that had seven tracks, right?

3205
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:15,960
I didn't miss it.

3206
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:18,960
Seven tracks, and I believe four bonus tracks

3207
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:20,960
that you get if you download it.

3208
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
They're not connected to the story.

3209
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,960
They are their own standalone songs.

3210
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,960
Oh, okay, I didn't listen to those.

3211
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:28,960
By the way, I listened to Gay for a Day,

3212
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,960
and I just want to say I loved it.

3213
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:32,960
There were only a couple of times I skipped ahead.

3214
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:34,960
I just, as someone who's on the record,

3215
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,960
pushing hard for Gay for a Day to be real,

3216
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:38,960
I'm glad that you finally delivered.

3217
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,960
I'm glad that my faith in the project's completion

3218
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,960
was not in vain.

3219
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:44,960
Indeed.

3220
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:46,960
Tom was the carrot, and I was the stick

3221
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,960
lashing from behind, or the opposite of that.

3222
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,960
I don't know, whatever it is.

3223
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,960
It exists. Go listen to it.

3224
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,960
It is a jolly good time.

3225
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,960
I had a great time listening to it.

3226
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,960
And now,

3227
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:00,960
if you come in

3228
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,960
and give your covers a Gay for a Day song,

3229
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:04,960
we will, of course, play on the voicemails

3230
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:06,960
every single time.

3231
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,960
Every single time.

3232
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,960
Let's put a quality floor on that real quick

3233
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:12,960
before we...

3234
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,960
Munchie and Gibbs said that someone in their band

3235
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,960
said that they wanted to do a cover of the album.

3236
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,960
God, I hope you stick to it, you coward,

3237
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:20,960
and actually deliver that.

3238
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:22,960
I want to hear it.

3239
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:24,960
Heavy metal covers.

3240
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:26,960
It could use a little bit.

3241
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,960
I'll, for keeping the quality of the original,

3242
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,960
you know, I hate remakes,

3243
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,960
but a reimagining is something else

3244
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,960
that I could get behind, you know.

3245
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3246
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,960
Like on the link in the description

3247
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,960
to listen to Grimp, too,

3248
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,960
should we discuss politics.

3249
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,960
And speaking of not

3250
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:46,960
discussing politics, Nate,

3251
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,960
I don't want to talk about this right now,

3252
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:50,960
but I think you should watch...

3253
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,960
You ever watch ContraPoints?

3254
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:54,960
I've seen ContraPoints a few times, yeah.

3255
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:56,960
ContraPoints' newest video is called

3256
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:58,960
TransTrenders,

3257
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:00,960
and I would recommend you give it a watch

3258
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:02,960
for some things...

3259
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:04,960
Based on our previous discussion in this very episode.

3260
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:06,960
Yes, for some...

3261
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,960
things to mull over and chew on.

3262
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,960
Look, my only point will be

3263
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,960
that I've got no problem, trans people exist.

3264
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,960
They seem perfectly real to me, got no issue.

3265
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,960
Shut up, I don't care.

3266
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:18,960
But Chris Chan is a different case.

3267
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,960
He's not, but anyway.

3268
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,960
She's not, fuck!

3269
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,960
No! It's spreading.

3270
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,960
Alright, anyway.

3271
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,960
Watch TransTrenders, it's good.

3272
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:30,960
I'll consider it.

3273
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,960
Hey guys, Nate from The Future here.

3274
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,960
Listen, I would never do anything like

3275
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,960
misgender someone to their face

3276
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:38,960
when they so clearly want to be addressed

3277
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:40,960
in a certain way. That's not my bag.

3278
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,960
And of course, this extends to Chris as well.

3279
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,960
But this is a comedy discussion

3280
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,960
podcast, and we're just

3281
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,960
here to discuss ideas,

3282
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,960
and I don't think gender or anything else

3283
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,960
is a sacred cow.

3284
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,960
I don't think it's crazy to have certain

3285
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,960
thoughts that some people may be more

3286
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,960
or less sincere. We know that

3287
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,960
TransTrenders exist to some degree.

3288
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,960
Some degree.

3289
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:04,960
And to maybe think about some people that

3290
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,960
perhaps they could be in that category,

3291
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,960
I don't think is unreasonable.

3292
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,960
And I think most people would agree with that point.

3293
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:12,960
But I'm never going to be rude to someone in real life

3294
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,960
when they want to be referred to in a certain way.

3295
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,960
So I just wanted to make that perfectly clear.

3296
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,960
Okay, I think we're all on the same page.

3297
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,960
After finishing this conversation,

3298
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:22,960
I actually did go and watch

3299
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,960
part of that ContraPoints video.

3300
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,960
Her videos are not my favorite stylistically,

3301
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:28,960
but I do think I got the general

3302
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,960
thesis out of it that she was trying to convey,

3303
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,960
which seemed to be an argument of,

3304
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,960
as opposed to arguing about who's male,

3305
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,960
who's female, you know, whatever position on the spectrum, whatever,

3306
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:38,960
instead, why not put empathy

3307
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,960
and compassion for how people

3308
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,960
may feel or identify over

3309
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,960
any kind of logical proof or categorization

3310
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,960
as to gender? Because is it even that

3311
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,960
important? To which I say

3312
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,960
that's not a crazy argument

3313
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,960
and I can see where people are coming from

3314
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,960
to make those kind of points. So does Chris's

3315
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,960
gender really matter? Is it my

3316
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,960
business to even judge? No,

3317
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,960
not really. My only rebuttal to that would be

3318
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,960
that, firstly, I do think that gender

3319
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:04,960
has some real use in the real world,

3320
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:06,960
so I don't think it's useful to just throw it

3321
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,960
out as a total concept right now.

3322
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:10,960
But also, there's guys like me

3323
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,960
and I think a lot of people in a similar position

3324
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,960
who are just very

3325
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,960
hearingly minded, I guess I'd say,

3326
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,960
where we try to categorize things

3327
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,960
and put them into boxes and whatnot, and I would

3328
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,960
just ask people to have patience

3329
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:24,960
with those of us who don't necessarily put

3330
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,960
empathy as our prime, overarching,

3331
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,960
most important ideal,

3332
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,960
but naturally do think in this kind of

3333
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:32,960
organizing way. I don't think it's

3334
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,960
evil or bad, it's just a different

3335
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:36,960
way of approaching the world. Because I think

3336
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,960
we all know it is not my prime

3337
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:40,960
virtue. I'm more of a problem

3338
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,960
solver. Anyway, thanks for listening,

3339
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,960
and I'll talk to you later.

3340
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:14,960
We can use to determine who is or is not

3341
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,960
really trans, who does or does not

3342
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,960
meet the criteria to be

3343
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,960
referred to as the gender of their choosing.

3344
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:22,960
Gender is not as

3345
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:24,960
simple as a question of XX

3346
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,960
versus XY, this kind of scientific

3347
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:28,960
interrogation will not yield

3348
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:30,960
us a robust definition

3349
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:32,960
of what is male and what is female.

3350
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:34,960
Therefore, there is no objective

3351
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,960
metric that we can use to determine

3352
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,960
who does and does not

3353
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,960
get to decide their own gender identity.

3354
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,960
We must accept that everybody gets to

3355
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:44,960
do that. It's the only logically

3356
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,960
consistent position. And accepting

3357
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,960
some people's ability to do that while denying

3358
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,960
others or doing it sometimes

3359
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,960
only in public and only not

3360
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,960
in private or whatever solves no

3361
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:56,960
problems and accomplishes nothing.

3362
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,960
So in the case where someone

3363
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:00,960
has made it abundantly clear what

3364
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:02,960
their preferred gender is as

3365
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,960
Christine has, I think the only thing

3366
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:06,960
to do is to accept what

3367
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,960
they wish to be referred to.

3368
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:10,960
And I'm committed to doing that for Christine

3369
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,960
and I'm committed to doing that for

3370
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,960
everyone. For a question

3371
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,960
that has no rigorous logical answer

3372
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,960
I think that empathy is the only

3373
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,960
thing that we can fall back on

3374
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,960
to answer it. Thank you and

3375
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,960
get fucked.

3376
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:26,960
Oh hey by the way, right now

3377
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,960
after this episode I'm going to be speaking to music

3378
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,960
I'm going to be recording a live concert

3379
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:32,960
in Uzgarans. It will have been a week ago

3380
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,960
by the time you hear it. But just go back

3381
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,960
and I think there will probably be a stream on RFCK

3382
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,960
literally a

3383
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,960
real live concert with all the

3384
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:42,960
RFCK musicians playing in a voice call

3385
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,960
in RFCK an in-game concert

3386
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,960
it will have happened. Good job. Fantastic

3387
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:48,960
how exciting.

3388
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,960
Is that right after this? Yes. We're recording

3389
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,960
okay I'll hop over. Sick.

3390
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:54,960
Alright I guess we're done then.

Yeah no. Oh my god you're right

3399
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,960
I forgot about that.

3400
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,960
Oh how exciting we got out we got out

3401
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,960
that boy. Can you believe they didn't give us a fucking panel

3402
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,960
can you believe that? You know what I very much

3403
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,960
can believe that because we are not

3404
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,960
brony people at all we have no credentials

3405
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:24,960
been out for years

3406
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,960
I very much can believe it.

3407
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,960
I can't believe this. I'm just going to flex my privilege

3408
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,960
here because I'm friends with Saber Sparky got me on

3409
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,960
a panel on a free badge so

3410
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,960
Saber Sparky is also not a pony

3411
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,960
man nor has he been for years so what's

3412
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,960
his credentials? Yeah exactly

3413
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:40,960
Nate do you understand there's given that

3414
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:42,960
to anyone who asks. I mean

3415
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,960
everybody in that clique does have a panel

3416
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:46,960
despite not being mostly pony people

3417
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,960
at all anymore.

3418
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,960
Damn. I mean they were like

3419
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:52,960
much bigger than we were at the time

3420
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,960
Saber Spark is big

3421
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:56,960
Saber Spark is the

3422
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:58,960
Saber Spark is the worst

3423
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,960
He has 800,000 subs

3424
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,960
Saber Spark is the worst lowest common denominator

3425
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:04,960
content most toxic shit

3426
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,960
I've ever seen on YouTube. Saber Spark?

3427
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:08,960
Yeah his videos are the worst

3428
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,960
I mean I never really watched the live but

3429
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,960
I hate them. He just rips on shitty fucking

3430
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,960
animated videos

3431
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,960
They're very milk toast

3432
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,960
like unique nemesaurus

3433
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:20,960
tier. Well I think they're worse

3434
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:22,960
than that. They're normie content

3435
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,960
but they're not bad normie content

3436
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,960
I think they are bad normie content

3437
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:28,960
The voice over is

3438
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,960
hilarious

3439
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:32,960
There you go there's some feedback for you

3440
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:34,960
Don't tell him I said that though

3441
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,960
You can tell him yourself when you see him in

3442
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,960
BronyCon. It's a secret

3443
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,960
I can't wait for the

3444
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:42,960
brony brawl while everybody kills each other

3445
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:44,960
Oh won't that be fun. That's the last day

3446
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:46,960
that's Sunday night. It all ends

3447
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,960
Because there's no bronycon anymore

3448
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:50,960
we have to die. What's the point

3449
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:52,960
of even being alive?

3450
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:54,960
You're right. You're right

3451
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,960

3459
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,960
I'm doing nothing

3460
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:30,960
My dick I'm jerking

3461
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,960
Myself I'm sucking

3462
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,960
I am an asshole

3463
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,960
I am a stupid

3464
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,960
I've got a deadline

3465
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:40,960
Don't want to do it
