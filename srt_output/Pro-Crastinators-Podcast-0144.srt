00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm the best guy ever and today we've got Hippocrit, are you?

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
We've got Ben Saint.

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,040
We've got Lethal Aurora Mage.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:53,640
I regret to inform you all that I am once again addicted to Animal Crossing New Leaf.

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,120
You swore you'd never do it again.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
I needed my fix.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
And we've got Endless Jess.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
Endless Jess.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Hey, it's Franklin.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Come into your house.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Hey, it's Franklin.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Come into play.

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:23,720
You ever see that level one mafia grunt as Caillou and the level 100 mafia boss as one punchman?

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,040
Was the middle one Charlie Brown?

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I guess that would work.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Caillou's so fucking retarded.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Anyway, hey everybody.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
Welcome to another episode.

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Yeah, fuck that guy.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,460
Today we're talking about Fuck Caillou.

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,040
It was the worst child show I ever watched.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,800
I never watched Caillou.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I don't think.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I guess it was for like actual infants.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Yes.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Well, yeah.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
It was for actual babies.

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Well, the plot lines were frankly patronizing.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,680
I know I have to wipe my butt after I take a shit.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,880
I didn't need to be a lower yourself to my level.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm glad you brought up that topic.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
This is the topic that I want to touch on.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm sick of wiping.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm done with it.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,160
I hate it.

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
I hate shitting.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I hate wiping.

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,640
It's a fucking nightmare every time.

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,480
You know, I have somewhat evolved my handling of that situation.

44
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm doing a lot of washing after wiping these days.

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
I've just upgraded and I think it's better.

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,000
There is no after wiping for me.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,120
Something about like I've got the poopiest shits and the slimyist craps.

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm just never done wiping.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
The wiping never stops.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
It's a curse.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,060
I can't get off the toilet for hours.

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,200
It's like they say, it's like they say, wiping is never, oh fuck, a wipe is never completed.

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Only abandoned.

54
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Right.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
But it's abandoned and then shown and that's what matters to people.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Cut all of this.

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
That's the biggest difference.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Take this out.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,640
Hey, speaking of, let's talk about, let's talk about cartoons featuring bald people.

60
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Like Steven, after he, Rebecca snatched his wig off in that finale, is that what you're

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
talking about?

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,400
After Rebecca Sugar made him come out as a skinhead, like she meant to all along, and

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
become sands.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Yeah, I was going to say come out as sands, have you seen the video?

65
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
I've seen the image.

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I've seen the image.

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
Yeah, I was going to say.

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Okay, okay.

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,720
You guys ever see a cartoon called Fillmore, exclamation point?

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Yeah.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
No.

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay.

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
No question.

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Okay.

75
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm googling it.

76
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
I think I saw it like once.

77
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,320
Like one time on some channel, I was, I watched this cartoon called Fillmore and it is about

78
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
a kid.

79
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,840
It's about, it's like a high school, it's a high school cartoon, but it's like, it's

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,560
like a noir, it's like framed as like a noir detective kind of story.

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,440
And I saw like one episode of it ever and I thought that was the coolest thing I've ever

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
fucking seen.

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,520
And then I never saw it again.

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,680
I was like, for the rest of my youth, I was like, when, what the fuck was that?

85
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,320
Like when will I ever see Fillmore again?

86
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,600
Like I want to see more of it.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,840
Are they even allowed to put black people on TV?

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,440
This is weird, man.

89
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Watch out.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Yeah.

91
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
That's you, Ben.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Wainhead.

93
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,840
I didn't say anything about him being black because it totally doesn't matter.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,840
And he doesn't, it's like, you know, I think I was watching some, I watched it.

95
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,160
What are you denying his racial identity now, Ben?

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,960
You're in a hot water, son.

97
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,840
I saw some YouTube video.

98
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,760
It was, it was called like, I think it was called how to black.

99
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Oh, I saw that.

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah.

101
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,480
It was recommended to me and it was a guy talking about like how to write black characters.

102
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,240
And this, you know, the guy making the video was black himself.

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,400
And he said, like, you know, in his opinion, like you don't have to, you know, it's tough

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,880
because like, I think some, some of those, some certain like white, guilty type people

105
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,480
would say like, you know, you got, you can't just, you can't just write black characters.

106
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,000
You don't know the black experience, but like, you don't have to.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,640
The story doesn't have to be about them being black.

108
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,600
Like it's okay if it's okay sometimes, maybe even most of the time, if a character being

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,720
black or white or whatever doesn't really inform the story much, it doesn't have to

110
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,680
be with the stories about that film or like film or could have been whatever.

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,520
He's just, he just looks like Morpheus and it rules.

112
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
He does.

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
He does remind me of Morpheus.

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
You ever see Wayne Head though?

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
No.

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
No.

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Wayne Head is like, there was like in the nineties, there was this entire genre of cartoons

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,280
that were like, like made by black people specifically for black children.

119
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,200
Like they were like these really ghetto, like urban, like all the characters looked like

120
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
really racist.

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Like Fat Albert?

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Like if a white person had drawn the cartoon, it would be considered racist as hell, but

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
because they were made by, they were all made by the Wayne's brothers or something, like

124
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
every different Wayne's brother had their own shitty cartoon series with like these really...

125
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
How many, how many Wayne's brothers are there?

126
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I don't know, like fifty?

127
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Three?

128
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Hundreds.

129
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Okay.

130
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
But Wayne Head was like this, like urban, just like weird.

131
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
They're breeding.

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,640
The whole show was about this kid with a club foot.

133
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
God, this character design.

134
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
That's the point.

135
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
This giant foot.

136
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,440
And that was like, he was like, oh, yeah, yeah, he had like a, he had like, he called it his

137
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
big shoe.

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
Um, I remember that one.

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,560
I don't remember what it was called, but yeah, he had like a foot brace because there was

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
something up with his leg.

141
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Yeah.

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,040
And the theme song was like, Wayne Head, Wayne Head, the party's just begun.

143
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,880
And like the theme song actually has a part in it that went, hey, ho, hey.

144
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
Like, like...

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Alright.

146
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay.

147
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Alright.

148
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
So this is the realism of the head and foot exclusively.

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
It's pretty freakish.

150
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,360
You ever notice how black people make art that's like really racist against black people

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,120
and don't seem to notice that they're, that they're being racist against themselves?

152
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,640
Well, but that's not racist then.

153
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Yeah.

154
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,760
Well, for them, it's just like, it's like, you know, isn't it funny how people do this?

155
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
You know?

156
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,160
Which like, you know, everyone does that.

157
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
But you know, if you're white...

158
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I'll just, I'll just...

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Listen, listen, if you're white and you're watching a cartoon by a black person that's

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,200
about like black kids living in...

161
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,700
It's already racist right there.

162
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
No, shit.

163
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,720
They're like living in the, living in the streets or whatever, not like homeless, but you know

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
what I mean.

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,200
You might, you look at that and be like, huh, wow, this is, this is, this is weird in what

166
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
it says about black people.

167
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,680
But like, you know, this is like, there's, you know, they're just writing about people

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,000
they know, writing about their, their life experience.

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't know if it makes me racist.

170
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,760
I hope it doesn't, but I hated all of these black people cartoons.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
Like they're just...

172
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,740
They were all like the proud family.

173
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,440
The proud family is a fucking disgrace.

174
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
I did not enjoy that show.

175
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
No, I did not.

176
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,240
The worst thing ever happened to the sequel was pretty decent.

177
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,880
You know, I wasn't, I wasn't particularly into the proud family either.

178
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,880
The whole, like the, like the whole proud family is like, there's like the dad and like the

179
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,360
grandma is like super abusive to the dad.

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,600
And it's played for the last cause she's like, you know, she's sugar mama.

181
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,740
She's like, it's, it's cool.

182
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,980
She's like a sassy black lady, but she's just like an abusive monster who like has

183
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,380
ruined the dad, his entire life by treating him like garbage and continues to treat him

184
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,700
like garbage and emasculate him daily, even as a man in charge of his own family.

185
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
She's the breadwinner.

186
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
She's the, the guy.

187
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,620
I hate, I hate sugar mama.

188
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,260
I want her to fucking die.

189
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,820
I want her to just, I want it.

190
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,540
I want, I always want an episode where she succumbed to dementia and ended up in a hospice

191
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,220
and died slowly.

192
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,260
And all of her family was around her and the last person in the room with her as she was

193
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,460
dying was Oscar.

194
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,420
I think his name was, was, was the son.

195
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,340
And he's just like Oscar Langley.

196
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,020
And like just as she's about to die, he's like, I don't forgive you.

197
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,460
And she just, she flat lines and that's it.

198
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Yeah.

199
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,940
Well, I mean, I think I would have enjoyed that as well.

200
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,540
He did get abused, but I think they were trying to paint him.

201
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,460
I mean, as they always do, like he was a fuck up, like everyone around was trying to help

202
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,540
him and he just couldn't take their good advice and just was a fool through and through.

203
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,620
Was the proud family dad a fuck up?

204
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Yeah.

205
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,740
He was like, he remember he was an inventor, but like he didn't make any money to support

206
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
the family.

207
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
What?

208
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
He was all the, the mom who was like a newscaster.

209
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Wait, he's an inventor?

210
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
No.

211
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Stu Pickles is an inventor.

212
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Was he like a tinkerer?

213
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Yeah.

214
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Stu Pickles is the inventor.

215
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
I was thinking like, is he, is he like Stu Pickles again?

216
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay.

217
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I might have been confusing that.

218
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
There's no way.

219
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,260
I don't, I don't remember what he was or did.

220
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Yeah.

221
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,780
I don't know these American cartoons.

222
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,420
Stu Pickles, now there was a cartoon dad.

223
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
I know that.

224
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,900
He was up, he was up at two in the morning making chocolate pudding.

225
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
That's, you're not wrong.

226
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Yeah.

227
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,500
Let's go back to criticizing Caillou and these nice white families that I feel comfortable

228
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
talking to him about.

229
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,220
The only media I saw with Caillou is like with those go anime atrocities.

230
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,220
Yeah.

231
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,700
Have you seen, have you seen Giles theme goes with anything Stu makes chocolate pudding?

232
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
Well, of course.

233
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
Of course.

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
Of course.

235
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Of course.

236
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Da da da da da da.

237
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
Stairs, stairs.

238
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
That's some time with the music.

239
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
That's good stuff.

240
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
Classics.

241
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
But hey, okay.

242
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,280
Remember that episode of Rugrats where there was literally a time machine?

243
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Is that Sprues?

244
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
Yeah.

245
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
I'm sure it was an imagination.

246
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Boo Boo Rooms.

247
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,880
No, they go to the toy store and one of the, the brand new hot toy that all the kids

248
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,060
want is a literal fucking time machine.

249
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
Okay.

250
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
That's very cool.

251
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
You know what I realized is like a-

252
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,020
Wait is it actual or did they just imagine-

253
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,620
They they they activate an evil toy gorilla that's chasing them around and the way that they defeat it is they lure it into the time machine and send it back and

254
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,800
Back in time to fucking George Washington crossing the Delaware River

255
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,740
tape

256
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,460
I liked it that much imagine. I'm glad it's not just a fever dream. No, it's real

257
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay, hang on. Are you sure that the that the the actual narrative was not that there was a

258
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,960
Playtime machine that was really fun to like pretend you were time-traveling

259
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,960
No, you literally see the gorilla materialize on the river as George Washington is crossing with his troops and they're like

260
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,720
What's that pretend? I don't think the kids were making believe

261
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,680
One-year-old kids making believe about George Washington in the Revolutionary War

262
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,120
Does it like happen where like a painting changes and not like there's a gorilla in the in the

263
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
One of the founding fathers gorilla

264
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,480
No twilight zone ending twilight zone ending they get the toy they go to the cash register and stew's like here

265
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,840
You go keep the change hands him a one dollar bill and it's

266
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,200
That would have been they should have gone for it. We should have committed to the bed

267
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,060
Everybody welcome to the cartoon podcast where the reason cartoons are dying. Yeah, that's true

268
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,340
Speaking of dying cartoons

269
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Like I could have sort was a fever dream for like I don't know like ten years of my life or something

270
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,140
And when I was little and I was watching pop-up girls

271
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,420
I saw this episode once and only once and I don't know why they stopped airing it

272
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,140
But like it was something about like but a cup of bullying some kid that kept eating glue

273
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,900
I think and then he turned into a giant glue monster and then she had to

274
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:24,820
Yeah, well, why did she apologize? She was doing the right thing by bullying this because he was stronger than her now and he could be

275
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,260
Her up. Yes

276
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,380
He was a giant glue. So she actually yeah, you know, I think I do remember that

277
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,820
Um, I don't know that I watched a lot of power

278
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,980
But yeah, like that I only saw it once on TV and I have no clue why they never aired it again

279
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,340
Was it was it like banned like the like the gnome episode? Maybe it was encouraging kids see glue

280
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,060
Maybe people complained maybe oh man, okay

281
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,180
What we need is a be careful who you make fun of in high school meme of like nerd kid is a powerpuff girl and then giant glue monster

282
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,800
That's what she learns. That's a good lesson to prevent future school shootings. That's a big reason why well

283
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,020
We really need we need these these white boys to get laid. That's what we need

284
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:12,100
We need heroic women out there who are willing to put out to save our children. That's the number one thing that'll do it

285
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,300
Why are my words why I volunteer I volunteer to be one of those women

286
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,900
To be one of those women. That's right. Why didn't the powerpuff girls just fuck all the other kids?

287
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:33,220
Think of all yeah, they were missing the greatest superpower of all heightened sexuality an ounce of prevention is a pound of cure

288
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,580
We've all learned a lot here today. Thanks for joining us everyone on the procrastinating cartoon cast

289
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,820
Okay, Steven Universe. Let's talk about it. There was there was the new special. I think everybody here watched it

290
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,300
I have not seen the new ones, but I don't care about spoilers if you want to

291
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:01,120
A blot black cartoonist just putting their own worst stereotypes and cartoons this black character amethyst is just such a

292
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,920
disgusting

293
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,060
Hittiest freak. He's I don't know where I'm going with that. She's even doing things

294
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:16,820
These episodes anyway amethyst is growing. No, I'm like amethyst a lot. Oh, I was just I was just I it was black people

295
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,540
I was making fun of not amethyst. Oh, okay. That's fine. Yeah, that's good

296
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,360
So so there was a whatever a couple of episodes and a big special like a 45 minute finale episode

297
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,140
Season some backster did the last shot with the I knew it. I yeah, I was yes

298
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,180
Disney guy hell happened in this part it got all good, you know, okay

299
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,860
What was interesting about that? So there's a moment at the at the emotional climax of this scene a lot of crazy

300
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,120
Shits happening with a confrontation with white diamonds going down and all that stuff

301
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,940
And all of a sudden the animation goes from piece of shit flash garbage animation. It's not flash

302
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,580
unbelievably beautiful

303
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,580
like fluid Disney level Disney movie animation

304
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,900
They're

305
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,100
Proportions and sizes wouldn't change so drastically. I don't I guess that's true

306
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
I have no idea what I'm fucking talking about

307
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,020
But I do know that this got super fluid. No, I liked it a lot

308
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
but I was watching this with Michelle and

309
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,420
She actually kind of hated it because it was such a jarring transition from what Steven universe normally looks like

310
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,540
That you said like it really just threw out of it. She wasn't able to absorb the emotions of the scene

311
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,940
You know itself I really liked it

312
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:34,100
But yeah as a whole it was quite a jarring jump like I immediately saw the shift in animation

313
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,180
It was kind of weird. It took me out of the experience. Yeah, it does make you think of like

314
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:44,580
Okay, this is the part where the people making the cartoon really want to blow their load and make me feel something. Yes. Yeah

315
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:52,420
Like it I like the way James Baxter was used in adventure time because it's just he animates a horse because he's good at that

316
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,580
And it's a silly horse and you wouldn't even tell me who James Baxter is though because I don't know

317
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,020
I didn't look into him, but he's a guy who has worked for Disney's done a lot of like really good

318
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
animation for Disney and

319
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,300
recently oh

320
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,580
You know the bit in the Gravity Falls opening where Mabel is rubbing her cheek on the pig and it's really smooth

321
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,260
That's him. Yeah, the bit where

322
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,180
Scar and is like a fighting off with Simba at the end of the Lion King with it like a 360

323
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,660
Shot where he's like no scope around him. Three six. There's sixty no scope

324
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,540
Yeah, that was him dude. Yeah, and and he's like a

325
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,220
What's the the punchback of Notre Dame?

326
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,420
He's done a bunch of he does a lot of like really

327
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Impressively animated motion scenes like yeah, the reason he did the thing with the

328
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,780
The white diamond in 3d like whoo like you just drew that because you can because he's good at that

329
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,020
What if right thinking thinking about scar a 360 no scoping Simba

330
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,100
Think what if like what if like voice actors, right?

331
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:08,740
Like like Jeremy iron like for example Jeremy irons just starts a twitch channel and just starts like streaming games as

332
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,540
Scar, but he's just like do that. I think yeah

333
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,660
Like not actual voice actors, but I kept being recommended like a few years ago

334
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,500
Like by a person who kept doing Fluttershy voice and pretending to be Fluttershy and just playing games

335
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
I've seen that the the the scout voice actor for TF2 has done that. Oh, yeah, that's cool

336
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,260
It's like the evolution of like an ask blog or something instead of like drawing this character

337
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
You're just are peeing him on on twitch

338
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,940
I'm not sure if he's streamed or recorded, but I heard like the voice actor for

339
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,980
One of the overwatch characters the high noon one. Oh, what's what's it the McCree? Yeah McCree McCree

340
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,180
Yeah, he he he would troll a fellow players and would just scream high noon in voice chat

341
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,960
So we play that was like just they'd be like oh shit. He's using his ult, but no it was in fact a ruse

342
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,260
Respect to them a lot more before I knew that he also plays the game

343
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,620
Yeah, let me tell me to maybe he only plays it to troll people who knows

344
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,760
So, okay, let's talk about the the the ramifications of this this Steven universe special

345
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,620
Because the big thing I saw a lot of people talking about it and I feel this to a degree as well is like

346
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,860
What is there even left to talk about now that this is done?

347
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,620
I'll just be able this is spoilers. So if you don't want to know fair enough skip ahead or whatever

348
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,540
It's done white diamond is redeemed. She's on our team now

349
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,860
Here's the most thing what I think because I'm way behind. I'm totally behind

350
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,620
Yeah, the last thing I saw was the white diamond reveal. Yeah, okay, fair enough. I mean that looks good still

351
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,780
So cool looking the thing with like all of Steven universe is like combat is part of it

352
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,180
But Steven is like as a person is always like I don't fight

353
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,540
Don't do it like a pink diamond would fight

354
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,300
She had a war going as like rose quartz, but Steven's like

355
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,060
Never and he has a shield and it's like, okay, so this is not really about like solving problems with violence

356
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,740
um

357
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,860
And I guess I guess the thing that happens next

358
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,380
after like white diamond is redeemed kind of or definitely is uh like

359
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,540
Changing home world like I think instead of having the climax be a slug fest

360
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,060
Which would go against like the the point of Steven as a character

361
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,740
It would be the finale would be you know changing the universe for the better making home world better

362
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,540
You know doing all this stuff because all they've done really is they've they've uh

363
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,420
Like what do they do? They got the gems that were like fucked up and they healed them

364
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
And then that's it

365
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,460
The cluster yeah, they've got to do something about the cluster

366
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,060
Or like turn it into a big giant guy

367
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
um me and byter joked that like

368
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,780
Because I heard that there might be a uh six season and we were like well

369
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,180
What are they gonna do because everything's so wrapped up?

370
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,540
And so we joked that like the whole six season is just just them separating and piecing back together the cluster

371
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Every episode is basically them

372
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,740
And yes, it's minecraft it's minecraft you go in there with a little pickaxe you chunk chunk a bit off turn it into a guy

373
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,700
Keep going. Please fact check me people

374
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,020
But I believe what I heard was that we know there's a movie coming in I think September of this year

375
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,620
And I believe that there's also a sixth season. I that that's what I was

376
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah, that's the rumors I've heard, but I'm not sure if it's true

377
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,740
I don't know. I don't know if there's any like confirmation of anything other than the movie. Okay. Okay. The movie's for sure though

378
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,780
So let me just say my thoughts in general which are

379
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,580
That so I I never expected like I mean would I have liked a little more fighting? Sure never hurts

380
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,140
But I was satisfied with what we saw we finally saw I think it was was it obsidian the fusion of all of the

381
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,100
Obsidian was was it final we saw the four fused?

382
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,940
Dude, did you notice did you notice obsidian was the temple?

383
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,340
Yeah, I used the temple that was I was expecting it to be the temple because I I knew the moment stupid

384
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,060
I I heard that temple is like oh it has to be I'd heard that theorized on like way back like you remember like season one

385
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,700
Damn, I guess everyone was ahead ahead of the curve and I was the only one who was excited about that

386
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,540
I know I I liked it a lot too. I thought it was really good and I liked her coloring

387
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,300
That way though that was yeah black with lava under it and all that dude's stuff with a big old sword

388
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,180
That was it was dope. It looked really cool and I was very happy with it

389
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,060
It doesn't get to do very much, but you know that that's okay

390
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,220
And and like like we were saying the like emotional climax or the climax wasn't a big fight

391
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,300
It was literally Steven like talking to white diamond and convincing her to be a good boy

392
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,340
But but beyond that, um, I mean it was it was convincing white diamond that whatever like people are imperfect. Nobody's perfect

393
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
So you shouldn't be so

394
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,380
Strict on everyone like you have to accept people's imperfections like okay fair enough whatever

395
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,740
Yeah rarity if you just you just opened your heart a little bit you let people into your your worlds

396
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,500
We can help bear your burden. You don't have to be perfect all the time

397
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,820
Yes, and that was a good that was fine. That was fine. I have some today. I learned that i'm steven

398
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,020
Well, let's just let's before we get to that. Let's just say that so when when white diamond she she she fucking kills everybody else

399
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,100
It's only uh, steven left. She fucking pulls the diamond out of his stomach

400
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,940
She pulls it. She rips it the fuck out and he's gotten up and there's blood everywhere deeply horrific

401
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
He was freaking out on dying

402
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,620
Out after she pulled it out. It was uh, it was fucking that was that was the um, okay

403
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,220
Can I can I say that i'm kind of disappointed with corny or rather how she was uh

404
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,140
useless

405
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
I'm over conny man

406
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,900
I was I was hoping when she entered the temple and every and and all the gems were getting zapped of their color and stuff

407
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,500
And it was like oh well conny's a human she won't get that maybe she could do something

408
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,100
And no she immediately gets caught like she has like a small battle, but that does nothing and then gets caught

409
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,500
It's like well, what's the point of you being here?

410
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,460
Yeah, that was a weird build up or nothing to happen like the whole conny thing like oh, it's cool

411
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:24,660
That steven confused with her and he becomes tall then the sword looks the right size

412
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,420
And the and the shield is in his other hand and he rides line or she

413
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,100
Schlier schlay or schler rides lion

414
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,820
And it's like oh the coolest like that's the final battle mode, but conny was just there

415
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
And she didn't do that

416
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:45,220
I don't know why I kind of built her up. It's like oh she learned how to fight and and stuff. Well, what's the

417
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:53,220
Okay, okay. Let me just get into my point here. Okay, so everything about steven universe every single conflict has been predicated on

418
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,300
The fact that they're what there's okay

419
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,820
What why do people fight in the real world people fight in the real world because they want things from each other

420
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,020
And like they can't just get it given to them instantly

421
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,220
They have to take it by force and they like they can't come to a compromise or they just don't care to

422
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,340
That's why people fight in the real world at all. So okay. Why are they fighting in steven universe?

423
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,540
They're fighting because like white diamond insists that like humans are shitty. I don't care about them like they're worthless

424
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,260
Gem life is good. We're going to spread gem life and whoever gets in our way including humans

425
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,580
Like we will fuck them up including like the you know the the crystal gems who fought back

426
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,940
They had to fucking destroy them because they were getting in their way. So this all makes sense

427
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,980
um

428
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,580
As to why why they're doing it. They don't recognize like the importance of the fucking differences of what makes them special

429
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,260
So when so white diamond is convinced finally that that is not the case by the big emotional climax

430
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:53,220
Where she rips out the gem from steven and the gem itself of pink diamond like she was expecting to just become actually

431
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,780
With me and michelle were thing was that oh now we're going to get steven and rose quartz. She's not even dead

432
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,700
She's just coming back. This is going to suck

433
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,180
But no the the the pink diamond itself had been changed by the existence of steven

434
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,700
We thought she was back

435
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,100
But uh it like so pink diamond really is permanently gone even having to remove the gem from steven

436
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,860
And it like its nature has been changed and now it's like it's a weird pink steven thing

437
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,060
And then it refuses with his body. It's a big emotional thing. Yay. I'm myself again. Okay, that's fine

438
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:30,340
So so what I just want to cut in just before you get to that that bit. Why why was uh pink steven the diamond

439
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,500
Had no emotion at all like the other diamonds have emotion. I don't really understand what that means

440
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,900
Well, I mean, okay, so that was a blank face pink steven

441
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,340
I mean, I mean was it really with no emotion because it yelled really loud that one time that seemed like something was going on with it

442
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,740
Uh, I just think it was a weird like

443
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,540
It was it was a weird like

444
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,100
Like choice to have it be so

445
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,460
Because like what else are you supposed to take away from that other than he has no emotion?

446
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,300
No, no, I think it was just sort of a shorthand to say it to show that it's incomplete without steven

447
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,020
Like two two halves of the same thing

448
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,340
And that's why when steven got happy. So did the pink steven got happy. They all got in sync

449
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,260
Yeah, I think I think that's right brain left brain. I think uh

450
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,380
The episode was kind of shit on the whole. Yeah, the more I think about it

451
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,660
um, because uh

452
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:36,420
Like a lot of a lot of the the dialogue and ideas in this episode seemed like like weirdly on the nose even for steven universe

453
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,260
like

454
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
It felt like like all the criticism

455
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,180
That people have given the show like how it like shoves like it's lgbt thing down people's throats

456
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
it it felt like

457
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,260
They heard the criticism and then doubled down on all of it

458
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,980
For this well, there's no way that we change that shit. That's what the show. No, I know they're not going to change it

459
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,220
And I've never really had a problem with it. I've been a stalwart steven universe defender

460
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,580
But some of the dialogue in this episode was like excruciatingly on the nose

461
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,980
Like when they go she prefers to be called steven now and it's like just shut off. Yeah, I know top

462
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,580
And there was a bunch and like they're like the part we're fucking the

463
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
The steven and garnet fusion

464
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,740
Sunstone, I think like breaks the fourth wall

465
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,060
Looks at the camera and says remember kids if you are dealing with a bully tell an adult

466
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,180
What the fuck was that that was horrible?

467
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,780
I don't I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I could character

468
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:43,220
It was a joke, but I don't get the joke like I really don't I can't understand what the joke is that literally that literally happened

469
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,340
What steven fused with garnet and made a new gem sunstone

470
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,300
Sunstone was like oh, she's wacky and like she says her and then she goes to the camera. She breaks the fourth wall

471
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,620
So like oh her joke is that she's

472
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,540
She's dead. She she breaks the fourth wall

473
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,060
And she says she says after school

474
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,180
I mean, I guess like commercial if they hit. Oh my god. Sunstone is fucking awesome

475
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,740
It looks great, but god damn like if they had done that bit if they had done that bit twice

476
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,820
Then I would have accepted it like okay. It's like her thing. Maybe it's because

477
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,100
Sapphire is in there somewhere. She's like aware of things

478
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,300
But like because they only did it once it was so insanely jarring and weird

479
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,580
Like she's just giving this like they're literally fighting first of all

480
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,540
And then in the middle of a of the fight like she's going. I'm gonna beat you up

481
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,140
I'm gonna beat up white diamond and then looks at the camera and goes but kids if you have a bully tell an adult

482
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,300
And like I wanted to shit. I just wanted to empty my bowels

483
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,700
in an instant

484
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,100
and uh this whole like arc of like

485
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,500
Of steven being there and being forced into the role of pink diamond

486
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,500
like

487
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,540
Like again, everyone is criticized to show a lot for a long time and I've always defended it

488
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:09,380
But this arc like right when he gets in the pink diamond outfit. That was the moment where I finally went

489
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
This is gay

490
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:18,340
This is gay. It's like he's just like he's in this like really to to with his midriff exposed for like four

491
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,820
entire episodes and like I'm not

492
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,860
Like I'm not being close-minded. I'm not offended by it. I don't know. I didn't mind that at all

493
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,620
It's just so fucking lame. I mean, I'm still looking at the wiki. I can't fucking believe how cool sunstone is

494
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
It's awesome. All right

495
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
You know, we're fucking angry

496
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,780
That thing with sunstone when she looked at the camera was

497
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,340
particularly like annoying

498
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:49,060
Uh, I was totally blind and that was just like oh just that was like them just like planting a sign like editing

499
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,780
Like a still image onto the middle of the episode and it wasn't in character wasn't anything

500
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,380
It's just like by the way, like we support children not being bullied

501
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,180
Just please call this number in the real world

502
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,780
It just doesn't make sense because sunstone isn't is way smaller than this giant robot. She's not bullying the giant robot

503
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,100
I don't understand what is yeah, but but that thing was the bully right like that thing was bullying them

504
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:18,100
Like the whole like I just don't get like why this episode like as the finale was so like weirdly

505
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,620
On the nose and in your face and like obnoxiously like

506
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,820
um

507
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,580
It felt like they were not subtle at all ticking books is like oh, we haven't seen Steven and pearl fuse got to do that

508
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,060
Steven that's true. They were trying to like really

509
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,380
Cramming all the different themes of the show all at once in this episode and throw them at you with no subtlety to them at all

510
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,340
like um

511
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,380
The part where it's just the the the finale fan service

512
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Yeah, yeah, but like

513
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,300
The best part of Steven universe is like

514
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,140
Getting to know the care like really getting into them like I think like one of the best episodes is

515
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,980
Mr. Greg

516
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,100
where

517
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,380
You like

518
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,500
Get an idea of like any pearl episode is great because like she's kind of the most rich character, I think

519
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,260
But like delving into like her insecurities and stuff

520
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,060
But in this episode there was a moment where

521
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,660
White diamonds starts running down the crystal gems and she just like flat out says

522
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,260
Uh, your flaw garnet is that you're fucking

523
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,620
Retarded and your flaw pearl is that you're insecure and your flaw amethyst. No

524
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,380
Your flaw amethyst is you're insecure and your flaw pearl is that you're obsessed and it's like

525
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,580
It was better when you like stating yeah, like the the characters seem so much more three-dimensional when you

526
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,060
Like are seeing that instead of like it's really weird for a character

527
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,580
To just like it's kind of like another break in the fourth wall thing almost where the characters just yeah

528
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,940
This is who you are as a character pearl and this is who you are as a character garnet and this is why you

529
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Gathered yet. These are the flaws

530
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
How does white diamond even know that?

531
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,860
Yeah, that's also a good. Did she say that did she did she say she said she she said like

532
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,540
As she was zapping them and turning them gray like oh, you're all flawed

533
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,940
You know and she said like the word obsessed to pearl and insecure

534
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,420
I forget what she said to garnet, but was was did we was it confirmed that pearl was white diamonds pearl?

535
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:27,140
That's still not confirmed and it's infuriating. Yes. Just confirm it for me god damn it. Well, well white diamond would have met pearl

536
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,660
Plausibly, but she wouldn't know anything about amethyst, right?

537
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Well

538
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,260
Because she kind of brain washes them

539
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,700
I think she has some sort of way of getting into their minds and knowing

540
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,580
That's it's it's revealed that

541
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
um white diamonds pearl

542
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
is pink diamonds pearl

543
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
Because she turns pink at the right

544
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,420
so

545
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,900
Like and and there was that line in an episode a long time ago where jasper says something about you being a defective pearl

546
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,660
so

547
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,660
My theory is that our pearl

548
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,300
Like at some point pink diamond fucked up and pissed off white diamond

549
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,340
So white diamond took pink pearls pearl

550
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,260
And said this is my white pearl now and then like

551
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,940
Pawn and like gave pink diamond like a crappier like an off-color

552
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:22,340
Defective pearl which is why our pearl is not pink as she like logically should be she's just pearl colored

553
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,100
That's so I think that our pearl was a replacement pearl for pink diamond after losing her original pearl

554
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,420
to white diamond. Yeah, most likely

555
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:40,580
All I'm saying is if it is in fact revealed as I personally suspect that our pearl just was straight up white diamonds pearl

556
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,740
Although like are there more than four pearls in the universe? I would imagine so, right?

557
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,740
Um, but anyway, like assuming that our pearl was white diamonds pearl

558
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:55,620
There are many many many times when it would have been relevant for for our white ish pearl to say by the way guys

559
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,740
I was white diamonds pearl. I have some information about her

560
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,260
I can like tell you some info on her, but she has not done that which is weird if she is in fact her pearl

561
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,300
I don't think I don't think I don't think she was white diamonds pearl

562
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,020
I think she was just like a literally a defective off-color. Yeah, like a spare piece of shit

563
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,420
Okay, I'll just say for the record. She would have been destroyed because there's no tall there's zero

564
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,220
Zero tolerance. I guess that's also true. That's true. That's well. Never mind. It makes no sense. It's stupid then

565
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,940
I'll point out just for the record that so every pearl has their pearl on the same place on their body as their

566
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:35,060
Corresponding diamond and white pearl or our pearl does in fact have a forehead pearl just like white diamond as a forehead diamond

567
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,780
So it seems well likely that they are in sync, but again not confirmed yet

568
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,540
Maybe she was uh cursed to not be able to say anything

569
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,780
Like I mean that is established that that is a thing that happens. So one thing about the episode that I did really appreciate

570
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,660
Is that a pearl pearl our pearl the real pearl

571
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,260
Has now permanent cool jacket

572
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,540
That's true big old shoulders

573
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,660
Yeah, so now she now she can dress up now. She can drive around and fuck that less and I like that because

574
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,500
Finally, I like that because you know every time that they regenerate they their outfits do change

575
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,500
But this is the first time that it's looked like to me or seemed like

576
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,700
The physical change is like a tangible manifestation of actual character development because that episode where she wore the jacket

577
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,980
Was an episode where she actually developed as a character. So now that she has a jacket as part of her

578
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,620
Permanent look. It feels like sick

579
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,860
Is the jacket is cool. Peridot has prominent glasses that she doesn't deserve and dead

580
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,900
And also and also a fucking

581
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:50,340
Peridot has come in a glasses. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's she's the one she's the one and garnet they both

582
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Oh

583
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Garden has like Simone glasses, I guess

584
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,460
And uh and uh fucking lapis has like a lad pants now

585
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,340
for some reason

586
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:10,820
God damn it lapis. You looked way better before go back to your dress. What what what what what's the deal with lapis

587
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,420
What the heck is she and why lapis is the worst character in the show

588
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,460
She's so she's so strange and I don't I still don't really understand who she is

589
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,940
Agreed me too. And that's a problem

590
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,860
I kind of like her lapis, but that's the thing is I can't describe why

591
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,100
It's like she vaguely depressed and confusing. I wanted to like her. She looked she looked really cool

592
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,340
I I was I was on board like when I first saw her I was like oh lapis. Oh cool

593
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,420
Uh, it was just sad. Nope. Nobody else on the show is sad. I'm into it

594
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,060
She was just written like a bit different a few too many times

595
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,140
I don't even feel like lapis should be a crystal gem

596
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,660
I just feel like because she was a character design that like had been in the show. They're like, we got one

597
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,420
Let's bring her into this because like I felt like she was just a one-off

598
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,220
Like side character, but then she gets all wrapped up and

599
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,060
She's so weirdly outside the the circle of what I consider the real crystal gems

600
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,780
Which includes paradox, but it does not include lapis and it does not include bismuth either

601
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,740
I don't like that character. No, it does not. I don't she should go away. Also guys, did you

602
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,420
When they all fuse into like obsidian or whatever

603
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,820
Notably, they just are like, we're let's just not use with bismuth. Let's like she we don't want her like mixed up in our

604
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,380
Like obsidian thing. Why why didn't they do it?

605
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,900
You know when I I looked up obsidian and like she she's like a lava creature and she like forges her greats

606
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:43,780
Out of like the lava in her third mouth, which is fucking awesome. So I saw that I assumed that bismuth was in there, but no

607
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
No, no, no, they just

608
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,260
You would think that would be bismuth's bag

609
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:55,380
I mean, maybe there's an easy answer to this but like like so the temple has like five gems or whatever for the five crystal gems, you know,

610
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,220
whatever

611
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,220
diamond rose quartz

612
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,340
Amethyst a garnet who is two gems and then pearl like how can bismuth didn't have a room?

613
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,820
What's up with that? She was there. Did she maybe they built that up before they made it? Yeah, afterward. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's fair

614
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
I guess that's fair. Okay. Well whatever

615
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,020
Is the worst

616
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Yeah, she sucks

617
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
We all agree on it. I just don't like it

618
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
The thing with bismuth

619
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,340
Is that like I was talking about this with some some art people and they were like really annoyed about how

620
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,740
Boring and terrible her character design is when the gem bismuth is the coolest looking gem in the world

621
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,460
Yeah, like she's just got sort of like kind of colorful dreadlocks

622
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,460
And it should be it should be like a wild like super rainbow

623
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Cool like angular hair and it's just some lady with dreadlocks

624
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,980
And I don't know she's like the most bloodthirsty of them all but she doesn't like do anything with that

625
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
She's kind of boring and she's fat

626
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,100
Yeah

627
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
I don't care for it

628
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,300
Yeah, I guess so were those uh one of those really good designs

629
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,580
Like at the end when when all those gems are getting reformed so many cool little designs are like weirdly vaguely humanoid

630
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,660
Are just really neat

631
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,820
That was one of the best parts of the show just watching them all being uh reformed and being able to guess like oh

632
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,100
What gem do you think that one might be?

633
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Hey, do you remember the the chip sky from the very first episode the one that likes

634
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Yep centipede man centipede

635
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,900
It's like the cutest one. I loved her

636
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,060
She's I do like I do like her and then jasper was there. I forgot that jasper was bubbled and then there she is

637
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,820
Bubbled and fucked up permanently uh with troll horns. They're they're saying she's a troll now you guys

638
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Oh no

639
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:52,260
Yeah, they got they got back the friends that they mentioned like I don't remember what the names were but like they mentioned those friends

640
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,660
And they were like, oh no, they're gone. They're corrupted and they got them back and bismuth pounced. You know, okay

641
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,300
You know what I'd like to see I'd like to see all right

642
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,500
This maybe this has nothing to do with anything

643
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,260
But imagine off on homeworld they got like babies

644
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,580
But they're coal so like coal babies and you crush them into different gems. That's how they make them

645
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,860
You put a baby in the crushing machine. It comes out

646
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Let

647
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:25,620
Okay, on the subject of saving all the corrupted gems at the end. Let's talk about like consequences

648
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:33,780
For white diamonds genocidal campaign throughout the stars that the other diamonds that by the way, nobody even cares about like blue diamond and yellow diamond

649
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,140
absolutely

650
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:43,460
Uh participants in these genocide crusades. Um, let's okay. What have they done as part of their galactic uh conquering empire

651
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,180
They have 100 destroyed planets wiped out populations

652
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,460
Mind all the resources in like an expunged all life plant or otherwise from planets

653
00:40:53,620 --> 00:41:00,260
And we can only speculate as to how many planets this was done to many many systems many many planets. Um

654
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,980
Okay, yellow did say like thousands didn't she thousands? Yeah, I think so

655
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,860
I'm not I'm not too sure but yeah, she mentions a large

656
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:15,300
And now so big dick Steven slams his cock on the table in front of white diamond and says

657
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
It ain't gonna suck itself

658
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,780
Stop being evil. You're good now and white diamond says okay

659
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,740
And whatever she learns that it's okay to be flawed. I guess that means, you know

660
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,820
I look I get the whole I get what they're trying to say socially in the in the meta text of that message

661
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,380
What I don't understand is how that's in any way a sufficient apology

662
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,060
For the genocides that white diamond and her and her cabal have committed across the universe

663
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,420
And how it's just okay for them to literally come to earth and say like hey guys, we're here. We're good now

664
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,340
How is that?

665
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,340
Acceptable. There are some crimes that you cannot be forgiven for and I think they've crossed the threshold

666
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,900
If they're doing more episodes that might be addressed

667
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:03,940
Okay, let let me finish one point though on this and it's it's just that okay. I am I do not believe in like, uh, like

668
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,220
What's the word?

669
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,580
Like repudiation justice like like punishment justice

670
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,740
If someone has if you've got a thief and he steals a loaf of bread and like okay, maybe the punishment for that is chop

671
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,420
Off his hand. Okay, like that's not gonna help anybody if you could instead

672
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,420
Explain to this guy why what he did was wrong and he could make it up to the person he stole from

673
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,300
And like he doesn't need to do any jail time or even be punished at all

674
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,220
He just needs to sincerely change his behavior like that's obviously what we want

675
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,380
So if white diamond has been like redeemed then like okay

676
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm willing to accept that like maybe it's not even doesn't even make sense to punish white diamond for this

677
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,820
But they don't talk about that what I think is that literally white diamond is too important to jail

678
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,940
Because she and it's it's literally only her political and actual physical

679
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,860
Might that prevents us from even thinking like oh this person should be in jail

680
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,660
Just like we do with big bankers in the real world

681
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,260
We're like obviously, you know, it's fine that they're not in jail. They're important

682
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:08,100
Like a president just can commit war crimes because like I don't know. He's the president. That's fine. And uh, I just feel like we're using some weird

683
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,060
Systems to judge these guys

684
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,900
Shouldn't we be more mad shouldn't the characters be more mad about what's going on?

685
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
um any comments here, I don't know I

686
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,820
What on the one hand? Yes, they should be more mad. I guess but I think they're just more relieved that

687
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,980
They they have stopped her from destroying everything and so they're just getting caught up in like

688
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,820
Ah victory, you know, we did it. We've solved the problem for now

689
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,780
And then you know, they they can sit on the beach with a ukulele and play a little little song

690
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Like for one second

691
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,780
That's fair, but okay, there's a couple of issues still at play them. Okay, it's

692
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,020
So what we are led to believe about white diamonds redemption

693
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,820
Is that it was that white diamond was a perfectionist and she like okay

694
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,740
She was literally like a bigot against like uh, and I understand what all this represents the real world like okay

695
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:09,860
White diamond thinks that fusing is icky. Why does white diamond think that fusing is icky? I don't know tradition

696
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,420
It's it's new and different and weird. It's the purity. It's not pure or something like oh, okay

697
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,380
Yeah, it relates to off color something like okay, that's fine like obviously that's just something that should go away

698
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,620
There's nothing really wrong about that

699
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,220
Like uh, I'm not someone in the real world who thinks that all traditions are necessarily worthless

700
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,780
But I'm happy to examine any of them and you know toss out the shit and keep only the good stuff

701
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,100
So this is one that doesn't seem to make a lot of fucking sense

702
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,300
And you're literally way more powerful if you fuse anyway, so wake up white diamond. Stop limiting yourself

703
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,740
I was almost hoping to see a blue and yellow diamond fusion

704
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,700
I wanted to see stuff like that

705
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,740
Dude, they gotta like it's okay that they've got a gay son now

706
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,860
But they're gonna have to work up to actually trying any gayness out themselves

707
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,380
What if all four of them fuse and they become big diamond?

708
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,420
Big diamond big big big big diamond

709
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,940
Um, okay, okay, so that's all that's all fine. I get what they're trying to say

710
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,780
But here's the thing and this is okay. This this is a moral for babies and like okay. That's fine

711
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,540
A galactic genocider with a big diamond on his head when you've got a galactic genocider

712
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,340
Most people who commit galactic genocide

713
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,180
Are not they didn't just like fall into this position. We all know one

714
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,220
Okay, all right

715
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,460
Like I'm trying to really take the story and give it all the credit that it's due like okay

716
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
Why was hitler like a bad man?

717
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,380
Uh, probably things like he was he was poisoned uh into thinking that like the world was persecuting the german people

718
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,140
After their experiences after world war one like he had had I think personal run-ins with jews that made him hate them

719
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,180
And make them think they'd be a great scapegoat. Okay, like fine

720
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,540
So he he had like some baggage that made him an evil guy understandable

721
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,940
Like what makes white diamond like an evil person uh one she like wasn't accepting of like new thoughts and

722
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,340
You know what people wanted to do with their lives

723
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,140
Um, but also let's not forget the fact that homeworld is literally falling apart

724
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,100
We we see homeworld and it's like being destroyed

725
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,780
I was kind of under the impression. Okay. This is this is how you write steven universe in like a like

726
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,940
I'm not even saying it's better, but like a

727
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,180
A more realistic thing

728
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,900
It's a thing where like what what I was hoping white diamond would argue and this didn't happen at all was like, okay

729
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,060
I'm white diamond the reason that I'm so strict in everyone is because homeworld is literally falling apart

730
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,700
Like our society is crumbling right now

731
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:44,580
The way that I maintain structure and order for like all my billions and trillions of like children that are like my

732
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:50,020
Under my command and like they're my responsibility is I impose these rigid social structures

733
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:55,700
To like keep things in line so that things don't like spiral off like they did when I gave pink diamond too much leeway

734
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,900
And it caused that whole crystal gem shit and then we had to go mop up that

735
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,380
Like people don't just become a dictator for like no reason they do it because they

736
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,940
Generally either think that it's for the best whether they're right or wrong

737
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,580
Or like they they just crave power and they find whatever way they can get it

738
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,420
If white diamond just crave power she would be evil and they would like have to fight her

739
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,100
So obviously they weren't going to do that

740
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,900
so

741
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,900
Like I just think it would have been way more

742
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,700
interesting of a of a story if they deal with what like actual dictators do

743
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,220
And it's a thing where like she like this is just the way that she

744
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,380
Controls her society and makes sure that I don't know it runs fucking smoothly

745
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,980
But like that and and then it would be harder to convince her

746
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,340
But no, it's just that oh, I just like I have just this purity thing

747
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,300
Like oh like but then she sees oh wait, I have emotions sometimes too. Even I'm not perfect

748
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,180
Maybe I can allow these people to be different

749
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,780
Well, I I I'm wondering about that because like they blue and yellow we're talking about you know

750
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,340
Oh, do you remember white diamond when we used to have fun picnics and we were all happy friends and like

751
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,100
They didn't necessarily mention a thing that changed

752
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,780
That's like I feel like there is a thing that would have changed like oh

753
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,940
And then the event happened

754
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,140
But we don't speak of that event was was the pink diamond

755
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,740
Well pink diamonds quote-unquote death or like the crystal gem rebellion

756
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,980
I like because they say that before pink left like they used to have fun together

757
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,100
And it's that's the only notable event like in gem history that we're aware of so it's kind of a guess

758
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,420
But it seems fairly reasonable. I think

759
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,900
Um that like something about pink diamond leaving and like quote-unquote

760
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:38,820
Well, I guess being murdered and like gems betraying them in their eyes. Anyway, maybe it just made white diamond think of like

761
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,780
Maybe this plays into what I was saying it like ah when I give them too much freedom bad things happen

762
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:49,460
So let's fucking you know, even tighter than before it could be that or it could just be the like

763
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,420
White kept pink around and didn't let her go on

764
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,380
Uh, you know taking over a planet missions

765
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,300
um

766
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,460
Because she liked having her around and when she was gone. She just sort of well, it's it's weird

767
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,220
We just don't know enough about white diamond

768
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:09,220
I'm imagining that they were all younger and like white diamond was the eldest and so she took up the mantle of being perfect

769
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,300
So that she could set a good example

770
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,460
There was like a line or two. I don't remember what the lines were but it was

771
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,980
The white diamond said and because of that I assumed for a split second that like

772
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:29,540
Pink diamond and maybe the other diamonds other color diamonds are kind of like parts of white diamond that got separated from white diamond

773
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,820
So she could be perfect

774
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:36,100
Let's talk about that because that was a little confusing and I was also wondering about that white diamond does say that like

775
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,180
She doesn't say things like literally she says that like blue diamond yellow

776
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:45,060
Like are part of her and that pink is also part of her. I think that was more metaphorical

777
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,140
In the sense of like they are aspects of myself

778
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:55,380
Like emotionally, but I like like whatever blue is like sad and I white could be sad

779
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,260
But I like control that in myself yellow is I don't I don't even know what you're angry

780
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,900
Angry and I you know repress that in myself. I'm just I'm calm all the time

781
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,620
And then and then like the thing that happens to me

782
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,340
Isn't yellow diamond isn't yellow diamond all about having no emotions like

783
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,660
No, she's actually pretty

784
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,740
Well, okay, okay

785
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,460
Yeah, but remember there was that episode with peridot

786
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,020
We're like she like she loves yellow diamond

787
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,100
But then she talks to yellow diamond and she sees that yellow diamond isn't as like perfect

788
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,860
Like she sees yellow diamond get mad on the communicator and she's like, huh?

789
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,460
She's not as cool as I thought she was she's not perfectly logical after all

790
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,500
Well, I guess I well white diamond does attempt to make everybody like logical and not

791
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,940
Overly emotional I guess but I suppose yellow attempts to do that

792
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:47,220
But you know isn't as good as uh as white diamond yellow is trying to follow white

793
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:55,540
Orders to the tea, you know, she's she did say like I I did everything and did everything perfectly in your name because you requested it

794
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:01,460
So she's sort of like trying to be like white diamond, but she's obviously not why I'm I'm still wondering

795
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,260
We this has not been addressed or even close to answered. Where did the diamonds come from?

796
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:13,780
What is the origin of the gem civilization to begin with the coal babies they started as the coal babies you get crushed by

797
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,460
um, you know, I don't even I don't even really minecraft steve

798
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,940
and his and his galactic

799
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,380
Craft and bench. Well, I don't even need like a real answer

800
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,900
The only reason I ask is because I literally want to know more about white diamonds backstory as a character

801
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,380
Like that's why I'm asking not because I I need all the lore all the fucking time

802
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,500
But like uh, so so in in in various things up to this point at the end of the special

803
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,940
We see a preview for the movie and there appears to be a red gem

804
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,260
Like rotating and and people theorize. Maybe that's red diamond

805
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:51,140
Like maybe this person is the one even above white diamond. Maybe this person is the real origin of everything

806
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,660
Or maybe it's just a split off diamond all the way or maybe they're not a diamond at all. I mean, who knows who knows

807
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,020
Um, could be anything could be diamonds all the way up

808
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,820
diamonds all the way down

809
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,380
And uh, like so so I guess I'm just gonna say that so so far I'm not really uh

810
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,900
It's not that I'm not satisfied with the story. It's just that oh

811
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,500
I have unfortunately recognized that this story's moral is just something that I kind of already know

812
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:25,700
And isn't really for my age demographic and that's fine. It's just unfortunate. So it's not that it's like bad

813
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:31,940
It's just the the thing I'm most interested in they don't really want to touch on and that's okay

814
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,420
It's just a different story. I guess then from what I want

815
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,860
But maybe with the movie and this possible next season there will be some of that because because just to be clear

816
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,180
Steven universe is actually like the only show that I go back to and just watch episodes from randomly

817
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,900
Because I just really enjoy the atmosphere and those queers can make a goddamn show when they put their mind to it

818
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,180
And make a comfy-ass atmosphere and I really like it

819
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,420
Uh, so this is not I'm not even trying to be that critical of the show

820
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,300
It's just when it when it comes to like intergalactic conflict and like the origin

821
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:12,020
Of like why civilizations act the way they do that's when my star fleet senses start to tingle and I get a little excited

822
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:18,580
Who would have thought that this show that I value so much for its comfy down-to-earth atmosphere would would would

823
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,860
Stumble out of the gate when it comes to intergalactic politics

824
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,860
And war crimes. Well, I mean that's the time when like, you know, they can expand the scope a little of that choose

825
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,940
And they chose not to and that's okay

826
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,020
But yeah, yeah, that's it. That's all I got. I want to fuck pearl

827
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:41,940
I want to check out her pants. I want her to regenerate with no pants on. I want to fuck her

828
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,860
It's me the best character in the show the guy who fucks him

829
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,100
That's my name. I guess that's the guy who fucks him

830
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,980
Greg's my Greg's my name, but the guy who fucks him is my middle name

831
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:07,300
Fuck a mom the pussy. I think we've confirmed that Greg literally did just come on her gem

832
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,060
And it butted off into some kind of steven growth. I think that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard

833
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,460
There can be no other

834
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,860
Do you see like a do you see like a like a zoom down like a house like a house?

835
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:26,340
Kind of like style like zoom in by into the body biological close-up and you see his no absolutely not

836
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,620
Okay, just one other solution could there be nothing nothing

837
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,740
Um, I guess that's it. I mean so september's the movie. Uh, I don't know

838
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,980
I there was actually some pretty mixed feelings here on how things are going. Um

839
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,140
Yeah, I don't know. I I still like steven universe a lot and I'm looking forward to more

840
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,780
Um, I should probably catch up. I want to see more white diamonds. I want to see sunstone

841
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,140
Cool-looking. Yeah, and she got some great animation and uh

842
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,340
She's got a cool star cloak with all kinds of cool stuff in it. I'm so fucking cool. You guys

843
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:03,220
Yeah, I want to fuck her. I want to stick it in her fucking

844
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,340
hole

845
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:19,940
If you okay, if you came on white diamonds, uh diamond, would it grow like a white steven universe?

846
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,980
Is like that what you would get same with you know bluey and yellow. Would it be the same sort of thing?

847
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,140
I think they would have to do it on they would have to decide

848
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,420
Like only if they wanted it to happen. Yeah, you can't do it by accident doctor. Help me

849
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,100
I cut my cock on a diamond cunt

850
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:44,420
What if what if it does happen and they don't have to opt in like what if it's like semen is just to a gem as like

851
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
Water is to the wicked witch of the west. Yeah

852
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,580
Like you confirmed that pink had to grow grow a womb

853
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,740
To actually I mean she did have a womb. We saw her like pregnant with steven

854
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:00,820
There was a thing I refuse to believe that the gems don't have vaginas and I meet you

855
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:07,780
They have to be able to fuck it's the like I think like because it's a whole episode like one of the earliest episodes

856
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,940
When steven tries to fuck amethyst that was a crazy. That was a big life lesson for me the earliest episodes

857
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,260
Pearl has that line where she's like I don't like eating because I don't like digesting. It's gross

858
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:24,260
Which confirms for me that they got you know pearl's been around a long time. She's like a million thousand years old

859
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,540
Right. She's so you know, she's but she's done things. She's pooped

860
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:33,220
She's peed and she's probably been porked a few times that sex and didn't her like it rose quartz

861
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:39,620
Absolutely requested and enforced and demanded that pearl develop a vagina for her pleasure

862
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,620
I have no doubt that happened

863
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,380
In real I think she went even further than that. I think I think that she is a definite degenerate

864
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,380
I think that she gave the order

865
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:57,300
She said pearl go out there and find male human boys and men and fuck them so that you know what people are like

866
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,900
You gotta go fuck them

867
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:04,100
Holy shit, you know those like you know those like saudi arabian and you gotta eat food and you gotta poop it out your shitter

868
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,620
Well, yeah, that that's my order. I'm that's an order from your fucking

869
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,420
Fucking diamond. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so wise diamond

870
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,980
And she had to do it. She had to do it

871
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,940
She had to go get fucked. She had to go shit and pee and she didn't like any of it. She didn't like it

872
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:26,660
She's like sitting on the toilet just sitting and she's just looking up out the window teary. I had like oh great time

873
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:33,540
And what what is your what is your plan? What is your life almost a shit? I can never stop wiping the wiping never stops

874
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,740
Oh, it all coming back together. We have to get off of it

875
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,780
Wiping so yeah, so this is steven universe episode four now

876
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,500
Uh, I think this is three universe. Isn't this our third one? It's only three. I think so

877
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,300
I think this has got to be at least three and a half

878
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:57,780
Well, okay, I'm glad that I'm glad that I was able to make that wiping tirade come back and have a purpose later in the podcast

879
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,340
Me too. Uh, we did not get any steven universe voicemails. Thank god

880
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,140
Do we want to talk about anything else or should we just go to voicemails?

881
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:10,900
And this has been steven. Oh man. If people aren't talking about pearl poop, and then I don't want to hear it

882
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:20,580
We need we need a we need a new top we need something to jostle us out of the steven universe rut where I say voicemails. Let's do that

883
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,940
Um, how many do you have? Here's a uh news fact news fact a relevant thing

884
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,580
By this the time this episode comes out

885
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:36,180
Uh kingdom hearts 3 will be out in the real world. It will be released. It's already out in japan right now

886
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:42,660
Uh, and people have copies because some people are just getting it early finally something gayer than steven universe

887
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:46,420
To satiate my lust for homo bullshit

888
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:52,580
I'm happy to say that nobody has even attempted to spoil me on things which is very nice

889
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,420
Um, and by the time they hear this it's going to be too late. So you can't even do it now motherfucker

890
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,900
I'm gonna be cock deep in that game by this point. Uh, maybe I'll take some time off work

891
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
I don't know. I might uh, I might call out sick

892
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,020
mischievously for a day or two. Oh you rascal. I'm such a rascal. Um

893
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
I don't know. Maybe I maybe you're just putting a day. I don't know

894
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,460
The point is I'm going to be playing a lot of fucking kingdom hearts

895
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,780
And uh, I just want to take a moment on on our platform here on the procrastinators

896
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:23,620
And uh, please play uh the the fucking main theme of titanic in the background

897
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:29,460
No one uh, just to play it in your mind ladies and gentlemen as uh, we recognize the friends we lost along the way

898
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:34,820
By that I mean the people who used to care about kingdom hearts, but are completely fucking out of it

899
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:39,060
I have several friends who said they would buy a ps3

900
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:44,020
Specifically for kingdom hearts 3 when it inevitably came out on the ps3

901
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,940
And we are like we are like a year or two away from the ps5 right now. It's it's right around the corner

902
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:54,820
Um, it's been but they they man, they did it. It's been 13 years

903
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,860
13 just for the meme and at a certain point they were like okay for the past 10 years

904
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,500
Let's just go to the meme. Let's make the meme happen here

905
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:08,500
Uh, and I guess they did it, but uh, there's no way that's a coincidence, right? That has to be intentional

906
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,020
I I can I god. I hope so

907
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:17,620
Well, I don't know. I obviously I haven't played the game yet. I've been avoiding it. I just thought that uh

908
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,940
Man, I don't know. I just fucking say how fucking crazy it is

909
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,980
That and you know what this game is way more important than final fantasy 15

910
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,900
Um, because I mean whatever I played 15 didn't love it very much

911
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:38,340
Uh, but but this game is an actual real continuation of the same story that I started playing when I was like 11

912
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:44,740
And I feel I haven't played a kingdom hearts game since uh since chain of memories

913
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:50,820
But you haven't played two. You never played two. Well, oh wait. No two was after okay. Yeah, then two

914
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,260
I guess then two I haven't played a game. I haven't played a game since two

915
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,500
My my child self is screaming at me. You gotta play three

916
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:04,180
But like I haven't played any of the other games in between would I I mean, I'm gonna play it and I haven't played any of those

917
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,340
games. I don't forgive you shit. I

918
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,420
probably

919
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,860
I mean, I don't have

920
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:16,580
Well, I think I have a ps4. I mean, I have no hope or delusions that the story matters in kingdom hearts at all

921
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,940
I basically feel I mean like the the the part of the kingdom heart story that matters is like the emotional part of it

922
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,300
Like in the first game

923
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,700
He's just trying to get back to his friends and in the second game

924
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:33,060
He's still trying to get back to his friends in the third game, you know, and probably still I don't fucking know

925
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,580
That's the part that matters. Everything else is just just bullshit

926
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,740
Kingdom hearts too. I mean, yeah, they could have ended it at kingdom hearts too and just it was a perfectly clean ending right there

927
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,420
But you know, they wanted to do more and that's fine. They had they had things to explain legitimately

928
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,020
So they planned that the real story of kingdom hearts is that uh

929
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,340
Sephiroth

930
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,980
Is standing on a cliff somewhere being gay for cloud and waiting for him to show up so they can have a

931
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,860
Gay fight and that's true a sword fight with their dicks. That's every game

932
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,540
Since okay since the game is not yet and I haven't played it

933
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:13,860
This isn't really a spoiler, but just I heard I heard that there just is no sephiroth boss fight in kingdom hearts 3

934
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,620
That's what I heard and like that makes me I don't know if that's true

935
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,740
That would be so weird because like don't they want to push the remake?

936
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:25,460
Okay, well here's the thing and this is where things get a little bit scary. Um,

937
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,980
I think that they're planning that as dlc

938
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,660
Um, that's my fear. This is my fear

939
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,660
and

940
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:39,620
You know like okay, so I would I would still I still find that weird because I would think they would want to push the

941
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,180
The remake I would think they would include that just for that. Wait, what do you mean the remake? Oh of seven

942
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:50,020
Of course, of course that that makes a lot of sense makes a lot of sense. Yeah. Yeah. Good fucking point. The you know

943
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:56,740
Uh, that re that fucking remake is in rough shape right now. Um, they they recently like completely scrapped all work

944
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,380
I think and started over no fucking way

945
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:04,500
You know what? I might be confused that with another story, but uh at the very least we have not heard any positive

946
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,260
updates and the only the only dlc that kingdom hearts 3 should have is fucking like

947
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,540
Sora goes to disney world and he goes in the princess room and else is like do you have magic hands?

948
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,020
and he fucking

949
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:22,180
Gets a a cold hand job. I don't know that sounds good. That sounds good. Um

950
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,980
I I don't know I've uh, I've just heard a couple things in the over the grapevine

951
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,940
But like when I you know kingdom hearts 2 was weird

952
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,500
I mean because they they released kingdom hearts 2 right and then that was that was a standalone game

953
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:37,620
It had all its stuff then they released final mix not not in the west

954
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:43,300
But eventually it came out in the west years like 10 years later. Um, but they did in japan and like I'm like

955
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:48,900
Is it worse to buy dlc or to like buy an updated version of the same game?

956
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,540
I like like the idea of buying an updated version because it feels like real commitment

957
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,220
As opposed to like slapping shit out and just rolling it out whenever it's done

958
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,860
Uh, which just feels sloppy, but maybe that's just an emotional response. You know

959
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:08,260
I don't know. I just can't stop thinking of like weird stupid gay people sex jokes and fucking

960
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,980
everybody's

961
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,740
Is that related to kingdom hearts? I don't know. I'm just on I'm just I'm just on her

962
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,220
I'm on a real gay thing this week. I can't stop

963
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:24,980
All I want to talk about is like and then sora goes up to donald and he's like, hey, I'm gonna fuck you donald and

964
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,020
Then goop. I'm gonna fuck you when you're in your pillow out there

965
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:35,140
Then goofy is like well, I'm gonna fuck myself and then mickey is like nobody will fuck me

966
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:46,340
Not even mini he's getting cut by peat. That's the thing that happens, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was actually the first steamboat willy

967
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:55,300
Actually the first one was called uh, what's it called the the charlie steamer, uh, but they they they thought that was not good for the cleveland steamer

968
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,340
The cleveland steamer. That's the one. That's the one

969
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:04,420
The fuck is happening. They revamped it before release. Historians agree. It was the right decision

970
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,740
Walt Disney really was a marketing genius

971
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,580
This episode is weird guys

972
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,140

One day I'll burn all my one day I'll burn bridges with the with my with my fellow poo tubers as well

990
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:40,820
The steven universe fan base has been inoculated already with uh instructions explicit instructions from sunstone

991
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:46,340
To not deal with bullies to just say no to bullies like us. So no matter what we do

992
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:52,260
Uh, they're fine. They're gonna be fine. Hey steven universe fans. We're the bully sunstone was warning you

993
01:06:53,460 --> 01:07:01,940
Not me. I'm just the guy who fucks all the gems. I just fuck them. I'm not a bully. I'm just a sex man

994
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,660
That's just bully with me. Hey, all right, let's go

995
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:16,100
If every pork chopper perfect, I wouldn't fuck pearl. Oh, they rolled they rolled out that line. They rolled out the

996
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:23,300
Every pork chop like that because like it means nothing to why diamond was she does not know what a pork chop is

997
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:27,940
But that was I think that was that was for us not didn't she watch dug?

998
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,540
Didn't she watch seminal nick tune dug? Hey, remember that episode where him and roger bought all the hands on the wall

999
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,420
Remember this christmas special where they're gonna kill pork chop. What no why

1000
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,420
He like bite

1001
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:45,620
Someone's being an asshole or doing something dangerous and pork chop like bites him and a totally justified act

1002
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,860
But the guy's like he's a wild dog. We got to put him down. They're gonna do it. Yeah

1003
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:56,020
What why didn't they do it? What's that? Hey, remember? Hey, remember that episode where skeeter gets banana putting on their

1004
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,900
Oh

1005
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:08,100
Okay, all right, that's enough. Let's let's just float on to our fucking voice next episode of the procrastinators podcast the dug

1006
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,020
I mean at this point it's the new

1007
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:15,220
Utilitarianism we just need to get it out of our system. I guess just uh

1008
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:19,700
All right. Okay. This is our first fucking voicemail. Here we go. Okay. It's from

1009
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,940
Everyone's going crazy for this pizza

1010
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:29,060
I was getting the foot off the pee. All right. Okay. Go. You're currently reading camo. You're on deck play

1011
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,780
I know it's a meme, but I really hate the phrase friendship simulator

1012
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,380
A one-way audio tracks doesn't really equate

1013
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,900
To a friendship and what a friendship can mean

1014
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:47,140
On the other hand, I really like the phrase simulator and it's kind of fun to think about what you can apply it to

1015
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:51,380
For instance, you could consider a movie an experience simulator

1016
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,020
Or you could call a book a thought simulator

1017
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,460
And that one really rings true for me because when you're reading

1018
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,100
it's almost like the author is

1019
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:05,860
Instructing your mind to think in a certain way and to follow along with the specific thought process

1020
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,740
I don't know just a thought

1021
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:15,940
Okay, first of all fair enough. Uh, that's generally true. Second of all the friendship simulator is designed to be

1022
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:21,300
Generally insulting. I think uh, I think we're all in agreement here that we are not your friends

1023
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,740
I hope so. I hope we're in agreement about that. Of course

1024
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Nor are we each other's friends

1025
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:33,620
Well, absolutely. Absolutely. It's yeah, I feel genuine. I feel genuine. You know, I'm

1026
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:40,420
Viewers, uh, I'm a well-wisher and that I wish you know specific harm. Yeah. Yeah, shoehorned in a simpsons reference. Good

1027
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,660
Wait, is that it?

1028
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:48,500
I thought you were like building to something with that. No, I just wanted to quote moe. I guess that's how moe

1029
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,460
Is like

1030
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:56,260
In the in the one where in the one where the where he eats the chili pepper and the spirit coyote tells homer

1031
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:02,020
He's got to find his soulmate. He thinks he's he's misled for a moment that marge might not be his soulmate

1032
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,540
So he goes to the bar and he starts asking everyone there if they're his soulmates

1033
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,940
And barney's like no, I'm more of a chum and Carl's like I'm an acquaintance and what he's like

1034
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,300
I'm a something and moe says I'm a well-wisher and that I wish you know

1035
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:19,860
Specific harm and then our dad would say that to me all the time. He really liked that quote. He really liked that quote

1036
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:26,340
That was his uh, that was my I was our dad's um, the sun is shining the kid or the birds are chirping

1037
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,340
But kids like you should be burning in hell

1038
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,180
He wished us no specific harm and you know

1039
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,820
All right next one from cheesy. Um, what what?

1040
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:44,660
Um, I was gonna say the the bit at the end about experience simulator. There's a there's a video

1041
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,100
There's a video by innuendo studios where he talks about um

1042
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,660
Uh, this is not it's like this is not a tomato is what it's called

1043
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:58,500
It's like he does like a big like metaphor explaining like what art is and he there's a part he talks for a while about like

1044
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:04,020
Stories actually I think it might be the his video on the beginner's guide whatever doesn't matter

1045
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,060
The point is he's quoting some he's quoting like an unauthor

1046
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:14,260
Like a writer. I forget who he's talking about stories and he says that like a story is like you use words and language to

1047
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:20,100
To to stimulate like a series of micro memories of your experiences, right?

1048
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,540
So like you have memories of like what a tree is like so in a story

1049
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,460
He might like describe a tree and then you pull up your version of a tree and that's like a little

1050
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:33,620
Many experience you're having from the description in the text and it strings these micro memories together into a sequence that creates

1051
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:39,220
Like an extended false memory and that false memory is what the story is and I thought that was neat

1052
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,180
I thought that's a neat way to think about it. Yeah, okay

1053
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:48,820
By the way, I'm just looking I'm sure this will be in the show notes, but this master slimelint is a very

1054
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:55,620
Absolute unit. He's just colossal. Yeah, he's to scale 72 feet across

1055
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:02,260
Why then what what what in treats you to such a massive individual? Why do you get such a big lad?

1056
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,260
What's makes you special?

1057
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:11,140
I look I spent I spent years I spent years in my slimewood lab slash dungeon in the basement of saint ben's cathedral

1058
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:16,340
Just like just just concocting them concocting them out of goo and ooze and whatever raw materials

1059
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:17,140
I had at hand

1060
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:20,340
I guess that's fair and and the result was a massive success

1061
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,260
But there was a lot of there was a lot of byproduct

1062
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,620
There was a lot of runoff and it all collect it all collected into the being known as master slimelint

1063
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:33,460
Oh, I see by the way whose name he's really based on the bubble from uh mermaid man barnacle boy, right?

1064
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:38,020
Uh, well someone someone suggested I give him that face. He doesn't actually have a face

1065
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,780
It's pretty fun. It's pretty funny though. So after the image his name is a reference to the master. Um

1066
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,620
The the elemental masters from ululilias book

1067
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,500
Yeah, legend of the 10 elemental masters because they all have names

1068
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:54,900
Although the elemental masters are like the fire one is the master lavalent

1069
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,660
And the the water one is the master lavalent. Um and stuff

1070
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:05,300
So he's the master slimelint because because all those are just big orbs of whatever element they are and so too

1071
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,300
With my boy here

1072
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:13,380
Sick, okay moving on. Here we go voicemail from cheesy man fraydo. He's back again. What do you got?

1073
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:18,820
Hey ben saint, um, I just came back to

1074
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,540
apologize about

1075
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,540
My last voicemail

1076
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,900
It's kind of really shitty of me just to use it to secretly show my web comic and

1077
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:35,540
I don't know. I just been thinking about it a lot. So I decided to come back in to apologize, you know

1078
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:48,980
All right, just kidding bitch. I got a patron on that fucking voicemail. Take that honky bongo luna forever

1079
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,780
Oh, no

1080
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,820
What a heel turn the joke of that man has gone too far

1081
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:03,140
I got I got a he he challenged me the bongo and luna guy challenged me

1082
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,460
He sent me a challenge on twitter. He he added me with something

1083
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,820
And I wanted to respond, but I didn't know how I guess I was just really intimidated. I guess I was really

1084
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:17,860
I guess I was just scared into silence. I was just scared into silence. Um

1085
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,460
Well, that's been for you cowered through and through there we go. There we go. Okay

1086
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,220

First time caller the other week night said taxation is theft

1093
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
And I just have a few words

1094
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,300
Did you know the top one tenth of one percent?

1095
01:14:53,780 --> 01:15:01,700
Owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. It is an outrage and it's time. They started paying their fair share

1096
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,580
I'll leave you with some readings

1097
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:09,540

I'll let you know how I think you have a lot. I think you I think you can learn a few things name

1102
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:34,100
I think I have many lessons to learn. I think you could I think you could expand your horizons

1103
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:38,740
In all I think I think you need to I think you need to be more sympathetic with the plight of the working man

1104
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,780
Indeed indeed and of the uh, I guess

1105
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:46,100
Uh, the poor oppressed german by those damn jews. Yeah

1106
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,460
Yeah, exactly. Okay. I'll open my heart to that

1107
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:55,620
Yeah, if you were talking about it before you were talking up, you know, how uh, yeah hitler oppressed

1108
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:00,100
Um, oh right, right. He was a deeply. This is what happened. Yeah. This is what happens

1109
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,980
This is what you know, you got one too many jeff bezos and you get another hitler. That's all insane

1110
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,660
All right next one the enlightened communist. Oh, okay. We're keeping right along. Let's see what he's got

1111
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,580
Hey, guys, sorry. I haven't sent in a voicemail in a while

1112
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,300
I was really busy jerking my gherkin and I've been wondering that's my favorite opening

1113
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,260
You still get messages about pony stuff and how hard was it to transition away from

1114
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:30,020
MLP related content and has your pony past had any effect on your current career?

1115
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,820
Any thoughts, uh, well, I don't remember any pony voicemails

1116
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:43,460
Not voicemails. I think he's talking about like, uh, pony messages

1117
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:48,020
Yeah, anybody at young twitter say fuck off clopper, you know, shit like that

1118
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,900
Everyone every once in a while someone will someone will obliquely reference uh, phantom horn

1119
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:58,580
Yeah, and you know sometimes people ask me where's the where's the t-bat max revive, which is uh fair enough

1120
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:08,180
I definitely view it as one of many black marks on my life and reputation that will never leave me and will forever follow me to my grave

1121
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:15,140
Yep fair fair. I suppose that's fair to say I get very little of it once in a while get like a keg standard

1122
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:21,460
But pretty much like Ben. I mean, I almost I almost got I almost had to get beat up by misanthropony that one time

1123
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,860
But uh, but uh, I mean I managed to uh, I managed to talk my way out of it

1124
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,820
I um, it's it's weird. I haven't really got any of that from anyone

1125
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:37,540
Like my old like pony videos occasionally still get comments about like ha ha. They said the word know a lot

1126
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:44,180
No, there's really old ones. Yeah, those great ones, but I don't get like current fans saying ha ha give and take

1127
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:48,820
You're you were a pony your pony ha ha like I don't get any of that

1128
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:54,580
Well, it'd be mostly I feel people, you know, whatever people who uh dislike or hate pony stuff for whatever reason

1129
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:58,100
Like trying to like be like hey remember this embarrassing thing you did

1130
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,620
I

1131
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,900
The only people I get the only people I get doing that is you guys

1132
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:09,300
Making fun of me for being rightfully making fun of me for being on analysis anarchy indeed. That's true

1133
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:13,380
I I I've come to accept that that is just really funny and I don't

1134
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:19,860
It is. Yeah, I don't even mind it that whole comparison of like Danny DeVito being you ben versus me being our old swarzenegger

1135
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,980
And that like brothers. Okay, class. The thing is that's true

1136
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:25,060
But in an intellectual capacity

1137
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:31,620
Exclusively when it comes to specifically the choice to be a part of or not be a part of analysis anarchy

1138
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:35,300
That was it that that was that was the mo that was the defining moment of my arc

1139
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:40,740
And you know, I I picked I picked a side. I picked a side and I could never go back. That's it. That's it

1140
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:44,820
But I I mean I guess for me, uh, like I really did just make a hard

1141
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,460
I mean, I remember agonizing about like oh

1142
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,740
Should I like use t-bap to like put I put videos on to like be like I've got a new channel guys come watch me

1143
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:58,580
I was just like fuck it. Nah, whatever you you you I think you made like a point like

1144
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:05,220
Ben like don't like don't link to my stuff. Don't like my other stuff from from t-bap

1145
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:11,540
I was very concerned about my ability to like not just be a pony guy forever. I was concerned about that

1146
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,260
Um, yeah, but it worked out pretty well

1147
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,460
I suppose it's fair to say what had just gone better

1148
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,300
What had just been a faster growth like what did you did if I like had used that?

1149
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:28,180
But yeah, no, I'm maybe I'm not worried about it now. Obviously. I doubt it would have made like a big difference in the long run. Yeah, yeah

1150
01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:34,660
I think actually if you had that pony like back backing you may not have started we agua

1151
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,220
Like you why you say that like

1152
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,220
Because it's it's sort of like you have like but the pony stuff you have like an

1153
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:46,820
An easy street like a bunch of subscribers that are already there like the algorithms already working in your favor

1154
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,260
Starting from scratch is a lot harder. So like making

1155
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:55,700
You know a month of regular content me and you know may not have been like a thing on your mind as much

1156
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:59,300
That is true. But you know when it comes to like there was really no chance

1157
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,060
We were gonna like I would even like because it was a shared channel with me and ben

1158
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,460
I was just like uncomfortable with the idea

1159
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,380
I mean, I didn't want to deal with the complexity of like making this my channel now

1160
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,260
Like I was just like I can abandon this like this is a

1161
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:18,260
Whatever ben could post on it. Would you like to preserve that channel for posterity just with the stuff on it?

1162
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:23,620
I mean, maybe one day we'll update it. We'll see there's big things coming. There's big things coming on that channel

1163
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:27,860
That's you're not wrong. You're not wrong. There's a big thing coming on that. I wouldn't have a big monetized

1164
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,300
We'll have to check

1165
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:34,740
I want to know dude. We got a post we got a post max revive tbap to the patreon and get that sweet like

1166
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:39,460
Definitely doing that that like eight dollars of people that are still the tbap patreon. Yeah

1167
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,180
Yeah, the tbap the abandoned tbap patreon

1168
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,900
It's it's alive. It's alive and well. It's going going strong

1169
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:54,180
Um, okay. Well, anyway, I haven't made it. Haven't made a dime off it in what years now. Yeah, absolutely probably three years or something

1170
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:57,140
Hell, yeah, uh, okay next one. Here we go

1171
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,860
Well, what about you mage? Have any thoughts on this? I mean, you don't do pony stuff anymore

1172
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,940
But like in in your circles

1173
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:10,660
Every now and then like I get comments on videos or messages or whatever like, hey, are you still on the pony fandom?

1174
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,660
I'm like, no

1175
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,460
Think you're the only one think you're the only one of us still dealing with that

1176
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:20,100
I think it's because of the whole alethel halloween cola because people

1177
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:25,700
Find it over and over again. And that's a big one. I get comments like oh, I watched this one. I was little

1178
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,700
Oh, I remember I was so scared

1179
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:30,900
I get comments. Oh my god. Oh, that's kind of nice

1180
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:35,620
Dang, I want. Yeah, I watched this when I was just a kid. Yeah, I'm 14 now

1181
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,740
God damn you guys talked over each other

1182
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:43,460
I said, yeah, I said, yeah, I watched this when I was just a kid. Yeah, I'm I'm 14 now

1183
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:50,660
Yeah, pretty much pretty much. Yeah, I was I was just saying like how long is it going to be until like I'm a nostalgic property

1184
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,700
Like the hypocrite videos be like, oh man, I remember watching those

1185
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,620
I'm already nostalgic for those like compilation videos at the very least

1186
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,300
Even the next episode

1187
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,780
The animations you did I really liked those

1188
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:07,780
The water glass glass of water. Yeah, it's probably been what like two years since you made those or something

1189
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,900
Yeah, well like I'm I'm thinking like like

1190
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:18,180
Like a munchy level like oh, you were a baby when you watched me and now you're a human being and you're talking about it

1191
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,820
Like I like the things I made are like

1192
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:26,180
As important to you as like anything else. Yeah, well, you know, it's what's youtube. That's true

1193
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,380
But you know, it's gonna be interesting. We're a generation that basically all of us

1194
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,780
Even munchy probably for the most part. Although no because homestuck was this big thing

1195
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:38,500
Oh, well, I was just gonna say that like we all grew up and basically our media stuff like was

1196
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:42,340
You know produced by like big companies and like it was like shows and stuff

1197
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,460
And well, those are obviously still big and what game of thrones and whatnot

1198
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:49,860
Obviously things are skewing more towards like the youtube and a little granular like, you know

1199
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,860
Middle-class creators who were you know individually successful. Yeah, I suppose as we just get further and further

1200
01:22:55,940 --> 01:23:01,780
It's gonna be like a generation that like they are biggest nostalgic thing. There's I don't know the Logan Paul vlogs or something

1201
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:07,460
Oh, yeah, something like that. I mean, there's so I mean so many kids so many kids watching that stuff

1202
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,260
You know, there's gonna be a whole generation of like boy. Yeah. Remember Logan Paul from when we were kids. Remember

1203
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,580
Remember Spider-Man and Elsa remember a bad man and wait

1204
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,340
Spiper man and bad man. You know what I'm talking about those guys

1205
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:22,660
Batman

1206
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,060
That's the life. Oh, I love chomkin

1207
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:29,780
Must be my favorite. I mean, I'm already like, uh, you know, remember

1208
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,740
Metal Gear awesome. Yeah

1209
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,820
It's so cool. Isn't it so cool how the internet the internet has allowed like

1210
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:42,500
Yeah, like individual creators to make stuff that made a huge impact like Homestuck. It's so great. Yeah, like

1211
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,060
So many kids like the fact that munchie like grew up in like Homestuck was his thing

1212
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:50,260
Is like, wow, it's pretty great. It's pretty amazing 10 out of 10

1213
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:55,540
Oh, what did I have what I have fucking um, and a man adult swim. I don't know

1214
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:01,540
We need to lose what you had. I had Winnie the Pooh. Yeah, I had Disney shit. I had Arthur

1215
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,260
I don't get I don't get Disney heads

1216
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,980
They're babies. I don't know. Arthur was uh hippo. I said I said in

1217
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:13,780
Oh, wait, no, this wasn't this was cut. This was cut from my script of the first poo video

1218
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:18,020
But in the first poo video originally I went on a digression like comparing poo to Arthur

1219
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,100
and how like for me

1220
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,620
Arthur was like like baby books in my like

1221
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,740
Elementary school library and I was like, oh, these are like baby books. I don't know the real shit though

1222
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:34,580
And and then but then like Arthur was a tv show and it seems like people think Arthur was pretty good

1223
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:38,900
Like people remember it pretty fondly, but it was already tainted like I was like, oh, that's a baby

1224
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:45,780
Franchise for babies. No, no, thanks. I mean, although I might have been a little old for Arthur when it came on tv

1225
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:50,420
I forget exactly. I look back on when Arthur punched EW with much fondness and

1226
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,420
blowing

1227
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,780
Remembrance

1228
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,980
Oh, yeah. All right. Next voicemail. Let's do it. This is from um

1229
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:05,140
Nyan Kwan. Nyan. That's not a real name. Get the fuck. So I'm a member of the inferior species known as the female

1230
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,420
I've never had the joy of having a big fat

1231
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,740
shlong dangle in between my legs

1232
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,300
I just want to know what's it like having a dick

1233
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,740
Like

1234
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:19,780
Why do some dicks curve to the left or to the right? Which way does your dick curve pcb boys?

1235
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,620
I want to know I want to know everything about dicks. All I know is how to put them in my fucking mouth

1236
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,900
I suck that dick all the time

1237
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:33,620
Yeah, but yeah, just I wanted all the dick facts. What's it like having a dick? Okay, bye

1238
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:39,940
Guys before anyone answers this is a trap that girl's 11 years old. Do not answer her questions

1239
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,100
Do not engage do not engage

1240
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,700
Yeah, it's pretty good. It's fine. It could be

1241
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:55,540
Uh, it's sick. It's fucking I imagine it's like easier than not having one because you have like control

1242
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,180
But it is, you know mass that is, you know, in existence control like the patriarchy

1243
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:06,820
My dick my dick has a my I'm going for I'm going for guys. You can't fucking stop me call call the cops

1244
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:11,780
My dick has a my dick has a very slight leftward. It's a very slight leftward curve. I think you're a left leaner

1245
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,260
I am I am a bit of a left leaner. Yeah, me too

1246
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:20,020
See it's funny Nate because I was thinking oh, it's because you because you jack off all the time

1247
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,660
And it's like, oh you're bending it because you're like applying all that force like

1248
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:27,780
But hey, but you're a lefty. Yeah, you're a lefty and I'm a righty, but our dicks curve the same way

1249
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:30,420
I guess it's not the jacking off that take that atheists

1250
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:35,540
All right, I I remember like like finding out like

1251
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,780
That it was starting to bend in one way. It's like, huh, is that bad?

1252
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:43,380
And I think it was just literally the way that I put my pants on

1253
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:46,740
Oh, that could do it. I mean and that's like the way it was just resting it

1254
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,820
There was I had to go one way or the other. I wouldn't like force it down like the middle path

1255
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,540
Just cut it in two. That's what you got to do

1256
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:58,740
So it just it just like naturally would be squished in one direction or the other and then that's how it grows

1257
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:03,380
Yeah, yeah, and it really doesn't matter because it it's it's a floppy thing

1258
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,540
Here that's true. That's true. You can bend it right back

1259
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:12,980
Throw it over your shoulder. Uh, you know all the good things like a continental soldier

1260
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:22,100
That's true. I've been an industrious young lady could figure it out too though

1261
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:29,300
If she yeah, I suppose you could employ a funnel perhaps or something along those funnel like like a garden hose

1262
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:34,180
Girls can pee standing up a thing. Well, yeah, but drawing while peeing, you know, that's uh, oh, yeah

1263
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,220
It's gonna take some skill some some maneuverability

1264
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,940
You'd have if you saved up a lot like you had a lot of pee you'd have to write really big like you'd have to like

1265
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,220
Take steps right and like walk. Yeah, that's the way to do it

1266
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,180
Well, you could just do it. You have to use a big font

1267
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:55,300
You have to write some like show card gothic or something. Yeah, I was gonna say try peeing and show card gothic next time

1268
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:04,020
All right, and do it in bold too. Okay. All right. Oh next another voicemail from no, thank you commence

1269
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:10,420
Hey guys, so I haven't made a voice message in a little while. I was wondering if anyone in the procrastinators

1270
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:16,580
Has has been interested in the subject of new tropics if you don't know what new tropics are

1271
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,580
It's a fancy name for mind enhancing drugs

1272
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:23,860
Not like creation or but things that will make you

1273
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:29,300
More able to concentrate or focus or reduce anxiety, you know, the the good and

1274
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:32,020
Pragmatic and utilitarian kind of drugs

1275
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,540
Yes, yes, if not why you can tend to just

1276
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:39,700
Especially the transhumanists on the podcast and starfleet

1277
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,340
future starfleet officers

1278
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,620
On the podcast why you consent to just let your brain

1279
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:50,020
Be how it was biologically made and not make any attempt to improve it

1280
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:53,860
With with any means necessary including buying

1281
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:58,580
Illicit substances off of strange chinese manufacturers on the internet

1282
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:04,420
Why what's wrong with you? Especially since most of these things are perfectly legal. I swear officer. They're perfectly legal

1283
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:08,900
So yeah, that's my question anyone have any experience with new tropics or other

1284
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:14,980
Smart drugs brain enhancing drugs and no, you know, it does not count. Did you boy? Oh my god?

1285
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,780
We did not count as a new topic. We'd makes you dumb

1286
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,820
I just kidding. I smoke weed every day

1287
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,020
I I feel like

1288
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:28,260
We we we have collectively had trouble with new topics on the podcast

1289
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,660
Yeah, we just can't come up with them. We abandon them the idea entirely

1290
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,060
You're right

1291
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,500
Well, um

1292
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:42,020
What counts? I mean does cath to something like caffeine count as a new topic? I take stuff like I take stimulants like that

1293
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,780
Yeah, maybe technically

1294
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:49,380
Caffeine's a hot topic. I I do find I do find that like I focus I mean he said like when I'm a little like

1295
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:53,220
I'm a little buzzed on on on something like caffeine. It's like I don't know

1296
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:58,420
I get I can like get like really invested in something and like, you know

1297
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:00,580
A little bit of tea

1298
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:07,940
Goes along we well the way that he clarified it as like not being mind-altering drugs or whatever. I'm just

1299
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:13,220
Confused it like I guess the criteria of it like what constitutes it because like

1300
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:19,140
Yeah, for example like lsd or whatever mdma like all those like psychedelic drugs

1301
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,860
Like yeah, I don't think that those would fit into his criteria

1302
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,780
But like I know people who've done them

1303
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:28,020
And everyone who does who who has ever done them has always like said the same thing like

1304
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:36,420
Changed their whole outlook on life from doing it once or whatever. Yeah, so I think that should count as like a mind-strengthening thing. I guess

1305
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:41,940
I could have you what he I could have used like a list of like some examples of what

1306
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:47,860
I could answer the question a lot better. I mean did he say yeah, he said Adderall was I've been on I've done Adderall a few times

1307
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:51,780
And I will definitely say that when I'm on it

1308
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:57,940
I don't know why anyone would ever not be on it because it literally makes you a better

1309
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,500
smarter person

1310
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,660
Uh like in every way. It's like it's like

1311
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,580
It's like a kaioken technique in like a pill form

1312
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,260
Like multiplies your strength times 10

1313
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,620
And

1314
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:18,740
Our uh, our I mean our dad our dad got me uh got me a little in very briefly at one point

1315
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,380
And uh, I ended up kicking a hole in a wall

1316
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,420
While under the influence of it. I don't think that made me a better or more effective person

1317
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,740
Well, I took it for like two. I took it for like two weeks. I've always

1318
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:35,140
Jesse if if if Adderall is makes you a better person

1319
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:37,540
Why don't you take it all the time because I don't know how to get it

1320
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:43,140
It's like it's like you you can't just get anything that you need everything is impossible to get your hands on

1321
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,340
Because you like have to go to a doctor and like I don't know like where do you get that shit

1322
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:53,700
All I know is that someone gave it to me once or a few times and like I don't I don't know where you fucking get that

1323
01:31:53,780 --> 01:32:01,060
Like I'm not well, okay someone surely someone someone on your local street. I'm not jumping through hoops to get anything

1324
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:07,220
I would rather be stupid and miserable and depressed than jump through any hoops to get or do anything

1325
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,660
Anything that I have to work for or put in any kind of effort at all

1326
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:15,140
That could be time better spent like wrapped up in a blanket hiding in the dark

1327
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,100
Fuck you know

1328
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,860
I you know if you're on Adderall wouldn't be saying that's also true. Yeah

1329
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:28,020
At Adderall Adderall Jesse you'd be like man. I better you know, I gotta I gotta start I gotta start branching out

1330
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:32,740
Yeah, it's time to do my fucking taxes. It's time to fucking get a real job. It's time to go back to college

1331
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,820
And I would do all of that in like in one hour. I would

1332
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:40,340
You know

1333
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:45,380
Okay on on the general subject here, I'm happy to answer why so I have the versions

1334
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:52,820
They kind of creep me out doing drugs in general and even things like surgery because they're like they're like fucking with your body

1335
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:57,540
And like okay, this guy's right that like utilitarianly whatever pragmatically

1336
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:05,060
There's nothing that says the default state of a human is like the best or correct or like will definitely go flawlessly

1337
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,100
But it's just when I when I think about messing with that

1338
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:12,020
I get nervous and like to take a step like that makes me think like, okay

1339
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:16,660
I really want to make sure what I'm doing is like, I know I'm not gonna fuck myself up or like, you know

1340
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,020
I don't know like if I take they say that like lsd

1341
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:25,620
I think they say gets embedded in your spinal cord when you take it and then like years later when you're like moving or

1342
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,620
Benning or something it can release that like

1343
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,100
Encaptured bit of lsd and you go on a trip whatever you're doing at that time

1344
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:33,940
And I know that's just one small thing

1345
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:36,500
but those are the sorts of things that I think about and

1346
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:43,940
And on the other hand, I am a pretty damn effective human being so like I don't really feel the need to

1347
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:46,580
Boost myself in those ways

1348
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:52,100
But it's it's always possible that things would just be better if I like took Adderall or any of that stuff

1349
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:57,860
But you have to weigh the risks the risks are why and I don't know the risks. So you know, that's it

1350
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:01,060
I was yeah thinking about that. It's like

1351
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:08,660
Surgery specifically if you have like um, say there's a new surgery to like to add your brain power plus one

1352
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:10,740
um

1353
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:15,700
You would get surgery when your leg's broken because you have a broken leg and that's painful and it's terrible

1354
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,940
Yeah, if you have a pretty fine leg, would you get surgery to improve your leg if it was fine?

1355
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:24,260
Probably not. So it's sort of like if you're in a really bad spot

1356
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,060
Um, and you're like, uh, I'm gonna die

1357
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:31,380
You know through suicide because I'm so depressed and I can't do anything

1358
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:36,260
Uh, and then there's this surgery to like give you a brain happiness thing

1359
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,980
Like it would be a better idea

1360
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:43,700
When you're in like the lowest point and like you're you're already broken. You may as well fix yourself

1361
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:47,140
Adding to yourself like improving something that's fine

1362
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:49,860
Yeah, it does have a risk to it

1363
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:54,740
Just generally I just yeah, I feel okay. So like I don't feel the need to

1364
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:01,540
Take drugs in general and that doesn't preclude our all our lives from just being better if we did

1365
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:05,940
Like I don't know explore some of this stuff like sam harris and first of all, I do coffee

1366
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:08,660
I mean, I you know, I drink coffee. So that's caffeine. That's a boost

1367
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:13,620
Like sam harris talks all the time about how he is like he's a smart guy. I respect his intelligence

1368
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:19,380
There's been a couple times in life where he has like done something like uh, like like mdmt or whatever it's called

1369
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,460
And he did it in like a safe environment and like what he says he got out of it

1370
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,900
Or like is like a transcendental experience, which for him was an awakening to like some of his

1371
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:33,940
He argues a lot of things that I agree with that like consciousness is an illusion. There is no self

1372
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:36,580
It's an illusion and like when he took mdmt

1373
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:43,140
I think he was saying that like he was very aware that like we are all everything in the universe is connected in the sense

1374
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:45,060
That it's all like matter

1375
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:48,740
Being operated on by the same forces in like a unified system

1376
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:52,580
Not that there's any like higher power guiding it just you know, the laws of physics or whatever

1377
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:56,740
And this also like killed his ego in the sense that he felt just like

1378
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:00,180
Part of the stardust of the universe like had no self

1379
01:36:00,740 --> 01:36:02,740
Uh had no personal identity

1380
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:07,300
That was all stuff that comes from like our you know, like our programming and our brains and whatnot

1381
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:13,780
And I I agree with that and maybe taking mdmt or something would help me to also experience these higher level

1382
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,780
Ways of thinking or maybe great make great art great music or whatever

1383
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:22,020
But I just don't feel like I need to and I worry that it would fuck something up

1384
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:26,660
So I guess that's it. That's why that's why I think about it though sometimes

1385
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:32,820
Well, my goal is to do every drug and every activity possible until I'm god

1386
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,140
So like I believe that like

1387
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,100
I don't know like the more experiences I

1388
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,860
Absorb into me the more powerful I become

1389
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:52,500
No matter what so like I just I want all knowledge inside my brain so that I can shoot lightning from my fucking eyeballs

1390
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:59,620
And stop wiping my ass once and for all with the knowledge that I've obtained

1391
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:07,620
You just you take a drug that turns your poop into little rocks and then they come out all dry

1392
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,100
That sounds good

1393
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,100
You don't have to wipe anything

1394
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:18,100
And that's how the first uh gem people were created at the beginning of steven universe

1395
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:22,100
That's what that's what some guy in some galaxy somewhere

1396
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:25,620
Just did all the drugs until he became a fucking gem

1397
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:30,100
And then like turned in it like made a body and became white diamond

1398
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:32,420
It was originally just a guy on drugs

1399
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:35,060
A lot of fucking drugs

1400
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,220
Uh

1401
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:44,500
He turned into a crack rock dude. Who's the who's the crystal meth gem? That's when you see he's out there somewhere

1402
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,460
Um, all right. Let's do another call here

1403
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:52,180
This is from oh, wait. I'm in the wrong chat. Uh, all right. Here we go. This is from um

1404
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:56,420
Kishin slayer. Oh, yeah, our old sword guy buddy. Let's see what he's got

1405
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,660
go

1406
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:01,940
I'm finally able to totally work on the swords, but I need a deadline

1407
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,660
Mage asked for something out of my current abilities

1408
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:07,940
Nate you said you need some time to think about what you wanted me to make

1409
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:12,260
Digi gave me enough to go on but never totally specified what he had in mind

1410
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,460
Davoo is silent as an overlord should be but I would still like confirmation if he doesn't want anything

1411
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:21,940
I like jesse too much. So I'll still give him a pirate sword even if he doesn't contact me

1412
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:27,220
The deadline will be when the next episode goes live at that time all requests are locked in

1413
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:30,900
With digis unless otherwise told I'll just do whatever the hell I want

1414
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:36,260
Also go play meow by bubble one games. It is literally the comfiest game that has ever been made

1415
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,580
That's good image take note

1416
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:46,580
No, no, it's gonna be completely clear. I didn't ask for anything. I back when we he first asked about us

1417
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,820
I thought we were memeing and I just I just said I just said, uh, oh no

1418
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,660
No, this is the most serious man's ever let

1419
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:58,020
He's gonna make a real fake sword. Yeah, but I don't I don't know. I feel bad for

1420
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,140
Requesting something like that. I mean, I mean this guy comes into our thing and is like hey guys

1421
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:07,220
Give me information to make you a sword, which is a little presumptuous

1422
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:09,220
But you know

1423
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:11,940
We don't owe him anything and I don't really care that much

1424
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:18,020
But you know make me a fucking vampire hundred d sword like d has in vampire hundred d. There you go

1425
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,100
You got my order. That's it

1426
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,980
I don't I don't even know what to ask

1427
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:30,340
Here's what I like I like the fucking yeah, I like I don't know what this guy's level of skill is or if it's possible

1428
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:35,460
You know what sword I fucking like I like the glass swords from morrowind the fucking

1429
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:41,700
They're like green and shiny and they're got like fucking they look cool. Make me a fucking morrowind glass sword

1430
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,500
What about rose quartz a sword?

1431
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:49,220
That's a big pink one big pink one. That's the site the site

1432
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,180
Make that for

1433
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,180
also me, I don't know I

1434
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:57,780
I guarantee that my sword is the coolest and will look the best

1435
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:03,380
Did you give him detailed specs and whatnot? I gave him a little I gave him details and I made it like a like a

1436
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:10,660
Like not ridiculously difficult so that he would you know be able to focus on making it as as good as possible

1437
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:16,340
Yeah, all right. It's I am I've been he he messages me on discord once in a while and uh

1438
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,340
Tells me like

1439
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:23,700
Man ben making this flambé as you asked for is gonna be really hard and I'm always like hey

1440
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:27,300
You remember all the remember how every time you say that I'm like

1441
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:29,860
I told you like a fun s stock is fine, too

1442
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:34,660
And he's like no no no i'm gonna do it it's gonna be a challenge and then a couple other days later

1443
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:38,500
He's like man this flam this curved blade is gonna be really hard and I'm like hey remember man

1444
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:42,900
I told you you don't have to do that. It's fine. He's like no no no it's gonna be good

1445
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:46,020
It's gonna be tell I'm buying all this extra equipment just to make it possible

1446
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,260
I'm like okay. You know whatever you want to do just remember. I said an s stock was fine

1447
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:54,740
I'm telling you right now. I don't want you to have this weird emotional leverage over me like you're doing me a big

1448
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:58,420
Fucking favor so just forget it. I don't want anything. That's that's what I have to say

1449
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:03,620
Well, you guys are stupid. He's making a sword. It's gonna be cool. I don't want to have to look at this guy anything

1450
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:05,860
I don't maybe I don't suck. I don't fucking know

1451
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,780
I don't know maybe I'll maybe I'll get it and I'll sorry

1452
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,180
I feel like I'm coming off because it was a little mean I'll still fucking keep it

1453
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:15,060
I'll still but then I'll have a sword and you won't that'll means I can kill you

1454
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:18,500
Let me just quickly say like I appreciate it

1455
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:24,020
But like you would have nowhere to send it to so don't make a sword for me though

1456
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,580
I really appreciate the sentiment problem. Are you homeless?

1457
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:31,700
No, I don't want to give out my home address and I don't have a p.o. Box. So

1458
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:37,780
You could probably have him send it to you at like a nearest post-op or maybe maybe you would need a p.o. Box for that

1459
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:42,900
Yeah, that's what p.o. Boxer for oh, you know what he could send it to me and then uh, I could just give it to you

1460
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,380
In person. Yeah, that's true

1461
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:48,900
You know what guys this is really boring. Let's talk about these details later because who cares

1462
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:54,500
I agree. Okay. Let's let's next move on to our final voicemail of the day. By the way kitchens later

1463
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:58,260
No disrespect. It's just this is another chore and I have enough chores as it is

1464
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:04,020
So there you go arrested if we carry swords around though. Oh my god. You are in britain. You are in britain

1465
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:06,580
These are not like sword swords. These are like

1466
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Yeah

1467
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:17,540
If I were on adderall right now, I could really draw this guy up some schematics of precisely what we all want

1468
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:23,140
If I was on adderall, I could forge this motherfucker myself. I could forge the buster sword single-handedly

1469
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,060
All right, let's go on

1470
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:35,540
We've got our final mail of the day and this is from Nate's body anxiety

1471
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:39,460
Um, I'm not looking forward to hearing from him. Well, let's let's go

1472
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:46,180
Run just go now. Listen. You don't have much time. You're not hot yet and you're not getting any younger

1473
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,540
Gotta get on that cardio train or the calories that kind of catch up to you

1474
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,180
You'll balloon up and then at that point, so

1475
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:55,480
You might as well just be dead

1476
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:01,080
So on that note Nate, how's the running going? I've been trying my hand at cardio, too

1477
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,160
But I just kind of feel like

1478
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,240
How are you dealing with that

1479
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:10,920
I okay, first of all, it's going like ass. I'll have you know

1480
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,520
No, I'm running after this episode as soon as this episode is done. I'm going for a run

1481
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:18,360
Okay, red. It was back on people today. I'm starting again

1482
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:24,440
I completely forgot that was a I know because I've been deliberately avoiding talking about it because I'm embarrassed because I fucking it up

1483
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,280
Uh, but

1484
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:30,040
To to your interesting point though how he has trouble doing things after he works out

1485
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:33,800
If if I go to the gym and it's like late when I get home

1486
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:37,080
And I only have like a couple hours to do anything for I have to go to sleep for work

1487
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:41,400
Then I have trouble like getting work done. Uh, and also the tiredness is also relevant

1488
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:45,320
But like if I just go for a run, I generally feel better and feel like wow

1489
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:50,600
I've accomplished something time to just jump into my next task and I usually get more done when I exercise

1490
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:56,040
So for me, there's no excuse to not exercise all the time. It's just better in every way. It's just laziness

1491
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,880
Joe Rogan calls it conquering your inner bitch to just get to the gym or get running into your thing

1492
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,840
And that's what I'm gonna do today folks. You should do the same

1493
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,400
Fucking shit. Yeah

1494
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,360
Hell yeah

1495
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:16,840
My man Joe Rogan my favorite fucking dude shit

1496
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,600
Take a fucking pee and then you'll see

1497
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:40,440
Um, I I think I think it's time to wrap it up folks right on that note. Uh, was that the last one that was the last one? Yeah

1498
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,400
Oh, thank god

1499
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,720
Yes, uh

1500
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:48,840
Um

1501
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,480
Patreon.com slash the procrastinators, uh, give us five bucks for the bonus episodes

1502
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,960
There will be a new one out by the time you hear this. Um, and uh, they're uh, uh, there's like 22 now

1503
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:04,360
I think I think that's the number at so it's worth the five bucks uh per episode so fucking do it

1504
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:08,200
You've cowered, uh, but one dollar and you're in the discord. So that's pretty fun, too

1505
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:14,840
That's a good place. Uh, anyway, uh at tpcrastinators follow us on twitter updates and shit and do the speak pipe

1507
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,680
Uh, but uh, that's it for the episode

1508
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:28,040
I'm gonna go run immediately after this and crush my body anxiety. It's gonna be great

1509
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,800
So thanks for being here to see you next week or on the bonus episodes

1510
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:36,280
Oh, oh, is this it? That's it. The end. Here we go with the end. Bye

1511
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,560
Yeah

1512
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:51,800
Right now, I'm supposed to be working right now

1513
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:54,440
But I'm not working

1514
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:57,160
I'm doing nothing

1515
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,800
My dick I'm jerking

1516
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,440
Myself, I'm sucking

1517
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,160
I am an asshole

1518
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,800
I am a stupid

1519
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,440
I've got a deadline

1520
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,160
