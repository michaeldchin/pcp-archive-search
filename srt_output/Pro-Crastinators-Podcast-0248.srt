00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
What's Happening Gamers? Welcome back to another exciting episode of the PZP. I'm your host,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,960
Cheesy Manfredo, and always with here is my lovely co-host, Tectonic Improv.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,960
I've always been here. Yes, we've always been here. Every episode. And you know who we love.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,960
That's the slogan. That's the slogan. That's the slogan.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
Wait, who's that? Oh, is that? The Pro Crastinators Podcast. We've always been

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,960
here. Is that our guest? Is that our guest? Ben Saint, the infamous Twitter man, Ben Saint.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Hey, you gotta say Ben Saint, what are you doing on my review? Ben Saint, what are you

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,960
doing in my review of Green Ninja? I just thought I heard you were talking about

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,960
the Adventure Cats movie, and I thought we could have a little, I already did a review

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,960
about this, and you're not allowed to do it anymore.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Give and take, what are you doing in my podcast? Is that Dark Cheesy Manfredo? What are you

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
doing here? I thought I killed you in the last review of the Three Ninjas.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:22,960
No, that was the Three Ninjas kickback review. Oh, man. Oh, no, it looks like I gotta do

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,960
it again. Cut to a video of me punching myself in front of a green screen. Except the other

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:38,960
you has a mime. Oh, he's a pasta clown, but his colors are inverted.

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Yeah, it's like that episode of Powerpuff Girls where the clown turns into the mime,

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,960
and it was really scary for me as a kid for some reason, and it has that cool song at

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,960
the end. That's a pretty rad song. Not to flex. Oh, yeah, go ahead. There she is. I'm

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,960
so privileged to be a part of the PCP at last. I've been wanting to get on this show for

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,960
years, so I think I'm so blessed. Give and take, what are you doing in my review? You

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,960
just like squeaked. I tried to do it a bit, but then the bit of reviewer took over and

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I was like, okay, I gotta do it later. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, and it's always yes. She

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,960
dropped for a second. I was like, oh, that's just perfect. Just perfect. Drops immediately

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:33,960
as the podcast starts. Is this the longest intro? No. Every podcast is entirely intro.

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:42,960
There's no content. Yeah, intro and then straight to voicemail. Yeah, so I'm thinking voicemails.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm thinking let's head to voicemails. We're done. Let's head up to voicemails. Alright,

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,960
first voicemail is for me, and it's this next thing I say in the entire show. It's

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,960
everything I say in the show is a voicemail that is just responding like it's pre-recorded

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,960
and it's responding to everybody as they say things. I'm not even live right now. It's

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,960
already started. Kind of the game. Remember when Martin Luther King delivered his historic

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,960
I Have a Dream voicemail? That was a great podcast. I think I've already made that joke.

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:29,960
I wish the CIA didn't cut his voicemail offshore. The CIA said this is cringe. The CIA, you

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:39,960
know, the enemy podcast of the PCP. There's a flock of geese flying by my window. I don't

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,960
know if you can hear that. Dude, open the window. Let them in. Yeah, see if they want to join

35
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,960
the podcast. Grab them by the neck and then you can eat that. Special guest, a flock of

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,960
geese. Dude, we're really scraping the bottle of the barrel. Today we have some geese as

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,960
the guest. I know people would love it. It's been years since some geese made a video.

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,960
They're basically dead. That is true. They never finished their review of Synecdoche,

39
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:17,960
New York. I want to hear the rest. Is the movie good or not? I can't tell. I couldn't

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,960
watch it, but I don't want to do that. I'd rather wait seven fucking years to hear the

41
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,960
last of the review come out. I stopped an hour in because that's as far as the geese

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,960
got with their analysis. And I really want to watch more, but I'd love to watch the

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,960
movie, but I'd hate to be spoiled on the analysis. Yeah, exactly. What if I come up

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
with an analysis that's just greased with their analysis? I don't want to do that. Yeah,

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,960
that would be so cringe. You get canceled. I want to be geese. Implying I had a different

46
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:59,960
opinion. I don't want that. Bad news. Bad news. It would be very unpogged. Speaking of reviewers.

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Are you going to review something live? Yeah, I'm going to review this dick. You guys want

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,960
to know how the instant win to get a popular tweet on Twitter. The instant life. I know

49
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,960
what it is. Tell us. In case for the audience, just shit on Doug Walker, the nostalgia critic,

50
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,960
and then just everyone agrees with you. They'll instantly retweet it. And if you do it enough

51
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,960
times, eventually some psycho is going to impersonate you and send Gorda people. It's pretty great.

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Now, cheesy, I have a question. How do we know that the imposter isn't on this podcast with

53
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:52,960
us right now? Oh, no. An among us reference. This really is a review. Do they guess that

54
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:02,960
would be there? It is a little sus. Ask me something only cheesy would know. What is the,

55
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,960
do you like big breasts? Yes. Okay. What's the ending of the villain verse? What's villain

56
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,960
verse about? It's how great capitalism is. Oh, wait, no, I mean, no, it's, oh, no. We got

57
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:30,960
them. We got them. What is Monkey Jones favorite webcomic? Is that true? It's true. It's true.

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
It's true. What's his favorite? What's his favorite webcomic? The vapor. I mean, fuck, wait,

59
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:44,960
no, never mind. You can watch one of these old videos and see the, oh, never mind. Anyway,

60
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,960
so, again, what are you going to say after I rudely interrupted you? Huh? What? What?

61
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,960
You're going to say something? No. You're going to. I had a joke, I think, but it's gone

62
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,960
now. It doesn't matter. Damn. We can pretend to laugh. Things expire. These things expire.

63
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Yep. Yep. I want to know, I want to know how much GME does everyone own right now? I'm

64
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
like so stupid because I haven't bothered to look into how to get one yet. You are so

65
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,960
stupid. All you have to do is hold. All you had to do was hold. Hold the line. Just don't

66
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,960
press the sell button. Just don't press the sell button. Just buy the dip and hold. Goddammit.

67
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:36,960
All right. Can I do it right now? How do I do that? You would need an account on something.

68
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I only have exactly one GME. A giant erect. No, you fucked up. GME. A giant massive erection.

69
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Gem is my name. Pretend I said a giant massive erection first. Someone said that.

70
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Eleazar, make my joke work. Eleazar, make a funny joke. Eleazar will make a laugh, I swear.

71
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I'm also going to buy stock stock. It's not loading. It's not loading. I'm just going to

72
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,960
say I'm pretty sure that it's too late. It's too late if you're looking to buy a game stop.

73
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,960
You might as well just, you're done. You missed the boat. It's not too late. It's not too late.

74
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,960
You could probably make a Robin Hood account right now and probably buy at least one stock

75
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:44,960
on the market. Didn't Robin Hood be the evil compromise corporation pretending to be for the people?

76
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Yes, Robin Hood is bad and they will restrict your stocks, but they are also the easiest

77
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,960
one to get to open an account on, which is why people use them. That's why it's taken

78
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Spork like five days to open a Robin Hood account.

79
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I was just going to mention Spork. It took her like five days.

80
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Yeah, it's still approving mine. Mine has been being approved for like three days now, so yeah.

81
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,960
I think you should just lie to them and tell them that you're an expert investor.

82
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I've been on Wall Street. I like some Twitter memes.

83
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah, because when I made an account they were like, what was your level of investing

84
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,960
experience and I was like, hello, and I haven't been approved. I think maybe that's it.

85
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Maybe I just had to lie to them and say, yeah, I'm a fucking pro. I do this every day. This is my job

86
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,960
and I am a hedge fund owner. I would never attempt.

87
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Yeah, you fake it so you make it. You wear a suit and then you say, yeah, I'm good.

88
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
And then you get in. That's how it works.

89
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah, RFCK is a hedge fund.

90
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Welcome aboard, sir.

91
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Yeah, I run the RFCK hedge fund.

92
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
I do. I have a hundred and I have a hundred slime coins sitting right here looking at me.

93
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
What's worth more than all the GME in the world?

94
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, please, Mr. Wall Street, please take my slime coins, please.

95
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Please, oh, please, take my slime coins.

96
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Just like GME, the thing about slime coin is you buy the dip and then you hold.

97
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,960
You hold, hold, hold forever. You never sell. That's how you get rich.

98
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:23,960
My my GME is my GME is sitting comfortably around 300, 300 and change.

99
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,960
And this this week, this week, Melvin Capital is going to have to liquidate.

100
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,960
They're going to have to start liquidating Melvin Capital.

101
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,960
It's going to be fucking epic.

102
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Just like just like still quite high.

103
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm looking at the GME.

104
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
It's it's yeah, it's pretty high still. It dipped down.

105
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
It's going. It's got one of the dips.

106
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,960
It's only going up. It's only going up. Melvin has not liquidated.

107
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
What a Melvin.

108
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm really happy to see to see all of these big hedge funds losing their marbles over over people doing what they're allowed to do.

109
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,960
There probably won't be huge ramifications for this that end up being good for us.

110
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,960
But in the meantime, the memes are very, very, very, very funny.

111
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I mean, I think I think a few like like few.

112
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I don't know what to call them companies or trusts or whatever.

113
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Somebody's gone bankrupt already.

114
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
That's that's Pog. That's pretty cool.

115
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
That is pretty Pog.

116
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I mean, they will they will if if it continues, which shows every sign of continuing.

117
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Like shorting the market was the thing like they buy a bunch of stock so that they can make profit off of it later.

118
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,960
But if the stock goes up, they now can't sell it for profit.

119
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:53,960
And so they've basically wasted so much money and they're trying to trying to wait for the people to stop making the stock rise for people to stop buying and stop holding.

120
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Yeah.

121
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
So they can't because it's costing them money in the meantime.

122
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Yeah, it's costing them money every every second they hold on to it.

123
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,960
I think there's I don't know if it's interest exactly, but that something something.

124
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,960
It becomes more expensive the longer they hold on to it to sell it later.

125
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:28,960
And since the people the longer this goes on, the more damage it will do to these wealthy people who are used to fucking with the economy to make small relatively for them small profits by destroying parts of the economy for fun for gambling.

126
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I think I'm a I'm a little optimistic about this because like, yeah, like some fucking Wall Street douchebags are going on CNN and and being like these these small investors are just trying to fuck over billionaires, you know.

127
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Nobody nobody nobody likes them.

129
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Everyone hates them.

130
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Like, you know, we fucking Ted Cruz and AOC are both like fuck these guys on Twitter.

131
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I don't think I think I think we're going to win.

132
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Like, I don't think it is like acceptable socially to like, like, I know some people like like a Warren, like Elizabeth Warren was like, this is kind of economic chaos.

133
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
We have to regulate this.

134
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
But everyone hates Warren.

135
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,960
I think it's going to I don't I think it's going to be good.

136
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,960
I don't think there's they're going to like scramble to like legislate like a little like individuals can't bet on on the on the stocks anymore.

137
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I mean, if they do that go to business, it'll be like even more obvious how fucked the the average Joe is compared to the billion.

138
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
That will be the turning point.

139
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I think that I think the ethics of the ethics of the situation are transparent or they're obvious enough that I I don't think they can afford.

140
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I don't think anyone's willing to stick stick their neck out and be like, no, I'm going to defend the hedge funds.

141
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I think I think we got it.

142
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I think we won this one.

143
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I can't wait till President Biden rolls out the new regulations where you're not allowed to bet on stock unless you own land.

144
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh, God.

145
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
That's how they get them.

146
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,960
But based well based by does it again.

147
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Sleepy Joe.

148
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
He did it again.

149
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
No.

150
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Sleepy Joe.

151
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Sleeping on my fucking Stimmy.

152
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
True.

153
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Sleeping on my Stimmy.

154
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Sleeping on my my shrink in my Stimmy.

155
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
What are you talking about, Ben?

156
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Every day.

157
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Can't.

158
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Can't wait for my fourteen hundred dollars.

159
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,960
He always said we were going to get eight hundred dollars.

160
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,960
The always we've always been at war with Oceania.

161
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Eight hundred dollars.

162
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Why would he want six hundred dollars?

163
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,960
You caught on millennials always wanting six hundred dollars from the government.

164
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,960
You should be happy that you're getting two dollars.

165
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Just two.

166
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Not two hundred.

167
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Two dollars.

168
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
You know what?

169
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Die.

170
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Just die.

171
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Six hundred cents.

172
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Fourteen hundred dollars delivered in fourteen dollar installments like per annum.

173
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Also you have to pay interest on the money that you already got.

174
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,960
So it gets less and less each time.

175
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,960
It reverse compounding interest is very complicated.

176
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Don't worry about it.

177
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,960
We did the math for you.

178
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Well, we just don't want these people spending their money on frivolous things like GameStop.

179
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Yeah.

180
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
No.

181
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
That would be unethical.

182
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,960
It would just be unethical if regular Americans were given money to invest in stock.

183
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Because then hedge funders would go out of business.

184
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
I've just learned something so incredible.

185
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,960
GameStop was founded in 1984.

186
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
Dude, this is literally 1984 right now.

187
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Holy shit.

188
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
This is it.

189
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
This is it.

190
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
This is it.

191
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Was it actually?

192
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
Yes, actually.

193
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Whoa.

194
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Whoa.

195
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Biden was born in 1984.

196
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Whoa.

197
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
What the fuck?

198
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
GameStop founded 1984.

199
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
That was Texas.

200
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Now, I'm pretty sure Ben is the only one who's ever lived on the East Coast and I don't

201
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,960
know how big this chain was, but before GameStop, I remember that there was a store called FunkoLand.

202
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
FunkoLand?

203
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Yeah.

204
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Yeah, GameStop.

205
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
There was FunkoLand.

206
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I think it became EB Games.

207
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Something like that.

208
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
I think GameStop bought them.

209
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
We had EB Games over here on the West Coast.

210
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I think FunkoLand became EB Games and then GameStop bought EB Games.

211
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Yeah, that sounds about right.

212
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah.

213
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I think West Coast had like Game Crazy or something.

214
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
Yeah, there was a couple of, ooh, yeah.

215
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I remember a handful of Game Crazies.

216
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Never heard of that.

217
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:51,960
But I've never really, even as a kid, I never liked GameStop because I liked FunkoLand and

218
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,960
where the FunkoLand was where I lived turned into a GameStop and I was like, well, when's

219
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
FunkoLand coming back?

220
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Turns out, never.

221
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
It's never coming back.

222
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Damn.

223
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I mean, they were all pretty interchangeable, I guess.

224
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
They were all stores that had video games.

225
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
I don't know why.

226
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Yeah.

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I care because I was a dumb kid, so.

228
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
But Tec, good new bad.

229
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,960
But Tec, FunkoLand did come back with the amount of FunkoPops they sell at GameStop now.

230
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Might as well call it FunkoLand.

231
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
That's true.

232
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Although, it was spelled fun C-O, not fun K-O.

233
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
C-O-O.

234
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
I guess you gotta appeal to millennials by spelling things wrong.

235
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Don't correct my English.

236
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I do not respect his language.

237
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
No one does.

238
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,960
Okay, my GameStop story is that when I traded in my NES to, I think, get some extra money

239
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
to buy, I think a PlayStation 2 maybe?

240
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,960
I traded in my NES and they paid me absolute dog shit.

241
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Yes.

242
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,960
And they gave me $8 for an original copy of Kid Icarus, which is a kind of rare cartridge.

243
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Yeah, that's a pretty crazy game, especially now.

244
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I think it's probably around $40, $50 or something for Kid Icarus.

245
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Damn, you know how much you do it?

246
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
That sounds...

247
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I mean, it's not an impossible to find thing, but it's not a super common cartridge.

248
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
And they paid me...

249
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I think they paid me like cents.

250
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,960
They paid me like cents for my other cartridges and they gave me $8.

251
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,960
I think I probably made like $30 or $40 trading in my whole NES collection and the console.

252
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,960
And it was good and it was in working condition.

253
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I shouldn't have done it.

254
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
What a fucking mistake.

255
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Yeah, I think everyone has a story like that.

256
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,960
You know how much doge coins you get with an original Kid Icarus?

257
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
How much is a doge coin?

258
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
It's like a cent now or something?

259
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,960
No, it's at about 2.5, I think.

260
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I got a complaint about this.

261
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
When doge coin was blowing up, when doge coin was blowing up, it was around like 3 or 4

262
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,960
and I was like, fuck it, it's going to the moon, I'm buying in.

263
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Tom was buying and I was sold.

264
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
So I went and I just tried to find out how to do it and I couldn't do it.

265
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I couldn't get any wallets to install.

266
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,960
You know, I couldn't get an account approved in time on...

267
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Oh god, wait, it's going to the moon again.

268
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
It's going to the moon again.

269
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Is it up to 4?

270
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh my god.

271
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
It's up to 4 cents.

272
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
It's up to 4 cents.

273
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Holy shit.

274
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
This is just today.

275
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
This is just today.

276
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I gotta say, I'm shocked doge coin didn't explode when the doge meme came back.

277
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I assumed that doge coin would have exploded in price when that dog started being funny again.

278
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:53,960
But I guess it turns out all you really needed to do was have the entire internet start paying attention to stocks and hedge funds.

279
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,960
And then doge coin will be worth 2 cents.

280
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,960
People are talking about investing and then people don't know what it means and they're like,

281
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,960
hey, this is a funny meme about investing.

282
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
What's a meme thing you can invest in?

283
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Hey, remember doge coin?

284
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Let's do that.

285
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
And then they did.

286
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Doge coin didn't have anything to do with shorting the hedge funds or anything.

287
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
It was just like, let's invest in something and doge coin is funny.

288
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
Yeah.

289
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Well, high tide raises all ships.

290
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Crypto and GameStop are just stocks.

291
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
They kind of just go hand in hand.

292
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Chances are, if you're trading stocks, you know a thing or two about Bitcoin and its affiliates.

293
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,960
But anyway, as doge coin was passing around 4, I could not figure out how to invest.

294
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
And then it ended up rising up to like 8.

295
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
And I just watched it.

296
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
And I was just watching it like, well, I missed it.

297
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I missed the rocket.

298
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
They made me watch.

299
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
They did it in front of me.

300
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
They made me watch.

301
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
It's all happening.

302
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Are you going to be watching too much again, Ben?

303
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Is this going to be the same as the Bitcoin?

304
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Is this the new key?

305
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Probably not that bad.

306
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Probably not that bad because I was way over-invested in Bitcoin.

307
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I had like a large fraction of my entire net value invested in Bitcoin for a minute there,

308
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,960
which is like a terrible, terrible idea.

309
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm not as, I'm only have like a piece.

310
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm considering everything that I've put into GME now to be gone.

311
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Which is the right way to do it for this specific holding.

312
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
Like with a healthy mindset.

313
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Yeah.

314
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Investing in Bitcoin.

315
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Why don't you invest in some bitches?

316
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Well, with the way Bitcoin's going, maybe I won't have to.

317
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Wait, how is Bitcoin doing?

318
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Bitcoin is, okay.

319
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Bitcoin had a shitty like little meme jump there because Elon put Bitcoin in his bio

320
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
and it like jumped up a bit.

321
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
That's all it takes.

322
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Bitcoin had almost back to 40 but not quite and now it's back down to like 33.

323
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
So, fuck you Elon.

324
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I honestly, after GME, after GME is dead, I am seriously considering like shorting Tesla

325
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,960
because like Tesla has seen like, Tesla is a shitty meme company that doesn't actually do anything.

326
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
You talking about that?

327
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
This fucking clown is in charge of it.

328
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Who survives entirely off of like, you know, the fact that stupid red editors think that he's cool.

329
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,960
His stock is predicted not to do well and I just think it would be fun to profit off of Elon Musk's loss.

330
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
So, I'm probably going to do that.

331
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't care much for Elon Musk at all but isn't Tesla the car manufacturing thing okay?

332
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Yes.

333
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Tesla's seen among other things.

334
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,960
I mean, with regards to having like bunches of powering stations and stuff.

335
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,960
I know the cars are like premium like expensive annoying things but like, electric cars are pretty cool.

336
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,960
I guess electric cars have already existed for a while.

337
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,960
My thoughts about that, okay but Tesla's are only for rich people right?

338
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Basically.

339
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
They're not like, yeah so fuck them.

340
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
That's not a solution.

341
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,960
I think the idea is that eventually they will become the standard but you know, you got to start somewhere.

342
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Electric cars are kind of iffy.

343
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Because you could kind of like, I heard that you could make the argument if there was better public transportation.

344
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
There wouldn't really be a need for electric cars.

345
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I mean, if you move everything towards electric cars, you're going to have to get rid of all the old cars.

346
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Which is like even more waste, you know.

347
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I'm absolutely on the like build more trains.

348
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Oh god.

349
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Yeah, fuck Tesla.

350
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Fuck Tesla, fuck Elon and the hyperloop.

351
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Whatever the fuck that is.

352
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
The hyperloop is completely stupid.

353
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
Yeah.

354
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:00,960
I hate this whole fucking myth perpetrated by Elon about like, oh yeah, I slept in my fucking car when I invested in PayPal.

355
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
You know, because I was betting on it.

356
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I thought like bro, no you didn't.

357
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
He did not sleep in no fucking car.

358
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
No you fucking didn't.

359
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
You fucking liar.

360
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,960
You know, he walked around, he literally walked around with emeralds in his pockets for game college.

361
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Thanks dad.

362
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
That's a quote.

363
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Yeah, yeah.

364
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Yeah, emeralds.

365
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Because he inherited fortune from an apartheid.

366
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Whenever he's like struggling on a test, he just, he just poems the chaos emeralds in his pocket and he's like, let's go.

367
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
And then Live and Learn starts playing as his hair goes super and then he gets a 74.

368
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
Yeah, he eats.

369
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
That's what happens.

370
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
This is why Bitcoin exploded.

371
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,960
This is why Bitcoin happened because he fucking chaos controlled the price of it.

372
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
It's very vague in the games.

373
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,960
I guess it can raise cryptocurrency.

374
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,960
That's what the chaos, chaos control literally just lets you like make your god mode wishes into reality, right?

375
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Like, isn't that what they're said to do?

376
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,960
It just like stops time or like lets you teleport.

377
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,960
It's really vague and weird.

378
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
It just is.

379
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
That's what it does.

380
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I thought it does be cool.

381
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I thought that their canonical power was that like chaos control just lets you like make your, basically make your wishes come true.

382
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,960
And just, I guess that implies that Sonic's wish is to be yellow and be really fast.

383
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,960
He saw Dragon Ball Z and he thought that's really fucking rad.

384
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
I think I'll do that.

385
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Yeah.

386
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Yo, that's way past cool.

387
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,960
In my fan fiction, they use chaos control to like abort like the anti-Christ.

388
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
I'm gonna have to stop you right there.

389
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Okay.

390
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Okay.

391
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Gotcha.

392
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Yes.

393
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Then what happens?

394
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Then after that, Sonic's like, well, we gotta go save Popeye so they go back in time.

395
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,960
But Popeye's has already been corrupted by Megatron's mind control.

396
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Popeye the character of Popeye the rest of them.

397
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Popeye the savior, yeah.

398
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
He's very crucial.

399
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,960
You see, he has like the genetic sequence to activate the Eva, which is going to be important in like arc five.

400
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
But I don't want to tell you too much about that.

401
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Yeah, sure.

402
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Oh, naturally.

403
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Dude, I'd love to see Popeye beat the shit out of Shinji.

404
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Dude, you're getting in that robot.

405
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

406
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,960
I think Popeye should just be relevant again in general.

407
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,960
I guess he's just getting out of the Eva and just trying to beat the age of the fist.

408
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Yeah, he'd take a bunch of spinach and like, no, he'd get like a shipment container filled with spinach.

409
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,960
And while piloting the Eva, he would eat that container and all the spinach would go in and it wouldn't work.

410
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
And he would be like, what's going on?

411
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
And then he would just do it himself.

412
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Shinji, Shinji, Shinji watching Popeye on a stretcher covered in bandages like every time you won't pilot the Eva.

413
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
Popeye has to do it again.

414
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Popeye has to pilot the Eva.

415
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Oh, you ever seen those, there's like a, there was a clip flowing around where like Popeye's like in a fight.

416
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
It's from one of the old cartoons.

417
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,960
And even when he's getting his ass kicked, he's still like talking shit.

418
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
I imagine like the Eva has a pen.

419
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,960
I've watched some of the old Popeye's and he really just sort of mumbles like,

420
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,960
he's really like mumbly and like talking, like there's no lip syncing sometimes.

421
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,960
It's just sort of like the voice actor is just saying all of these things and there's sort of accent and then there's punch sound effects.

422
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,960
I really actually love Popeye.

423
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,540
The voice direction was just a go fucking ape shit. Just say whatever the fuck you want. We'll figure it out later

424
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,980
Popeye is insane, dude. We haven't really like

425
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,220
solidified the Popeye characters. Let's do whatever the fuck you want

426
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,860
Animation used to be good and then they invented anime. Popeye is Fleischer right? Yeah, down hill

427
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
Did you say Popeye is his red build?

428
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:13,740
Well, yes, but a spinach build really. He's a Fleischer cartoon, right? Like Betty Boop and stuff

429
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,360
Yes, well, I don't know. I don't know names, but he's from that era. Yeah

430
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,000
He started in that era. I'm sure I want Popeyes to show up in one piece

431
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,200
I think it would make sense. Would he be a long-armed tribe?

432
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,180
Remember, that's the only... Franky is already kind of Popeye. He would just be like a regular human who's just that strong like a garb

433
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,580
Yeah, that makes sense. He just has weird arms, but he's not a long-armed tribe. Yeah, some of these motherfuckers just have weird things

434
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,580
He's the thick-armed tribe

435
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,420
It's a new one. Yeah, I like that. I could imagine it in my head

436
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,460
Like that they were outside like a like a like a sailor bar and then Luffy is fucking

437
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,220
Crash through the wall because he got thrown out and then and then like smoke is coming out of the the bar

438
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:09,300
The giant hole that Luffy just made and we see the silhouette of Popeyes, and he's all like your garb's kid, aren't you?

439
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
He's a marine

440
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:21,940
What if he had like a like a piston double fruit which turns is like his his fists into like pistons like big O

441
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Yeah

442
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,900
That'd be cool. Oh my god. Yeah, Oda, get on that. Can we get Popeye in here?

443
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:36,300
Please definitely like Popeye. I feel like there's no way he would have been inspired by him for sure

444
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:41,580
There should be a crossover movie. I could see them doing that. I like that Lupin movie they made last year

445
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,140
Luffy versus Popeye. Yeah, Popeye. Are we talking about Luffy? Whoever wins, we lose

446
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,660
Please stop defending pedophiles for one second. I mean Popeye would be a marine, right?

447
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,540
Yeah, no way. He's he definitely be like a

448
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,140
Not not an admiral, but he'd be like a what's Garth's vice admiral vice admiral. Yeah, he definitely be a vice admiral

449
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,740
True. It's cheesy. I'm surprised there isn't already a Popeye

450
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,380
I mean some some characters have big Popeye arms though. True. Yeah. Yeah

451
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,780
This the set the setting was mostly inspired by Popeye. I'm sure

452
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,260
Cheesy. What were you saying about defending pedophiles?

453
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Is that like an actual news thing or?

454
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,940
It might have been like a year or two ago, but um, it was like it was a couple of things

455
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,820
First it was like, you know, you know, the you know the man get the anime at orico

456
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,340
Is that the cook the cooking one? Yes, like, uh, yeah

457
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Yeah, so that guy turned out to be a pedo

458
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,780
And

459
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,980
Cuz they were friends and then the Roni Kenshin guy turned out to be a pedo and

460
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,380
Oh, they're not just out of but like all of shown in Jeff defended that guy and it was like very like

461
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:12,500
Man, I know I don't things are different in Japan, but it's an incredibly bad optics. Yeah, it's not it's not the same country

462
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,740
That's for sure. I did it. I I think the Roni Kenshin guy had like

463
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,740
Way more like they couldn't even collect all the child point he had cuz he had just so much of it. Yeah

464
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
Geez Louise

465
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,380
Like like terabytes like the real

466
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,900
I

467
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:39,140
Think it was like I think it was 2.75 terabytes. We can actually go hang on. Let's be a little more specific here. Uh,

468
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Yes

469
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Well, that sucks

470
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,020
I got a parrot everything yo-ho-ho

471
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,220
You know, you know when you hear like something like Tezuka may have said something racist in the past

472
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,180
You're like, okay. Um, that was that was in the past

473
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,220
But it was cool back in the past and it's like everyone was a bit more racist than they are today back then

474
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,500
But you can't it doesn't matter how far back you go or how old you are pedophilia is like terrible

475
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,820
It's always been well, unless you go like to the middle ages or something

476
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,700
I mean, you say you say that and yet like people were fucking marrying 13 year olds like all over the fucking place

477
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,220
So it's not like people were when I pedophilia. She was mature for her age. I swear

478
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,820
I know that I did that I didn't mean like all over the like throughout time. I mean like

479
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,140
People that you could even feasibly know of like ancient historical figures. It's like

480
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,580
Whatever like we we know the world was fucked in many ways back then

481
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:54,380
It's hard to like judge them by today's standards, but people who are like, I don't know maybe 50 60 years

482
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,260
You know

483
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,860
black and black and white

484
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,380
photograph people

485
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Show me the show me the

486
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,460
Show me the commandments that says thou shalt not sleep with children. Come on

487
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:15,340
Yeah, I'm drawn up blank here. Well, good thing. I'm not a christian. Otherwise, who knows what I'm thinking with you. Yeah, it's like

488
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,460
Yeah, it's incredibly sucks. Um

489
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,820
I don't think like

490
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,100
didn't Tezuka like beat his wife. Wasn't that the big thing?

491
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,060
I I remember just hearing about like

492
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,900
I was it kimba and some other things where he's like drawn blackface and

493
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,220
a lot of weird

494
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
bit of like, um, you know

495
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,780
Not not

496
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,980
Yeah, racist. I think he apologized for those depictions and kimba like years later

497
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,140
But yeah, well, you know, he still did it

498
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,580
they um

499
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,700
They still continue like even up until like the 90s. They were doing things they were drawing a lot of like

500
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
You look at like early dragon ball

501
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,860
You still find like little traces of people. Yeah, I mean, I mean there's like mr. Black from the red ribbon army

502
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,220
Who they yeah like a samba character. They they just they didn't have as much of a

503
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,900
understanding because there's so few black people even in that part of the world

504
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Much less in japan itself

505
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:23,100
So they would like they were sort of divorced from the idea of of like race problems

506
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,260
Like of like what what are the what is the black people in the audience going to feel about this?

507
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,340
You know, like they won't because like none of them are reading that. Um, yeah hot take

508
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
They just they aren't here. Take uh japan

509
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,220
Probably ain't that good

510
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,860
Probably ain't that good in place. I'll say bro. Take there you go. Yeah, you know a hot take. We need another nuke

511
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,460
Bro, no, bro. No, they made nintendo games over there

512
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
There's gotta be another wife

513
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,860
But we'll give them we'll give them like one more nintendo direct and then

514
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,100
That's that's the squeeze. There's never gonna be another nintendo direct

515
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,700
The duke didn't fucking do anything

516
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,420
The dude two nukes didn't fucking work. No, no, no, it's good because they made godzilla and that's cool

517
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,540
Okay, you know what never mind japan good actually japan great place best place in the world can't beat it. Um

518
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,700
What's that one shit that white national's love to say homo erectus

519
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,500
After those days, it's basically an afternoose day 10 out of 10. We love it. Wait

520
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,580
Well, the thing that the thing that white nation's like to say homo love

521
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,780
They love homosexuals

522
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,820
That they're white national is the love white people so much. They'll fuck any white person amander the gender

523
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:43,180
Um, just like just like trump said, uh those years after he got the covet

524
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,060
Oh, you know the last guy the last of us who?

525
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Um pre-biden

526
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,100
Oh post post obama pre-biden

527
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,340
Uh, you mean the dark. Oh, yeah, there was like this guy. Um

528
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
I like to call him dark obama

529
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,740
You remember dark obama

530
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,500
He was he was that orange. He was the orange

531
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,740
In was in japanese languages. He's known as black obama. They had to change it in the western audiences

532
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,980
It was that was such a weirdest chapter in baki the grappler. I don't even know why

533
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,420
There's like a five page summary of baki monogatari about that. It's really strange. It's just like I didn't see that

534
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
I didn't watch that digi video

535
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,460
This is this is the most sus pcp episode in a long time

536
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:48,940
I cannot wait to see pcp episode. I cannot wait to see the pcp guy doing the sus face. It's gonna be so good

537
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,220
Oh my god, there's a sus face. Yeah, you know like the germa one. You not know about the sus face

538
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,620
Where he looks like um, he looks like apex twin on that one album cover that I was just about to say apex

539
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,580
Oh god what back in my day sus was just sauce. It was youtube poop and it was funny

540
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
What could you do I could suck he could suck

541
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,620
Yep, there he is unedited. Yeah

542
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,460
Oh my god, there was this fucking germa video I watched real face

543
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,260
I watched the other day of like his the thing stream and someone like he made like this

544
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,780
This wacky face and then someone in the chat posted a slightly edited version of that face

545
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:45,100
And he had a nervous like borderline nervous breakdown over whether or not it was real. It was super fucking funny. Oh my god

546
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Oh that that happened so often

547
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,540
He's he was always looking at his like. Oh god. I'm so fucked up

548
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,980
In in he has like a stream like awards of like

549
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,860
The viewers vote on like at the end of the year on like a bunch of things related to germa streams

550
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Like best joke worst joke

551
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,140
um

552
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,780
And then there's like things like worst noise where germa just does a plays a game and he's like

553
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,180
And he's like that's one of the candidates for worst noise of the year

554
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,780
and

555
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,020
It's it's it's really funny. He has things like

556
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,100
like

557
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
Like this like like people

558
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
there's a there's like a

559
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,940
What do you call it a not a community like a culture of people taking

560
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,420
Images from germa when he's got face cam on and then fucking with them and then sending them to him and he puts them on screen

561
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,220
And he's and he's like crying. It's like no

562
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,060
Crying or laughing like it's just it's just really funny and it's just like a fun back and forth

563
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,340
And sometimes it results in actually scary images like this

564
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,700
German is such like a he's a genuinely great showman. He's probably like

565
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Like the best one of the best

566
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,460
Uh, I yeah, I would I would create is

567
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,700
like

568
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,220
Entertainers online

569
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,580
I'd say

570
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,660
He he's a good. He's a great. Um, yeah showman is is the right word

571
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,260
It's not fair to just say he plays video games on stream. He's yeah

572
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,700
Like you don't you don't do a live action twitch integrated carnival and not be carnival

573
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,420
Oh, yeah, did you have you not heard of that that there was I don't know

574
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,780
I I only I literally only know of germa at all like from you Gibb for the most part

575
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:39,740
Well, there was this one stream pre-covid. So 2019 2018. Yeah, a few years ago now and he had

576
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,220
Put funds together and he made a stream live stream

577
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,820
With a bunch of people who made robots that can be activated by twitch

578
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,900
Like integrated like button prompts like everybody says up left right and the robot will move

579
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,500
And with this concept like twitch plays with this concept

580
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,580
He was like like twitch plays pokemon kind of yeah, twitch plays pokemon

581
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,260
But twitch plays a physical robot with like a throwing hand or like a something and he creates

582
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,220
He made a carnival in a field

583
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,580
Where like chat plays like toss the ring or like throw the ball

584
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
And he does he did

585
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,100
My favorite one. I think was the dunk tank where he's sitting in a dunk tank

586
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,620
And chat has to try and shoot the ball at the target to get him in the water

587
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,140
And it's like it's that's is it a ball or was it a frog like a little

588
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,180
One of the carnival games was complicated. It's it was so complicated. It's like a whole team of people behind it

589
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,620
And sounds awesome. It's it's such a fun like

590
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,860
Stupid thing

591
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,180
And it's just great. I just like

592
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,460
No one else would even bother to do something like this. That's insane. I never I've never heard of such a thing

593
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:59,420
I think the cherry on top for this whole carnival thing is that like the day he did it. It was so windy and shitty out

594
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,940
It's like it's like the chef's kiss to it all. Yeah, germa has this

595
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,620
Uh this air about him when he's like

596
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,580
Performing where he he likes drawing attention to like things going wrong

597
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,500
and like

598
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,940
You know playing that up like he doesn't actually like it to be super clean. He likes it to be like

599
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,940
Hit him to be the butt of the joke if it looks like shit, then it's funny because he's like

600
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,780
Putting on a shit performance

601
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,940
But everyone loves it because he's trying so hard to make it like an interesting. Yeah, there's like a clear effort there

602
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,700
So like everyone knows he's putting in a lot a lot of effort and when it goes wrong

603
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,940
He you know, he draws attention to it and it's all

604
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,620
Everyone feels like they're part of like the experience and now that carnival is like the

605
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,740
In recent memory at least like the biggest one of the you know, the most germa 985 thing that has happened

606
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,300
Yeah, probably the best thing since the live action germa rumble. Oh, yeah

607
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,780
The live action germa rumble is like, you know the the uh the radcon roll rumble

608
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,780
I was gonna ask was that the inspiration? Yeah, germa germa had done

609
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,580
Royal rumbles with the same sort of wrestling makes shitty characters in his videos

610
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,860
He makes the rumble and like he commentates it like a an actual like a

611
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,500
WWE commentator

612
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,460
Yeah, and he's he's doing all this stuff and he does bits and then one day he made on his main channel

613
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,180
um a live action version of the rumble where a bunch of his friends

614
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,500
And him get into an actual wrestling ring and beat the shit out of each other

615
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,140
You know like a scripted sort of wrestling rumble thing

616
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,220
With like the shitty character people dress up as his stupid video game

617
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940
joke characters

618
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,580
That was he has he has so like such dumb characters like like the egg

619
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,900
Is one it's just like a guy in all like white makeup

620
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,700
He's just an egg. He was just a dumb character from like one of his first ever videos and now he's just immortalized

621
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,460
Or like glue man glue man or like martin van pieren made of glue

622
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,860
And I think has this elaborate like basketball backstory. Oh, yeah, I forget where that comes from

623
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,820
I know it's on the wiki

624
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
It he just did like some like

625
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,620
NBA

626
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
like 2k video and

627
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,900
And made like this video like this basketball star called Gabe the glue man del glossy

628
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,060
And then like he fell into a vat of glue and became glue man. I don't know it's

629
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:43,420
There's there's it's so like stupid, but it but there's it's it's dumb, but it's also high effort

630
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,460
Yeah, it's perfect and like there's a lot a lot to learn

631
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,180
There's a lot to love a lot of lore here a lot to love. Yeah, exactly give

632
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Uh, you obviously, you know germa

633
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,420
So you like watch the you watch you watch like a lot of like the tf2 like commentary stuff, right?

634
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
So you've seen star. Yes

635
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,180
Very have you seen the new video he did about I did basically

636
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,380
It was basically like hey guys. Sorry. I haven't uploaded in a while video, but it was actually like pretty sad

637
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,900
It was a bit sad star is a tf2

638
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:24,380
Tuber and he and germa did a lot of collaborative videos back in the day when both of them were tf tubers

639
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,380
um

640
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,860
And uh, and also like just playing games together in general and they were really like great comedy duo, but star

641
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,940
yeah, was

642
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
much more known for his like

643
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:42,460
Impressive tf2 ability and germa was more like a comedy goof and they sort of yeah

644
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
You know, they went there

645
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,540
Different ways and star when overwatch came out. He went to overwatch

646
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,620
He was yeah, he was all in he was thinking this was going to be the next big

647
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,660
Um competitive thing. He really wanted to try out that for that because he's always been like very

648
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,380
Like good at shooting games and he likes playing competitively

649
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,420
um, and his fan base that he'd grown

650
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,860
Uh, just wanted him to play tf2 forever and he just his recent video was him

651
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,500
like

652
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,820
like revealing how

653
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:23,660
Soul crushing it is to have a fan base that is extremely abusive towards him for not playing a specific game that he doesn't want to play anymore

654
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,820
and it was just him

655
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,660
kind of like raw

656
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,580
like like saying

657
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
i'm not gonna do it and

658
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,780
you

659
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,380
What this has caused like in my life as depression and and anxiety and feeling bad

660
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,260
He just went into everything that is that is like

661
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,900
I you know, you hear it the story a lot of times with youtubers being

662
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,900
Feeling trapped. Yeah by their audience and uh, yeah

663
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,300
That's a big one

664
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,180
Because star had not uploaded in a long time. He'd gone straight. He'd been on twitch doing

665
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,700
His own thing for like years now

666
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,220
And his his fans were like

667
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,660
Come back tf2. Just keep playing the same game. Just keep doing what I want

668
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,220
Reliving the the glory days from

669
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
I don't know when they were nostalgic

670
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,900
Show us more tricks like the the window and dust bowl

671
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,900

672
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,980
This is this is me. This is me with krug smash when krug smash does uh when krug smash does uh a short for it

673
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,420

00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,580
nah

677
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,620
It's pretty much when he plays them when he plays a d a door fortress mod

678
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,060
I say no base game only vanilla only tile sets. Fuck you ascii only shithead

679
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,500
This is me. That's I'm in so I get it. You know, I relate. Fuck that guy who won't play tf2

680
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,860
Yo, that's me when like ben say is making gummy worms. I'm like no no gummy worms

681
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:12,220
Give us the vapors the champions. I want the champions. Give me more biscapades. I need the vapor stop

682
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,020
No more gummy worms. I can't read gummy worms never make it for real. I'll never make another gummy again

683
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,780
I can't get the imo

684
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,500
I used to I used to have contempt for biscapades because ben was doing it while he was

685
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,780
Holding off on making vapors three and I wanted vapors three

686
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,900
Wow finally glad I finally got that off my chest

687
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,220
It feels good and then vapors three came out and you were like boy. He should have done

688
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,940
It's like oh jeez, man

689
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,940
Showed you, huh?

690
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,100
Grass is always greener. That's what I learned

691
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,820
I've been um

692
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,740
this uh, I uh

693
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,540
I stopped working on my normal stuff first because I wanted to do the uh

694
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,140
It took me a few days to edit the the the oolily a book reading. Is that the secret project? Uh, and then the

695
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,380
That is not the secret project. I was I was working on it. No

696
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,900
That was like a thing I decided to do kind of randomly and was like

697
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,100
I should just bang this out while I still have enthusiasm for the idea

698
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,980
I can uh

699
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,420
Relate to that. Yeah, and then um, and then um, uh

700
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:30,060
Oh, yeah, and then I like as soon like the day I published that the stock market shit started happening

701
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,940
And I've been occupied. I was occupied with that for the rest of the week

702
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,300
Curious, so this week it's back to the secret prod this week. It's back to the secret prod. Oh

703
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:42,300
The day. Yeah the day that uh, ben saint reads uh,

704
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,860
Legend of ten elemental masters game stop goes to the moon and dogecoin explodes. Hmm

705
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,100
Correlation does equal causation

706
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,420
Ben saint

707
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,500
Ben saint stein. Hey, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait a second there

708
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,860
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm secret project more like

709
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,060
Secret project secret cabal

710
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:15,420
That's the secret is the secret project is the secret project terrorizing some children to extract their adrena

711
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,820
Perhaps I don't know

712
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,660
Fucking laser your jewish laser to start forest fires in california

713
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,660
Jewish moon laser

714
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,700
Ben couldn't keep the weight off with kita. So he's going to try he's going to try adrena. So it takes it out of the kids

715
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,620
Yeah, he's got to take the kito out of the kids. Wait, is the jewish space laser

716
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,500
Was the jewish space laser on the moon or was it just like on a satellite in space?

717
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:43,180
Because I remember that the idea guys terrorized chris chan with a moon specifically a moon laser

718
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:49,180
Was going to destroy quick fill. So I uh, you know, I think it must be it has to be the same laser

719
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:56,220
Is it maybe it's the space colony? No different laser. I don't know what the idea guys came up with but recently

720
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,940
Uh, there was a story about a congresswoman insane lady q and on marjorie taylor marjorie marjorie

721
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,740
Yeah, that's what I was referring to yeah, um who who thinks that um the fires in california that bush the big fires that

722
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,940
Swept all over the place were started by big funded space lasers

723
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,180
um

724
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,780
Um, and she heavily implies that without actually saying like hmm

725
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,500
I mean, you know, it's it's interesting that it was like these jewish companies that just fun

726
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Like it's all like really stupid

727
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,580
I mean, I've seen old footage of her like talking about how she just is a q-believer

728
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,820
Yeah, like so. Yeah, of course

729
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,780
Of course you would think that there's an i'm a q-believer

730
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,740
A cute q-believer more like a q-t am i right?

731
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,700
A q-t

732
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
Not if I go into fight that bitch, um

733
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,580
She's she's you know what you know what?

734
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,220
Ah, what would we do without uh, what would we do without uh, you know once you get to know her it would be undemocratic to not

735
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:06,860
It would be undemocratic to not have some q representation in our in our houses of congress. Yeah, motherfuckers still be q

736
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,380
Wasn't didn't the date pass where like they were gonna gun down the democrats

737
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,500
Dude, when when people say I don't think she's I don't think she is publicly pro q anymore

738
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:24,300
But she was for a long time like before like before she was elected when people like say a date that something bad is gonna happen

739
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:31,420
And they you know rally around that date as soon as the date passes they just say oh, well it'll happen eventually

740
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,820
Here's a new date like that. It's always how they think it's it's either

741
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,860
They either reinterpret the date or I mean in the case of q the answer is like

742
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,420
Oh, the thing didn't happen on the date that it like the the mass arrested and take place

743
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,780
They're supposed to shit that just means the jewish cabal and the deep state are even more powerful than they thought

744
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,180
They're even more of a threat and they were able to prevent it

745
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,860
Like it literally just strengthens their results. Yeah, just trust the plan and it's in the slogan

746
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
To never to never stop. Yeah

747
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,340
To never like you trust the plan until it doesn't happen and then fucking trust the plan until it doesn't work and then

748
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,940
Form a private militia and take matters into your own hands

749
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:17,740
It's so annoying because if imagine like whoever was behind the q posts

750
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,620
originally if they came out

751
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,740
In in the way that they release information and they said sorry guys q has been a fake joke this whole time

752
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,220
It's not actually real. I I've been lying to you nobody wouldn't then believe

753
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,900
That post they would believe what they heard before

754
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,740
Oh, yeah, that's that it was all real, but as soon as the person comes clean

755
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,180
They won't believe it because now they're into this stupid idea

756
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,180
They're too far on honestly. Okay. I I don't

757
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:53,900
Understand the q business model like what exactly does q get out of being q?

758
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,540
Uh, maybe it's maybe it's cool

759
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,500
I don't know. That's that's one. That's a lot of it's cool. That's a lot of deep state questions. You're asking there ben

760
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,300
Yeah, hmm curious. I mean, it's it's I mean are they make I mean are they making money off it somehow?

761
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,820
I don't know. I feel like I never really thought about it, but I could imagine that the person who is q

762
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,380
Well, whoever they are I am Spartacus

763
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,820
Or even if it's one multiple people it could just be

764
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,260
They are as insane as the people who follow them and just I actually believe it

765
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:31,500
No, I don't think so. I don't think I don't think so because it's like some fucking palm reader shit

766
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,820
Like all the q drops are are cryptic to the point

767
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,660
They're like deliberately cryptic to the point that anyone could read whatever they want into them

768
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:44,940
It's it feels like it's like oh someone posted in a in a discord the other day a link to uh a

769
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,780
article by a game designer about how q is basically

770
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,300
It's basically an arg designed without any of like the safeguards that are meant to like

771
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,820
Prevent it from like new dead drop too far. It's at the capital like

772
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,700
Yeah, or like when you're building an arg

773
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:06,940
You have to you have to design it in such a way that like someone who stumbles upon it

774
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,900
Like won't think it's real like if the arg is a murder mystery

775
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,500
You have to make it so that people won't think that like an actual murder

776
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,260
Happened, uh, if they find a divorce from context and q is like an arg without I think that was a joke

777
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:24,220
That was a joke on trap on chapel trap house where it's like it's an arg for boomers

778
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,140
Yeah, I mean it kind of is yeah this article explained like here's all the same ways in which you know it engages people

779
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,580
You know, there's like the community aspect of that

780
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,300
It's like they give you clues and then everyone is meant to like work

781
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,820
Collectively on like deciphering what it means and the right answer to whatever a q drop means is just whatever the community

782
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,900
Collectively decides is like the most popular or most compelling interpretation

783
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,860
Literally the right answer is just whatever everyone likes the most and that's and that's what that becomes the truth

784
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,220
It's funny. That is kind of there's this podcast. I watch or listen to rather

785
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:06,620
It's uh, they're called the the argonauts and they they like every couple of weeks like talk about like an arg

786
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,620
Or whatever and just kind of like dissect it and how what like happened

787
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,940
During the course of it and it's really it's really cool. It's a really cool idea for a podcast

788
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:21,900
Yeah, that sounds interesting. Yeah, that's really all I had to say. I just I like them. Oh, I thought you were gonna

789
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,820
I thought I thought you were gonna make a point. The point is that that's cool. I always want

790
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,860
I always wanted to make an arg

791
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:34,780
Um, but now I'm old and it's COVID times. So you can't really do a lot of the cool stuff. Args do

792
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,220
All right, here's an idea for an arg. All right. So you um, you give me money

793
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,500
And then trust the plan and then I maybe I'll tell you where to go

794
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,940
You give me money. I mean, I guess I can't be a villain versus a villain

795
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,980
I

796
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,140
Put like secret messages in the paneling of villain verse like that sword quest arg

797
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:05,420
Um, I should say now that everyone should buy villain verse book two because I am in it

798
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,460
Oh, yeah, Ben. Are you I haven't I haven't read mine yet. Um, it might yeah

799
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:17,420
Yeah, yours would have been in it tectonic, which reminds me Ben. You gotta you gotta pay that invoice. They didn't pay the invoice yet

800
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:22,060
Oh, have I not paid the uh, sorry. Sorry. Okay. I'll pay the invoice

801
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,940
I'm sorry. Do you take dogecoin? I sent money to your Kickstarter and I got that um that drawing

802
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,580
Was I supposed to get the digital versions of of the books that were out of the time? Oh, I should

803
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,580
Did I not give you the link? Hold up. I don't think so

804
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,420
Let's see if I still have the link because I've been clearing out my my google drive. Wait, when did you have the kickstart?

805
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,020
No, it was uh, it was a yeah, it was a go for me for my computer

806
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,380
Yeah, oh right

807
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,820
I was like I didn't pledge to that wall. I think I pledged

808
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,180
Wait, didn't you give me like didn't you give me 20 bucks?

809
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,700
Who me? Yeah, didn't you broke for that? I shouldn't have you didn't deserve it

810
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,660
What it's it's cool. I want it back

811
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,380
You know what? I need to reinvest. Take me out of the book. Take me out of the book and give me that 20 bucks

812
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,940
Don't put me. Don't put me in the book. Take me out

813
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:20,300
All readers of Villainverse grab your white out find Ben snake and just just go over. I'll just go over them

And then just put your own name there

816
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,540
And then and that's that's the cheek. That's the life hack to becoming a cheesy patron without paying me

817
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,140
It's that easy folks

Trust the plan trust the plan

823
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,020
There you go again. That's it's just a google drive with all the

824
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,940
All the at the time was just up to chapter three. I mean we're up to chapter four now

825
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,340
Maybe she's just giving chapter four for free. Maybe I don't know

I don't care. Um, I just want more people to read Villainverse. That's it. That's all I want. This is all I want

829
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,260
Is that too much to ask?

830
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:33,580
There's so much that doesn't want to ask to be popular and people to break my the boundaries of my privacy. That's all I want

831
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,540
Uh, yes, it's too much

832
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,900
Damn

833
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,900
That's some shit. Um

834
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,900
Anyway, what are y'all?

835
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,260
What are y'all up to?

836
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,260
What are y'all up to nowadays?

837
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,020
Okay, um, just um, just getting mad on twitter

838
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:55,420
These these days it's about like wall street hacks and uh and uh msm cronies being like

839
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:01,580
Ooh, russian. Oh, no russian bots and and white nationalists are buying are buying a gamestop

840
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,580
Every time it's always the same thing every time every time every time

841
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,580
Yeah, I mean you've seen you've seen those articles getting posted around that like this is that the fucking game

842
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,700
Game stop stop shorts short squeeze is just gamergate too for some reason

843
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,580
It all leads back to gamergate

844
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
There was that one article where

845
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,900
This one lady was talking about how there is some there's a couple of people out there

846
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:39,420
Who have anti-semitism beliefs towards like wall street like they think they're hitting the jews where it hurts

847
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,100
Yeah, sure are I don't disbelieve that but

848
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,820
Yeah

849
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:52,860
It's it's literally the same thing as when uh when van jones on cnn when people were calling a bloomberg and oligarch

850
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,700
And van jones was like, oh, that's anti-semit. That's an anti-semitic slur. Is that the guy that looks like an ace attorney character?

851
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:07,420
No, that's not cowman. Okay. No, no van jones is like a normal-looking guy, but uh, whatever. He's just some he's just some talking head

852
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,020
Yeah, uh

853
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:15,180
But yeah, but the point was like the point was like don't like if you don't like how rich this guy is that and you say so

854
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,580
That's anti-semitic because he's a jew. That's yeah, that's so that's so fucked up

855
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:22,860
That's so fucked up and not to like let anti-semit's off the hook or anything

856
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:28,940
But like that's the kind of stupid thing that an anti-semit will point to and be like, uh, this is this is what i'm talking about

857
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,660
You can't criticize the jews anymore because they control the media. You can't keep getting away with it

858
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:39,340
It's just it's just falling into like a very obvious and stupid trap. It doesn't make any sense

859
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,940
Maybe some really fucking mad. I really I have to wonder then

860
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,300
like

861
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:51,740
The people who think that the like the rich are the jews like equal like and they're like the fucking over the rich

862
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,820
Do they think that?

863
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,100
Ultimately

864
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,540
They should just have the riches themselves. They just want to be up there and they just yeah

865
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,460
It's yeah, but but they're not but they wouldn't be jewish. So it would be okay

866
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:11,820
I mean, it's like it's that logic that most fascist beliefs have where it's like the enemy has to be weak

867
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,780
But they also have to be incredibly strong at the same time, you know

868
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,340
Because like when they talk about the jews like when they talk about the jews and they describe it

869
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:23,740
They're like they they themselves are proclaiming themselves to be the superior race

870
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,980
But when they talk about the jews, they keep talking about how the jews outsmart them and it's kind of like

871
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,300
Well, then isn't the jews like better than your race then by that logic?

872
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,500
Well, I mean, okay. I mean to them. It's all about tribalism. So it's like, yeah, okay

873
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:44,060
If the jews control everything that's bad because they're not me and I and we my tribe should control everything

874
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:49,420
And that would be better my tribe by the way includes me a tribe called quest. Yeah. Thank you everyone

875
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,380
Bass

876
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,260
Ow

877
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,060
Yeah, that's what it's about. It's it's just it's just the us the generalized us versus them

878
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,220
mentality

879
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,020
Um, man, uh, where how do you even get on this shit? No, I

880
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,860
I had there was something funny. I like noticed though. I remember I was looking

881
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,620
At that article. I mean, specifically the article wasn't saying that they were all antisemites, but there is like

882
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,380
A subsection of the people who are investing in these stocks in these stocks who well, sure

883
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:27,340
I mean, there's there's a there's a subsection of any group. No, no, I mean, no, I'm not like I'm not like

884
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,740
Thanks to jews control wall street. Yeah. No, I'm not like fucking saying I'm saying like she

885
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:36,620
She's saying she's not like she's not proclaiming that it's all of them are antisemites

886
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:41,020
She said there's a subsection of them and then like there's people in the comment to react saying like

887
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,060
Oh, they're they're not all antisemites blah blah blah

888
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,100
And then then right after under them you see people commenting

889
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:53,180
Oh, well, are you sure it's not the jews controlling everything and then they post like the general like they post a general like

890
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:59,820
poll charts with the like, um, weird how all these studios are run by jews, huh? And it's like

891
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,300
What's that got to do anything if true?

892
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,580
Yes, yes, sure

893
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,300
Uh, she's funny. I don't know. I used to just find everybody it's weird. It's weird how you see people

894
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,580
It's weird how you see people like claiming that like

895
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,460
That like antisemitism isn't real

896
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:22,620
Like or and like right alongside other people who are just unironically like actually jews do control

897
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,660
I mean if you like the media and everything and should be destroyed

898
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
They'll do it and like

899
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:33,820
Yeah, but like group a will just we'll just like pretend that group b either is just joking or that like they're just trolling

900
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,300
Or they're just such a small minority that they don't count

901
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,900
They just don't take the two seconds to kind of scroll down

902
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,860
And see that oh shit. There are people like that

903
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:48,380
It's sort of like a no true scotsman thing like if anyone does espouse such a viewpoint

904
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,740
It's like well, they're an extremist and no one takes them seriously, right?

905
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:57,740
It's not like a real opinion that a real person has, you know, that's just that's just some crazy talk, you know

906
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:07,420
I guess the the most annoying thing for me is that like not everybody who holds those views

907
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,140
Holds them strongly enough to know where the logical

908
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:16,700
Like conclusion would be so if somebody says oh you want the jews to die or whatever

909
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:23,260
They may not really have thought about that. They just think the jews control everything

910
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,060
Because they've heard that and they just think it's true

911
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,180
And they don't realize that they're in league with people who do want the jews to be killed

912
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:36,620
And then and then they defend themselves like I don't want I like jews. I know jews. I don't want the jews to die

913
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:40,300
That's stupid. You're you're you're you're making stuff up

914
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,380
And they just don't understand where their position would lead them logically. I'm sure there's some

915
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,740
Just pisses me off because it's hard to talk to those sort of people

916
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,980
They haven't thought about what they actually believe it. It's a lot of very surface level like answers

917
01:04:54,540 --> 01:05:00,060
You know, I mean, I mean if you're very if you lack if you lack all historical context

918
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,740
I mean, it's not like every it's not like every

919
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:10,060
A party member in you know, germany in the 1940s or whatever was like

920
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:16,220
Like yes, I personally would like to execute people of the hebu race like

921
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,340
They weren't all like that most of them were just like yeah, you know

922
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:23,260
This is this is probably best for our economy or whatever

923
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,300
Swing kids, huh? Or watch that movie

924
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,460
I

925
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,020
No, I guess I'm the only one who's seen it then. Uh, it's a it's about these group of

926
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,100
teenagers in

927
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,100
nazi germany who

928
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,420
Uh, who like swing music, but it's like band or something

929
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,260
Cool

930
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,500
And it's it's kind of sad. It's kind of sad because they because they all they all get caught at like

931
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,860
I'm spoiling swing kids. They all get that

932
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:58,140
One of them gets beat in the street and killed and the rest like get caught by uh during like some sort of

933
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:03,180
Like underground dance or something and then they get uh drafted into the military and presumably die

934
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:10,060
That's so this is like it's like footloose, but it's like nazi footloose kind of is yeah

935
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,580
If kevin bacon was was there things would have been different

936
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,260
If kevin bake, I've never actually seen footloose. I just I've seen that scene in hot rod

937
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,340
That is a parody of footloose

938
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:24,860
I saw kevin bacon die in the first

939
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,780
Friday the 13th

940
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,900
He's in that

941
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,860
It's it's it. Yeah, I think that that's probably what happened

942
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:36,620
It's it's that episode of avatar where ang gets all the fire nation kids to have the dance party. This is what happens

943
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,100
So after after ang leaves

944
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:41,100
Yeah

945
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,100
After he left things are really wet

946
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:47,820
And you fucked up you fucked the man. Didn't you think about your actions?

947
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,540
No

948
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,660
So deep speaking speaking of fire

949
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:02,140
Um, I just finished reading the manga fire punch. Have you guys heard of that manga? Is that like fire force? No

950
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,900
It was uh, it was written by the guy who wrote chainsaw man

951
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:10,540
Was that before after chainsaw man? Yeah, I was right before chainsaw man

952
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,420
Any good and it's uh

953
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,940
I

954
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:17,180
It was it was good, but it felt very like

955
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,820
Like there wasn't like a

956
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,980
Concrete like goal it was heading to it was kind of like making stuff up as it went along

957
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:24,780
Yeah

958
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,180
And which isn't necessarily like a bad thing

959
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,820
But like I guess the problem with that is like

960
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,060
Like I mean, okay, so for example when you read like one piece like, you know

961
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,460
Since chapter one, you know what the goal is, you know, it's like oh become king of the pirate

962
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:44,860
So you said that becomes kind of like a rope for the story, you know, even though one piece could like fluctuating quality

963
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,460
You're still kind of like

964
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,300
Determined to see it to the end, you know

965
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:48,860
Yeah

966
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:54,540
So that like that like incentivizes you and then the problem with like manga that like doesn't have a concrete goal

967
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:59,420
Is that even like the slightest the slightest dip in quality is kind of a big risk

968
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,620
Right, so because it's kind of like why the noise is heading so I don't really want to waste my time, you know

969
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,860
um and fire punch

970
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,780
Well, at least fire punch is like consistently good

971
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:13,340
But it really does feel like this guy's like making it up as he as he went along

972
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,980
And what people tell me is that chainsaw man has more of a

973
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,700
Concrete cult goal and I guess that's why it lasted longer than a fire punch

974
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,620
I don't want to tell you too much about fire punch, but there is a lot of punching that with fire. So, you know

975
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
It doesn't lie. It was so like fairytale

976
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,620
Yeah, is there fairy tales and fairy tales. There's feet

977
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:37,740
Now fairytale the the main guy in fairytale is he uses fire and he punches

978
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,220
Oh

979
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,220
The base

980
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:47,260
Oh god, there's this um, there's like this five hour long video

981
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:51,580
on youtube called a fairytale retrospective

982
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,180
And like I I played that in the background. I was like

983
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:01,740
Uh cleaning my room to move out because I just needed some bullshit and it's not even a retrospective. He's just like

984
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:07,260
Reading the entirety of like the Wikipedia articles for like fairytale

985
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,380
You know this isn't a retrospective. You're just fucking just describing what happens

986
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,500
In fairytale now, I know everything that happens in fairytale and I hate it when when you know

987
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:26,140
slightly like more than the surface level of a subject a lot of youtube videos talking about something start to become

988
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,620
A lot more like Wikipedia

989
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:33,260
rereads like I've always felt that it's so much of like just

990
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,140
basic information

991
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:40,300
I was I was looking on like minecraft like I saw one video

992
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:46,220
Which is like what which is the best way to dig for to find diamonds in the most efficient way

993
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:50,860
And I was like I kind of want to know so I clicked on it and it was basically just

994
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:57,740
A bunch of boring uninteresting like if you've never played minecraft before you will learn something

995
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,140
But since I know a little already

996
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,420
It was so devoid of anything actually useful

997
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:09,660
And I and I cried I cried and I shit myself because it was such a shit videos bad

998
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:15,100
And I uh liked and subscribed. I um, I kind of had a feeling

999
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,740
similar to watching um

1000
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,980
Um, you guys y'all know embleman, right? Uh, yeah. Yay

1001
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:28,380
More or less. I've been like slowly phasing out of not being an embleman fan really, but

1002
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,380
But like he made a video because he made that joke, right? What was that?

1003
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,940
Because he made that trump joke. Yeah that

1004
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,100
Yeah, like he deliberately put like trump propaganda one of his videos

1005
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
But also, um, I I

1006
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:48,060
That was like vague enough that I couldn't really understand the it sort of seemed like a like a trump like a trump was robbed thing

1007
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,700
But it I didn't really see it like that. I could see how it would it was

1008
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,740
He dropped the video it was vague enough that like if he said like no

1009
01:10:55,740 --> 01:11:00,140
I was just referencing current events in an ironic way. I could be like, yeah, I guess maybe

1010
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,660
I mean he was referring to specifically as like, oh, we a trump is a necessity, you know, and it's like

1011
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,660
Eh

1012
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,620
Wait trump, I don't know. Maybe I'm thinking of a different. Um, I'll repost the clip

1013
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:18,220
But um, that being said, um, he dropped a video talking about like villains and whatnot

1014
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,700
And it just basically like it just felt like he was reading like tv trope articles

1015
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:26,060
It didn't feel like he was really like doing an analysis on

1016
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,740
Villains god. I I hate it. I was that for that video that thumbnail for that video makes me mad

1017
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:39,020
But please finish your thought that's that's what um, that's what that's what most of the gun videos from ahoy feel like

1018
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,820
it's just him like saying which guns were in which video games and

1019
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,460
Just sort of like reading from a list

1020
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,100
I mean, I could there's probably other better examples

1021
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:55,100
But that's the one that jumps to mind that is the most like this guy literally just went on wikipedia and wrote a list and like

1022
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,500
Wrote it in like pros format

1023
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,620
And then read it we put video game footage over it

1024
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,020
And this is wikipedia, but in video form

1025
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,220
What was that guy that was like making cool videos?

1026
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,220
And then you disliked him because he made like one about the gorillas

1027
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,700
Which is so basic and surface level but people loved it because it was a nice reduced video

1028
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:20,060
Oh, uh, yeah, was it captain christian? Yeah, I don't even remember that video, but I remember

1029
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,740
What you're talking about and how captain christian is an idiot

1030
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,500
It's just it's I mean this sympathy I remember seeing this. I'm like, oh, yeah, zuko. Yes

1031
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:33,980
He responded to my tweet. He responded to my tweet being salty that I said he saw

1032
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,780
pussy

1033
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,500
Yeah to that guy. He just dropped off the face of the earth

1034
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Well, good

1035
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,860
Like his first video was about a a

1036
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,500
As a superman fleischer cartoon

1037
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,340
Superman I'd never heard or seen of that so that was interesting

1038
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:56,620
But then everything after that was like, oh, I've heard of this. Oh, I've heard of that

1039
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,420
Um, okay. Do you have anything new do you have anything like good?

1040
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,980
I didn't really

1041
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,780
It kind of reminds me on uh, I don't know if you heard this podcast

1042
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:13,100
But it's called the pcp and I remember a member on that podcast. That's right. I remember a member on that podcast said

1043
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,660
I can't remember who it's probably didgy

1044
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:19,580
Um, she said something about like you actually not know or this isn't a bit

1045
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:22,540
But it's like something that they said that I do agree with a lot

1046
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,340
About like a lot of times captain christian's videos and sometimes other people's videos

1047
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:34,380
Sometimes super ipaduals videos are like this where it's basically like the thesis statement is like, oh this good

1048
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:41,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean, yeah tons of videos are like there's nothing really wrong with that

1049
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:48,540
Like I've done that before I saw one. There's nothing wrong with that because like, you know, sometimes you like to be reassured

1050
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,780
Yeah, the thing you like is good or sometimes you want to be sold on something, you know, yeah

1051
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,540
I I

1052
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:59,660
Yeah, I guess it's it's like there's nothing wrong with it, but it's it's the um

1053
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,380
The highfalutin fancy pants sort of attitude about how cool

1054
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,340
Yeah video is even though there's nothing to it

1055
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:11,660
Especially I think part of it comes from like people

1056
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:16,860
People really like when captain christian was making videos people were super into him

1057
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,060
I mean me included too because like his editing was really good

1058
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,980
so

1059
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,860
Yeah, like the the first couple ones I thought they were pretty cool

1060
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:29,100
And then I guess it was the gorillas ones. I was like this if he didn't say anything and like

1061
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,500
It wouldn't bother me except that like I had liked the previous ones

1062
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,140
Uh, you know it

1063
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,620
No, no, that was that's pretty much

1064
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:46,540
What what I think happened with me was that uh, like all of his videos are sort of the same thing where it's like

1065
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,940
thing good with really good editing

1066
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
All right, and here's why?

1067
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,340
And and there's nothing really wrong with that, but I think there's this sort of

1068
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,700
Like like he got so much praise for it. I think maybe there's part of a almost it's not

1069
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,260
It's not like he's the only

1070
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,980
Right, it's not like he's the only one who makes videos that are just

1071
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:12,380
Yeah, he was he just sort of came out of nowhere and it seemed like oh this guy's like planned out his youtube career

1072
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:16,780
And it's like wow, this is so like all of the thumbnails are like color-coded and

1073
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:19,340
It's all very very well

1074
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,860
Considered, but when you really look at it, it's nothing special

1075
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:25,820
And you would completely forget it and never watch him ever again

1076
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:30,620
And I think people like that and that's what I just sort of lost relevancy lately

1077
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:35,340
I mean, I've never I have not seen videos like that for a long time. I mean there I mean there was

1078
01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:39,100
I mean there was a there was a bubble getting recommend. There was definitely a video

1079
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:45,740
There was definitely a video essay bubble that was like captain christian sort of was around like right when it was peaking

1080
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,180
Yeah, I mean nerd writer was maybe like sort of the

1081
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:55,500
The the like front man of it for a minute there and that was when when nerd writer was peaking

1082
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,820
That's when captain christian showed up and everyone loved his shit

1083
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,820
And I think it has deflated. It hasn't like fully popped like people still make video essays

1084
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,180
But um, I think it's deflated a bit that particular stuff

1085
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:11,580
Wasn't there like a brief period of time where there were where like every frame of painting was still uploading videos

1086
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:15,980
Hi, my name is Tony captain christian was yeah, this this was the heyday of every frame of painting too

1087
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:21,740
It was around the same time in this specific era where all these video essays are coming out and people were like just enjoying them all

1088
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,140
But then in retrospect a lot of them didn't really say that much

1089
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:30,060
I mean every frame of painting stands up. Yeah, I still watch this must be a copycat guy

1090
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,180
Well, every frame of painting has a really solid like technical analysis

1091
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:40,380
That like the your average your layman's you were criterion doesn't he able to explain I don't I don't want to like like shit on this person

1092
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,460
But I I always saw them

1093
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:44,620
What's like, what are they called?

1094
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,140
Now you see it

1095
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,980
I always saw them as like an every frame of painting ripoff that was just not quite as good

1096
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:52,620
I've seen their videos and I can't really remember any of their videos

1097
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,460
Wait, I'm trying to remember now

1098
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:58,380
It's it's a channel called now you see it and it's like no, I don't talking about

1099
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:05,020
Movies and in the same sort of fashion of like look at this camera move or whatever

1100
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,740
But it was just not as good and I just

1101
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,940
I don't know. There was a lot of those as well

1102
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:15,820
If something's popular people will copy it. You know what channel i'm really digging recently

1103
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,380
Is a accented cinema

1104
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,780
You guys heard of this channel? No, no

1105
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,580
They um, there are there are chinese guys who like

1106
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,940
Analyzes like not just like chinese movies, but he talks about a why like

1107
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,100
range of stuff

1108
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,620
right and um

1109
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:38,460
I think one of my he did he talked about he said why he didn't he made a video called why I don't like shin godzilla

1110
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,940
And I mean, I love a shin godzilla, but I think it's like

1111
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
It's very I like it when

1112
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,220
I do like hearing

1113
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,740
Like when people have the opposites like why they don't like the things I

1114
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,980
I like you know as long as they're like not you see I just get mad being reasonable

1115
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
Because they're usually mad too

1116
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,540
Yeah, this channel is really good. Um

1117
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:06,460
They have one called how to film a good sword fight, which I think is very interesting and it says a lot of things that they don't think about

1118
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:08,940
um

1119
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:10,940
And they have one on uh, they have one on

1120
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:15,980
Pulgasari you guys ever heard of pulgasari. Yeah, he has like a 4chan board, right?

1121
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:21,660
Hmm, wait, what was that? He has like a 4chan board devoted to discussion about him, right?

1122
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:28,380
Yeah, maybe I don't know. No, pulgasari is the north korean kaiju movie

1123
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,500
No, wait, yeah, they all one of those

1124
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:35,500
Oh, yeah, oh, you can watch it all you can watch it all on youtube

1125
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,700
I'm actually if you want to hear an analysis on it. I made a podcast about it, but

1126
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:48,380
That be that being said polkas what makes pulgasari so infamous is that the director was like kidnapped from south korea

1127
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,780
And forced to make the movie

1128
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:52,780
Is it right?

1129
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:58,540
But the movie is like very interesting because it's I watched it and it's actually a pretty decent like

1130
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,540
kaiju movie

1131
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:06,140
But also it could be interpreted as like an anti north korean film or like kind of like

1132
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,060
Trying to send a message to the north korean all we agree between the lines, you know

1133
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,700
In a way. Yeah, like if you read

1134
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,460
Yeah, hold up. I'll uh, you can watch the entirety of the movie on youtube

1135
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:22,460
I'm looking at accented cinemas videos. I'm scrolling down. I see minecraft enslave the populace

1136
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:26,620
I was like, oh, what cool interesting. Oh, it's april fools

1137
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:34,860
So this channel I I hate it. I hate it when when the the april fool is that thing that is cool isn't real

1138
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:40,220
Yeah, it's always better when it's like thing that is cool, but stupid

1139
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,220
Is real wait, no wait, no ascented cinema is good. You haven't seen it. Y'all

1140
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,620
I'm

1141
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:53,820
Okay, yeah, here's the podcast where we talk about pulgasari. Uh, check out the sick thumbnail

1142
01:19:54,700 --> 01:20:02,140
Is that honestly cheesy? I gotta say I love this thumbnail idea where it's just picture from the movie with gun

1143
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:10,700
Yeah, I um, I do that every time I do a podcast about any movie. It's always like, oh, yeah something from the movie with a gun

1144
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,700
I just I did it with my uh, dragon quest your story podcast

1145
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,740
It's just it's just so funny

1146
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:23,180
I'm pretty sure this might backfire me in some way like youtube's gonna be like, oh if you have a gun in the thumbnail

1147
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,180
We're gonna restrict your video or something

1148
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,900
We will just kill you that

1149
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
Christ

1150
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,620
I had one of my videos recently like

1151
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,180
Like automatically manually

1152
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,580
Set as made for kids because I wasn't swearing in it or something

1153
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:42,220
So that I couldn't make money off of it anymore

1154
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:49,660
Like they they sent me an email saying we've uh reviewed your video like this hadn't been flagged or anything

1155
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:54,620
It was just like suddenly we've reviewed this video and we've just determined that it is made for kids

1156
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,700
So now it is made for kids

1157
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,700
Oh, thanks

1158
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,540
Which um

1159
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,940
I mean it was one of my old pony videos. So I'm like whatever

1160
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:09,260
Yeah, but you know, I can see why but like I don't like that. They can just flip a switch to do that

1161
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,060
Yeah, that is annoying

1162
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:17,820
It is incredibly annoying. I wish there was humans in between where you could talk to you about this shit, but nope

1163
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:21,580
Nope, no humans cost money who we don't want to spend that

1164
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,140
Is cheesy in a fancy world right now?

1165
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:30,540
Uh, it's one of my roommates is probably playing the little piano and playing melodica. That's funny

1166
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:33,660
It's telling me

1167
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:36,140
More than half of the roommates here play an instrument

1168
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,340
Um, you could have like a little band

1169
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:44,860
I could I'll uh, I'll be I'll be uh, the the lyricist. I I know how to write man. I'm pretty good at it

1170
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:52,380
Yeah, I could be that I went to um music videos. I went to a concert once remember concerts guys. Haha. Anyway, uh,

1171
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,780
No, we're the

1172
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:59,180
Welcome back. I'm back by the way and by tectonic the thing you said about uh, april fools

1173
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,940
Uh, I remember you said the same thing in your rpg video

1174
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:09,740
About the about the the april fools better when the thing is real. Yeah, okay. Just had to have someone dead

1175
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,220
Yeah, but it's it's

1176
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,540
There was I went to this concert once where um, it was like a

1177
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
It was like a dual

1178
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,460
Like a dual performance or whatever

1179
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:29,740
Uh, or it's like two two headlining acts one goes after the other and I me and my sister

1180
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,900
We really only wanted to see the the second act

1181
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,300
but we went through the opening one anyway because it's like, you know, whatever uh, and

1182
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,180
They weren't great. It wasn't really like it was kind of like boomer-ish music

1183
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:45,740
But uh, they had like a hype man for some of their songs. It was just it was just this like

1184
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:50,780
Uh, like lanky black dude with like a like a fedora and like a black suit

1185
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:56,620
And he's just kind of like walking around the stage like getting everyone super excited and it it was

1186
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,580
Confuddling me. I had no idea like what the point of him was

1187
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,620
because like the music

1188
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,020
It was it was it was just like rock music

1189
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:12,620
So I feel like do you really need a hype band like that and is that all he does and it was it was all he did

1190
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:16,220
He was like part of the touring band so strange

1191
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:23,900
That is incredibly strange. Um, very it's very vivid in my mind. I don't remember the songs. I remember the hype man

1192
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,940
One time I remember there was this girl. I had a crush on

1193
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,180
And um, one of one of those artists that we both like was in town

1194
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:39,900
And I asked him like hey, you're going to this concert and she's like, uh, maybe and then I'm like, well, it'd be cool to see you there

1195
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,020
Am I right and then like the day of the concert

1196
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:47,660
She'd be at me saying like you're still going to that concert and I'm like, yeah, and then she's like, okay cool

1197
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,900
Me and my boyfriend are going to

1198
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:57,020
I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh awesome. It's like, uh, actually I have covid so I can't go

1199
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:06,460
This is like three years before I have a normal strain of the coronavirus. Oh, sorry

1200
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:13,260
But um, no, I have that weird lung thing from vaping. I have uh looks at year

1201
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,660
I look so anyway

1202
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,340
I show up to the venue early because I had a bar and I decided to get stupid drunk

1203
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:26,060
Because I did not want to meet her boyfriend sober and it was great actually and after that I realized

1204
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:30,140
Whoa, I love going to shows super drunk. So now I'm super drunk at every show

1205
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,660
I usually get like a drink, but I don't

1206
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,300
Plastered

1207
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,100
I love I love getting uh, super drunk

1208
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:44,460
Getting getting getting plastered in like a public bar. It's it's the only way to feel

1209
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Like uh, you're not gonna

1210
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:53,260
It's it's strange the only way to feel like you're not embarrassing yourself is to be a little drunk

1211
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,780
So you so you don't actually

1212
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,700
Makes the the last the last time I got drunk in like a public bar

1213
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,100
I ended up like I ended up like, uh

1214
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:09,580
It was when I lost my wallet and I kept asking the bartender where my wallet was and I like heckled

1215
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,660
I like heckled a fucking like stand-up

1216
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,740
I got told to shut I got told to shut up by the management

1217
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:21,340
And uh, and then I went back when I went I've told this boy when I went back and asked the bartender like hey

1218
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,260
Do you find what he's like you asked me this like 40 times yesterday? No, I don't have your wallet

1219
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,700
He's glared at me and it was like the worst feeling that's kind of familiar

1220
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:34,140
Yeah, yeah, I mean this was like this one. Okay. This was like a year and a half ago. Yeah, because this was pre-covid

1221
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:40,620
But yeah, that was the last time I got drunk at all. Yeah, and I felt and I felt so terrible about it. It was traumatizing

1222
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,820
It was just one time

1223
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,260
Known as an annoyance. Yeah, when you didn't say

1224
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:55,420
No, the fact the fact that that I was annoying enough that this guy who works at a bar where people go to get drunk

1225
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,860
That I stood out in his mind as being like particularly obnoxious

1226
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,580
No, oh

1227
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,700
fuck

1228
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,500
Yeah

1229
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:04,300
Okay, okay

1230
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,860
I think I think though that it was a bad influence because I was with because I was with that weird girl

1231
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:13,500
And I think that she was the one it started heckling and I think I just kind of followed her lead

1232
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,660
No, I think that's why it was the girls fault. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent

1233
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:22,540
It was all the woman. It's always a woman's fault. She ate the apple. She ate the apple first

1234
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,900
She's from she stole my rib and then she ate the apple

1235
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:32,460
And that's why that's why mankind is like in a fallen state. God the problem is that we're raised by our mothers. That's the problem

1236
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:35,580
I

1237
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,580
one time at a show I uh

1238
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,100
I

1239
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:42,780
Think this was probably the last concert I went to was I went to see like Cara Cara Bonito in uh

1240
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:48,780
In boston or whatever and I was getting some I was getting some cash out of the atm

1241
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:53,340
And I noticed that there was an id on the ground. I was like, oh my god, someone dropped their id

1242
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:58,380
Uh, I I should probably go pick. I should probably go report this or something. I pick it up. It's fucking my id

1243
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:00,540
I dropped my id on the ground

1244
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:01,980
somehow

1245
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,860
I was like, I was like, what if you didn't realize that you well, thank god

1246
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:11,340

01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:19,660
Was it the middle east? No, it wasn't the middle east. It it it was

1250
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:22,540

01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:33,260
I have no fucking clue. Yeah, I'm just gonna say it was the paradise rock club

1253
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,700
What if you went to go

1254
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:41,660
You didn't realize it was your ideas id so you went to go give it to them and they looked at the idea and then they looked at you

1255
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:43,740
And they're like, is this a fucking joke

1256
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,780
The idea was kind of old

1257
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:51,340
So so I don't know if I looked like the picture. I had sure I look like Mike. Uh, actually

1258
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:57,260
Yeah, I probably look like minecraft steve and my fucking id god my head is so square. That's fucking cool as shit

1259
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:01,020
Uh, man, I I mean, I don't like it. My my younger cousin would bully me

1260
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:06,940
My zoomer cousin would be like shut up minecraft steve when they look at minecraft steve minecraft steve. No, no

1261
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,340

1262
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:16,700
Won't you go mine diamonds minecraft steve? I never played minecraft. I don't understand what your zoomers are telling her saying to me

1263
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,620

1264
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,380
I am not minecraft steve. Oh god damn. I was

1265
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,540
Oh, it's been a little it's been a little while since we did a pcp minecraft

1266
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:34,620
I'm gonna say hasn't it been like isn't it's two weeks a little while? Oh man, maybe I guess internet time

1267
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:37,500
We've been trying to do it more regularly. I guess word

1268
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:44,860
Yeah word word did you uh the uh, did I did I tell you that I that I spent a while off stream?

1269
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:51,340
Uh, just like mining marble. I mean, there's like there's like four chests full of marble. Yeah, and uh, what can you do with marble?

1270
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,580
I haven't played minecraft since like we're building gibbs, uh abby's play 12 or something

1271
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,180
Uh, also, um

1272
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:04,780
Hey, okay, so we've been I don't know if this is the time to talk about it

1273
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:10,860
But like maybe maybe those abby should have been made with like marble facades instead of full marble blocks

1274
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,900
What do you mean facade? Is that a thing?

1275
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:16,060
I mean

1276
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,500
There's a there. I mean, I think one of the mods lets you make a yeah

1277
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:23,340
Like you can make not a full block, but just like a very thin sort of like

1278
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:30,060
Less than half a block of that has like the brick marble texture on it. I think

1279
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,020
I mean, it's too late now

1280
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,980
I mean at the moment I need like the I need like nether

1281
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,780
um, nether quartz

1282
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,900
Shit

1283
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,100
uh

1284
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:49,580
Well, I mean there's I mean uh, uh maren maren made the uh, the machine that is just like generating infinite nether quartz

1285
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:50,780
pan

1286
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:52,300
Oh, yeah

1287
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,540
God those mods are so fucking strange. Oh

A gift for you that will make maren very angry. Yeah, we should we should play. I can't fucking wait

1293
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,340
patreon

1294
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:19,420
Uh, and uh, so you can have infinite nether quartz by a mage

1295
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:23,260
No

1296
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:26,380
I think maren runs it

1297
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:34,300
Maren pan is a is uh the the one of the uh big time minecraft gods is what they is

1298
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:42,140
Oh, wait, yeah, this might be off topic, but I did you see that like last week? I I um

1299
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:49,020
I clipped out my my pan peaks are rent from that one pcb episode and I edited it right next to the pan

1300
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:52,380
Yes, yeah, I saw and I finally uploaded to my channel

1301
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:57,100
I saw that and like that got me like six new subscribers on the spot because of it

1302
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,140
Dude six. I want to say

1303
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:07,820
Okay, one one last thing about the pcb minecraft server is I was doing I was doing the top killers like art stream

1304
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,220
Uh day before yesterday, I think

1305
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:16,540
and you know, I was editing the top killers uh image and people the subject of um

1306
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:21,740
Minecraft came up and someone maren pan was in the chat and

1307
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:28,140
Someone was like, uh, oh maren pan is the guy like oh maren pan. It's cool. He built like he's building like the full scale

1308
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,740
Uh, uh

1309
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:35,660
New os angela city, you know thing in minecraft and everyone was like, oh, wow, that's really cool. Oh, well, that's really cool

1310

and someone was like, uh like

1311
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:43,100
But someone was like, oh, but you know, it's if you have to pay to get in the server and it was I was like

1312
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,380
I was a little I don't know how to feel because I was like, oh, that's good

1313
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:52,300
That like there's a cool thing in the pcb minecraft server that someone might want to like pay money to get access to

1314
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,300
But also like, oh

1315
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:58,140
These these rfck heads are like they're they're cut off from the

1316
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,340
From the goods

1317
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,740
It's it's only five bucks a month. It's only it's only five bucks a month and uh

1318
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:10,940
maren pan's a full scale recreation of nlaka come is is always growing

1319
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,300
Downtown I think is basically done and it looks fucking sick

1320
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:21,100
Um, okay, I don't know. That was that was just an experience that it happened and I made me lull

1321
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:25,420
Fuck you. Fuck everyone that doesn't uh, that's not in the server

1322
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:32,380
Give us money. Give us money. It's pretty. It's pretty money. Give us money. Yeah

1323
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,260
No, I I um

1324
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:41,180
No, sometimes when I'm just like want to relax. I just pop in there and mine some ports or whatever

1325
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:45,580
And usually there's nobody in there usually most people on the show for the streams

1326
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,340
Uh, but not always sometimes people are around

1327
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:53,020
Okay, that's enough. That's all I have to say about that

1328
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,740
but but but based

1329
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,100
um

1330
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:00,860
Well, I've I guess one thing that I've noticed was interesting

1331
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:05,180
I don't know how many people of how many of you guys follow philosophy tube

1332
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,740
Oh, yeah

1333
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:09,420

1337
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,860
like very

1338
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,620
Classy in in all aspects of the coming out very classical abby

1339
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,580
I I have not I have not watched how did he do it better than I have not watched the video

1340
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:34,300
Uh

1341
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:37,100
Um, okay. Anyway. Yes, great. We love to see it

1342
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,620
We love to see another pcp member transition awesome

1343
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:48,220
They they're inspired by the pcp. Yeah, they um, they saw the jenny's

1344
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,940
Gives did did anyone's transition. Okay. I'm sure I'm sure that probably nobody

1345
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:59,340
I'm sure nobody else cares and nor should they but did anyone see peter coffins reaction to it. Yeah. Yeah, I was very

1346
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,980
What did they say?

1347
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:05,980
What did they say you fucking bigot, sorry

1348
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,740
I'm very sorry

1349
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:14,780
Pete peter coffins said peter coffins reaction to abagail coming out

1350
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:23,180
And everyone being very supportive was to to tweet like when I came out as non-binary a mainstream magazine ran a piece on how

1351
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,180
I was a male appropriating feminism

1352
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:30,060
Damn, like just being salty. I mean, that's okay. That does suck like so

1353
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:35,180
Okay, it it does suck it does suck but like

1354
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:43,020
Why it's it's it's very sour. Why it's like, oh like it's it's like to to bring it to bring it up right then

1355
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:48,620
It's like it's just pure sour grapes and it's really unfortunate. It made me pretty mad. Yeah

1356
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:51,820
Um, you know that peter coffee used to follow me on twitter

1357
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,780
Yeah

1358
01:34:55,100 --> 01:35:00,700
Yeah, they did for a moment. I followed them back but then like the more ridiculous their tweets came out

1359
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:05,900
I was like, okay. I think this is enough. I think i'm just gonna stick to your ex who has fat tits

1360
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,220
Speaking of fat tits abagail Shapiro

1361
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,420
Um, uh, no, I don't I don't like her. I don't like uh, she like

1362
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:20,140
She is look can I be a look can I be a little misogynistic for a second?

1363
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:28,540
Of course, of course, of course. No by all means. No, she's gonna be the cheesy misogynist for a minute here

1364
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:33,260
If I could just be ironic for a moment your honor. It's it's like she's not she's not really

1365
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:37,740
She's not really that funny like not all

1366
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:43,180
Dutton she's really not very little like banger tweets to be honest and she doesn't even

1367
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:47,980
I don't even show that many like she's not funny. There's like there's like other if you say it's because of her boobs

1368
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,820
There's like other twitter. Yeah, there's like other twitter girls with big boobs

1369
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:57,340
Obviously people follow her because she's got huge tits. She's not that funny and honestly. I think her face is kind of gross

1370
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:05,660
She's she's like talking about are we talking about the lady who has the

1371
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:10,620
Yes, yes, I don't know who she is. Okay. I don't blame you

1372
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
this is this

1373
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:17,740
Uh much much like how peter coffin was caddy about the philosophy

1374
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,060
To coming out this conversation is very caddy

1375
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:24,300
True. I'm not being caddy. I'm just saying she's not that funny

1376
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:28,540
People follow her for the way she looks and I don't like the way she looks. So what's the what's the appeal?

1377
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,300
There's none. I'm being a big cap boy right now a big cap boy right now. Um

1378
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:37,020
Fun. All I'm saying all I'm saying is that like I've seen other

1379
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,180
lefties

1380
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:45,100
Uh girls with big boobs who show more big boobs than actually does they're more praxis and funny

1381
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,100
That

1382
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:52,300
I want to say I want to say I'm not I'm not I'm not angry. I'm not jealous

1383
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:57,420
That uh punish that punish that punish friday and flip friday and slip

1384
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:05,340
I'm not jealous that um that ashley follows michelle. All right. I'm not jealous. That's not why I'm saying this

1385
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:09,980
Wait, really does she yeah? Yeah, they follow each other. Why I don't know why

1386
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,900
Because michelle also makes funny tweets, which are I think funnier

1387
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:17,020
I think they have the same I do find michelle funnier even though

1388
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
bishchelle is like my enemy

1389
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,500
um

1390
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
She's my she's my nemesis

1391
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,540
um

1392
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:28,140
If people if the audience don't know what i'm talking about i'm talking about michelle. Um

1393
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,900
Girl girl nate girl best guy if you will

1394
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:36,140
The best guy girl. That's we should get michelle on the show. Oh, we should

1403
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,420

Shut up. All i'm saying

1406
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:28,540
All i'm saying all i'm saying is look at her face and look at her lipstick

1407
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:31,980
And how her lipstick goes above her lips

1408
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:35,500
It's so weird looking and it makes me mad. I hate it

1409
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:41,580
I hate it. Is that about michelle? Is this the is it? No, it's about no ash

1410
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,940
I hate ash's lipstick is bizarre

1411
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:50,940
The cheesy misogynist and the biggest saint once again united together. Shut the fuck up. I hate you

1412
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:59,340
I hate everyone honestly honestly. No unironically whenever anyone tells me that i'm being misogynistic because I think a girl is ugly

1413
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,980
Fuck you. You are the you are the misogynist

1414
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:08,940
Uh, it's it should be okay to say that about anyone. Uh, I'm so fucking mad. I hate all of you. I hate everything

1415
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,940
I'm not the misogynist. You are

1416
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:16,060
Yes, unironically. No, not me you. No, not me you every single time

1417
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:18,540
I may be a misogynist

1418
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:20,700
But at least i'm not a liar

1419
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:26,620
You are though you're both of those things. I think I mean in this instance

1420
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,620
Uh

1421
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:33,420
From what I've seen like she goes to great lengths to show off her attractiveness

1422
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:38,540
So to critique her attractiveness is not like misogynistic. It's just like thank you

1423
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,540
It's part of what you know like her appeal and if you don't agree with it then

1424
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:49,180
You know, I said the same I said the same thing about I said the same thing about maryc deville and everyone got on my ass about

1425
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:53,500
You know what? You know what? I like to have what I like to state a formal apology to benzade. I'm sorry

1426
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,580

01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:10,620
I'm free now. I can be as much misogynist as I want to be

1431
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:15,980
Ha ha just kidding. I'm even more misogynist. Let the bigotry commence

1432
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:22,940
It's the it's the sicko sky. Yeah, benzade is the sicko on the window. Yeah

1433
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,340
Go in sicko mode

1434
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:33,260
Oh, god. Ha ha. Yes. Yes speak. Okay. So anyway, I remember when we were talking about analysis videos earlier. No

1435
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:36,140
Um, so anyway, I just brought that up

1436
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:40,380
Because I was gonna I was gonna show my own analysis video coming soon

1437
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:44,700
Doge dogecoin plummeting dogecoin plummeting cheesy cheesy

1438
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,340
It was up to four. We need to go to four. It's going down. It's going down. It's

1439
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:55,020
Oh, wait, no, never mind. Never mind. He's canceling his video. He's canceling his video. I'm canceling my analysis video. I'm canceling it

1440
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:58,780
No, no, please. Oh god, it's dropping. It's 0.352. 0.35.

1441
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:03,580
Is it gonna hit 0.3? Will it go below 0.35? You've crashed. I don't know what I want. Oh my god. This is it

1442
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:06,700
Tom, Tom, get out. Tom, bail.

1443
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:10,940
Get out of there, Tom. Tom. Tom. No. Tom.

1444
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,220
Don't, no. I'm already dead.

1445
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Damn

1446
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,580
I learned I learned uh

1447
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,580
The real doge's name

1448
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:26,940
It's very cute. The the doge that the the meme is based on's name is um

1449
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:29,020
Oh my god

1450
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:33,580
Fuck I can't kabosu. That's a weird name. It's kabosu. Oh my god. That's a weird name

1451
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:41,100
Kabosu it's the name of like a citrus fruit and the owner named it that because it had a round face

1452
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:47,020
Like a cut over and that is cute kabosu or an or or an orange. Yeah. I do love cheap

1453
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:52,380
I'm a big fan of chimes myself. I think chimes is the best variant

1454
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,100
Is it a is it a hot take that I think chimes is funnier than doge? If it is then I stand by it

1455
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,260
I think yeah, I think chimes is better. I mean, I love love doge

1456
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:07,100
Love doge, but I think I prefer chimes. Yeah, just objectively. Chimes just looks cool. Like let me let me show you a picture

1457
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,180
Let me show you my favorite

1458
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:15,020
I've seen I know what chimes looks like. No, let me show you my favorite chimes picture when when you see when you see buff doge

1459
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:22,300
And and like the little crying yellow dog. The yellow dog is chimes. Look at look at this guy. He looks like an anime protagonist

1460
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:27,980
Yeah, chimes is they're both cheapy. Yeah, it's not the same dog. Yeah once they are

1461
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:34,380
Chimes chimes, uh, wait, let me find the original way his legs are sitting. Yeah

1462
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:38,140
He's he has an anime protagonist that

1463
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,900
I mean, there's the there's the meme image which is the meme image is like

1464
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:46,620
Very similar to the actual picture

1465
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,260
But like the actual picture is like funnier

1466
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:53,260
Yeah, yeah, the actual picture is like is really good

1467
01:42:55,580 --> 01:43:01,340
Versus um versus this this is like the meme which is like slightly distorted and like yellow. I guess it's pretty much

1468
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:07,980
That's not yellow. It's just a squish down. That's natural. I love his face. Yeah, it looks like he's stinking. He's having a big think

1469
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:15,020
He looks like he's a little annoyed about something. The funniest thing about it. I think is that he has no neck whatsoever

1470
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:22,620
His snout starts and his body begins. Do you guys want to see one of my uh, I made like a his name his name is his name is Baltzy

1471
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:30,140
I did one of those like, um, I did one of those like gene addicts. He has no ears. No ears whatsoever

1472
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:35,020
No, vulture. Don't steal it. I've never seen Spiderman. He's like got the um the same

1473
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:40,380
He's he's got the like the same energy as like a seal that's squished his neck

1474
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,780
Like his head into his body

1475
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:45,740
Like like receding a receding dog

1476
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,780
He's just like herm big think

1477
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:51,660
Having a big old think right now

1478
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:57,420
Wait, wait, sorry, but uh, I just I like

1479
01:44:01,180 --> 01:44:03,180
Oh

1480
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,540
Hell yeah, Ben saying when you call him the size of this

1481
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,380
Stop right there

1482
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,140
How dad

1483
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:25,500
I want to I want to photoshop it with like glasses that make a purple so he matches Ben's like

1484
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:27,820
Oh

1485
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:33,020
James is funnier. I didn't I didn't realize it was a different dog even

1486
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:36,700
Yeah

1487
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:41,980
Oh to be fair, you can't have cheese without doughers. So I think you know, you got to respect your elders

1488
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:46,700
Yeah, all the same family there. Okay. I was reading an article

1489
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:53,100
I read an article about you know, original doge 8 say aka kabosu and the article said that there's like another

1490
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,700
Shiba Inu who was also sometimes called doge

1491
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:02,780
And it's just some american guy's dog that wore a bandana and like I'd never seen this other one

1492
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,340
before

1493
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:08,060
Yeah, so like top notch aesthetics

1494
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:13,820
And like I feel like the the article was like, yeah, these both of these dogs became

1495
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,860
Doge and I was like, who the fuck is that other one?

1496
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:20,380
Like this is this this one did not stand the test of time

1497
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:22,940
Uh, which one?

1498
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:28,460
I'm looking. Sorry. I'm there's an article. I'm going meme hunting

1499
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:31,820
I am going meme hunting. Um

1500
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,300
this is

1501
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:36,460
Doge was what the article was called

1502
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:41,740
Yeah, okay. It was from the verge. It was called what the article was called. Wow, this is doge

1503
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,100
and

1504
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,780
Okay, I this one

1505
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:51,020
Like what is this

1506
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:56,940
Yeah, I've never seen this. This looks terrible. Never seen it before. Yeah, but the article like makes like yeah

1507
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:59,820
Yeah, this this one is also doge. It looks like a

1508
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,140
Boomer mistake

1509
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:07,660
I used to hate this. I used to hate the doge meme. I don't know. I honestly, I think I still hate the much

1510
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:14,140
Wow, so whatever. Yeah, that's that's dumb. But the comeback was was really good

1511
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:19,020
It was never that funny. What do you mean the come on to gen two doge than gen one doge

1512
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:25,180
Gen one just had way too many like like bugs. Okay. I mean the I mean like the the wow much amazing

1513
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:30,620
Is like fine. I don't know like it's okay. It's yeah. Well, sure

1514
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:34,860
What's what's second edition doge? Is it like doge's v-teams?

1515
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:39,340
Is that is that the revival like you know back in 2019 when when

1516
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:44,700
Doge just started being popular again. It was more all-encompassing

1517
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:47,260
Hmm

1518
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,340
This is one picture now. We're just posting memes. All right, here's the stuff

1519
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:56,220
Here's a free here's a free cheat. Here's a free team emoji if anyone travels

1520
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:01,740
Cool, I just I just love how he looks. He looks so adamant

1521
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:07,820
Some someone's got to make team coin and then the cycle will will close. I would invest in a team coin

1522
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:11,900
I would probably start doing bitcoin if someone made it today

1523
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:17,820
I probably would because I feel like it would be destined to like be a serious doge coin competitor

1524
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:19,980
Finally a coin for me

1525
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,300
PCP heads, you know what to do

1526
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:25,660
Yeah, PCP assemble

1527
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:29,340
Do your thing

1528
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:33,100
Oh boy. So sheaves. Sheaves are pretty cute. I like sheaves a lot

1529
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:36,300
I I have been um

1530
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:40,620
In my room all week because I got covid

1531
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:45,660
Uh, I didn't buy the shirt. I actually got covid 19

1532
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,900
Esquire

1533
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:53,180
Uh, and I work. I don't know exactly how I got it. I work at at a middle school

1534
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:56,540
So it could have been something to do with that. I'm not sure

1535
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:00,140
But um, it's god damn children. Yeah

1536
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:06,380
It was it wasn't too bad like my symptoms were were mostly mild

1537
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:09,340
It just kind of never went away and I still can't really taste things

1538
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,060
Uh

1539
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:19,340
Since I've been in my room all week, I've pretty much done like nothing but play video games and uh, yeah

1540
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:23,660
And one of the video games I've been playing was uh, I picked up

1541
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:30,300
Uh, like fire emblem echoes after not playing it for like three fucking years and then I ended up beating it

1542
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:36,460
After after so long and now I'm in a huge fire emblem hole. I'm playing all I'm playing games

1543
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,100
Constant fire emblem. I wanted

1544
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,140
I wanted to do a video

1545
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,580
on on the

1546
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:45,980
The sacred stones the one for the game boy advance

1547
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:52,220
Because I really I really liked that game, but I was I felt I was feeling like

1548
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:56,700
Oh almost like an imposter syndrome. God damn it fucking

1549
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:02,700
Among us has ruined the word imposter, but I I felt I felt almost you were you were feeling suss

1550
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:05,820
I was feeling a little suss. I was feeling a little suss when I was a little sick

1551
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,740
feeling a little suss

1552
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:09,980
When I was when I was working on it because I was just like

1553
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:13,900
Like because because I was talking about things I like in the game

1554
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:20,540
But but I was also feeling like almost inadequate in a way because I don't really know too much

1555
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:24,780
Like I'm not as big in fire emblem as some people are

1556
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:31,980
Because I've played I played like the sacred stones like years ago and then I played echoes. I've played three houses

1557
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,820
And I'm making my way through some of the older ones now. I'm playing through genealogy

1558
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:39,100
which is like the fourth one that never came out over here and um

1559
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,140
I I just I just feel

1560
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:47,580
I don't know it's it's it's the first time I ever really felt like I wanted to do like a video on something

1561
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,220
But I've also felt like under qualified in a way

1562
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,180
And it's

1563
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,340
I feel that

1564
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:00,460
Uh, what do you feel like you gotta play the whole series before you can talk about it or

1565
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:05,820
I I I just feel like I should I I should know a little more about the games because

1566
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:10,540
It's it kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier about the um

1567
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:15,900
About how like, you know, as soon as you know something about a series

1568
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:22,140
A lot of stuff on youtube starts to feel surface level and I don't want to feel surface level when making

1569
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:25,340
A video about a game. I really like like the sacred stones

1570
01:50:25,740 --> 01:50:27,340
So

1571
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:31,980
Yeah, I I felt like that when I was making my my heroes of my magic videos

1572
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:34,300
Yeah, where I realized that oh wait

1573
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:40,620
I'm just just playing these and trying to make a video quickly because like more videos equals good

1574
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:46,300
And so I didn't really get into the game for long enough to have much to say about it and

1575
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,260
Anyone who has played the game

1576
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:54,860
Would be able to immediately see that I have just not really into it

1577
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,820
And it was like it's so much easier to write scripts about games. I played for years

1578
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:04,540
And so like playing new games and making reviews on those it's like

1579
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:09,340
I don't know that you can't really do much more than at first impressions

1580
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:14,460
Unless you really put the work in to try and completely understand every facet of it

1581
01:51:14,780 --> 01:51:16,780
Then you can make something interesting and different

1582
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:19,420
it um

1583
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,540
Uh

1584
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:25,340
In well while I was in this hole. I found this uh fire emblem guy on youtube

1585
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,060
He most he mostly just like streams iron man

1586
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:32,460
Playthroughs of the game where like if a character dies you just keep going and those are fun

1587
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:36,300
But he has like a couple of video essays. You mean a normal playthrough. Yeah

1588
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:42,940
Yeah, but like uh, you know how like sometimes without resets. Yeah without resets. Yeah

1589
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:47,740
Yeah, so you just so you just I don't know. I feel like in a game like a fire emblem is like

1590
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:52,700
Like permadeath is like a major like thing about it. I feel like you would be I don't know

1591
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:56,860
I would feel compelled to not do any resets if I fucked up and someone died

1592
01:51:57,100 --> 01:52:00,220
I would feel like that would be that's how I play these fucking games and it's on

1593
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:06,300
I'm kind of I'm trying to find a way to to sort of shake shake my way out of it and just sort of move on

1594
01:52:06,860 --> 01:52:11,900
Wait, you you you do the reset. I do resets. Yeah, that's how I played. I mean no judgment

1595
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:14,300
I just think it would be more fun. No, no, it's fine

1596
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,860
Yeah, I think I'd be more fun if like the stakes would be higher. I'd be like a lot of judgments

1597
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
A lot of judgment on my side. True

1598
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:25,420
It's like um, you know nuzlocke sort of yeah

1599
01:52:26,220 --> 01:52:31,980
Stakes and that's like kind of the fun of the game is that is that you get you get like named characters with backstories and stuff

1600
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:35,020
But they can legit die. It's cool. It's a cool mechanic

1601
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,660
And if you like reset, you're not really

1602
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,380
Yeah, you're turning you're turning losing that character into losing progress

1603
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:47,180
Which is a it's still you know, it still sucks because like you can get through most of a chapter

1604
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:52,780
But if one of your guys dies, I think fuck when I was young I I never like considered

1605
01:52:53,580 --> 01:53:00,220
Continuing if a character died. Yeah, because I was always gonna be I was always afraid that later on in the game

1606
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,860
I would not have enough power to even

1607
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:10,540
Like stand any chance of winning and if you get all the way to the end there are like usually you get so many guys

1608
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:15,420
That I mean, yeah, but they I've never really

1609
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:21,740
Like I always reset if a character dies and I always try to maximize the amount of experience I get from every level

1610
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:27,500
Yeah, every every um mission or whatever. That's pretty much how I play it. That's kind of why that's kind of why I like

1611
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,740
I know it's like kind of a controversial

1612
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:35,740
Edition, but I like that the uh, the newer games have that sort of rewind time feature

1613
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,780
Oh, yeah, I guess it just saves time

1614
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,020
But it also like

1615
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:41,980
removes

1616
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:46,860
Because like losing time having to do things again is a punishment that you don't want to happen

1617
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:52,540
So it does raise the stakes and make you think more about what you're doing. Yeah, it's 100. That's definitely true

1618
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,020
Yeah, sure, but this was uh, this is like the video that kind of got me

1619
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:02,060
That that I thought was really good and and started making me think like oh geez

1620
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:06,300
Should I be making this fireman video? This guy knows like way more stuff about these games than I do

1621
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,500
So I just kind of been watching him

1622
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,700
The video you've been wanting to make already

1623
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,620
No, he hasn't

1624
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:16,780
There's not really there's not the thing is with

1625
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,380
I want to do a video on sacred stones because there's not really like a

1626
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:25,340
A video that kind of just like really goes into that game in particular

1627
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:28,380
I think it's kind of underrated

1628
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:33,820
I'm good. Um, you can still make your video and then just admit that like oh, I got a lot of my

1629
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:39,580
Information from this guy check him out. He's really cool. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I probably appreciate the shout out too

1630
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:49,660
I uh, I'm not like a funny gimmick. You could be like, uh, how can you beat fire emblem sacred stones without pressing up?

1631
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,300
something like that

1632
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:56,060
Let's find out gamers

1633
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:01,260
You get like 75% of the way through the game. It's like, oh you come

1634
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:04,700
That's not satisfying

1635
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:11,500
There's actually two areas where you just need to press up and that's it. So I flip the controller upside down and we're good

1636
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:15,580
Hack

1637
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,580
cheats tectonic cheats

1638
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:20,380
Take that. I do donkey kong

1639
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,060
Tropical freeze without using a single button just shaking the Wii remote

1640
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:29,100
Can can I play minecraft at high volume without waking up my mother? Let's find out

1641
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:32,300
No, no, I can't

1642
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:35,100
Wait, mom. No. No. It's a stream. It's a stream mom

1643
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:38,460
Oh god

1644
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:43,020
Um, damn, I have a can I get through the day without mentally breaking down?

1645
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:45,100
ha ha

1646
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,220
Yes

1647
01:55:46,220 --> 01:55:48,220
Because I'm built different

1648
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:53,740
Um, I built like a truck. Yeah, I have a happy truck. I have the opposite of depression

1649
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:56,380
I don't know what that is, but I'm pretty sure I have the opposite of it

1650
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:59,340
It's pretty epic. Uh

1651
01:56:00,220 --> 01:56:02,220
Oh pressure

1652
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:07,020
Yeah, oh pressure because I'm brown. Yes. Oh, yeah, I like

1653
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:12,940
Ethan Ethan Klein just tweeted uh to hold to hold the game stop line

1654
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,500
Uh pretty well now that he said it

1655
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,420
I was I was gonna sell but

1656
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:21,820
I mean

1657
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:24,220
Honestly, I I've been I've been having a lot of fun

1658
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:28,140
Just going on r slash wall street bets and seeing all the top posts that are just like

1659
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:35,180
I just poured in like $200,000 into game so hold the line and other people like I have literally a million dollars in game

1660
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:38,220
Stop. I'm not selling no matter what everybody holds

1661
01:56:38,860 --> 01:56:40,860
Uh, it's awesome

1662
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,860
Hold the line Bart

1663
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:45,420
Part of me part of me

1664
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:51,740
Part of me wishes I just put my entire fortune my fortune lull into uh like my whole my like all my money into game

1665
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:55,420
Stop, but no not again not after not after bitcoin

1666
01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:01,820
Not not if if if the stock you have in game stop becomes huge

1667
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,820
um

1668
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:07,820
Then maybe you could consider but like hold the line. Well, but then it'll be too late line for

1669
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:13,740
Yeah, I don't know that's that's the big question. Do you want to get a nice fat page?

1670
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:17,820
I want to get a do I want to get a lot of money or a little over the billionaires a little bit

1671
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:20,540
I do what the fucking billion is

1672
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:24,460
I mean if if the stock blows up, I will make a decent chunk of money

1673
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:29,020
I might I mean if it goes really high, I might make like a few thousand dollars, which would be pretty cool

1674
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:33,180
um, but uh, I don't know that's seemed that's like the most optimistic

1675
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:35,820
scenario

1676
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:38,140
I'll I'll be happy if I don't lose anything, you know

1677
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:41,260
That would be every day

1678
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:43,340
I honestly the thing I'm worried about is like

1679
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:47,580
Melvin liquidates they sell they they they buy back their shares

1680
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:54,140
The market like goes up and but I like I miss it and then like it like crashes back down immediately after and I'm like, oh

1681
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:56,060
It's too late

1682
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:58,060
melvin brother of the joker

1683
01:57:58,700 --> 01:58:00,700
melvin brother of the joker

1684
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
uh

1685
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:07,820
Hey, I think so i'm working let's check in on dogecoin dogecoin is

1686
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,540
It's bouncing back a little bit

1687
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:14,140
Check in on cheap cheap coin while you're out there cheap coin cheap coin

1688
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,860
Check it

1689
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:23,740
So so i'm working on a little analysis video. Well, it's it's like a how-to video on a

1690
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:29,420
On a on a very specific stream. Um, do you guys ever watch any of the adult swim live streams?

1691
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:33,020
Back when they would do them. Are those the ones where they pitch cartoon ideas?

1692
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:38,700
Oh, yes. Okay. Yeah, that's one specifically i'm talking about. Okay. There's a stream called development meeting

1693
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,100
And it's legit hosted by the

1694
01:58:41,820 --> 01:58:46,780
The head directors of development at adult swim like they're the hosts these these guys aren't like actors

1695
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:50,860
They're actually the development heads. Yeah, and every thursday you could call in

1696
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:55,900
And a picture idea for a cartoon, right? And i've been watching them for like

1697
01:58:56,540 --> 01:59:00,780
They've been doing it for two years and they but they like stop back in december because

1698
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:04,460
all the live streams got like um got cancelled because

1699
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:08,940
You know covet they can't afford to do them anymore. I guess change of ceo blah blah blah

1700
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:15,100
That'd be that being said i've been watching enough of them that i now understand the meta game that how to get a show

1701
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:20,140
Picked up. Oh, and i was gonna make yeah, i i was gonna make a video talking about how to do it

1702
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:24,300
I was originally gonna do it after i tried to pitch villain verse to them as a show

1703
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:28,300
But then he got but then you know stream got cancelled and i couldn't do it on time

1704
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:33,900
So i fucking uh, so i guess now why not now and i mean also i need more cloud anyway

1705
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:41,340
Might get me enough cloud you could be like that guy that told everyone to do community posts on youtube and that drives engagement up

1706
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:45,100
But for like adult swim

1707
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:51,020
Yeah, um my video was gonna be the video was gonna be called something like um how to get your own adult swim show

1708
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,580
Oh, perfect, and i i'm already clicking on it was good

1709
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:56,620
Yeah, yeah, the video i only written down like

1710
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:02,140
One fifth of it. I'm not gonna lie. It's been a while since i've seen any of the older streams

1711
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:07,820
Of it, so i'm gonna probably watch a couple of those while i work on villain versus this next week

1712
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:10,620
um

1713
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:12,380
But yeah

1714
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:13,580
Fuck i'm excited for that

1715
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:19,580
You know that um, you know that pan pizza went on to pitch a show while uh gendi tartikoski was on too as guests

1716
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:23,100
Yes, i heard of this and i heard it was bad

1717
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:29,660
It was it was bad. I was actually i was i actually gave him some like pointers and advice beforehand

1718
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:33,820
Um, i feel kind of bad. I could have given like better like advice, but um

1719
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:40,380
He did he did fumble and it was very it was hilarious not gonna lie pretty on brand he honor

1720
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:43,500
Yeah, it is pretty is very on brand like he on ironic

1721
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:45,980
There was a part where like

1722
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:52,380
Like the thing is that he just was too busy talking about the lore of his world instead of like talking about the actual show

1723
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:56,220
Like like when you go on you have to like specifically they're looking for

1724
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:59,500
They're looking for comedy they're looking for comedy shows

1725
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:05,660
They want comedy shows and they really want you to talk about like the characters and dynamics, right?

1726
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:09,500
If you could go on and describe the dynamic of your characters

1727
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:14,700
Um to to to tell somebody the good dynamic is when like you tell the host

1728
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:19,820
The dynamic and the host could already like figure out like stories with that dynamic. Yeah, right?

1729
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:24,620
That's when you know, you have a good show. Unfortunately. No one gives a fuck about your lore. It's

1730
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:27,740
Yeah, yeah, they gotta make them care surface love

1731
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:32,220
Yeah, I there's there was a whole point that like pan pizza was bringing up with his

1732
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:39,180
With his pitch where it's like, oh, you know in my world, uh, like they banged cartoon and they could have like half human

1733
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:41,180
half cartoon children and

1734
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:45,500
But here's the thing if you actually read his the comic like that literally has nothing to do with the plot

1735
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:48,380
And how okay, which how

1736
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:55,020
How does uh pan pizza's cartoon pitch compared to a mysterious mr. Enter's cartoon pitch

1737
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,900
Which one which one's more based?

1738
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:02,060
Here's here's the thing. Uh, this look. I love pan pizza. He's a friend of mine

1739
02:02:02,620 --> 02:02:06,700
Um, that that being said I could see I could miss fruit

1740
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:13,180
Through full force of will I could probably see mr. Mr. Enter getting at least some

1741
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:17,420
Not not getting an actual show on a network, but actually getting like a pilot

1742
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,980
done

1743
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:24,860
Like maybe before pan because like at least mr. With mr. Enter

1744
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:29,980
It's kind of like he's just like at this point. He admits it's a terrible idea, but he's still gonna do it

1745
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:40,540
Yeah, like he he admitted that like, oh, yeah, this is gonna make no money at all. I'm still gonna do this pilot

1746
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:42,620
What a fucking idiot. It's like god. No, that's

1747
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:45,580
Idiot

1748
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:49,180
It's this weird kind of like

1749
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:53,580
Throw your fucking baby right out with that bath water and get a new baby and new bath water

1750
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:58,060
I don't know like when like there's something interesting about like when someone has an incredibly

1751
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:02,380
Bad story or something but still wants to go through with it. Like oh my god

1752
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:05,980
Like this this probably means something more to them than people realize

1753
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:09,100
No, I don't want to know which one is going to get made. I want to know which one was better

1754
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:15,260
Oh, well, like I mean it's different because mr. Enter didn't go on like the development meaning to pitch it

1755
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:19,900
Um, we have a lot to go on with pans. Anyway, no different versions of the same story

1756
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:25,420
Uh, yeah, pan just keeps soft rebooting it. But the the general gist is that um

1757
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,860
Uh, I think pans has a stronger

1758
02:03:29,420 --> 02:03:32,940
Premise it the thing is that I think the premise is very good with pans thing

1759
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:37,580
The problem is that like the characters don't have a strong dynamic because it's like

1760
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:42,220
Oh, there's like a little like pan described this character that had a bunch of assholes

1761
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:47,100
But if you read the comic, it's like they're not really assholes. They're just kind of like regular people

1762
02:03:47,740 --> 02:03:51,820
Maybe if like one maybe if one was a piece of shit and one was a straight man

1763
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:56,860
It'd be a lot better of a dynamic, but it's not they're very like I don't know. They're very normal

1764
02:03:57,820 --> 02:03:59,180
Um

1765
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:06,460
Well, I'll gonna I'll say this right now. I'm definitely not going to go and read pan pizzas cartoon pitch treatment

1766
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:09,180
I don't know

1767
02:04:10,780 --> 02:04:12,780
It's on a it's on a stream you could um

1768
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:14,780
You could watch actually I'll link it right now

1769
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:19,340
I can't like I can barely watch that like that toy story. Let's play

1770
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:24,060
I can't watch like him like bombing live in front of industry veterans

1771
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:29,340
Oh, wait, wait, wait, you get to see him like do a pitch live

1772
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:33,260
Yeah, it's like a live stream. They did not hear me. Okay. That's a little interesting

1773
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:39,740
Adult swim hosts like a live stream where they just get on like random. Okay, cool. I here's a link with it timestamp

1774
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:47,420
Um, it this is when pan pizza jumps in and he starts pitching it and it's like, oh my god, this guy fumbles oof

1775
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:51,820
And um, it's so funny because like at the end after he gets off

1776
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:56,460
Uh, gendi tarakoski is on the stream to as guest hosts also mike laszlo

1777
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:58,860
former c

1778
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:00,860
It's lasso from camp lasso

1779
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,660
Mike lasso, I mean

1780
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:07,980
Mike lasso and who's the former CEO right former

1781
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:13,820
CEO adult swim. Yeah, and um, and the thing is after pan pizza leaves, um, again

1782
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:16,620
He said something very interesting about his pitch like he says like

1783
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:20,220
um, the problem with like pan pizza's pitch was that

1784
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:27,020
Um, it's like it's like if you're trying to sell someone on finding on finding Nemo and you tell them it's about the ocean

1785
02:05:27,980 --> 02:05:33,820
I see, you know what that in a way, maybe it's good. He bond because that's really that's

1786
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:37,020
Uh, that's pretty profound

1787
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:41,900
Yeah, that's uh, that's I know exactly what that means

1788
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:44,860
Yes, I have lots of insight. Hmm quite

1789
02:05:45,580 --> 02:05:47,580
I get it. I get it though

1790
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:53,740
So you're so as you're saying that pan was like focused on like the setting and the premise but not on like the story of it

1791
02:05:54,060 --> 02:06:00,060
Right. Yeah, like he like I've talked to pans. I've been in like I I actually been helping him a lot with uh

1792
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:01,580
this

1793
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:06,780
With the comic as much as like as much as I can to the point where like if I do more than what I do

1794
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:12,140
He's gonna have to start like paying me or put me on as a co-writer or or that would be just terrible

1795
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:15,740
Put more critiques and capitalism in and then maybe I'll keep doing it for free

1796
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:19,260
Yeah, exactly. Um, no, but um, no actually

1797
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:23,260
I wonder if you can pay me in price. I already told other people actually

1798
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:26,940
I actually asked pan like look

1799
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,620
I actually asked pan like look

1800
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:33,820
I could probably help you like really rough out the story a lot more if you put me on as co-writer or something

1801
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:37,900
Because like at this point it's like too the stuff I'm doing the stuff I would suggest

1802
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:43,260
Would just be too much that it's like to put in this much effort. I would need something in return

1803
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:47,340
Right and I and I asked him about that and he's and he's not like, I don't know

1804
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,060
It wasn't down, but whatever

1805
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:52,540
Yeah, I already got my own comics

1806
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:54,540
um

1807
02:06:54,540 --> 02:07:00,140
So wait, can I I can I just say can I say that pan pizza is not a good artist?

1808
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:02,540
damn

1809
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:04,540
I like his art. I don't

1810
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:10,860
I I don't even know what it is. Pan pizzas are pan pizzas artists like yours, but worse cheesy like yours, but like way worse

1811
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:14,220
I don't know if I agree

1812
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:19,740
Is art kind of reminds me of uh wonder waffle and I like wonder waffles like uh, it's worse than that too

1813
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:27,340
Oh, no, no, and I'm talking shit about my boy wonder waffle. I mean, I don't I mean, I'm pretty neutral on wonder waffle

1814
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:34,140
Hold up. I'll show you some of wonder this development meeting thing. Yeah, is this something anyone can do?

1815
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:39,980
Um, not anymore because the stream is over, but yeah, anyone could do anyone could jump on and pitch their idea

1816
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:42,140
Are they starting it up again?

1817
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:45,100
Uh, hopefully

1818
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:51,420
But there has been no word about it. They do in the last episode they mentioned that they would be so down to come back

1819
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:55,020
But at this point, I don't think they can afford to do the live streams

1820
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:58,140
Uh, wait a second. Here's here's wonder waffles art

1821
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,100
Uh, and I think it's really good

1822
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,260
Yeah, that's pretty good

1823
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:06,460
I don't I don't I feel like

1824
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:09,420
I feel like pan pizzas art

1825
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:15,020
Is probably like if he wants to do comics, he's gonna have to like rearrange the art a little bit better

1826
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:18,380
But um, you mean he looks like he's drawing

1827
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:22,220
For animation, but he's not

1828
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:27,420
And it's it's bad. I think he majored in uh, I think he majored in

1829
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:32,380
Graphic designing or something. These are made these look like they're made to be flash puppets, but they're not

1830
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:36,620
I I google pan pizza and it is images of pizza

1831
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:39,420
A rebel rebel taxi pan pizza

1832
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:46,620
Because the channel is called the rebel tag. Look at this. I'm looking at the stream. I'm looking at the

1833
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:51,260
I'm looking at the pitch document images. I'm sorry. These are garbage

1834
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:58,380
These are garbage. They're trash. I think my biggest issue with pans art isn't the quality of the art itself

1835
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:04,140
It's that it's the thing cheesy said is that like it's kind of hard to tell what's happening with his characters

1836
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:10,700
I I can't I can't get over the quality of the art. That's honestly, that's it. That's that's all that's all I need to see

1837
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:12,780
I'm not even gonna think about it any further

1838
02:09:13,740 --> 02:09:15,740
I'm mad. I'm actually mad

1839
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:24,460
You know, you know me like I like the majority of artists. I don't think there's any artists. I this means you have no standards

1840
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:30,460
Wow, okay. That's like that's like you're like the jake. You're like the jake english with movies

1841
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,180
Wow, okay

1842
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,100
Fuck you

1843
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:44,380
Who's jake english? He's the guy. He's the homestuck guy from he's from x6. I don't know. He's the he's he's he's all

1844
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:49,260
He's all he fuck you die. He's all grandpa. He's all timeline grandpa. Did you watch homestuck?

1845
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:57,820
I watched I was one day in like high school. I was like, you know what I hear I hear a lot talk about homestuck

1846
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:03,420
I think I'm gonna get into homestuck and I went on my tablet and I went to homestuck.com and I couldn't get past the first panel

1847
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:06,300
I literally got stuck

1848
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:11,420
Shut the fuck up. Oh, it's not very good. Yeah, that's because it's not very good

1849
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,740
That was like that was a complete

1850
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:22,060
Yeah, of course, of course, that's bad idiot

1851
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:32,140
That was so like, you know blonde beard guy. Yes, like homestuck already's bad. Yes

1852
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,100
Wait, what do you know?

1853
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,700
We know wait, this is wonder waffle by the way

1854
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:42,700
Oh, why do you keep showing me? I don't care. I don't care about wonder waffle

1855
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:52,140
Uh wonder waffle is great my wonder wonderful. He's awesome. Why do you even what honestly? Why why is why are we even talking about wonder waffle?

1856
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:54,140
Who gives a shit?

1857
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,540
Oh

1858
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:11,420
Also, I thought I thought wonder waffle was a girl. Well, yeah, that's that happens a lot mostly because his avatar is his little robot girl

1859
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:14,060
Yeah, uh, oh well

1860
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:15,260
Oh, well

1861
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:16,380
Oh, well

1862
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:21,260
So anyway, I'm working on it. I'm working on analysis video talking about how to win at

1863
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:25,740
Making a pitch like what's like the killer things you need to do to to get

1864
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:28,460
How to game

1865
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:33,820
I don't know but here's the thing here's that's going to be like the end joke like at the end

1866
02:11:33,820 --> 02:11:39,980
It's going to be like, oh you ready to do your pitch now. Well too bad. It's canceled. You can't do it. It's too late

1867
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,820
Owned

1868
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,820
Classic cheesy tricking people

1869
02:11:45,820 --> 02:11:49,580
Tricking people to watching my content and then at the very end I'd be like

1870
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:52,860
It's canceled now villain versus never going to be a show

1871
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:55,580
And that's how I sneak in the little the little ad

1872
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:00,940
Sneak it in. Yeah, you know a little

1873
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:05,580
Never happen all because wink

1874
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:08,860
Wake villain first. What's that?

1875
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:12,060
Oh

1876
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:17,180
I don't think you need to sneak it in. I think it's better if you just say also read my comic you fuck

1877
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,660
You just say that

1878
02:12:19,660 --> 02:12:21,660
Okay, I'll do that

1879
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:25,180
If you sneak it in it seems like you got something to hide

1880
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:27,260
So I'm a sneaky guy. I'm a I'm a

1881
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:33,420
I might you might call me a villain if you will. I'm a sneaky little villain. I sink in my ad

1882
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:36,140
You might be calling a villain a verse

1883
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:38,940
I'm a verse to

1884
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:44,620
Here's my verse on villainy if you will an unverse they call you might call me a stinky little piece of shit

1885
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:47,420
You know a villain

1886
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:50,860
Oh god

1887
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:57,820
I was looking at my comic lord of ghosts and I was like, oh, this is pretty good. How many um chapters are there a lot of ghosts?

1888
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:01,020
Uh

1889
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:03,180
The chapters

1890
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:06,860
Let me five I think give and take dot site

1891
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:13,980
Click that in click that in right now everybody. All right. I'll do play along. All right. Uh, given given date

1892
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:16,940

1893
02:13:17,180 --> 02:13:19,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah wrong

1894
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:21,180
Um

1895
02:13:21,740 --> 02:13:29,740
Given take trans is the first thing on uh google six seven seven chapters and 94 pages so far

1896
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:35,020
Tell me on the lord of ghosts. Why should I read it?

1897
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:42,620
Um, the lord of ghosts is about a ghostly person who is uh

1898
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:45,740
He's so fucking quirky though

1899
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:48,380
um

1900
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:50,460
He right there's a world that's uh

1901
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:56,380
There's slime and there's no no you're talking about the ocean. You're talking about the ocean. Don't talk about the ocean

1902
02:13:56,860 --> 02:14:01,020
Um, don't uh, can you go for an episode of the lord of ghosts?

1903
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:04,860
Can I go for an episode? Yes

1904
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:08,780
I don't know what that means never never mind. It's a bit. Okay

1905
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:13,580
Yeah, last you're logic. You're sorry. That's it. You're five minutes are over

1906
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:17,900
Doesn't make grammatical sense what that's you are the weakest

1907
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:23,500
Give when you pitch when you pitch when you pitch you gotta gotta go in with the log line

1908
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:27,820
You gotta give the log line. You gotta talk about the dynamic. I know that if you said give me the log line

1909
02:14:27,820 --> 02:14:30,060
I would have known what okay. Give me the talking about

1910
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:38,540
Oh lord of ghosts is a ghost trying to remember his past and and uh, he's uh swept up in lots of

1911
02:14:39,420 --> 02:14:45,900
Little adventures and he's he just wants people to be dead. He just wants people to be dead and that's so much to us

1912
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:48,700
That's good. That's good. Okay. He what is there like a

1913
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:52,540
No, he wants everyone to be dead like him. That's good. What what's the stakes?

1914
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:54,940
What's the stakes in the lord of ghosts?

1915
02:14:55,820 --> 02:14:57,820
Um through the heart he's gonna he's gotta

1916
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:02,300
He's gotta is a little ghost gotta find his way home little ghost gotta find his way home

1917
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:05,980
You're in okay, so a little ghost gotta find his way home and also make sure everyone's dead

1918
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:08,220
Yeah

1919
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:13,500
Yeah, the most the most we could give you is 10 seasons. You think that's gonna be enough to tell the story

1920
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:20,060
Uh, I'll have to no deal have to cut out. I have to cut out some of the uh, some filler have to cut out some of my

1921
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:22,540
My my bonus content, but

1922
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:30,460
Ten seasons lord of ghosts lord of ghosts is a one season long anime squeezed into 10 seasons

1923
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,340
Just like the hobbit movies

1924
02:15:33,660 --> 02:15:35,420
Yeah

1925
02:15:35,420 --> 02:15:38,380
Was it the battle of the 500 000 armies?

1926
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,900
I can't I want to do a lot of armies fighting each other

1927
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:48,460
Like five armies. That's kind of like a lot of

1928
02:15:50,140 --> 02:15:52,460
How do you even fit that many armies in one battle?

1929
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:59,820
Oh, because they're all hobbits. That's why because they're small enough. Oh, they're all hobbits. I thought they could have five armies

1930
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:06,620
Makes sense. Yeah, five armies is is fine. But you know, if the if they're made of small people that makes them

1931
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:15,100
One hobbit one human is like three hobbits, right? So you can have like five armies. Yeah. Yeah

1932
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:28,220
Anyway, go read lord of ghosts on gibbon take dot site. Yeah, I agree. There's my pitch

1933
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:34,300
I I I want to get back to to finishing it because it sort of ends right now on a cliffhanger

1934
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:39,020
There was supposed to be something that happens afterwards, but it's changed in my mind since then I need to rewrite it

1935
02:16:44,220 --> 02:16:46,220
Just recently I dropped

1936
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:47,900
it's been

1937
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:49,900
A year and I and I dropped another

1938
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,540
comic on bongo and luna on webtoons

1939
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:59,180
But this comic was talking about how like hey, I'll bring back bongo and luna if my patreon reaches the 200 dollars

1940
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:03,580
And um, it has not but it did reach to 100 finally

1941
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:08,460
That's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah, uh, but apart bongo and luna should become

1942
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:16,540
Like a political platform. They should talk exclusively about how capitalism is fucking stupid. I just I just might

1943
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:20,060
Yeah, yeah, they should they should be one of those

1944
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:21,660
cartoonist

1945
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:24,540
Like bread panels. Yeah, bread. Yeah bread

1946
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:31,340
Bread a bread tuner. Yeah, bongo luna is already bad. So I just got to add the politics and it won't change. It won't change

1947
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:33,500
It won't change at all

1948
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:35,820
Should be like

1949
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:40,380
Luna stop squeezing my tits instead. We got to squeeze these greedy capitalists out of all their money

1950
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:44,620
You gotta squeeze we gotta squeeze the short on game stop luna

1951
02:17:44,860 --> 02:17:46,860
Uh

1952
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:49,820
Luna stop looking at my ass instead. We gotta look at the crimes that the

1953
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:55,580
And start and start looking at these green candles on the wall street exchange

1954
02:17:57,020 --> 02:17:58,460
dude

1955
02:17:58,460 --> 02:18:03,820
Something really funny about like the exact same way of like hey

1956
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:09,340
Stop looking at my ass stop looking at my tits like every single comic exactly starts the same way

1957
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:16,620
Like entirely sexual. It's like instead of that. How about this political idea like cutting all of the like the nuance and the

1958
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:23,020
Subtiffusion, you know the sleight of hand out of it. It's just like power one sex panel two politics

1959
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:27,660
Luna stop jerking off. We got to get rid of these jerks off of wall street

1960
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:31,580
Yeah, I ironically do that. That would be really

1961
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:38,780
Luna stop looking at my ass remember how bill clinton bombed that that pharmaceuticals plant in syria

1962
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:43,260
Whatever reminds me of there is a comic like like that

1963
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:45,340
I think where it's like this one girl

1964
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:49,100
Like the first panel would be like a guy is being like like hey, hey, baby

1965
02:18:49,180 --> 02:18:53,420
You want to suck my dick and then the girl like kills them and that's like every comic

1966
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:58,220
It's just like she does she like violently murder. Yeah. Yeah. It's so funny. I think I've seen that

1967
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:01,900
I think my my favorite one is like where she's like in the first panel

1968
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:06,460
She's hanging out with like a guy friend and this guy called a race car johnny

1969
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:10,620
Like in the in the first panel and then and then she's all like all right

1970
02:19:10,860 --> 02:19:12,540
That was a that was a great dinner guys

1971
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:18,540
I'll see you guys later and then race and then the the male character like shakes race cars johnny's hand

1972
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:21,820
And then hugs the girl and then the girl says hey, wait a second

1973
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:25,980
Did you did you shake his hand because he's a guy and hugged me because i'm a girl and the guys and the male

1974
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:30,220
The male friend's like uh, uh and in the third panel she like punches him

1975
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:36,220
But then race car race car johnny's like right there too and all race car johnny says is room room

1976
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:38,460
room room

1977
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:43,980

1997
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:50,780
um, so what he does

1998
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:52,940
is say a

1999
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:54,940
long-running narrative

2000
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,620
animatic

2001
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:03,340
Which isn't an animation. It's like a a comic or a storyboard, but uh, narrated

2002
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:05,340
You know

Is about him the creator

2005
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:17,100
In college in art school not having any fucking idea what he's doing with his life

2006
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:20,860
Or why he is there and it's about you know

2007
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:26,060
Motivating yourself in like a post jesus society

2008
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:30,940
You know what the fuck uh finding your purpose or whatever

2009
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:35,180
Uh, it's great is full of pathos pathos

2010
02:21:36,060 --> 02:21:38,060
It's a long-running narrative

2011
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:39,980
um

2012
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:41,660
so, you know

2013
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:47,820
You can start with the first episode or there's one about uh working at walmart. It's great

2014
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:53,260
And it can be a good place to like you know meet the character get familiar with the feel

2015
02:21:53,820 --> 02:21:58,140
Which is uh number 19 called where you're going uh watch it

2016
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:00,860
I think i've seen this before

2017
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:07,500
So he just somewhere he just this is a really kind of cool channel idea. He just shows on the youtube channel

2018
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:10,700
No, wait, so this is um

2019
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:12,860
Is it like

2020
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:14,460
inspirational content?

2021
02:22:14,460 --> 02:22:19,420
If he is he could be doing way better. Is it like inspirational stuff? Is it like just bio comics basically?

2022
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:27,420
Yeah, autobi. He's the original story time animator says his twitter profile. So yeah, it's it's like the story time

2023
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:33,980
YouTube videos, but it seems like it seems like obviously this guy was doing it for fucking longest years ago

2024
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:36,540
2013 I think

2025
02:22:38,140 --> 02:22:41,660
This is pretty cool honestly that voicemail. However

2026
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:45,180
Needed more lo-fi hip-hop and editing

2027
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:49,740
His last technical day of episode was three weeks ago, huh?

2028
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:55,420
I don't know. I hate autobiocomics on principle. So I think yeah

2029
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:57,980
Yeah

2030
02:22:58,140 --> 02:23:00,700
Isn't isn't one of your comics? Yeah, I never made another one

2031
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:04,220
Um, is it like vapors kind of autobi?

2032
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:07,660
No

2033
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:11,260
This is veneer. That's right. That's what yes

2034
02:23:11,740 --> 02:23:17,820
Is at least at least have the day had the decency to pretend that you're not just writing about yourself. That's what that's all

2035
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:20,700
It's totally not actually

2036
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:27,980
All fiction isn't always like always just about the author. Yeah, first of all, Vincent is white. Okay, so there

2037
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:31,500
That should be the dead giveaway. That's it's literally not me

2038
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:34,060
um

2039
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:36,060
Okay, okay, so

2040
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:41,260
Next one is called is another is tommy j. What the fuck is an LLC?

2041
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:43,900
three two one

2042
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:44,860
go

2043
02:23:44,860 --> 02:23:46,860
Does anybody know like

2044
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:54,300
Where corporations even came from like where we got this idea that an organization

2045
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:57,020
became like a person

2046
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:59,420
Like a legal person

2047
02:24:00,620 --> 02:24:03,900
How does nobody like they must have done this on purpose, right?

2048
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:09,500
Like I don't see how you couldn't foresee this as soon as you made something like this

2049
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:14,060
The people who made it who made the fucking the corporation

2050
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:18,380
They're literally called limited liability companies or some shit like it's like

2051
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:24,700
Created specifically the entire concept is just that whenever anything goes wrong

2052
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:29,740
Whenever your pollution like kills a bunch of children or something you just disappear

2053
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:32,060
You just resign you jump ship

2054
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:35,020
and pass all the bullshit on

2055
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:37,500
to your

2056
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:42,620
Your your the shareholders who don't see a company coming. We're probably like

2057
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:46,780
LLCs are probably massive investors from the middle class and

2058
02:24:47,340 --> 02:24:53,660
You pass it on to your employees and you pass it on to your customers and let them deal with the bullshit, you know

2059
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:58,140
How yeah for real how or just you know

2060
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:02,940
The shit you cause just never gets resolved and the victims just just just sit there

2061
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:05,580
Be poisoned or whatever

2062
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:08,540
I give welcome back. Why how?

2063
02:25:09,340 --> 02:25:12,460
It's it's cancer kill it kill corporations

2064
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:18,220
That was that was a great voicemail. Uh, next one up is uh, Tommy jay. What the fuck?

2065
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:21,500
What the fuck is an what the fuck is an LLC part two?

2066
02:25:21,980 --> 02:25:23,580
Jesus Christ

2067
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:27,740
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Not this one. Not this one. Uh, it is

2068
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:32,860
Yeah, what the fuck is an LLC part two? Uh, three two one go

2069
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:37,180
Honestly, the worst part maybe I don't know. There's lots of bad

2070
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:39,900
A bad part is it I hope you guys are ready?

2071
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:45,260
I hope you guys are ready for what the fuck is an LLC part three after this and none of the ways that are like

2072
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:50,620
A detriment to being a person like if an american person

2073
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:57,580
Went over to china and just like kidnapped a person a chinese person

2074
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:04,220
And just forced them to put together plastic crap for them until they wanted to kill themselves and jumped out a window

2075
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:10,140
And landed in a suicide nest net then like when that person got back to the u.s

2076
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:15,980
They'd be extradited to china and then face consequences for that shit that they did

2077
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:20,860
But a corporation just gets to use magical bullshit

2078
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:26,380
You know what? I like legally nonsense to avoid those those repercussions

2079
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:33,100
You know, it's it's bad. It's honestly. This is very basic shit with power

2080
02:26:33,260 --> 02:26:38,300
Maybe if comes responsibility with right comes the responsibility for the shit that you do

2081
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:44,220
I'm going to kill you. Um, how how the thing is that it's in the name. It's a limited life

2082
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:47,820
So the liability is limited so they can't get in trouble. Here we go

2083
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:52,220
Limited my ability makes you think

2084
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:58,540
Make really really does really does make thank you the voicemail. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but look at this

2085
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:01,740
Look at look at this image and tell me that this is okay

2086
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:08,060
This is fine. Dude. It's wait. Yes. Yes. That's like that was in the pitch. That was in the pitch

2087
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:16,060
Oh, I don't like that. I don't like it either very hound. What is this is a picture? This is a picture reference

2088
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:20,700
Why do white girls always want to fuck dogs? Oh my god, it is

2089
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:28,940
Oh wait, you're a white girl and I know it's hard, but you gotta stop banging dogs

2090
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:38,140
You guys know that song? Hold up. You can rely on the white man's come. You can oh, that was a song created

2091
02:27:39,020 --> 02:27:45,740
That was a song created by like, uh, my my friend a yellow swag. He made he made this song about white girls. Hold up

2092
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,900
I only oh mr. Yellow

2093
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:55,980
I love this guy. I interviewed him on a couple cheesy counts ago. Oh, oh, I know this guy. Yeah on twitter

2094
02:27:56,700 --> 02:27:58,700
Yeah, he's cool. Love him

2095
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:01,660
um

2096
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:04,860
Hey, tell whoever that is in the background a shout out

2097
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:07,260
It's a dog. Um

2098
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:13,500
Oh, okay. Next one is uh, tommy j. What the fuck is an llc part three? Oh my god. I'm gonna talk over this

2099
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:17,660
Three two the thrilling conclusions three two one go

2100
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:24,220
Okay, so while this goes i'm just going to find more, uh screenshots of terrible pan pizza art

2101
02:28:24,700 --> 02:28:28,940
Uh to prove my point and if a if a corporation is a person

2102
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:31,260
I did

2103
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:37,740
The income tax rate that like a person actually gonna you know, he has a podcast called a special tax rate that

2104
02:28:38,140 --> 02:28:43,340
I think it's lower, right? I'm can't I can't hear you over tommy. It's awesome. I have to declare war

2105
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:46,460
I'm interested in what he has to say to us or whatever

2106
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:49,660
deductible what if tommy j is actually saying very

2107
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:56,940
Profound things about the concept. He might be a real person, but his presentation is very dull for me

2108
02:28:56,940 --> 02:29:03,020
That i'm not interested. I'm sorry tommy j. It's all it's all wrong. Nothing against you. I think it might I probably agree with you

2109
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:07,020
Everything I'm always gonna tell you this right now. I probably agree with everything you have to say

2110
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:09,340
except indie games

2111
02:29:09,340 --> 02:29:15,500
And like dudes on pay but patreon is bullshit. So even the dudes on on patreon are

2112
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:21,580
Like knee deep in the bullshit. They're not making the bullshit, but they're in it. Does pan have a

2113
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:24,220
They're on a foundation

2114
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:29,180
Probably be able to put something together with like a fucking public bitcoin

2115
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:36,540
I don't know what i'm fucking talking about. I just know it's all bullshit. It's all okay. I found the trouble

2116
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:39,420
It's all a lie

2117
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:43,980
It's been talked on this podcast of like investing

2118
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:45,740
in

2119
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:49,020
These in these these mutual funds. Okay, look at this

2120
02:29:49,500 --> 02:29:50,700
Um

2121
02:29:50,700 --> 02:29:52,700
Look at this. I don't know

2122
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:58,140
The money's not real. So who cares it looks like a smear frame drawings aren't real

2123
02:29:58,460 --> 02:30:03,500
That looks like a like a murdoch from gorillas smear frame. This is like this is like

2124
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:10,380
I don't know this I can see he's going for like a for like a fairly odd parents like very graphic designy look

2125
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:13,260
But like it's just shit. I don't know like he just failed at it

2126
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:14,860
I did

2127
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:17,820
How is it that butch Hartman's art has like regressed

2128
02:30:18,460 --> 02:30:21,820
Over the years because like dany phantom and fairly odd parents the guy who does

2129
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:27,340
But then you see him draw the characters now the thing is that he didn't even really design those cartoons

2130
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:31,260
It was uh, steven silver. I know he wasn't really big on dany phantom

2131
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:33,900
Like a big part of it

2132
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:39,100
So that was me. I'm really pitchy pitch dany phantom. I assume he drew the original cosmon wand

2133
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:42,940
Yeah, he um, he pitched dany phantom and fairly odd parents

2134
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,020
um

2135
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:51,340
I just remember reading that that uh, someone else whose name I obviously don't remember. So that's that's the guy who is

2136
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:55,020
That's the guy's style and he's he's also the guy behind other kim possible

2137
02:30:56,700 --> 02:31:01,900
Oh, that's shit. That makes sense. Yeah, he sounds like a cool dude. Um, I like butch Hartman

2138
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:04,460
Is more of a rude dude

2139
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:08,540
It's could be worse could be junkay. Okay

2140
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:14,140
Uh, dude instead of that look at look at one of my favorite pages from the lord of ghosts

2141
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:17,020
Wait, oh, this is a cool page. I like this

2142
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:24,140
I don't even wait. I don't even remember this one to slime city. It's very near the end. Yeah, haunt haunt dude. I love this

2143
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:30,060
Oh, this is so fucking cool. I got it. The lord of ghosts is so good

2144
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,100
Makes me happy

2145
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:35,340
Yeah, but I think um

2146
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:39,340
I think it's just a draw more comics and I'm not talking necessarily like

2147
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:41,980
Loki rl like you need to better

2148
02:31:42,700 --> 02:31:44,700
understanding of like

2149
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:51,100
Images within panels you get me. I guess cinematography panel

2150
02:31:55,580 --> 02:32:01,260
Are you still looking I mean are you still looking man? Yeah. Yeah, I'm still I'm just going through his tumblr and like

2151
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:03,660
some of these are okay

2152
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:05,980
I would say his art range is from okay to bad

2153
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:09,660
I

2154
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:12,220
I want to say I want to say that I

2155
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:15,260
I like yeah, I think it's fine. It's just that it might not be the best

2156
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:21,020
For a comic or to do a comic consistently. It does take him like a couple of months to do at least one

2157
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:22,780
issue

2158
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:24,780
Then again, I think that's a majority of people

2159
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:27,820
I I think that his art

2160
02:32:27,900 --> 02:32:29,900
would look better

2161
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:31,820
in like an

2162
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:35,500
It's like he's drawing for animation, but he's not so it just looks like shit

2163
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:41,100
That's that's what I think doesn't work about it. I'm trying to remember. I don't well. No, there's more to it than that

2164
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:43,100
I just think he has like a shit like um

2165
02:32:43,660 --> 02:32:45,660
sensibility of like what looks cool

2166
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:49,020
Uh in in addition to his like misguided

2167
02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:53,340
It's just misguided uh, uh, uh, you know technique in general

2168
02:32:54,540 --> 02:33:00,140
Individual lines look pretty good, but the the whole okay doesn't really work. What is this?

2169
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:03,500
Like what what is this on the right?

2170
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:08,220
That's uh that one chick from myzakin

2171
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:11,340
Yes, I know but it's it's garbage

2172
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:13,820
an idiot

2173
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:17,020
Yes, it's like uh, you know, I think I think

2174
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:22,940
I can tell that he's going for he's just sort of failed on on like capturing the

2175
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:24,780
like

2176
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:27,260
It just sort of feels like she she's melting

2177
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:31,660
Like it's it's going for like why I know it's I know it's going for a squash and stretch

2178
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:36,940
It's going for a squash and stretch, but it doesn't look good. There's like uh, it's not just design is a word

2179
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:42,540
There's like a full style. There's like a philosophy thing, but he's going like half measure. It's not like it's

2180
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:46,860
Stylistic enough to feel like it's deliberate. It feels like he just fucked up

2181
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:50,140
It is feel like it's half it's half measured. Okay. What really pisses

2182
02:33:50,380 --> 02:33:55,820
Okay, the line of action like look at the arms like the the the arm behind the body

2183
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:58,540
The arm behind the body

2184
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:05,180
Like it's like curving in in like the same direction. I just noticed. Yeah, like the way the arms are positioned is very strange

2185
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:09,340
Like I can tell he did he drew it as like a it's got like this

2186
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:14,460
It's like an over adherence to like the line of action like if you look at the silhouette

2187
02:34:14,460 --> 02:34:17,820
It just looks like it's like a blob that sort of curves from the left to the right

2188
02:34:18,380 --> 02:34:21,580
And like the arm follows that line, but it doesn't actually look right

2189
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:26,140
It it's it's like he's trying to okay. Wait hold up. You guys ever seen this. This is like uh

2190
02:34:26,620 --> 02:34:30,140
Yeah, this for the cartoon one over yonder and it's kind of like lava theory

2191
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:33,100
It sounds like a spongebob video

2192
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:36,060
It's like how kind of like certain shapes of characters like

2193
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:41,100
Fill into each other when they're standing next to each other and I feel like pan is trying to do something

2194
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:44,460
Similar, but a lot a lot of times it feels like a lot of the lines

2195
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:49,500
Contradict each other almost. Oh, you got me. I got I found another one

2196
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:51,980
God, I found another one

2197
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:58,060
I like the machete drawing. I think that one's pretty. Yeah, the machete one's okay. And the the bionicle is okay

2198
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:04,860
Oh, that one this one's old this this comic is like this is like the probably look at that hand second or third incarnation

2199
02:35:05,260 --> 02:35:10,060
Okay, I mean this is from this is 11 months ago. He posted this 11 months ago

2200
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:16,060
I think this is a repost maybe okay, maybe whatever. Well, it looks terrible

2201
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:21,180
All right, if it's if it's not representative of his style then fine, but I think it is

2202
02:35:22,860 --> 02:35:25,580
It's it's whatever, you know, okay, you know what?

2203
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:32,860
Um, how about how about we all cool our heads as we listen to tommy j. What the fuck is anything?

2204
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:37,100
Um, oh my god three. This one better be short. Nope

2205
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:42,620

2206
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:47,500
Hey, stop this. Um, you mean, you know, we don't have to listen to these, right?

2228
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:26,940
Was empathetic the other week in the first voicemail. I said because I cringed at him losing bitcoin

2229
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:30,780
I would like to think I'm an empathetic person. Anyway today

2230
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:33,340
What this week what I cringed that

2231
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:39,580
Is the fact that I have to go get a covid test because my mom got covid

2232
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:41,980
She's gonna be okay. She's recovering

2233
02:37:42,700 --> 02:37:45,420
But she was very sick and now I have to go get a test

2234
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:51,180
See if I'm sick because I live with her. So that's gonna be fun. I have to get the long thing up my nose

2235
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:53,260
I'm not excited about it. Oh

2236
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:56,060
Um, but I'll be okay. I'll survive

2237
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:02,140
Um, what I bing would you bing? What do you bing this week was um

2238
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:08,460
I binged uh, I binged some episodes of avatar the last year, but I'm not familiar with this one

2239
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:14,620
I listened to the podcast at work and they shut up. I'm trying to listen to cringis bingus

2240
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:18,620
Uh, but some of those early episodes are kind of are kind of silly cartoony

2241
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:22,300
But it's a good show still I think I like it

2242
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:26,780
Uh, cringis bingus signing off. Goodbye. I'll see you next week

2243
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:28,780
Cringis

2244
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:33,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, cringis cringis if you're listening to this right now

2245
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:35,820
I want your opinion on the pan peaks of art style

2246
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:39,260
Yes, absolutely. Please. Cringis bing

2247
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:45,180
Cringis call next time and tell us your opinion on pan peaks of art style. I'm really interested

2248
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:47,500
What show did he say he binged?

2249
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:54,140
I'm sorry, Ben. I wasn't listening. Fuck all of you. I'm going back. I'm listening again

2250
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:58,460
All right, we'll wait on you. Thank you to do that when I bing

2251
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:05,180
It was the early episodes of avatar. Oh my god, shut up. I'm trying to fucking listen die

2252
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:12,220
It was avatar the last airbender lol fucking christ

2253
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:18,460
He is right though. The early episodes are kind of I wouldn't say they're cring, but they are but

2254
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:21,100
But they're they're definitely rough

2255
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:25,820
Uh, or just like they're definitely he's right. Um, like average kids show

2256
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:32,620
I'm sorry for my internet keeps clicking out. That's pretty cringy. Wait, uh, what's I mean?

2257
02:39:32,620 --> 02:39:38,140
What's wrong with the early avatar episodes? I haven't watched it. There's nothing specifically wrong with with them

2258
02:39:38,140 --> 02:39:44,700
But they're not indicative of the quality. They are, um, unassuming. I think yeah, but I don't know whether that's a like

2259
02:39:45,420 --> 02:39:51,420
Like ultimately makes them good because they're unassuming and you you get a it's like, oh, it's just a fun adventure

2260
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:54,700
And then it grows and grows. Maybe that is an aspect of it that works

2261
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:58,860
There some of the episodes though are just like are just bad like, uh

2262
02:39:59,100 --> 02:40:05,580
Like bato of the water tribe that one is is just like not a good episode and like everyone gets in the great divide

2263
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:08,060
uh, bato of the water tribe is the one where

2264
02:40:08,780 --> 02:40:11,500
um, ang finds out that uh, that

2265
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:17,260
uh, uh, katara and sakka's dad is going to be, uh, nearby

2266
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:21,420
And uh, he withholds the information because he's jealous

2267
02:40:22,380 --> 02:40:24,380
And uh, hijinks ensue

2268
02:40:25,420 --> 02:40:27,420
Ang is jealous that they have a dad

2269
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:30,460
That that he won't be paying attention

2270
02:40:32,220 --> 02:40:34,220
Yeah, um

2271
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:36,860
I think there were a couple of different writers in the early seasons. I

2272
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:39,260
I'll of but uh, erine has took

2273
02:40:39,820 --> 02:40:41,820
One one that I remember

2274
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:47,740
Finding annoying for some reason was jet and I don't know why because I thought jet was cool initially

2275
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:50,700
Jet is like the the

2276
02:40:51,100 --> 02:40:59,660
I don't I like that episode because jet is a character jet is like the the typical like based but actually cringe character

2277
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:03,980
He's so he's so typical. Oh, yeah, I remember this guy

2278
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:11,660
Because he's he's based because you know, he has like a stick in his mouth and he wants he wants to free

2279
02:41:12,460 --> 02:41:17,500
Like he's he's cool. Katara gets a lady bono for him. Yeah, it turns out he uh

2280
02:41:17,740 --> 02:41:23,580
Is cringe kind of cring at he's kind of cring. He's kind of cring anyone and he just kind of wants to kill people

2281
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:28,620
Uh, he is a good. Oh, that's that's pretty base. I don't know what you guys it's a

2282
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:31,900
You know, it comes and goes

2283
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:38,380
Um, he has a good art scene. I've never seen avatar the last ever. He's only in one episode, right?

2284
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:41,020
He's in he comes back

2285
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:47,500
Uh, uh, very very briefly for like a a uh, like a couple episodes point into the earth's kingdom

2286
02:41:48,700 --> 02:41:55,740
Like I remember he uh, he's trying to be oh, yeah, he gets some he gets taken in by the uh, the uh

2287
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:01,340
The diely who like brainwash him and then he comes back and it's like a bit of a whoa

2288
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:04,380
And he you've totally changed literally

2289
02:42:07,180 --> 02:42:11,820
He tries to be based and he just he can't help it. He's just constantly cringe

Wait, let me let me confirm. Let me confirm. Uh

He dropped 30 minutes of voicemail to just get it. Yes. It was him. It is the same guy

That is pretty cringey. This is cringle, dude

2305
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:14,060
Yeah, it's not us. It's not a situation of throwing stuff at the wall until it sticks

02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:19,260
We go through all the voicemails. So if you put or or we don't spam it, we're not gonna pay attention

2307
02:43:19,260 --> 02:43:21,260
Or we don't in situations like this

2308
02:43:22,060 --> 02:43:24,460
Uh, yeah, specifically because the spam

2309
02:43:25,340 --> 02:43:27,340
Don't ever put me in a situation

2310
02:43:28,220 --> 02:43:30,220
Uh, all right. What is that one is called?

2311
02:43:31,900 --> 02:43:33,820
I don't know. I just forget about it

2312
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:39,180
I saw a funny I saw a funny picture of a frog with a gun that said don't ever put me in a situation

2313
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:42,300
And I just realized it

2314
02:43:42,540 --> 02:43:44,540
um

2315
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:50,460
Thanks what it's called. Hey, that's just a theory a pcp theory. Uh, there it is

2316
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:53,100
three two one go

2317
02:43:53,100 --> 02:44:00,700
Hey, so everyone here in the pcp theory crabney community has been talking and we're pretty sure we know what's in the kawasaki scrolls

2318
02:44:01,340 --> 02:44:06,700
Ben, can you confirm whether or not the scrolls contain the secret samurai circumcision technique?

2319
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:09,340
Like you just take out your katana

2320
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:15,020
Do one big slash walk past the guy and she their sword and their foreskin just pops off

2321
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:17,660
Are we all right, Ben?

2322
02:44:18,060 --> 02:44:22,700
I I don't speak japanese. So I don't know I can't read them. I can't even read them. I don't know

2323
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:27,900
This but I have pictures ben. I'm not sure if like this means I can't read pictures very late

2324
02:44:28,620 --> 02:44:34,460
To the whole circumcision like arc is funny or not. I'm I'm the jury's out for me

2325
02:44:36,140 --> 02:44:40,540
You know, it's it's been long enough. It's been long enough. I'm no longer mad about it

2326
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:44,060
Yeah, it's been long enough. It's been long enough that I'm not mad about it. So

2327
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:47,660
I can stomach it better. That's my opinion

2328
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:50,140
It's an nostalgia

2329
02:44:50,140 --> 02:44:53,740
It's it's yeah, it's just all the good old days of like a month ago

2330
02:44:54,300 --> 02:44:59,180
Uh, okay, the next one is called hi ben three two one go

2331
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:06,860
Kringus bingus is not only the hero of the downtrodden that we so desperately need in these trying times

2332
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:10,780
Kringus bingus is a holy warrior

2333
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:14,860
All three sides of the holy trinity

2334
02:45:15,980 --> 02:45:22,540
And he needs to be respected as such. I absolutely agree. Can you do that in the pretty voice the father the son and the kringus?

2335
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:28,220
Next next voicemail is called hi ben two three two one go

2336
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:42,540
I think it's an impression

2337
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:51,100
Pretty good impression though

2338
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:56,460
What the fuck were they saying?

2339
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,780
That's how you know

2340
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:00,780
I don't know. I don't know

2341
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:06,860
Uh, but all I know is okay. Next one is another tommy j. Uh, what the fuck is a virgin? Uh, no

2342
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:13,660
Uh, next one is uh epic thing that you guys might like mostly tom though

2343
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:17,180
Okay, here we go

2344
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:21,340
There it is three two one go found this cool thing

2345
02:46:21,340 --> 02:46:26,460
I think you guys might like uh mostly tom, but also everyone else might be interested in it

2346
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:28,300
Um

2347
02:46:28,300 --> 02:46:33,420
It's called pico eight. It's like, you know how emulators they'll run like an nes or a game boy bands whatever

2348
02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:36,860
This is an emulator for a console that doesn't exist

2349
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:41,420
You can go to the website. Just look up pico eight p i c o eight

2350
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:48,860
And uh, and you can play games there that people have made, uh, you know the game celeste. It was actually prototyped in pico eight

2351
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:54,700
Um like the the creators the the original version of it was in there and then they made it like a full epic game

2352
02:46:54,780 --> 02:46:57,100
You know swag mode. Um, but

2353
02:46:58,380 --> 02:47:03,820
It's really restrictive. It's like 128 by 128 resolution. There's only 16 colors you can pick from

2354
02:47:04,460 --> 02:47:08,060
And it's like 36 32 kilobytes something like that

2355
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:12,940
Okay, why a little bit lesser than an nes, but like not like Atari levels of shit

2356
02:47:12,940 --> 02:47:18,700
Well, why make a game for pico eight? It's pretty awesome people make some cool games where and there's even

2357
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:22,860
You can look up hashtag tweet cart on twitter people make the idea

2358
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:25,740
Is that is that you you work it in like a maker?

2359
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:29,020
And they'll post it on twitter and they'll post like the entire code

2360
02:47:29,260 --> 02:47:30,380
Uh, I remember no no

2361
02:47:30,380 --> 02:47:36,380
They're in the sweet limit like the 280 characters or whatever about this thing. Uh, so you can check all that out. It seems pretty cool

2362
02:47:37,260 --> 02:47:41,820
Um, but obviously it's cool. I thought it was cool. That's why I made this voicemail

2363
02:47:44,220 --> 02:47:47,740
Uh, okay. Oh, okay, so the idea is like

2364
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:55,500
Get back the like the limits of of like old like data. Yeah hardware or whatever. I think I think the pico

2365
02:47:56,220 --> 02:47:59,340
Did did he mention this in the voicemail that uh that you can

2366
02:47:59,980 --> 02:48:05,820
Run this in browser. I'm pretty sure like that's the appeal of the pico. I'm playing it. I'm playing cellist two in browser

2367
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:11,740
Yeah, that's that's the appeal of the uh of the pico eight is that it's like a it it's like a website game boy

2368
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:15,180
It's it's cool

2369
02:48:15,180 --> 02:48:17,820
That's pretty cute. That's pretty good voicemail. Thank you

2370
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:25,180
Well, this yeah, this does look pretty rad. I guess I better check it out pico eight

2371
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:29,180
Uh

2372
02:48:29,900 --> 02:48:31,900

2374
02:48:38,220 --> 02:48:40,220

2380
02:49:01,500 --> 02:49:03,500
I don't know what it is

2381
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:07,660
Okay, next next voicemail is called. Um

2382
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:12,860

Okay, three, two, one go you fucking people are always like oh

2384
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:24,700
I don't want to keep making youtube videos

2385
02:49:25,660 --> 02:49:32,860
Well, have you ever considered giving thought to starting to initiate the creation of videos for p2p?

2386
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:37,660
Yeah

2387
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:43,660
No, I'm not going to stop sending these I won't stop. You can't fucking

2388
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:46,220
I kind of ruin it

2389
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:50,140
Yeah, you should have cut it off after the punchline

2390
02:49:51,100 --> 02:49:53,580
Let's continue making video for a poo

2391
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:56,300
There you go. I have actually yes

2392
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:59,100
Yes

2393
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:01,420
YouTube I thought uh next voice

2394
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:04,460
Uh voice grail

2395
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:07,420
No

2396
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:14,060
I'd rather give it to the pico eight. No if if if if if tommy. Yeah, I mean there's an argument there

2397
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:19,820
Next one is okay next. All right. I'm tempted to play the next one. It's another tommy j

2398
02:50:20,220 --> 02:50:27,340
But it's called what the fuck is an apology. So I'm thinking. Okay. How long is it? It's 28 seconds. So it's not that bad

2399
02:50:27,820 --> 02:50:32,940
All right. All right. We'll give we'll give you we'll give it a shot. We'll give it a shot three two one go

2400
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:39,180
If you do something you kind of get the feeling that you're supposed to apologize for it by convention

2401
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:45,900
Uh, but you don't actually feel sorry about it. Oh should you because that's like lying, right?

2402
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:51,180
Because you say you regret doing it even though you don't or you say you feel bad

2403
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:57,100
No, this isn't what I was hoping. What do you do you lie or do you like this is a good question?

2404
02:50:57,100 --> 02:51:00,220
Do the thing you're supposed to is it a good question? I mean what's the answer?

2405
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:03,340
I guess it's fine

2406
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:04,700
um

2407
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:12,140
Oh, what do you think if you threw the lens that he thinks that we should think that he's sorry for sending all these voicemails

2408
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:19,260
Uh, I think it's interesting. I don't I don't think it doesn't make any sense. You're right. It doesn't I don't think that

2409
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:21,900
This is actually about the voicemails

2410
02:51:22,380 --> 02:51:26,780
I mean you could you could read that into it if you wanted to I am invoking death of the author

2411
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:31,500
In which yeah, yeah, I sure in which case what this means is that no, he is not sorry

2412
02:51:31,980 --> 02:51:36,780
About sending the and so he will suffer. Yes. I I just I just think that

2413
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:43,180
I don't think panpeaks art style is that bad really. I hate you. I hate you. No, I hate it. I hate it

2414
02:51:43,180 --> 02:51:48,780
I'm bringing it back, baby. Is that is just not that bad. It's okay at best. It's okay at best and you know when I call something

2415
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:50,780
That's okay at best. I call it bad

2416
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:53,740
Okay, I call it bad

2417
02:51:54,460 --> 02:51:56,220
Bad saint

2418
02:51:56,220 --> 02:52:00,860
Is like, I don't know. I don't like it when people fake apologize. I don't think

2419
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:06,060
It's something that should be done, but I guess if

2420
02:52:07,020 --> 02:52:08,620
if the only

2421
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:14,540
Like result from an apology whether it's fake or not if it's like a just too quell

2422
02:52:15,100 --> 02:52:16,380
anger

2423
02:52:16,380 --> 02:52:18,380
that is I don't know maybe

2424
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:20,780
Unjustly bubbling over

2425
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:26,860
No, I don't know. It's not it's not as clear cut as like yes or no. I think I mean

2426
02:52:28,940 --> 02:52:33,260
I mean if someone is apologizing to me if if someone did something to me

2427
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:38,700
And then and I didn't like it and then they apologize. They came and apologized to me

2428
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:45,260
But the way they were apologizing like I sense like they don't mean this they're lying to me. It would only make me angrier

2429
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:50,780
So sure that in that situation, but like what if I don't know they apologize

2430
02:52:51,020 --> 02:52:54,860
They didn't mean it, but you bought it and now you feel better

2431
02:52:55,900 --> 02:52:57,900
well, if I

2432
02:52:58,220 --> 02:52:59,500
Oh

2433
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:01,500
So is it if you want to

2434
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:07,580
Maintain a relationship with this person. It's best to apologize even if you don't the point is the point is like

2435
02:53:07,740 --> 02:53:13,100
What is the purpose of an apology? Is it more for the listener than it is for the speaker?

2436
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:16,460
Oh, I see. Okay. So like is an apology

2437
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:23,580
There so that like an opportunity for you to make amends or is it just like a social gesture designed to like

2438
02:53:24,220 --> 02:53:25,580
maintain

2439
02:53:25,580 --> 02:53:27,020
a like

2440
02:53:27,020 --> 02:53:28,460
You know

2441
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:29,340
relationship

2442
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:35,100
Right, what is an apology a miserable? I would prefer all apologies to be like sincere, but

2443
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:37,660
I don't know like in a perfect world, you know

2444
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:43,020
I mean I honestly I think it's like if you care about the person if you don't really give a shit about them

2445
02:53:43,420 --> 02:53:46,060
And you just are like I need this person not to be mad

2446
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:47,260
Then yeah, sure

2447
02:53:47,260 --> 02:53:51,740
You can make a fake apology and as long as they buy it it it does what it's supposed to do

2448
02:53:52,300 --> 02:53:55,740
But it but it sounds even worse. Well. Yeah. Well, that's what I think

2449
02:53:55,740 --> 02:54:01,020
But if you if you do care about them, then like you're doing you're you're disrespecting them and doing something pretty

2450
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:06,860
Pretty nasty to them by like going to them and saying like you're mad about me doing this thing

2451
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:11,020
I'm not sorry, but I'm gonna pretend that I am so you'll stop being mad about it

2452
02:54:11,820 --> 02:54:13,820
No, it's pretty bad the way I'm thinking about that

2453
02:54:14,460 --> 02:54:19,180
But like it just depends more on like public apologies for like saying the wrong thing

2454
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:22,620
Like I think I don't know

2455
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:24,620
I guess it gets more complicated

2456
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:30,300
If you don't if you don't actually think that you said the wrong that what you said was wrong

2457
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:34,620
Then no, I mean, I think the right thing to do is not apologize for it even if

2458
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:40,460
Everyone's mad and think they want you to like if you really if you really don't think it was wrong

2459
02:54:41,820 --> 02:54:46,780
I believe in sticking to your guns. I think that's good. Yeah, I I think that's

2460
02:54:48,620 --> 02:54:51,500
It it it most of the times say what is true

2461
02:54:51,580 --> 02:54:56,620
But I don't know there's like there's like a tiny bit of like leeway that I'm like unsure about

2462
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:59,340
well, I mean, I mean if like there's a

2463
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:02,540
I mean if someone is like

2464
02:55:02,540 --> 02:55:04,540
If someone is like attacking you

2465
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:11,740
Unjustly and like doing harm and you can stop it with an apology even if you don't mean it

2466
02:55:12,700 --> 02:55:17,020
Yeah, but in that case it's like a well, I don't I don't actually care what this person that this person sucks

2467
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,740
I'll apologize to them just like to make them stop

2468
02:55:20,380 --> 02:55:22,700
I don't like them because they're bad, but like

2469
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:25,980
The apology will prevent damage

2470
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:27,980
sure

2471
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:31,100
I I think so there's there's space for that

2472
02:55:31,580 --> 02:55:34,620
It's very cynical, but I don't think you're wrong

2473
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:41,820
I mean, I think I think you I think you should you should make an insincere apology when an apology is not actually warranted

2474
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:44,620
But like it needs to be done

2475
02:55:45,340 --> 02:55:47,340
Uh, you know

2476
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:49,580
Yeah, yeah

2477
02:55:50,140 --> 02:55:54,940
I mean, it's a it's a concession. Okay, uh next one is called

2478
02:55:55,660 --> 02:56:02,620
Uh, I'm skipping the next one. Oh, I'm actually I'm skipping the next two. Actually, there's there's two more Tommy J's

2479
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:06,380
Okay, Jesus Christ. Yeah, three from now is called

2480
02:56:07,260 --> 02:56:08,060
uh

2481
02:56:08,060 --> 02:56:10,060
Gibbon coin

2482
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:12,060
Uh, it's

2483
02:56:12,620 --> 02:56:14,620
Wait, there's so many

2484
02:56:15,500 --> 02:56:17,500
Gibbon coin greater than

2485
02:56:18,060 --> 02:56:20,060
saint coin

2486
02:56:20,380 --> 02:56:22,380
Right. Yeah. Gibbon coin

2487
02:56:22,540 --> 02:56:27,980
I'm listening without without hearing anything Gibbon coin greater than saint coin three two one go

2488
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:40,220
Why are you speaking the book?

2489
02:56:41,740 --> 02:56:46,300
This is a let's read not a let's speak

2490
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:55,340
Is this that snakes?

2491
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:58,140
I mean

2492
02:56:58,300 --> 02:57:00,300
It could be

2493
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:05,500
Remember that week that everyone had voicemails like this and it was scary

2494
02:57:07,100 --> 02:57:09,100
That was only like two weeks ago

2495
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:11,660
It feels like it feels like an eternity

2496
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:17,820
I I think they might be referencing this one wasn't creepy. This one wasn't unsettling. It was just like, uh

2497
02:57:18,780 --> 02:57:20,780
Just wacky

2498
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:23,660
It just I felt very weird for the sake of being weird

2499
02:57:24,460 --> 02:57:29,020
Yeah, I didn't I don't do you remember that video I made like years ago on Gibbon take

2500
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:35,020
Where it was a let's read and I just opened a book and started silently reading the book on camera. Ah, that's good

2501
02:57:36,220 --> 02:57:41,660
No, I don't I think that may have been I don't know if they knew about that, but the idea of Gib coin better

2502
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:46,140
Sorry, it's actually titled Gib coin greater than saint con

2503
02:57:47,100 --> 02:57:49,100
Uh, so I don't know

2504
02:57:49,820 --> 02:57:51,820
Make make make of that what you will

2505
02:57:52,940 --> 02:57:54,700
Yikes, you had a typo

2506
02:57:54,700 --> 02:57:57,740
Arguments dismantled voice jail voice jail

2507
02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:01,020
Your argument is invalid

2508
02:58:01,740 --> 02:58:04,380
Next one is called uh squilliam fancieson

2509
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:07,100
three two one go

2510
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:09,500
A couple weeks ago

2511
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:13,500
You guys had on a pcp fan artist who had done a bunch of art for you guys

2512
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:15,900
But when are you gonna represent

2513
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:24,220
The real silent majority of the podcast listenership the fan artist. That's right. It's me. I did I did the pcp fan lectures

2514
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:26,220
Oh god, they're taking me away. Please

2515
02:58:26,300 --> 02:58:28,300
Oh, I know this guy. I'm

2516
02:58:28,620 --> 02:58:30,780
Yeah, I know I I I haven't actually got

2517
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:33,500
I've watched part of the um

2518
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:38,060
The elder scrolls lecture. I think I haven't watched the whole thing. Uh, yeah, he did another

2519
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:40,700
I mean, we've we've got someone who did a

2520
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:45,660
PCP ask lecture on right now. So fuck you squilliam. Uh, we're doing it

2521
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:53,260
Twice even already happened already happened. Yeah, what he did he did squilliam did one on on the elder scrolls

2522
02:58:53,260 --> 02:58:56,540
And he did one on was the other one. He's done more than I have

2523
02:58:58,220 --> 02:59:03,660
He's done two and the other one was even plays elder scrolls. I'm right. I I mean not me

2524
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:08,700
Which is probably why I would I would probably get more out of that lecture than a player

2525
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:14,700
Yeah, not not I said ben sey the majority the real silent majority. Yeah, true

2526
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:17,820
I believe this. Okay. I believe this is the video

2527
02:59:22,780 --> 02:59:24,780
Yes, yes, that's the one

2528
02:59:25,180 --> 02:59:29,580
Okay, it's harry sante. The next one is called reacting to let's read

2529
02:59:30,620 --> 02:59:34,300
And it is from gibbon tibbon at fibbon.com

2530
02:59:35,260 --> 02:59:38,220
So, uh, okay, so sorry about three two

2531
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:48,300
Three two one go and we'll dive into the treasure of the pleasant valley. Yes, this is a video I was talking about frank. Yabi

2532
02:59:50,700 --> 02:59:52,700
Old old face

2533
02:59:54,540 --> 02:59:56,540
Don't ever watch videos of mine

2534
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:03,420
This is just gonna be

2535
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:06,700
It's still going

2536
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:11,740
Oh my god, that hit me very quickly. Oh my god, wait

2537
03:00:17,100 --> 03:00:19,100
That's kind of what I was waiting for

2538
03:00:19,660 --> 03:00:21,660
This character's fucking gay

2539
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:27,260
Negroes in it

2540
03:00:28,220 --> 03:00:30,220
Oh

2541
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:36,220
Someone's getting canceled. That's what it read. That's what it said

2542
03:00:37,020 --> 03:00:39,900
Yeah, this is like getting canceled for reading huck fit in class

2543
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:44,620
It was an old book a lot of a lot of blacks in this one. Oh two

2544
03:00:46,700 --> 03:00:48,700
A little too many of you asked me to a black

2545
03:00:49,820 --> 03:00:51,820
Wait, what book was it? It's

2546
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:54,700
The treasure pleasant valley

2547
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:59,100
It's like an old like no cover like 1910s sort of

2548
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:02,700
You know book written before stones were invented

2549
03:01:04,460 --> 03:01:10,860
Interesting curious and they had the word they they had the n-word like the the the old n-word the negro word

2550
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:14,060
That's a yeah

2551
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:16,780
Yo, I think it's just as bad

2552
03:01:17,740 --> 03:01:19,500
No

2553
03:01:19,580 --> 03:01:23,580
No, it's fun. I wouldn't say it but I wouldn't call it as bad. You probably shouldn't say it

2554
03:01:24,220 --> 03:01:28,060
You probably shouldn't say it. It's not a slur. Don't think it don't say it. It's just an archaic

2555
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:33,020
It's just an archaic term. It's out of fashion. It's an archaic term, but like the

2556
03:01:33,420 --> 03:01:36,940
You finally say it if you're gonna say the Spanish word for the color black

2557
03:01:37,100 --> 03:01:41,500
The other one is just a slurrified version. No, it's a country in africa

2558
03:01:41,900 --> 03:01:47,660
Slurrified the captain. They used to say negro before they said black and now you say poc

2559
03:01:48,220 --> 03:01:53,180
You know, it's all it's all good. Oh my god. He's still saying it. Yeah, but the reason the reason the n-word

2560
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:58,540
Um, the more, you know, the colloquial one. Um, it's not a bad word. You shouldn't really say it

2561
03:01:59,100 --> 03:02:01,100
Oh my god is because

2562
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:03,900
Is is because of like the connotation it has

2563
03:02:04,780 --> 03:02:07,100
Right, it doesn't have any connotation and the the the more

2564
03:02:08,460 --> 03:02:13,980
The slavery maybe no, you know, it's not it's not it's not a slave word. It's not a

2565
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:20,940
I uh, it it's it's just it's not it's just too sussable word nowadays to use is that word again suss

2566
03:02:22,220 --> 03:02:24,300
Uh, there's yeah, that's the real slur

2567
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:30,620
Wow, wow, wow, uh, uh, big it big it big it

2568
03:02:31,420 --> 03:02:33,660
I gotta say the same in the same episode

2569
03:02:34,220 --> 03:02:35,980
Christ

2570
03:02:35,980 --> 03:02:38,220
What I just don't think I don't think there's like a

2571
03:02:38,780 --> 03:02:40,780
I don't know

2572
03:02:41,020 --> 03:02:46,540
Like a significant difference between the old n-word and the new n-word for the older room

2573
03:02:46,860 --> 03:02:52,220
Yes, there is more okay. Yes, there is no you're an idiot. You're an idiot because all right

2574
03:02:52,300 --> 03:02:57,340
Literally both words existed at the same both words were used at the same time and they were different words

2575
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:03,180
They were two different things and one was the correct term and one was the one was them the the slur

2576
03:03:03,740 --> 03:03:05,740
One was always bad and the other one was okay

2577
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:08,700
They both could be used as slurs

2578
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:14,060
Said by white people about black people to dehumanize. No, that's not true

2579
03:03:14,220 --> 03:03:19,740
That's not true. The the regular one was not a dehumanizing. It was just the word for I mean we call we call

2580
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:25,180
We call them you could say the same thing about calling someone black like oh black is just what you called someone to dehumanize them

2581
03:03:25,180 --> 03:03:31,260
No, it's just it's just the word for it. That's that was just okay. Maybe maybe maybe I don't know the history of the word

2582
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:36,540
I just always assumed that it was like Martin Luther King said like a disparaging sort of word because

2583
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:44,140
It was it was like the the words to use but also because black people were so maligned. It was also like

2584
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:51,980
Like I mean they were called in the way that in Europe too, which like didn't have slavery. Oh, yeah, Europe wasn't racist

2585
03:03:52,460 --> 03:03:54,460
I'm not I didn't say that

2586
03:03:54,860 --> 03:03:56,860
This is so dumb

2587
03:03:57,020 --> 03:03:58,780
This is by this by this logic

2588
03:03:58,780 --> 03:04:04,220
You could be like like literally anything that you've called that they used to call them is like automatically racist because people

2589
03:04:04,220 --> 03:04:07,020
You know, I I agree this conversation is dumb. Let's

2590
03:04:09,420 --> 03:04:11,420
I'm furious

2591
03:04:14,460 --> 03:04:20,220
I'm not I'm not I'm not budging until I know like I've looked up the definition of the word more like like the history of the word

2592
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:26,140
And and it's use because I may be assuming things but like I know I know how I know how we can settle this

2593
03:04:26,140 --> 03:04:29,260
We got to look it up on urban dictionary.com. That's gonna

2594
03:04:34,940 --> 03:04:36,940
All right, uh

2595
03:04:37,900 --> 03:04:39,900
Wait, where is the next one there it is

2596
03:04:40,780 --> 03:04:42,620
Wait, no, it's me. Um

2597
03:04:42,620 --> 03:04:50,060
This one is called the real reason why Nate isn't on the pcp hashtag bge exposed

2598
03:04:50,780 --> 03:04:52,780
3 2 1 go

2599
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:55,420
This isn't actually like that serious of a thing

2600
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:59,900
It's just so I felt a comfortable saying it before because it's not actually like a major issue or anything

2601
03:04:59,900 --> 03:05:04,380
I just wanted to slip it in so everyone's been commenting on like when's Nate coming back

2602
03:05:04,540 --> 03:05:10,540
Where's best guy ever etc etc since the whole brad garling house thing and like I hear what you're saying guys

2603
03:05:10,780 --> 03:05:16,460
I understand where you're coming from like why isn't Nate back? But here's what you gotta understand everybody right now

2604
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:22,380
Nate doesn't want to come back on the show. He's doing his own stuff. Do not expect him back

2605
03:05:22,700 --> 03:05:28,140
He may come back someday or he may not it is up to him and do not count on it

2606
03:05:28,220 --> 03:05:31,740
So everybody commenting. Where's the best guy ever?

2607
03:05:33,180 --> 03:05:38,300
This is your answer. He's not coming back anytime soon. He has made that explicitly clear

2608
03:05:38,460 --> 03:05:41,260
He is going his own way the proud mig towel that he is

2609
03:05:42,140 --> 03:05:43,660
This

2610
03:05:43,660 --> 03:05:50,460
This guy sent in a voicemail the last time I was on of like a of a nate best guy ever

2611
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:55,100
Yeah, we'll we'll sent in a voicemail the last time I was on of a very similar sounding speech

2612
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:59,740
I just thought that was interesting that they decided to call it again when I'm on

2613
03:06:00,940 --> 03:06:05,020
Okay, I'm sorry to beat this. I'm sorry to beat this dead horse, but I'm gonna read this from wikipedia

2614
03:06:05,180 --> 03:06:07,980
Okay, this is from wikipedia. Best guy ever is

2615
03:06:08,940 --> 03:06:16,380
In the english language negro plural negro is a term historically used to denote persons considered to be of black african heritage

2616
03:06:16,540 --> 03:06:22,940
The term can be construed as offensive inoffensive or completely neutral largely depending on the region or country where it is used

2617
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:26,940
So there you go. Okay wikipedia is on my side. We were both

2618
03:06:27,820 --> 03:06:30,700
Once again, the white man is correct

2619
03:06:32,060 --> 03:06:37,420
I mean, I would still not use it just because the only times I've I've heard it said in like

2620
03:06:38,460 --> 03:06:41,900
Modern times is by extreme far-right racists

2621
03:06:42,860 --> 03:06:47,180
Who are also boomers? It's a suss word, Ben. It's just a very suss word to use

2622
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:50,780
Okay, but like if it's like it's not it's not bad if you read it from a book

2623
03:06:51,420 --> 03:06:53,420
No, it's not bad

2624
03:06:53,900 --> 03:07:00,060
I wasn't like saying. Oh, I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't like call I wouldn't I wouldn't like call someone that I wouldn't like call someone that

2625
03:07:00,300 --> 03:07:02,300
To in like, you know

2626
03:07:02,620 --> 03:07:04,620
A regular conversation

2627
03:07:04,780 --> 03:07:06,780
Like like maybe maybe

2628
03:07:07,340 --> 03:07:11,180
Would do maybe the word is like equivalent to using the term african

2629
03:07:11,340 --> 03:07:17,980
Which is like just a description descriptive word in in in that case then sure, but like I feel like like

2630
03:07:18,460 --> 03:07:23,660
Generally speaking people associate it more with the n word. Maybe just because it begins with the letter n

2631
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:31,580
Is a n word kind of no, it's literally it's literally it's because the slur is just a like bastardization of that word

2632
03:07:31,660 --> 03:07:33,340
Which was the like

2633
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:34,940
Yeah, polite word

2634
03:07:35,020 --> 03:07:41,100
I mean if you ask like just random people, I feel like they would assume that they carry the same weight even though they may not

2635
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:44,620
They don't words change definition based on the popular opinion

2636
03:07:44,700 --> 03:07:48,460
So like I don't know it's very it's very suss like using the word like using the word boy

2637
03:07:48,940 --> 03:07:51,180
Like come here boy like that, you know

2638
03:07:53,900 --> 03:08:00,860
Fine, I don't what do you even disagreeing with me about oh, fuck you. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, obviously don't just go around like calling people

2639
03:08:00,940 --> 03:08:02,940
It's weird. It'd be really weird to do that

2640
03:08:03,740 --> 03:08:05,500
Fuck her

2641
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:07,500
I'm gonna try not cancel you

2642
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:12,860
All right. Okay, Ben. Okay. Ashley's ugly. All right. I agree. She's not good

2643
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:16,460
She is she is fucking ugly. She does her lipstick like a fucking idiot

2644
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:21,900
She's not okay. You won. Yeah. Thanks. Good. I win. I all

2645
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:30,060
I don't think you're okay, Ben. Hands aren't so isn't that good. All right. I always win. Okay. I always get my man

2646
03:08:30,380 --> 03:08:37,180
Next next voicemail is called uh, not the samurai. Uh, there it is three

2647
03:08:38,460 --> 03:08:40,460
One go

2648
03:08:41,500 --> 03:08:48,060
First you skip my exciting earnest voicemail series and now you shit on webcomics making almost none

2649
03:08:48,940 --> 03:08:54,700
I still remember the emptiness. I felt I'm from my second rereading on one of my favorite webcomics

2650
03:08:55,180 --> 03:08:56,460
Gaia

2651
03:08:56,460 --> 03:09:04,380
I first did for more quality comics and remembered a certain ccp member talking and hustling around his scribbles all the time

2652
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:09,660
A venture to his website went through all its contents in a very

2653
03:09:10,540 --> 03:09:18,540
Unsatisfyingly short amount of time and stayed dumbfounded and flabbergasted having a brain freeze over there not being

2654
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:21,580
anything more

2655
03:09:21,660 --> 03:09:28,860
You can only tremble under the weight of the heaps of published content of giants like penny arcade and control alt delete

2656
03:09:29,820 --> 03:09:33,340
I couldn't get into penny arcade, but I hold control. They'll

2657
03:09:33,980 --> 03:09:35,500
Deep in my heart

2658
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:42,460
The Kickstarter for their collective comics was the only one I ever successfully backed and its six kilo kilos of

2659
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:45,980
Quality hardcore remains one of my most priceful sessions

2660
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:49,580
I still remember being emotional about the mean loss

2661
03:09:50,540 --> 03:09:52,540
Since I wasn't plugged into the internet

2662
03:09:52,620 --> 03:09:54,620
I guys at the time

2663
03:09:56,940 --> 03:09:58,940
No matter

2664
03:09:59,420 --> 03:10:06,700
Also, Europe is in deep this funny voice. That's just his voice around any time. I don't think he's I don't think he's putting on a

2665
03:10:07,900 --> 03:10:10,220
Maybe he is I don't know who even knows

2666
03:10:11,180 --> 03:10:17,580
I don't know. Is he just saying like like ben saint, uh, where's the quantity? I want quantity not quality

2667
03:10:18,380 --> 03:10:20,380
That's fair. You know what I respect it

2668
03:10:20,540 --> 03:10:21,580
I

2669
03:10:21,580 --> 03:10:27,900
I want anything. I can't even disagree. I can't I I I want more ben sane comics. Well, yeah

2670
03:10:28,700 --> 03:10:35,500
I'm a fan of Ben Sane's comic after I finish the secret project. I will go back and I'll make some I'll make some of that stuff

2671
03:10:35,580 --> 03:10:37,580
I promise I promise

2672
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:39,740
uh, but

2673
03:10:39,740 --> 03:10:46,380
I never read uh, penny arcade much, but I did play penny arcades on the rain slick precipice of darkness 3

2674
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:48,700
I I have not played the

2675
03:10:48,860 --> 03:10:52,220
Uh, and I like that. I don't you I don't think you listened to the last week's episode

2676
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:57,740
But uh, I was saying then like I don't I don't think I don't think anybody likes the penny arcade comic

2677
03:10:58,060 --> 03:11:04,940
Like I don't know anybody who actually thinks they're good. Um, the rain slick precipice of dark rain slick precipice of darkness

2678
03:11:05,180 --> 03:11:11,820
I've never played it and I don't particularly want to but I am like amazed every time I remember that such a thing exists

2679
03:11:13,580 --> 03:11:15,100
There's four. Yeah

2680
03:11:15,100 --> 03:11:19,580
The fourth one is like made by like a different studio or something, right?

2681
03:11:21,100 --> 03:11:25,100
The third and the fourth one are made by um, we're made by zboy. Yeah, boy

2682
03:11:25,820 --> 03:11:28,700
Like cthulhu saves the world in breath of death seven. I think

2683
03:11:29,420 --> 03:11:32,300
Is how you say, right? I want to hear this guy's opinion on millenverse

2684
03:11:32,940 --> 03:11:39,820
A bunch of a bunch of the uh DLC the penny arcade dlc podcasts involve them talking about like

2685
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:47,420
Oh god this week was such a fucking uh, I had to like write all these item descriptions for the game

2686
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:51,820
Or I had to like I had to like do all these like these art assets for the game or whatever

2687
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,860
I had to

2688
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:59,580
You just like a bunch of them are them talking about like their role in the like creative process while for the studio

2689
03:11:59,580 --> 03:12:02,780
That was making one of the rain slick precipice of darkness games

2690
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:06,060
So I'm like interested in them as like an artifact

2691
03:12:06,620 --> 03:12:09,500
Uh, I mean, is it good? Is is number three? I would

2692
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:16,140
Uh, the the the one I played. Yeah, I actually kind of liked it. It's uh, it's like a simple jrpg

2693
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:19,820
it kind of has it kind of has combat like, uh

2694
03:12:20,940 --> 03:12:26,060
I think I think it's like found fancy 10 or like vagrant story or something where you can like you can see the uh

2695
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:30,460
You can see how like how the turn order is going to play out before you do anything

2696
03:12:30,860 --> 03:12:36,380
And uh, it's it's pretty easy game for I remember because they heal you after every battle, but I didn't really mind that

2697
03:12:36,540 --> 03:12:39,500
That's pretty funny too. It's been years since I've played it though. Okay

2698
03:12:41,180 --> 03:12:43,180
It's it's just

2699
03:12:44,060 --> 03:12:46,620
Every everything everything that exists

2700
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:54,300
Because of penny arcade is like a weird thing that should that shouldn't exist but does and is funny

2701
03:12:55,260 --> 03:13:01,900
And it's it's it's more interesting than the comic itself. Absolutely. Absolutely. I wish that was me

2702
03:13:02,780 --> 03:13:06,060
Me too. No, I just I I don't like penny arcades comics

2703
03:13:06,540 --> 03:13:10,060
Damn, but I want to I just want to like steal their skin and live their life

2704
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:13,100
I'm gonna do something called bill and con

2705
03:13:13,340 --> 03:13:15,340
One of the days is gonna be great

2706
03:13:16,540 --> 03:13:19,100
Uh, the next one is called

2707
03:13:19,820 --> 03:13:20,940
cross

2708
03:13:20,940 --> 03:13:23,180
hotly debated question

2709
03:13:23,500 --> 03:13:25,500
3 2 1 go

2710
03:13:26,220 --> 03:13:28,860
How many chuggas come before the choo choo?

2711
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:32,380
2

2712
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:34,300
No two

2715
03:13:41,660 --> 03:13:48,860
I Chugga, conroy. That next question. Okay. There's a graph imagine. There's a graph like it's it's up really high at one chugga

2716
03:13:48,860 --> 03:13:53,080
And then it's down really low for two and then it's kind of medium for three

2717
03:13:53,480 --> 03:13:58,880
If you're going short chugga chugga choo choo if you're going long chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga choo

2719
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:11,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah seven seven I would go for seven wait tectonic when you mentioned chugga conroy

2720
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:13,600
six you ever um

2721
03:14:14,140 --> 03:14:18,920
There was a there was a I think it was years ago when like this one company was was saying like a

2722
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:22,420
Pitch is an idea for a movie and if it's good

2723
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:29,200
We'll pick it up and chugga conroy pitched his idea for a movie and it was called water falls and it was about a guy called

2724
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:33,420
I think his first name was waters and he was basically like a waterbender

2725
03:14:35,440 --> 03:14:42,000
No, it's called water I need to hear your hands you need to send here's the here's the kind of here's the kind of like

2726
03:14:42,080 --> 03:14:45,320
It's like lost media basically his pitch is because I couldn't find it

2727
03:14:45,320 --> 03:14:48,800
I think he took it down because it was kind of a very silly ass pitch

2728
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:56,720
It's called water hands. Yeah. Yeah, we'll call it water hands or something and the character had a sister called water falls

2729
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:03,640
And I remember him and I only knew that was chugga conroy years later because I

2730
03:15:03,960 --> 03:15:09,960
Needed to like pass a level in a game and I looked up a left play and I found chugga's and I watched a little bit of it

2731
03:15:09,960 --> 03:15:14,320
And he mentioned it for a brief second like oh this I think it was a Mega Man game

2732
03:15:14,320 --> 03:15:22,120
He's he's like, oh, yeah, this this power kind of reminds you of my character from my my idea for a series of called water

2733
03:15:22,120 --> 03:15:25,960
Hands and I'm like wait a second. This is the guy who pitched water hands. Oh

2734
03:15:27,080 --> 03:15:31,400
God a fame a fake shock. You know, you know chugga conroy as the water

2735
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:35,760
And not I mean, I know he's a let's player, but it's so

2736
03:15:36,640 --> 03:15:38,640
Just so funny

2737
03:15:39,960 --> 03:15:45,840
The next next voicemail next voicemail is called poke. Well, no, it's called Pokemon

2738
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:49,520
But if it was good three two one go black and white

2739
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:52,320
I'm like a month late on this topic

2740
03:15:52,320 --> 03:15:56,880
But use was asking if there's a Pokemon game that doesn't suck shit and drop the ball 20 times in a row

2741
03:15:56,880 --> 03:16:01,640
Well, I got one for you. It does everything the fans have been clamoring for it has every Pokemon

2742
03:16:01,760 --> 03:16:07,280
It retains all the mechanics from previous gens. It's an MMO. You can have your mom's follow you outside their ball

2743
03:16:07,280 --> 03:16:12,320
It's highly customizable. You might not have heard of it. It's called the procrastinator's Minecraft server Ben

2744
03:16:12,320 --> 03:16:16,920
You fucking Dweebeheimer. How does this always skip your mind when the topic of Pokemon done right comes up?

2745
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:24,160
Pixelmon is the solution to the game-free question or GQ if you will not only that it's also the endless war Pokemon

2746
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:29,520
Romhack except a thousand times better because it's CW and 3d. That's right. We're recreating lock a common 3d

2747
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:31,840
And it's fucking based it's being slowly developed

2748
03:16:31,840 --> 03:16:36,920
But one day it'll be home to all the rough houses and cop kids to commit gang violence to their hearts content

2749
03:16:36,960 --> 03:16:40,540
As of this podcast going live the server is free to enter for the next week

2750
03:16:40,540 --> 03:16:44,040
I've decided this is just canon now and there's nothing you can do about it

2751
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:51,160
Actually, you know, I have any rck people getting for free forever. Fuck it. Can it bam, whoa, okay?

2752
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:57,960
Does he can he do that did we give him the permission to do that

2753
03:16:58,200 --> 03:17:00,200
Um

2754
03:17:01,760 --> 03:17:05,960
Me and tectonic are the host so we get to the side. Yes, you can do that. Oh god

2755
03:17:06,560 --> 03:17:10,640
Yeah, okay. Fuck it. Go. Well, I guess I was wrong

2756
03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:16,200
I guess I was wrong when I said that you have to pay to be in it. Fuck

2757
03:17:18,280 --> 03:17:20,280
Well, okay, well

2758
03:17:20,680 --> 03:17:22,680
nice

2759
03:17:22,760 --> 03:17:30,320
It's true that else do we got just like just like two more. Okay, uh, next one is called actual do

2760
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:34,320
There it is three two one go

2761
03:17:35,120 --> 03:17:40,440
Hello, my name is actual do and if you are reading this I am gone

2762
03:17:41,920 --> 03:17:48,040
I'm writing this letter as a way for my memories to not simply vanish from this place

2763
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:51,680
So that some may learn from my mistakes

2764
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:55,040
Ben

2765
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:57,040
You utter fucking moron

2766
03:17:58,040 --> 03:18:00,040
because of you and your

2767
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:01,800
simply

2768
03:18:01,800 --> 03:18:05,480
Disgusting interest in the stock market. I decided

2769
03:18:06,040 --> 03:18:09,840
Maybe I should understand it better. I don't know much myself

2770
03:18:11,280 --> 03:18:17,920
And me being autistic. Well, I need the cause-and-effect relation

2771
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:20,680
To understand

2772
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:26,720
So I looked for it and I looked and I looked and through the halls of

2773
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:33,520
Investopedia I read and the more I read the less I understood the more I I fucking

2774
03:18:34,040 --> 03:18:41,720
Grasp to the difference between an option a future a currency and a commodity the more I could feel my brain

2775
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:44,080
implode from within

2776
03:18:44,960 --> 03:18:52,080
Do not try to understand the stock market some things are meant to not be understood

2777
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:55,960
So fuck you Ben you motherfucker

2778
03:18:57,960 --> 03:18:59,960
Say you know

2779
03:19:06,360 --> 03:19:12,320
All you have to understand about the stuff it's so easy all you have to understand is buy a game stop and hold

2780
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:19,520
Just buy a game stop and don't sell high American Psycho. Just don't sell it. That's all it is to it

2781
03:19:20,400 --> 03:19:24,560
Couldn't be couldn't be simpler. You know that one scene where Christian Bale like

2782
03:19:25,200 --> 03:19:31,320
Kills that guy with the axe imagine Ben and it's Nate is the guy that he killed but Ben is talking about

2783
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:38,240
He's talking about what's the name that one strip search that one show with Katie Rice strip search

2784
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:44,720
Yeah, he starts also penny arcade joint he starts playing it and it goes to number today's like have you heard a strip search?

2785
03:19:44,720 --> 03:19:46,720
And then he starts talking about it

2786
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:53,800
Like it's a gem that no one talks about that often and then finally kills the first couple of contestants were a little too

2787
03:19:54,280 --> 03:20:00,640
Mainstream for my taste there. Yeah, they were too amateurs when they eliminate when they eliminated Tristan Falcone

2788
03:20:00,640 --> 03:20:02,640
I think they really came into their own

2789
03:20:02,920 --> 03:20:04,640
Tristan

2790
03:20:04,640 --> 03:20:11,920
You didn't oh, yeah, that is Amy Tristan now. I believe so. Yeah, whoa, okay. I follow them on

2791
03:20:13,240 --> 03:20:16,900
Twitter no, they're actually one of my favorite contestants. I

2792
03:20:17,800 --> 03:20:20,520
Just tried to search Twitter on Twitter. That is

2793
03:20:21,640 --> 03:20:23,640
That is that is so wacky

2794
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:27,040
Okay, that's interesting

2795
03:20:27,760 --> 03:20:29,880

03:20:29,880 --> 03:20:31,880

I hate hearing myself what about voicemails

2813
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:15,600
That fucked me up

2814
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:25,760
I thought Eleazar was gonna

2815
03:22:25,840 --> 03:22:30,960
I thought Eleazar was gonna edit in more other PCP members voices in there what other members

2816
03:22:31,280 --> 03:22:34,880
I thought I thought yeah, what other members I thought he would just edit in

2817
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:40,240
Endless just trying to justify saying the n-word in there. Oh come on

2818
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,960
Who uh, I don't even remember that lol

2819
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:51,680
Who uh, who are we talking about calling a son of a bitch and a horse on

2820
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:55,200
I don't know

2821
03:22:56,000 --> 03:23:01,280
I must must have felt pretty strongly about it at the time. Yeah, I said it so much

2822
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:06,000
We sang a whole song about it

2823
03:23:11,840 --> 03:23:13,840
That was honestly

2824
03:23:14,560 --> 03:23:17,120
Honestly, why the fuck not why the fuck not?

2825
03:23:17,520 --> 03:23:23,840

The old in with the new

2827
03:23:26,240 --> 03:23:31,760
Maybe the episode after this because if this is a nice little punch line to end the podcast with

2828
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:34,640
I agree. I agree

2829
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:39,680
