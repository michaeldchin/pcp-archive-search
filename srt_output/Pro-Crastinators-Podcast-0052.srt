1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Donald J. Trump is now president of the United States.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,680
I am the best guy in the motherfucking game.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,400
And I'm here once again with all your favorite internet shenanigan boys.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Here's Hippocrit.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
Everybody is a human being.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,200
But some are gayer than others.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Mumkey Jones is here.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,880
I just saw the Japanese film Your Name in theaters, and then I went and watched The

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Pleeve and the Weep episode, and I thought it was very funny and well-edited.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,800
Oh, well, go on to, uh...

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,960
It's only we knew the name of the genius who edited those episodes.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Who could have?

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,720
It's only he had a Patreon.com slash Endless Jess that we should know about.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,040
You have co-opped this intro segment.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
It's garbage now.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,800
Endless Jess is here as well, as you heard.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,440
I'm wearing slippers.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Nice.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Tom Oliver.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Sup?

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Uh, yeah.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I'm here.

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
He's not on the podcast.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
I'm just asking him what's up.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I got nothing.

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
He's in the room.

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
He's in the room.

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
I'm eating my blue pills.

30
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
I'm eating my blue pills.

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
I'm eating my blue pills.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Is he saying he's eating his blue pills?

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
I'm eating my blue pills.

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
What on earth else could he be eating?

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
That's a good question.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
I'm hoarding those blue pills.

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
You son of a bitch.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Leave some for me.

39
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm eating my blue pills.

40
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Oh my god.

41
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
In that new Rick and Morty episode, is that what they were feeling?

42
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
What on earth else could he be eating?

43
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
What on earth else could he be eating?

44
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
That's a good question.

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Are we feeding everyone?

46
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,940
Is that the pills that everyone was surviving on?

47
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Oh my god.

48
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
And Ben St.

49
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,440
The most blue pill man the world is here.

50
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
That's right.

51
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,940
I'm here to show y'all how it's done.

52
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,440
Because today's topic is SJWs.

53
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
Uh-oh.

54
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,940
It's a spicy topic.

55
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
It's a heated topic.

56
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,080
It's gonna get crazy.

57
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,800
This will be the end of the PCP.

58
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Most likely it'll terrace in Twayne and will never be whole again.

59
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Today's special episode has not one, but two,

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,080
urban dictionary definitions that we're reading,

61
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,280
which means you have to go to patreon.com

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
slash the procrastinators and double your Patreon amount.

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,480
I find the term urban is totally rad, so keep going.

64
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,240
I thought you were gonna say racist as a SJW.

65
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
Way to explain the joke, Nate.

66
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,200
I fucked it up.

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Well, rad is a very white word as far as I'm concerned.

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,040
Read your fucking definition.

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,760
Here is what he's the definition of SJW.

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,720
Social justice warrior, a pejorative term for an individual

71
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,440
who repeatedly and vehemently engages in arguments

72
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,520
on social justice on the internet,

73
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,320
often in a shallow or not well thought out way

74
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
for the purpose of raising their own personal reputation.

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,840
And that's the important part.

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
And here's the special bonus definition today,

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
because I thought it behooved us to define specifically

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
social justice itself, to be a little clear

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,780
as to what we're talking about here.

80
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,820
So here is the urban dictionary definition

81
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,380
for social justice, promoting tolerance, freedom,

82
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,980
and equality for all people regardless of race, sex,

83
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,340
orientation, national origin, handicap, et cetera,

84
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,420
except for white straight cisgendered males.

85
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,740
Fuck those guys, they're overprivileged no matter what.

86
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,580
That's true.

87
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,020
That's the deal, that's where we're starting.

88
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,940
I wanna start off by saying I don't agree

89
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,860
with that definition of social justice.

90
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,700
It's a meme.

91
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,540
It's a joke.

92
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,340
Yeah, so everything except the fuck white guys.

93
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,900
Ben does agree with that, though.

94
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,340
He's like, yeah, that's me, that's me, right, Ben?

95
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,340
As a cis white male, I know that I deserve no rights

96
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,660
and no consideration.

97
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,980
Good, good, good, good.

98
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,820
Yes.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,700
You there, boy, what day is it?

100
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,580
Why is Mon Luther King Day, sir?

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,100
Mon Luther King Day, bring me some social justice.

102
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,780
Here's a tuppence, my lord.

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,140
For the sake of organization,

104
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,100
I think we should start off

105
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,020
when everybody goes around the horn and says,

106
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,180
you know, what's your stance on social justice warriors?

107
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
That's a good way to start.

108
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,020
Probably evolve a debate from that.

109
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,060
That's probably a good call.

110
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,900
Monkey, why don't you start us off?

111
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,660
Well, I think it's no secret that I'm not a fan.

112
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,780
Yeah, okay, I'm a racist, it's fine.

113
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,660
I'm also a sexist, a misogynist.

114
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,740
Just anyist that's negative, you can say I am.

115
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,020
So I'm pretty much against the idea of,

116
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,180
the social justice warrior who like innate definitions,

117
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,340
who was very loud and obnoxious,

118
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,940
but in a way where it's hypocritical,

119
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,060
not in the good hippo way,

120
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,420
but how are the good gibbon way, I should say,

121
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,420
but in the way where they want equality in quotes

122
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,740
and their version of equality

123
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,180
is special treatment for people like me

124
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,700
and disregard the issues of others.

125
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,420
That's what I think the modern day

126
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,780
social justice warrior is.

127
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,620
Can I insert my little definition in there?

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,500
I was reading about it ahead of time

129
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,060
just to make sure I was sort of up to snuff

130
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,500
on sort of the more accurate definition.

131
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,580
And it's kind of this Leninist, Communist sort of idea

132
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,220
in terms of society where there is,

133
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,860
the goal is an equality of outcome for all

134
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,260
in terms of society, as opposed to eliminating the barriers.

135
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,420
No, it is equality of outcome.

136
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,580
That's what it's about.

137
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,500
Equality of outcome in terms of society

138
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,260
in a social context, which necessitates

139
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,100
a large degree of control on people

140
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,220
to force the people above down

141
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,100
and lift the people below up to get the same right.

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,940
Okay, so that's-

143
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,260
Social Marxism as the buzzword is.

144
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,220
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,060
I like Leninist though,

146
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,900
because it makes me sound smart.

147
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,860
It does sound cooler, I'll give you that.

148
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,460
Okay, monkey, have any further?

149
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,260
I have a lot more to say, but I'll save it for later.

150
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,100
Okay.

151
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,940
How about you, Munchy?

152
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,660
What are you, where are you at, brother?

153
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,460
You're Californian, so you're gay, right?

154
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,660
I'm a Californian.

155
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,860
One time, Bernie Sanders actually ate my poop.

156
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,500
He actually came into my house

157
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,220
and he actually ate my poop,

158
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,780
so that changed my fucking life.

159
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,980
Were you that bird that landed on his podium that one time?

160
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,820
Was that you?

161
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,660
Yeah.

162
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,980
Okay, cool.

163
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
If we're gonna be serious about Bernie,

164
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,020
I actually shook that man's hand.

165
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,460
It was an honorable moment in my life.

166
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,300
Really?

167
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
What was that?

168
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,980
He came to my college.

169
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,300
What?

170
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,140
I stopped trying to call it my social movement, Munchy.

171
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,140
Anyway, I think, while their efforts are noble,

172
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,300
they're debatably noble.

173
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,060
No, they're fucking noble, they're great.

174
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,940
However, they're also bad.

175
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
Well, they are mean, and I don't like that part of it.

176
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,220
So you think that they got their hearts in the right place,

177
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,500
but their tactics are mistaken?

178
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,180
Their tactics are that of a fucking boy.

179
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,900
I hate boys.

180
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,540
Uh-oh.

181
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,220
Yeah, that's a no-no.

182
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,580
How about Tom?

183
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,380
What do you think about all this?

184
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,220
I think my opinion is probably pretty close

185
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,100
to what Munchy was talking about.

186
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,260
I'm really not a huge fan of the hypocrisy of the movement

187
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,340
and the people in general.

188
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,940
There seems to be a lot of, instead of raising people up,

189
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
it's trying to push people at the top down.

190
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,780
Right.

191
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,260
And just like, I think this way about one thing,

192
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,100
but not about the other thing,

193
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,980
and I'm sure I can probably get into specifics

194
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,380
as the debate will continue.

195
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,140
I'm not a huge fan of social justice warriors.

196
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,980
It's interesting, back in 2012, 2013,

197
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,700
I was more on board with it

198
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,580
because I just kind of heard the service arguments

199
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,140
and it seemed to make sense,

200
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,780
but the more I digged into it,

201
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,860
the more I realized that a lot of it was bullshit

202
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,700
and based on false arguments.

203
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,820
So now I'm definitely more on the red pill side of things,

204
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,980
but I'm not super invested in any of it.

205
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,780
It's just kind of what I hear and stuff.

206
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,420
Yeah, so it's done.

207
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,260
Jesse, what are you saying?

208
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,740
Well, the PCP has slowly morphed over the years

209
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,900
or the last year into more and more

210
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,980
of the Jesse is Right podcast.

211
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,180
And I think this episode is going to be the most

212
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,600
Jesse is Right episode in quite some time.

213
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,900
Because everybody's wrong about social justice warriors.

214
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,460
Everybody's wrong about what a social justice warrior is.

215
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,940
Everybody has an idea in their head

216
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,780
of what a social justice warrior is.

217
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,060
And most of us picture the militant left,

218
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,380
but I say the term needs to be expanded

219
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,060
in people's minds to encompass people

220
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,460
on both sides of the extremist fucking spectrum.

221
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,540
Because I think if you're the kind of person

222
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,740
who is up in arms about social justice warriors,

223
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,300
then you are yourself a social justice warrior.

224
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
You're all the same.

225
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,140
You're all polarized, you're all politicized,

226
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
and you're all a fucking militant, tribalistic,

227
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,620
primitive cancer on this earth

228
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,180
that is holding us back as a species.

229
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,660
And every single one of you, all of you people,

230
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,700
all of you social justice warriors on the left,

231
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,540
all of you social justice warriors on the right,

232
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,220
you all need to be fucking terminated

233
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,980
and executed immediately.

234
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,780
Because you're destroying everything.

235
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,740
You're choking the empathy out of the human race,

236
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,300
and you all need to be fucking dealt with.

237
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,180
All right, Jess, no time out.

238
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,860
Jess, you just said if you're against social justice warriors,

239
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,500
then you are one, and then you say

240
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,060
they should all be exterminated.

241
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,500
So does that make you a social justice warrior?

242
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It makes me the one true social justice warrior.

243
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
The only one in the world, everyone else is doing it wrong.

244
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,780
There's one social justice warrior in us, me,

245
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,900
because I'm the only one who really cares about justice

246
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,180
and social progress for both sides, for all people.

247
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm the only one who's not sitting

248
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,780
in my own little fucking corner saying,

249
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,060
you know, rah-rah for the home team, fuck the other guys.

250
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,100
I'm the only intelligent person,

251
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,500
the only one standing against this wave of retardation

252
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,140
that is just drowning the entire world.

253
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm the only smart one,

254
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,020
and more people need to listen to me,

255
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
and no one else, fuck all of you.

256
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,580
The end.

257
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,300
I think more positively about the kind of,

258
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,660
what's the word I'm looking for, benevolent despot,

259
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,500
you know, that seems more and more appealing to me.

260
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,380
But okay, got it.

261
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,820
Note real quick, I should factor into my ideology

262
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,020
that I also find the opposite, well, yeah, as Jesse said,

263
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,780
just the same people on the right side,

264
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,820
almost more infuriating to me specifically.

265
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,980
I mean, like, what is really the difference

266
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,260
between this group of people who, you know,

267
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,740
everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi?

268
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,060
What's the difference between that

269
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,260
and everyone who disagrees with me is a cock?

270
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,380
They're exactly the fucking same mentality.

271
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,220
I see what you're saying.

272
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,780
I think that they sort of have come from the same place.

273
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,700
More, in recent history, it manifested more.

274
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,460
It's the same sense of sort of, you know,

275
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,100
fighting back against the ideology

276
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,860
that you feel is becoming too entrenched.

277
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,100
It's all, it's just, it's fighting fire with fire,

278
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,500
because like the social justice movement

279
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,700
hit the mainstream, it got a lot of attention,

280
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,660
and like, you know, you have like governments

281
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,460
and companies kind of capitulating to that ideology,

282
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,060
and you have people who are against it,

283
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,700
basically saying like, okay, if you wanna be tribalist,

284
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,100
we're gonna be a tribe and fight you with tribalism,

285
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,060
which is kind of like the natural reaction,

286
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,300
but not the one that's very well thought out.

287
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,060
So like, they're both, they're both operating

288
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,460
using the same tactics, but with different ideologies

289
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,620
and different value systems.

290
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,260
So they're both wrong in their execution,

291
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,060
despite having different kind of motivations for doing, so.

292
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,940
If you're talking about like, yeah,

293
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,180
these kind of political activists,

294
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,900
SJWs on both sides, then yeah, you're totally right.

295
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,700
So Hippo, what do you think, dude?

296
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,740
I think the clue is-

297
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,540
As the only non-American, I'm curious

298
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,380
what you have to say.

299
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,980
I mean, it's the same over here

300
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,620
because the internet's everywhere, but-

301
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,460
What?

302
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,300
The clue.

303
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,780
You guys have the internet?

304
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,260
Yeah, dude.

305
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,180
Whoa, okay.

306
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,260
Fuck that joke, it's stupid.

307
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,100
All right.

308
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I think that the clue is in the name.

309
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,700
Social justice warriors, they fight in wars with weapons

310
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,500
and they're brutal and they're clan based

311
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,940
and they attack people.

312
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,820
And social justice, I think, is a neat idea

313
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,100
that warriors have taken and used

314
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,740
to bludgeon people to death with.

315
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,940
It's just sort of, if you're fighting for a cause,

316
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,260
it's an okay cause, it shouldn't be ignored.

317
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,380
It's not the biggest problem in the world, social justice,

318
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,900
but it shouldn't be ignored, it's real.

319
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,060
And it's good to have more representation and stuff

320
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,220
and their quality and all that, people being good.

321
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,340
And then we've got all these warriors and a war

322
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,100
and it's like everything that's called a war.

323
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,180
It's like everyone gets hurt and nobody's happy

324
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,340
and everything's shit.

325
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,220
So I think the warriors is the main part

326
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,900
that sucks about it all.

327
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,100
That's my stance.

328
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,940
Okay, I'll say mine before we get to Ben's

329
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,140
because I think his might be the most different.

330
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,820
I agree with most of you guys.

331
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,780
I don't care for a lot of the tech.

332
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,700
I mean, if we're talking about not people

333
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,100
promoting these kinds of ideas,

334
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,980
but specifically the SJW people.

335
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,620
Yeah, not a fan of what seems to be,

336
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,400
I see this happen on both sides a lot,

337
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,580
the kind of willing to ignore facts.

338
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,380
Like the goal is to promote the ideology

339
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,380
as opposed to intellectually honestly pursue

340
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,140
what appears to be correct and then operate based on that.

341
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,500
That's where I really, that's where I get my most annoyance.

342
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,540
When I see things like, just to bring up one big example.

343
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,380
Just monks, then it might be better.

344
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,100
That's true, that's true.

345
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,460
Like one thing that infuriates me that gets brought up

346
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,540
is the way that the gender pay gap

347
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
gets brought up repeatedly.

348
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,980
And it's not inaccurate to say that men overall

349
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,860
earn more than women overall,

350
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,020
but it's in the nuance of that point

351
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,060
where either deception or the actual truth lies

352
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,340
because the truth is that,

353
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,340
they say 77 cents on the dollar.

354
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,660
It is that men overall, in total,

355
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,780
all people, all men in America make like 100 cents

356
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,940
compared to the average woman's 77 cents,

357
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,540
but that's during net earnings for a year.

358
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
So it's just that women are in different jobs

359
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,460
and there may be a small pay gap,

360
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,660
but it is not the massive,

361
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,300
like almost 25% people talk about.

362
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,500
And it's when people bring up that idea,

363
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,820
like Obama himself did it.

364
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,780
And I'm sure people have heard this a thousand times,

365
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,020
but like Obama said sense,

366
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,460
we have to pay women the full amount that men get paid.

367
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,300
It's just not fair.

368
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,540
It's me, President Barack Obama, this is how I am.

369
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,100
It's in the way that he presented that point,

370
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,580
which made it look like your average business

371
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,460
gives a woman 77 cents and a man doing the same job,

372
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,340
one dollar, which is factually inaccurate.

373
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,660
And it is by saying things like that,

374
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,740
that people are deceived and you create this kind of outrage

375
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,040
about things that aren't real.

376
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,880
So like when you've got people who are outraged

377
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,080
by things that aren't true,

378
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,640
fighting people who are aware of the truth,

379
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,960
like I don't really blame the people getting mad.

380
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,120
They've just been filled false information

381
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,360
and they're confronted with conflicting information.

382
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,520
Of course there's gonna be a conflict.

383
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,760
Like what else could you expect in a situation like that?

384
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
So it comes like the responsibility is on everyone

385
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,080
to be truthful and honest and accurate.

386
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,360
But people aren't capable of pursuing

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,000
that responsibility or holding to it.

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,760
People are, they're not looking for nuance.

389
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,800
They're looking for an excuse

390
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,440
to justify their own bitterness

391
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,640
and everything that they do.

392
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,600
It's all that people care about because like,

393
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,120
you should be able to say,

394
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,400
any intelligent person should be able to say,

395
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,640
well, obviously the wage gap is not a real thing

396
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,400
because I work with women and they don't make,

397
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,960
you know, more or less than me, you know.

398
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Everyone should be able to, but people can't,

399
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
people have this like conflation they do where like,

400
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,600
if one thing supports their side,

401
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,120
then everything must support their side,

402
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,280
even if it doesn't.

403
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,720
Well, the wage gap isn't true and that's bullshit.

404
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
So, you know, everyone who believes in that is dumb.

405
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Yeah, okay.

406
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,200
It's not true and it's dumb.

407
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
And also this stuff about, you know,

408
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
how women might sometimes like get harassed in the workplace.

409
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,720
That's also not true because the wage gap, like, what?

410
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,240
No, you can have both.

411
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,160
You can have a brain and have empathy,

412
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,480
except you can't, only I can.

413
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
Going back to what you were talking about.

414
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
That's why everyone hates me.

415
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,320
The left hates me because I have a brain

416
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,720
and the right hates me because I have empathy.

417
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
Well, it just goes back to what you were saying earlier

418
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
about how both sides are dumb.

419
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,320
It's because there seems to be no room in people's heads

420
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,200
or this discussion in general, you're aside for nuance.

421
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,400
You know what the problem is?

422
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,840
The problem is, I think, I see this all the time.

423
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,320
And God, I see this with guys like Sargon.

424
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,280
They just like block out things that look like they're correct

425
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,800
and they're just not focused.

426
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,440
There's this problem of focus where people just do not

427
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,560
emphasize the things that are true,

428
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,160
but don't help their argument.

429
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,360
It's not like you're lying, but this is the whole problem,

430
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,200
that it's so hard to be intellectually honest

431
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
and accurate with your information.

432
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
And there's this additional problem

433
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,080
that I think people have such a hard time

434
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
relating to things that don't,

435
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,280
and I don't blame them at all.

436
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm like this too, everyone's like this.

437
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,760
People have such a hard time processing macro issues

438
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,200
as opposed to specific issues in their life.

439
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Like if you have a job and the women there

440
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,840
aren't sexually harassed, it is your experience in life

441
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,400
that women never get sexually harassed ever.

442
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,960
So you're like, why is this a problem?

443
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,840
It never happens.

444
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Look at my life.

445
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,760
This has never happened to me.

446
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,120
Like I understand why that guy would think that way.

447
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
It's, that's right.

448
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,200
It's when you live in a bubble, when you live in a bubble

449
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,880
and you've never seen discrimination

450
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,560
or you've never seen what you considered re-discrimination

451
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,080
and you've never seen inequality,

452
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,440
it's easy to tell yourself that it doesn't exist.

453
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,360
That's why people talk about white privilege

454
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,920
and the thing about white privilege

455
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,840
is that white people can deny that it exists

456
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,200
because they don't have to deal

457
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
with the ramifications of not having it.

458
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,000
And what they say is that if you don't,

459
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,320
like only if you don't have white privilege

460
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,800
do you need to acknowledge it, you know?

461
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,040
Like if you've got white privilege,

462
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,400
the part of that privilege is the privilege

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
to pretend that there is no white privilege.

464
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
And to take it one step further,

465
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
I would say that like,

466
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
I'm talking kind of about that bubble as well,

467
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
but about like a bubble that is unavoidable for anyone.

468
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,760
And that is that like we observe the world

469
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,960
through our individual perception as one human being.

470
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,040
But like the most accurate way to like deal with this problem

471
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,200
is to look at things like mass gathered statistics.

472
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,840
It's like the only way to accurately assess like,

473
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,880
okay, how much of a problem is like workplace sexual harassment?

474
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,800
Like no one's individual account

475
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
is going to help us solve that problem particularly much.

476
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,560
You have to aggregate like all the information.

477
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,040
And it's so easy to just look at that and be like,

478
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,880
ah, fuck it, I don't care.

479
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
I don't care about that.

480
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,960
Even if you aggregate like the statistics,

481
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,520
you then have, well, okay, but what is the actual like cost

482
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,360
of that?

483
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
Like how like, like, like no two,

484
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
no two harassments are like the same.

485
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,000
You can't put like a dollar amount on them.

486
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,440
Yeah, yeah, that's another problem.

487
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,400
Experiences are the same, no two people.

488
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,760
That's why the whole privileged, you know,

489
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,920
genre of arguments in general is fucking goofy and retarded.

490
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,120
Well, I think like the whole thing is that you can have,

491
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,160
like I don't think there's like people who say

492
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,040
there's no such thing as like racism or discrimination

493
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,760
or like white privileges and the thing.

494
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
I think that's stupid.

495
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,400
Of course there is, you know,

496
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,200
there are people out there going to think that my problem

497
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,240
is when you have social justice worries saying

498
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,000
that all of this is systemic,

499
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,480
which I don't think there's really any basis

500
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,320
for saying there's systemic.

501
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,880
Can you define systemic for everybody?

502
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,440
Cause that seems to get fucked up a lot.

503
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,040
Well, I mean, as far as I can understand systemic,

504
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,840
when social justice refers to something as systemic racism

505
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
or systemic privilege and stuff like that,

506
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,440
it's talking about a concept that is pervasive

507
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,120
throughout all of society

508
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,600
or is like ingrained in law somehow.

509
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Yeah, does it necessarily imply that it's baked

510
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
into law specifically or can like?

511
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,760
Sometimes it sounds like that's what they're,

512
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,680
I mean, again, like I'm not a social justice warrior.

513
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,880
I think the problem here is that it's a little bit too vague

514
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,520
and like we can, we can have different meanings.

515
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,000
The interesting thing with the social justice argument

516
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,640
is that it kind of like points at a boogeyman sometimes.

517
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,280
It's like, okay, cause like you have people saying like,

518
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,360
we need to end, we need to end white privilege.

519
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
It's like, okay.

520
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,960
Does anyone really think,

521
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,720
does anyone who knows what white privilege is

522
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
and understand what it actually means,

523
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
does anyone like that actually think we can just end it?

524
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
Well, that's the whole thing.

525
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
It's like, what do you, why,

526
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,200
that's what they want to do.

527
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,080
They want this equality of outcome.

528
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,160
And they want, we can't, we can't just end.

529
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,840
Okay, good.

530
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
Can't we just all get along?

531
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,040
No, well, can't we all just Pokemon go to the polls?

532
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,720
I mean, yes, queen.

533
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,280
That's the solution to all of our problems.

534
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
It's her time.

535
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,320
It's her time.

536
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,360
Hi, here's my second Hillary song.

537
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,680
What up, wow, Hillary.

538
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,520
You make my ass whole flame, Hillary.

539
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,840
I got AIDS, thank you, Hillary.

540
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,680
Wow.

541
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,880
Hillary Clinton, widespread AIDS support.

542
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
Hillary Clinton, everybody, she'll be here all week.

543
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah, all right, thank you, Hillary, thank you.

544
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,480
No, it's Hillary fan 306.

545
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,640
Oh my God.

546
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,720
I was gonna say Hillary fan 666, she's the devil.

547
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,480
She's my queen, I worship the devil.

548
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,000
But anyway, so we didn't get to Ben.

549
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So Ben, why don't you tell us your stance on this?

550
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,360
I need to get in the bra, what's up?

551
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Well, I really believe, I really believe in all the ideals

552
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,560
that I think the SJW movement is, like, wants.

553
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,720
Like, everything that they want, I think would be great.

554
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,680
You know, equality, representation, egalitarianism,

555
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,440
everyone gets a fair shake.

556
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,440
But like, okay, I don't believe that equality of outcome,

557
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,280
like, to bring about equality of outcome,

558
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,920
you would just have to take away everyone's freedom.

559
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
Like, you would just have to dictate

560
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,120
exactly what everyone gets and make sure

561
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,960
everyone gets the same thing.

562
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
State-enforced communism is what that amounts

563
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,600
to all times.

564
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,440
Yeah, that's what it would be.

565
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,760
State-enforced homosexuality.

566
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,840
It's coming, dude, it's coming.

567
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,840
So like, I'm all about equality and SJW bullshit

568
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,480
and all that crap that sucks, but I stop short

569
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,040
of being willing to like call for like...

570
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,880
Equality for everyone but Pokemon.

571
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,840
They're not people, they're not people.

572
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Yeah, but like, yeah, I also don't believe

573
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
in telling people what to do.

574
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,040
Like, I kind of think that like, if an employer is racist

575
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
and hates Mexicans, like, if he starts his business

576
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,600
and is like, well, I'm not gonna hire any Mexicans,

577
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
I mean, that sucks, but I kind of think

578
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,160
that's his prerogative in a way.

579
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Yeah, you would think like, really,

580
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,800
ideally the free market would just be like,

581
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,720
well, fuck that guy, we're not gonna, you know,

582
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,600
if you can deal with that.

583
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,440
Like, one of the things that, one of the stories

584
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
in a couple, in recent years that really got to me

585
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
was for this issue, like, there was a baker

586
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,480
who was asked to make a cake for a gay wedding

587
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,240
and they're religious, I hate all religious people,

588
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
by the way, but they didn't want to

589
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,720
because of their religion and, you know,

590
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,160
because they're Christ fags or whatever.

591
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,360
And so they didn't want to.

592
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,320
And then later on, like, they were sort of,

593
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,240
they were forced to do it, like, they were sued

594
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,680
or whatever and they were forced to do it.

595
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,800
Well, that's some bullshit.

596
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,080
That's where I hit a fucking, that's where I get mad

597
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,200
because to say that you're not allowed to, like,

598
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,920
hurt people, totally on board, makes sense to me,

599
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,440
but to force people to do things

600
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,160
that they don't want to do, that's, like,

601
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,440
that's a whole nother ballgame, to impel action

602
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
at, like, otherwise you'll go to jail or whatever.

603
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,480
Yeah, like, saying, like, if these people were straight,

604
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,440
you would have done this, therefore, you have to do it.

605
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,560
Yeah, right, that's not.

606
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
I think a lot of the social justice,

607
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,840
there's like this, they don't understand that

608
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,760
even if, like, people hate people, like groups of people,

609
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,160
they all, even if race wasn't a thing,

610
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,560
we would hate each other based on what town we came from

611
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,760
or, you know, what street you came from,

612
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,160
like, various things we would divide ourselves up into

613
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,560
and say, well, I don't like those people,

614
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,840
they're from the next town over.

615
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
If it wasn't race, it would be something else.

616
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,280
So you can't ever end, like, subjugation of a group.

617
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,960
Yeah, it's never, it's impossible to do.

618
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
That's an interesting point,

619
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,640
because I think that a large,

620
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,800
I think a lot of it comes from, like,

621
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,040
a base-level ideological difference between,

622
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,920
between, like, more, I guess, conservative is the word to use,

623
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,640
conservative versus, like, SJW people,

624
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,200
which is that SJW people, in general, or, like, the left,

625
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
seems to have their mind, have in their mind,

626
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
and I kind of agree with this,

627
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,760
that people will be able, like, humans as a species,

628
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,680
will be able to overcome, like,

629
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,240
our generic kind of prejudices,

630
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,040
and we will be able to solve these kind of issues

631
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,880
as time goes on.

632
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,520
And so they're kind of working towards that,

633
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
whereas conservative people more accept

634
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,680
that that's a reality, that they can't change,

635
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,040
and are sort of comfortable trying to just deal with that

636
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,360
as far away as possible.

637
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,280
I would like it if people didn't care so much about race,

638
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,840
but I understand that there's always gonna be groups

639
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,960
dividing people up, you know,

640
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,400
even if we finally end, like, racism of skin color,

641
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
it's gonna be something else.

642
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,520
And I don't, I don't think, you know,

643
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,760
we're all ever gonna be on the same page ever

644
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,600
as a species.

645
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,640
I don't quite agree, but that's interesting,

646
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
that's interesting.

647
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,960
Well, I mean, you know, there's always,

648
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm thinking about Starfleet Dog,

649
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,960
I'm thinking about Starfleet.

650
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,400
There's too many people to get, like, on the same page.

651
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
I disagree.

652
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,040
Well, you know what, you know what's a great example of this?

653
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,640
I think the ending of Watchmen is a really cool

654
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,040
example of this sort of issue,

655
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,800
because at the end of Watchmen,

656
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
like, the world is about to be destroyed by these,

657
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,000
these kind of like, you know,

658
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,800
country-based divisions between, you know,

659
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,920
like, it's the Cold War,

660
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,540
it's a Russian America in the 80s,

661
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,140
and like they are on,

662
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,700
they are one minute from midnight,

663
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,820
which means like a nuclear war is like about to happen.

664
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,500
And so, Vite, or Ozymandias,

665
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,220
like the quote-unquote villain,

666
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,500
like he staged this whole operation

667
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,860
to basically trick humanity into not destroying itself

668
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,900
by uniting it against an interdimensional alien race

669
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,420
that they, that he like,

670
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,060
sets the situation up as invading Earth.

671
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
We don't have any of those.

672
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,260
And almost immediately, well, that he made one up,

673
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,860
he invented a false one,

674
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,540
and that at least temporarily solved the problem

675
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,460
of like humanity about to destroy itself.

676
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,540
And I sort of think that for just for one crazy example,

677
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,620
if we had something like, you know,

678
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,580
space travel and relationships with other alien life forms,

679
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,300
all of humanity would look at each other

680
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,340
and be like, you know what?

681
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,880
I guess we are pretty similar compared to these guys.

682
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,540
They're a bunch of weirdos that we don't understand,

683
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,380
but we, you know what I'm saying?

684
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,220
I think that perspective-

685
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I think that perspective, like if we had that,

686
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,740
would definitely help.

687
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,420
But I mean, the whole thing is that like,

688
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,580
for example, like we still hate people.

689
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,420
Like, even-

690
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,260
Of course.

691
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,340
I hate Ben Stain, for example.

692
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,820
You just said you hate all religious people.

693
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,380
Well, Nate, you just said you hate all religious people,

694
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,220
you know?

695
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
I do.

696
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,900
I do, I want to say that.

697
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,720
Like you thought it was a joke,

698
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
like you still, there's still some disdain

699
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,400
for religious people.

700
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,240
They're holding us back,

701
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,320
and I, oh my God, you totally got me.

702
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,660
You're absolutely right.

703
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,940
So, I'm a total hypocrite.

704
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,780
It's just like, we're always gonna have like prejudices.

705
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,380
And like, the thing is that like these prejudices,

706
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,700
they don't always come into play, you know?

707
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,460
Like, it's, I think it's less about our thoughts-

708
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,900
I like to think that this is a very

709
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,420
parental brain.

710
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,260
Oh, sorry, sorry.

711
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,100
Go ahead.

712
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,300
You can dislike somebody,

713
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,860
but as long as you don't let that,

714
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,580
like affect your day-to-day interactions,

715
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,700
that's what true tolerance is.

716
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,460
It's not about like loving everything.

717
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,340
It's just about like, you know,

718
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,780
letting bygones be bygones.

719
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,620
Like, you know?

720
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,380
Yeah, the best case scenario for the future

721
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,740
is that when somebody is like racist or whatever,

722
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,980
or dislikes a whole group of people,

723
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,260
they would just, they would channel it into apathy.

724
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,100
They would just be like,

725
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,820
oh, fuck that guy, I don't care, whatever.

726
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,880
It does, because it tends to not affect you directly.

727
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,720
Most of the time.

728
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,920
You know what this reminds me of?

729
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,600
This reminds me of my award-winning video on T-Bap.

730
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Keg reviews, putting your hoof down.

731
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,720
The world-famous My Little Pony episode.

732
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
Speaking of people I hate, fuck Bronies.

733
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,440
They're the worst.

734
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,400
It's just, Fluttershy is this cute little pony,

735
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
but in that episode, we learn that deep down,

736
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,360
she has a burning hatred for everyone in her life.

737
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,960
But what makes her the fitting element of kindness

738
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,160
is that she is able to suppress that rage.

739
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,000
Is that she looks past her friends,

740
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
horrible inadequacies.

741
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,860
Yes, that's right.

742
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,180
And she pretends to like them anyway.

743
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,380
And that's why she's the best guy ever.

744
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,220
She is the best.

745
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
She is the best.

746
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,540
Yeah.

747
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,940
Oh, I like that one.

748
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,980
I'm gonna put that in my book.

749
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,060
It's funny that you bring up My Little Pony,

750
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,460
because, and this sounds like a non sequadar,

751
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,060
but I'm gonna make it make sense.

752
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,980
Recently, they released on YouTube the teaser

753
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,500
for the My Little Pony movie.

754
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,260
Is this the real one with the actual ponies now?

755
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,060
Oh, that's exciting.

756
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,900
What are you talking about?

757
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,340
Well, you know, as opposed to like the humans,

758
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,940
as opposed to equestria girls.

759
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,780
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,620
It's the real.

761
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
That's not the movie.

762
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,140
But the teaser on YouTube has like mostly thumbs down.

763
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,100
And at first I'm like,

764
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,060
why the fuck does this teaser have so many thumbs down?

765
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,260
And then I realized, oh,

766
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,820
it's because people still hate bronies.

767
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,220
And like, this is like putting bronies

768
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,660
in the forefront again, I guess.

769
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,820
And it's like, yeah, and it's like,

770
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,220
how can people still be invested in like not,

771
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,900
like how can people still give a shit

772
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,980
about bronies like existing?

773
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,380
And it's the same thing with social justice.

774
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,700
Like when I hear people complaining

775
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,180
about social justice warriors now,

776
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
I just roll my eyes like,

777
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,860
how the fuck can you still care?

778
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,740
That you've been, you people have been circle jerking

779
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,340
about this supposed problem with social justice warriors

780
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,220
that's gonna destroy society for fucking like,

781
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,580
like almost 10 years now.

782
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,380
And you just, it's never gonna stop.

783
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,300
It's just gonna go in circles forever and ever.

784
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,900
And both sides are gonna continue destroying society

785
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,620
in tandem because they're never gonna stop

786
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,940
fucking throwing shit at each other.

787
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,060
And everyone in the middle is going to get rained on

788
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,620
by all this fucking poo punch from the sky forever.

789
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,140
How can you still fucking care?

790
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,980
That's the problem.

791
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,820
It's people caring too much about stupid bullshit

792
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,740
that doesn't matter.

793
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,220
People care too much about the president.

794
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
They care too much about, you know,

795
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,900
whatever goofy social issue scandal of the day is going on.

796
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,900
People posting on Facebook,

797
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,340
arguing with their friends and family members

798
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,180
about everything.

799
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,500
Everyone's a fucking social justice warrior now

800
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
about something.

801
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,700
Everyone's got a fucking hill to die on about something

802
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,540
and fucking argue with everyone about something.

803
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,620
And it's just like, you know what the problem is?

804
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,740
It's that people are fucking empty and bitter

805
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,580
and sad and pathetic.

806
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,420
They hate their lives.

807
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,100
They hate themselves and they can't admit it.

808
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,260
And they've never fucking loved anyone.

809
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,220
That's what the problem is.

810
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,020
I think if you've ever just cared about another human being,

811
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,580
then you would have some kind of fucking empathy

812
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,020
or compassion inside you.

813
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,300
And you would realize that all of this fucking

814
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,220
tribalistic shit is fucking goofy, man.

815
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,060
It's that the problem, people are stupid.

816
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,900
They have no lives.

817
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,020
They don't love each other.

818
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,980
No one has ever fucking loved anyone.

819
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,060
No one loves themselves anymore.

820
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
They're all cancer.

821
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,220
Everything is cancer.

822
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,020
Everything is bad and nothing is good.

823
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,620
The world is irreparably broken.

824
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,380
And I'm the only one who fucking sees it.

825
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,540
No one else can see it.

826
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,100
You know what you remind me of, Jesse?

827
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,580
You know that comic of XKCD about all the people on the bus

828
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,300
having the same thought about how they're the only

829
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,460
smart one in the world.

830
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,180
Yes, and I'm all the people on the bus

831
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,700
and nobody else is on my bus.

832
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,540
Exactly.

833
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,620
That's right.

834
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,900
Hey, Jesse, you know who you were on me of?

835
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,820
Have you ever seen a little show called

836
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,980
Bojack Horseman, bro?

837
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,820
LOL.

838
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,820
You're like that one.

839
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,660
You know, I think, I understand why it's gone like this.

840
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,660
It's because the internet is based mostly in text.

841
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,860
And through text, you can't ascertain someone's

842
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,860
like real mood or the way they're saying something.

843
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,220
And we've seen it in our chat.

844
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,260
Like sometimes we'll be arguing and we won't actually

845
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,020
be as mad as we seem like we are.

846
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,420
And then on the internet, people,

847
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,580
they see these things on Twitter,

848
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,580
they argue over forums and Facebook and stuff.

849
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,740
And they come away thinking that these other people

850
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,940
are way angrier than they actually are.

851
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,220
And that's sort of like, it's gone in circles

852
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,940
and cycles and cycles and circles.

853
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,300
And to the point where people themselves

854
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,460
are in general being angrier.

855
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,620
There's a great communication is on the internet.

856
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,700
It's just people accusing each other of being mad

857
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,500
over and over again in a circle.

858
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,660
There's this great little flash game on Newgrounds

859
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,180
called You Become What You Behold.

860
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,020
Oh yeah.

861
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,820
And it's like a bunch of little stick figures

862
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,380
running around a room and you have like a camera.

863
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,580
And you can take pictures of things

864
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,460
and they show up on the TV screen in the middle of a room

865
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,260
and all the stick figures look at it and they react to it.

866
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,220
And basically what the point of the game is that

867
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,260
like they only care, like the stick figures only care

868
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,980
if you photograph something like bad happening.

869
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,620
So you'll photograph people that like bump into each other

870
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,580
and fight each other like a square and a circle

871
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,780
because they have different shaped heads.

872
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,380
Like a square and a circle will get mad at each other.

873
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,660
You photograph that and you put it on the screen

874
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,700
and then more like squares and circles

875
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,980
get mad at each other.

876
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,900
And you just like take more and more pictures

877
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,660
of like the people being mad at each other

878
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,340
because it keeps happening until everyone's mad

879
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,580
at each other and then it erupts.

880
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,540
And it creates this like sort of racist thing going on

881
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,020
between the squares and circles.

882
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,780
Yeah, everything was fine before.

883
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,740
Everything was fine before but because the racial tension

884
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,620
was so like brought to the forefront of media,

885
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,900
everyone like perceived it to be a bigger deal

886
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,700
than it was and then it got worse as a result.

887
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,340
Yeah, and the thing I really like about that

888
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,860
is that once it starts getting bad

889
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,820
and you try taking pictures of nice things happening,

890
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,420
it doesn't help, it just always continues to be worse.

891
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,060
Yeah, that's so, that's, that is an absolutely brilliant

892
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,900
representation.

893
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,260
It's true, I retweet wholesome memes every day

894
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,980
and the world still isn't fixed.

895
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,100
You're doing your part too.

896
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,500
You're doing, so, Jess, I don't want to misinterpret

897
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,940
your argument before I go against it.

898
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,340
So are you saying we shouldn't be talking about SJWs

899
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,380
in the first place because they aren't causing

900
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,740
any real harm?

901
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,740
No, I think that they are causing harm,

902
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,500
but I think that, you know, if you give a shit, fuck you.

903
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,580
So what harm, what harm would you say that they're causing?

904
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,060
I don't understand a question.

905
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,900
I don't understand a question.

906
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,500
You literally just said they're causing harm,

907
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
so what harm are they causing?

908
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,060
What do you mean?

909
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,860
What are you talking about?

910
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,300
Maybe you can give an example.

911
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,140
Okay, sure.

912
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,380
Job lynch mobs, that's an entirely SJW run thing.

913
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,740
People losing their jobs for having the wrong opinion

914
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,220
for saying the wrong word.

915
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,620
These SJWs are dangerous because they'll go after

916
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,620
these people online, they'll contact their employer,

917
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,340
they'll contact their family, their friends,

918
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,420
do whatever they can to ruin their lives.

919
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,540
Just because they have the wrong opinion politically,

920
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,100
or they say a word out of context or something.

921
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,260
So that's an example of how SJWs cause harm.

922
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,940
You're ascribing a philosophy to behavior,

923
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,500
but the behavior is done by people with all manner

924
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,380
of political and social stances.

925
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,860
I mean, it's not just social justice warriors

926
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,980
harassing people or setting out to fuck with people

927
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,340
or ruin each other's lives.

928
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,500
Everyone does that.

929
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,540
I mean, are you gonna tell me that?

930
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,900
Are you gonna tell me that polox don't go around?

931
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,180
Not polox the country, I mean like 4chan kids.

932
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,380
Are you gonna tell me that people on the right

933
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,220
don't do the same thing?

934
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,060
Yes, you've already defined for all of us

935
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,420
that social justice warriors are both into the spectrum.

936
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,780
So let's say I automatically agree with you.

937
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,420
If I'm saying social justice warriors

938
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,220
means angry idiots who care too much about stupid shit

939
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,780
and fight each other, then they, yeah, they just.

940
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,220
Oh yeah, well then that's definitely the,

941
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,060
yeah, that's the problem,

942
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,660
but the way to fight that problem

943
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,660
is not by caring more in response.

944
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,420
I think the way to solve it,

945
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,220
not that I would know,

946
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,740
but I think is just to be a nicer person in real life

947
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,500
and leave the internet alone a bit more.

948
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah, I think the problem in general

949
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,100
is just to leave the internet.

950
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,220
Everyone, okay, the thing is we can't leave the internet

951
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,460
because that is real life now.

952
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,300
The internet is like the essential highway

953
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,260
through which everything important is done now.

954
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,060
You can't just, you know, ignore it.

955
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,420
You can't ignore it, but you can't listen it,

956
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,140
you can't like forget about Facebook.

957
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,500
Even if you, okay, I mean like if everyone did this,

958
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,580
then okay, that would make a difference,

959
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,420
but not everyone is going to be able to do this.

960
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,260
And currently, if I write a story saying, you know,

961
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,620
PewDiePie is a Nazi,

962
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,860
here are a bunch of screenshots that prove that,

963
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,780
no one knows.

964
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,740
I mean, immediately, they will first of all,

965
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
just see the headline and that will already,

966
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,780
like a billion people see it if I'm someone important,

967
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,420
like the fucking Wall Street Journal or whatever,

968
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,740
that will already make people flip out.

969
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,420
And it's just the reaction to that

970
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
without looking into the details,

971
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,300
which were 100% false in this case about PewDiePie.

972
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,820
It was just a bunch of stuff that were,

973
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,220
I mean, you could call it bad jokes,

974
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,260
but at no point was he ever advocating

975
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,380
for any of this stuff.

976
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,740
It was all just, in fact,

977
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,620
much of the time he was making fun of Nazis.

978
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,780
That is true, I mean.

979
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,380
Nonetheless, it's the response that is inevitable

980
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,100
in the day and times that we live in right now,

981
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,260
that people will flip out and corporations are forced,

982
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,060
as money-making machines, to react to it,

983
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,860
no matter what the actual truth is,

984
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,180
just if people are mad, they have to act

985
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,020
if they want to keep their problems up.

986
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,380
Well, on the PewDiePie thing, I mean,

987
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,020
I think we all agree that it's trumped up charges

988
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,780
and it's fucking ridiculous and false claims

989
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,500
and it's retarded. Of course, it's been proven many times.

990
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,740
You know, it's just people lying for clicks

991
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,300
and they should all be hung.

992
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,180
But it's not as though the people on that side

993
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,540
or whatever don't have a point at all,

994
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,540
because the idea that a guy with PewDiePie,

995
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,740
with all this reach and this young audience,

996
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,020
this impressionable audience,

997
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,020
the idea that joking about Nazis and stuff

998
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,180
and joking about rightist ideas, right ideas,

999
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,460
is seeping into young, impressionable minds

1000
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,140
and making them who might not be as in tune

1001
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,420
with satire or the memory behind it all,

1002
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,780
that they might grow to honestly believe it.

1003
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,980
I mean, that's obviously true.

1004
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,220
That does happen.

1005
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,100
I mean, that's what memes are.

1006
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,420
Memes are just thought control.

1007
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,220
It's just the way that people spread their message

1008
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,300
in a humorous way.

1009
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,620
It is impressioning minds to feel a certain way.

1010
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,020
I mean, I don't think that that's

1011
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,780
the entertainer's responsibility at all

1012
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,100
to give a shit about that,

1013
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,380
but I mean, it is a valid point in some small way.

1014
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,340
You know, I kind of do think it is,

1015
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,660
I sort of agree actually on the,

1016
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,300
I do think that you have a responsibility as PewDiePie,

1017
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,620
like legally you're not going to be held

1018
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,420
to any kind of standard, like, oh, you have to,

1019
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
you know, make people smart or whatever,

1020
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,460
but there's definitely a responsibility

1021
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,900
if you're reaching millions of people every single day

1022
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,340
with the things you say to not be a monster,

1023
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,060
which he's not, but like the worst thing he did,

1024
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,420
the objectively worst thing he did was make a joke

1025
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,620
about like, wow, will these guys on Fiverr

1026
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,260
actually write a sign that says death to all Jews

1027
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,860
or like kill all Jews or whatever it was,

1028
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,220
even though it was that followed by subscribe to Keemstar.

1029
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,300
I mean, I definitely think that like PewDiePie

1030
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,020
was like the wrong target to make that point with

1031
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,740
because all he does is make silly jokes.

1032
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,620
But any story about PewDiePie gets views,

1033
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,620
so that's the perfect one to do it about.

1034
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,800
I mean, like, if they were saying that like,

1035
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,140
that like, Sargon of Akkad is the problem,

1036
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,580
then maybe they'd have more of a case.

1037
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,260
I, I, okay.

1038
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,380
I don't really watch him,

1039
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,780
but I assume it's, he's basically the amazing atheist,

1040
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,380
but different slightly.

1041
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,220
What does he talk about?

1042
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,700
Sargon has transformed.

1043
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,420
I admit, I watch Sargon and he has,

1044
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,260
he has transformed over views.

1045
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,220
He just talks about social justice issues,

1046
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,140
just like, you know, free speech and shit like that, you know?

1047
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah, that's true.

1048
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,220
He was speaking to Brexit because he's in England.

1049
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,060
Yeah.

1050
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,900
That was the thing that we talked about.

1051
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,300
I think, well, we tend to bash Sargon.

1052
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,860
He's very, he's very evidence-based.

1053
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,820
I mean, he definitely has his agenda

1054
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,860
in that he has his opinions and, you know,

1055
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,700
presents them where appropriate.

1056
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,740
We tend to bash Sargon a lot on this show,

1057
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,340
but it's mostly because I can't think of any other names

1058
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
that are in that genre.

1059
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,340
Yeah, like, I have famously feuded on Twitter

1060
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,740
with Sargon of a kind.

1061
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,580
Yes.

1062
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,300
Earning Ben swaths of Patreon bucks, right?

1063
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,420
It's not that I think that Sargon is the worst of his kind.

1064
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,740
It's that, it's that I hate his whole kind

1065
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,580
and he's just the one that comes to mind the easiest.

1066
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,860
He's just the first, he's just the first name I think of

1067
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,180
when I think of like right-leaning internet pundits.

1068
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,620
I, yeah, I hear what you're saying.

1069
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,300
I do think, just, I don't know,

1070
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,420
this is even appropriate to say now.

1071
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,060
It's just that I do think that he's gotten more concerned

1072
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,340
about providing factual like reasoning

1073
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
behind what he's saying and he does a lot of reading

1074
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,420
and presents like, oh, well, I read this book, you know,

1075
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,180
fucking The Republic by Plato or whatever

1076
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,260
and it has this idea.

1077
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,420
I'm applying that to this thing I see happening.

1078
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,260
So I don't know why I'm defending the guy.

1079
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,140
Yeah, I mean, and obviously if there was like a,

1080
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,060
like a left-leaning pundit that I could equally think of

1081
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,260
to name and shit on him that I would, you know.

1082
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,100
Anita.

1083
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,940
Anita's the one.

1084
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,500
I hate that, I hate the fact that

1085
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,980
in order to shit on someone,

1086
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,100
you have to find someone on the opposite end of the spectrum

1087
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,380
to also shit on or else everyone's going to accuse you

1088
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,740
of being on that side.

1089
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,180
That's, yeah, that's true.

1090
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,020
That's where we're at.

1091
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,740
Well, it's the cultural binary.

1092
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,620
It's always been there, that's bullshit.

1093
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,460
You're right on.

1094
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,740
There's a guy I found recently called Quinton Reviews

1095
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,340
who he made, he's made a couple of drama videos about,

1096
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,780
but he, and a few reviews and stuff.

1097
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,340
And he seems like really nuanced.

1098
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,460
Like he's like exactly in the middle

1099
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,340
in terms of being a totally reasonable human being.

1100
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,220
And I kind of really love that because he's like,

1101
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,780
he's actually kind of, he's got a hundred thousand subs

1102
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,660
and he's like doing decently well

1103
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,740
and he's not crazy on one side or the other.

1104
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,500
Like he did a review of Ghostbusters

1105
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,380
and he actually talked about, you know,

1106
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
the new one.

1107
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,780
Mofeminism, Mofeminism!

1108
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,060
But he actually like went into it like,

1109
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,500
like as a normal person, like a real human being.

1110
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,020
And he said, well, you know, it's just an okay movie

1111
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,060
and all this and that.

1112
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,420
And then he explained what it was, you know,

1113
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,300
cause like every other video about Ghostbusters

1114
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,620
that I had seen was like, oh my God,

1115
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,940
I can't believe everyone likes it

1116
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,860
or I can't believe anyone hates it.

1117
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,500
It's like, whatever.

1118
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,340
I mean, I'm not trying-

1119
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,980
And his video is really nice.

1120
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,100
I mean, I'm not trying to say that like it's impossible

1121
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,580
to examine these issues from an unbiased

1122
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,140
or at least from a nuanced perspective

1123
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,500
or that like, you know, opinions are just bad

1124
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,860
and nobody should say anything about any social issue.

1125
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,420
I just, I'm just so like wary of people who care too much.

1126
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,740
I don't trust them.

1127
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,620
When I feel like someone gives too much of a shit

1128
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,100
about these issues, they just come off like they're just like,

1129
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,420
they must be like an empty, bitter weirdo to me.

1130
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,260
I mean, I think-

1131
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,940
I guess there's just people who are into politics

1132
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,780
and social issues.

1133
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,340
I think that's what makes an SJW

1134
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,220
is someone that cares too much about it.

1135
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,060
Yeah.

1136
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,340
To an unhealthy level.

1137
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,580
And I think we should bring back you, Mad Bro.

1138
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,380
That should really like grow.

1139
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,900
I don't know about that.

1140
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,460
That's the equivalent of get good.

1141
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,500
It's a discussion ending.

1142
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,940
It's like they are mad and they'll be like,

1143
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,700
I'm not mad and then they'll feel stupid for being mad

1144
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,260
and then they'll try and be normal.

1145
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,940
I suppose that's true.

1146
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,860
Yeah, you can tell a gamer goes into an old spaghetti factory

1147
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,100
and breaks all the dishes.

1148
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,060
What are you gonna do about liberals?

1149
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,180
He, that munchie really leveled up.

1150
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,620
No!

1151
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,940
No!

1152
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,260
Oh God.

1153
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,180
Guys, Gamergate.

1154
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,580
Gamergate was cool, right?

1155
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
Remember that?

1156
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,660
Guys, look at how fucking Gamergate.

1157
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,340
Well, I don't know what there is to say.

1158
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,540
Gamergate was a bunch-

1159
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,020
No, no, it was a joke, Nate.

1160
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,860
It was a joke.

1161
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,700
No, actually, don't actually start talking about it.

1162
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,940
Okay, abort, abort.

1163
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,580
Okay, DeVoo, you know, here's something

1164
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,420
that's interesting.

1165
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,260
DeVoo, I see this-

1166
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,860
Wait, have we done a PCP on Gamergate yet?

1167
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,700
We told you!

1168
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,340
We have!

1169
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,180
No!

1170
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,100
At least we are firmly post Gamergate

1171
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,420
so we can kind of assess it.

1172
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,980
Gamergate PCP, it'll be a bonus episode.

1173
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,300
I'm gonna kick that bonus episode.

1174
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,620
Gamergate, what's the problem?

1175
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,100
The next bonus episode, Gamergate,

1176
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,140
starring only Munchie.

1177
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,380
You know what, that could be plain everyone else.

1178
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,820
We should do it as a bonus episode.

1179
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
That would be pretty funny.

1180
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,140
It would be a fucking bad idea.

1181
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,660
The only reason I don't want to do it

1182
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,380
is because I had never looked into any of it

1183
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,060
and I don't care so much.

1184
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,900
I, that's the exact right perspective.

1185
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,820
It was, I feel like, not until months after it ended.

1186
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,460
Did I even begin to understand what Gamergate referred to?

1187
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,300
I was very invested in it for like the first three days of it

1188
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,420
and then it went on for like seven more months

1189
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,620
and I'm like, what is wrong with you people?

1190
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,900
What's going on?

1191
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,220
Why do you care?

1192
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,780
Hey, you know, I wanna talk about...

1193
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,340
It's because that slut Zoey Quinn

1194
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,900
slept her way to the top of the video game

1195
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,220
and I am insane!

1196
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,540
I'm a Gamer!

1197
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,220
I pricked my bones!

1198
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,740
I, man, I know a lot of shit about her that I read.

1199
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,060
But anyway, so Davoo mentioned something else.

1200
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,260
In the chat, he just said like,

1201
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,260
the Young Turks was all the time posted.

1202
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,100
Yeah, that's an example of like a left-leaning pundit

1203
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,940
on YouTube.

1204
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,660
The interesting thing about the Young Turks is that,

1205
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm coming out.

1206
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,820
I'm going like the Young Turks.

1207
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,740
I'm coming out of the closet.

1208
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,580
I watch the Young Turks all the fucking time.

1209
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,900
All the time, I watch the Young Turks.

1210
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,060
Among the most politically invested among us.

1211
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,060
I mean, I think Monkey might also be, but...

1212
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,660
That's possibly true.

1213
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,420
Here's the thing about the Young Turks though.

1214
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,260
Cenk Yuger, the main guy.

1215
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,780
I fucking love Cenk Yuger as a person.

1216
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,380
He is like the most fun and the most goofy and silly

1217
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,820
and I love everything he says until he starts talking

1218
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,580
about his SJW shit when I want to kill myself.

1219
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,260
Like the left-leaning Alex Jones a little bit.

1220
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,220
Oh, he would get so mad.

1221
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,540
I was thinking that same thing the other day.

1222
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,060
He would flip his shit because he hates Alex Jones.

1223
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,500
Did you ever see that video where they fought?

1224
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,340
It was great.

1225
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,180
Of course, of course.

1226
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,020
It was nuts.

1227
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,380
Have you ever watched Karen Strone or whatever?

1228
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,220
Strone?

1229
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,060
Strone?

1230
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,900
The fucking Gourds, what?

1231
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,740
The short haired lady.

1232
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,380
She's like an anti-feminist talker

1233
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,340
and she's very articulate and, you know,

1234
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,340
among the least retarded ones, I think.

1235
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,820
But she was on there, like that guy was just yelling at it

1236
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,660
like, shut up!

1237
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,620
Yes, you are oppressed, you fucking idiot!

1238
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,660
You stupid idiot!

1239
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,700
You so oppressed!

1240
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,540
Shut up!

1241
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,460
That blows my mind.

1242
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,820
It's so weird to see a fucking straight,

1243
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,820
almost white male telling a woman how oppressed she is

1244
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,300
when she's arguing against that.

1245
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,460
It's just, I mean, I get what's going on here.

1246
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,380
He might as well be hitting on himself.

1247
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,340
And I gotta say, one of the things,

1248
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,660
the biggest problem for me with Cenk in general

1249
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,220
is that he has this fucking retarded feud

1250
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,420
with one of my favorite people on the internet right now,

1251
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,500
Sam Harris.

1252
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,460
He has been fucking, just the other day,

1253
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,380
I'm watching the show,

1254
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,620
I'm watching the stream on like Friday or something.

1255
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,540
He just, he brings in a little joke

1256
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,260
just to shit on like Sam Harris out of nowhere

1257
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,100
because he just fucking hates the guy

1258
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,740
after he's the one who took all his arguments out of context

1259
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,020
and just doesn't understand what it is he's being.

1260
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,220
It's so fucking weird that he still is doubling down

1261
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,940
on that after Sam Harris fucking destroyed him

1262
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,780
for like an hour.

1263
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,380
I get it, he doesn't like it.

1264
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,620
Like now they're just fighting,

1265
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,580
now they just hate each other.

1266
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,980
But he got to that place,

1267
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,940
there's such a fucking retarded clusterfuck

1268
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,140
of his own circular, I'm sorry, I'm going on a rant.

1269
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,820
It sounds like you care a lot about it.

1270
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,660
I'm invested in that.

1271
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,900
And that means you're social justice,

1272
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,580
you're social justice warrior.

1273
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,140
I can't watch these fucks.

1274
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,260
And that means you need to Pokemon go to the polls

1275
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,340
to cleanse yourself.

1276
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,140
I need to vote for Hillary like 20 times

1277
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,060
to cleanse myself of this.

1278
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,220
That's my ablution.

1279
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,340
Memes are cool, I like the jokes,

1280
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,140
but I don't like the political ones.

1281
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,740
Hey, you know who doesn't like jokes?

1282
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,180
SJWs, those are offensive.

1283
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,940
Hey, let's talk about cultural appropriations.

1284
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,020
Let me talk about what I want to talk about.

1285
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,260
I go on YouTube and I go to my subscriptions

1286
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,140
and I have like, oh, there's another tab, trending.

1287
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,340
Let me reconnect with my fellow humans.

1288
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,460
What do they think is popular right now?

1289
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,540
It's all like anti-Donald Trump shit

1290
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,780
and I always watch it.

1291
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,980
Oh God, I hate the trending hashtags so fucking much.

1292
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,500
It's the worst, it's the worst.

1293
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,220
You guys don't like that shit?

1294
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,940
I almost always agree.

1295
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,540
And yeah, I basically always agree.

1296
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,900
I watched Donald Trump's stuff

1297
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,180
and I wanna know why is there not stuff

1298
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,020
like this for the right,

1299
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,700
because I want to watch every political opinion

1300
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,020
and then forward afterwards.

1301
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,100
I think we know why.

1302
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,540
They don't want you to see that shit.

1303
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,540
They are controlling it.

1304
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,100
There's no, all they have to do is add one tag

1305
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,180
about whatever to flag things as offensive

1306
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,020
and it won't, you know,

1307
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,980
because they control the system.

1308
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,820
They control it, right.

1309
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,060
You know, there's no doubt in my mind.

1310
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,900
I have been enjoying like Razorfists' rants

1311
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,140
about Donald Trump, people who hate him.

1312
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,260
Cause Razor, you know, what is the rageaholic guy?

1313
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,100
Yeah, Razorfists is great.

1314
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,940
Yeah, right, right.

1315
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,980
I like the fact that he's quick with his videos.

1316
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,820
So I don't have to sit

1317
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,380
through a 40 minute lecture or a podcast.

1318
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,580
That's kind of the problem with a lot of the alternative media,

1319
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,980
quote unquote, is they tend to be very long-winded

1320
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,540
because they're exhaustive in their points and stuff.

1321
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,180
Yeah, Saigon of a card.

1322
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,420
I think I've watched one video of Saigon's

1323
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,100
and it was just him sentence by sentence

1324
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,380
reacting to someone's video

1325
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,620
and it was like a 40 minute video.

1326
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,100
And I can't imagine unless I was already invested

1327
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,260
in his content that anyone would like

1328
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,020
I think that's kind of the problem

1329
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,700
with the alternative media and what's kind of happening.

1330
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,420
Like a great, a great channel

1331
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,540
if you want something that's like really unbiased

1332
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,380
for that is the Rubin report.

1333
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,860
I don't know if you guys ever, you've been heard about it.

1334
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,700
Oh yeah, I'm familiar with him.

1335
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,180
But he just interviews people from like all sides of.

1336
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,100
You know what they say, never rub another man's Rubin.

1337
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,140
He is gay.

1338
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,980
That's true.

1339
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,340
He would rub his own Rubin.

1340
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,500
I don't get it.

1341
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,580
But I think the problem is that

1342
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,500
when you have someone like a Saigon of a card

1343
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,660
and guys like that, is that because it's become their job

1344
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,900
they have to kind of keep placating to their audience.

1345
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,580
So I think that's a real thing.

1346
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,420
That's a real thing.

1347
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,260
Oh man, even if they don't realize it, that happens.

1348
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,140
That fucking steams me up.

1349
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,540
That fucking, yeah, because like,

1350
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,620
because their commenters are all people

1351
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,300
that agree with them and are in their fucking echo chamber

1352
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,260
and they, and because they're surrounded by people

1353
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,940
that like love them and believe in what they're doing,

1354
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,420
they're like, yes, what I'm doing is good.

1355
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,700
I'm making a positive contribution to this world

1356
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,340
because all my followers and fans think so.

1357
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,100
And I don't want to have to stress.

1358
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,940
I don't mean to.

1359
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,940
Now they're trapped, they're trapped in the cycle

1360
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,700
where the way that they make money and be popular

1361
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,540
is by hating on the other.

1362
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,420
And they're like, they couldn't,

1363
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,220
like they have no motivation to do anything else.

1364
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,300
They have a monetary incentive not to change their mind.

1365
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,140
Yeah, yes.

1366
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,460
It doesn't have to be necessarily malicious.

1367
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,060
That's so fucking much.

1368
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,140
Like imagine a situation if you're any of these guys

1369
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,900
and you have two stories to talk about,

1370
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,460
one that is like a vindication of Hillary in some way

1371
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,580
or one that's about her fucking up in another way.

1372
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,740
Like what do you think your audience

1373
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,100
is going to want to hear more?

1374
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:26,940
Like that's all it comes down to.

1375
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,860
That's like the big problem.

1376
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,900
And I mean, it's hard to put the blame squarely on them

1377
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,340
just because like, again, like that's how they make their money

1378
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,580
and they can't control their audience.

1379
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,140
It's not like when your audience is whipped up

1380
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,700
into a frenzy, how is it like, you know, like that's,

1381
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,980
I agree with the fact that they should be unbiased,

1382
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,380
but I never, I've always gotten upset

1383
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,860
when people have blamed them for like,

1384
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,140
your audience is just circle jerking in the comments.

1385
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,980
How dare you?

1386
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,820
It's like, well, there you don't control

1387
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,740
what the comments are, you know?

1388
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,700
It's not something that they do, but unfortunately,

1389
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,540
like it's interesting.

1390
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,300
There's a guy who does this kind of videos.

1391
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,820
His name's Harmful Opinions.

1392
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,660
And he-

1393
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,500
Yep, I know him.

1394
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,900
That guy is a fucking maniac.

1395
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,140
He's pretty, he like went against the whole grain

1396
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,620
and people have been giving him shit for it,

1397
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,700
but he's slowly starting to get people back to his side

1398
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,820
because like, there was that app, that candid app,

1399
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,820
that everyone was like, this is like a free speech app,

1400
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,740
and it wasn't, and he was the only one talking about it,

1401
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,060
but everyone else was under contract.

1402
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,900
He seemed to be right in the end.

1403
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,740
He seemed right.

1404
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,100
So, I don't know.

1405
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,060
I know way too much about all these people.

1406
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:21,900
Jesus Christ.

1407
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,740
Yeah.

1408
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,740
Well, you know, it's drama.

1409
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,780
It's interesting.

1410
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,300
You can't help but admit that, you know,

1411
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,260
you click on it because, ooh, what's all this about?

1412
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,700
Actually, I wasn't subscribed to drama with these guys

1413
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,940
until like three days ago,

1414
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,260
and I just unsubbed from everyone.

1415
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,860
So I was like, I have more important things to do

1416
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,460
than watch all this stuff,

1417
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:42,140
even though like, I'm kind of invested in like,

1418
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,860
the whole like social kind of game going on right now,

1419
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,380
because I just find it interesting.

1420
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,540
Well, see, that gets back to kind of Jesse's point

1421
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,140
about like, you know,

1422
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,460
should you really concern yourself with it too much?

1423
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,420
And like, I say, you know, I don't quite agree.

1424
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,260
I don't quite agree.

1425
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,700
I think that, I am concerned about like,

1426
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,520
yeah, I am concerned about the future

1427
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,500
and the way things are going.

1428
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,940
And like, this back and forth, sorry to just interrupt,

1429
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,780
but I mean, my whole thing is like this,

1430
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,740
this cultural back and forth is just perpetuating itself

1431
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,940
because everyone's fighting fire with fire, you know,

1432
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,340
they're fighting the extremism with more extremism.

1433
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,380
Everyone, I mean, I guess your instinct is to think

1434
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,780
that the way to combat all these people being wrong

1435
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,340
is to be right, but it doesn't matter.

1436
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,740
You're not gonna affect anything.

1437
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,340
All you're gonna do is make more people go back and forth.

1438
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,380
The only way to solve what you do.

1439
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,420
The only real solution is to find the people in your life

1440
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:37,300
that you care about and just hang out with them

1441
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,660
and be nice and be normal and take yourself out

1442
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:44,340
of this fucking insane war zone of shit-flinging.

1443
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,180
Just take yourself out of it.

1444
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:49,020
Oh yeah, see, what if I haven't got any friends?

1445
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,420
Then you should die.

1446
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,260
Oh no.

1447
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,100
Yeah, I think you're right though.

1448
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,540
And I can easily see like all these,

1449
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,380
oh yeah, all these things,

1450
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,780
these people like pawning each other

1451
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,740
and coming out with videos,

1452
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,820
like whoever you're already on the team of,

1453
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,620
you're just gonna get more polarized.

1454
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,420
There is not a lot of course correction

1455
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,420
so much as deepening of adherence

1456
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,260
to one side of the other.

1457
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,100
This whole meta-narrative could be solved

1458
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,580
if there was just compromise.

1459
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,220
Compromise, if both ends of the extremes

1460
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,780
could just sit down and just give a little ground,

1461
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,460
get a little ground and just like, okay.

1462
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,300
You don't have to do that.

1463
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,700
But there's no incentive to do that.

1464
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,940
Yeah, you know what, there's no financial incentive,

1465
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,780
there's no cultural incentive.

1466
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,580
Because that's the whole problem

1467
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,580
with having this all broadcast on social media

1468
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,460
is that shitting on the other person

1469
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,220
gets you more attention than trying to solve the problem.

1470
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,420
Like does anybody on either side invested

1471
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,980
in solving the problem anymore?

1472
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,820
Yeah.

1473
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,860
Well, I've noticed this, I mean,

1474
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,140
it's this kind of like this neutrality shaming again

1475
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,300
to get back on that old fucking topic.

1476
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,380
Oh dude, yes.

1477
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,580
Yeah, it's because, you know, like Centrist

1478
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,140
has been made into like a dirty world now.

1479
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,300
And it's like, you never see people

1480
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,860
just like coming down from like their extreme.

1481
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,740
If you see anyone change their mind at all,

1482
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,140
it's always I was one extreme and now I'm the other.

1483
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,820
I see articles all the time of like,

1484
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,900
I was on the alt-right and now I'm fixed

1485
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,060
because I'm on this side or I was a social justice ward

1486
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,220
and now I'm fixed because I'm on the other side.

1487
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,780
And it's like, no, you're not fixed.

1488
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,260
You just look like to another cancer.

1489
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,220
You just treated one cancer for another.

1490
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,820
Dude, it's that horseshoe theory, dude.

1491
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,620
It's that horseshoe theory that you offer

1492
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,940
the size of the spectrum resembling.

1493
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,380
It all comes back to drowning in horseshoes,

1494
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,660
the greatest YouTube channel video thing of all time.

1495
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,980
It all comes back to that.

1496
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,940
Horseshoe will never finally be solved.

1497
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,780
The most fucking prophetic, brilliant,

1498
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,260
artistic vision ever created by mankind.

1499
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,900
There's this thing that if you're a centrist,

1500
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,620
then what you are to the left is too far right and a racist.

1501
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,660
Or if you're a centrist to the left,

1502
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,980
then you're a fucking Nazi.

1503
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,380
It's almost as if like the horseshoe is endless.

1504
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,020
I'm a bitch!

1505
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,260
The war is finally coming together.

1506
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,660
We finally are cracking the code.

1507
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,180
But yeah, it's like, because I mean,

1508
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,900
if you're a centrist, then you're both sides' worst enemy.

1509
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,700
You're everything to everybody that they,

1510
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,300
you're every villain they want to paint you as.

1511
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,960
Because I mean, I make a lot of opinion-based videos,

1512
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,860
not because I particularly care about my opinion,

1513
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,660
but because it's like a launching pad for comedy for me.

1514
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,340
But you know, I can't help but have opinions.

1515
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,540
I can't help but say stuff.

1516
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,180
I fucking say things.

1517
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,100
But because I am more towards the center,

1518
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,260
I guess, on most things.

1519
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,380
It's like, you know, I'm hated by everyone in the world.

1520
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,740
That's why people fucking hate me so much.

1521
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,020
I've been called a social justice warrior.

1522
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,060
More times than I can count,

1523
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,260
I've been called a fucking whatever the opposite-

1524
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,980
You said that being puppy cat comic.

1525
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,940
That was pretty-

1526
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,100
I've been called an alt-right, like a Nazi.

1527
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:44,940
More times than I can.

1528
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,420
I've been called everything by both sides.

1529
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,500
Yeah, fucking, I've been called the social justice word

1530
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,300
because I did a video complaining

1531
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,060
that there was a page bent in my being puppy cat comic.

1532
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,300
You're a monster!

1533
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,020
Like half the comments were like,

1534
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,100
Oh, you read that fucking SDW trash unsubscribed.

1535
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,940
What the fuck is this?

1536
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,540
It's a comic about a girl with a cat.

1537
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,380
I just wanted to read it.

1538
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,980
It's because, all right, that's the thing.

1539
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,820
That's what happens to all conversations.

1540
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,580
They boil down to like the most like drama-y issue

1541
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,420
about that thing.

1542
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,060
Like what do we, what do you think of when you think of like-

1543
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,700
Nobody is talking about the real issues,

1544
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,980
which is that I was sold a comic

1545
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,980
with a fucking weird bent page in it.

1546
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,020
That when I unbent it,

1547
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,700
it was like longer than the other pages.

1548
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,260
How did it even get printed that way?

1549
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,100
I don't know.

1550
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,940
It's a mystery.

1551
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,420
This is a thing that's very much on my mind these days.

1552
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,300
Like the new Ghost in the Shell movie came out recently.

1553
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,540
Like all anyone ever fucking talked about

1554
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,420
was that Scarlett Johansson was cast as Motoko Kusanagi

1555
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,700
or as the major whatever.

1556
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,780
Like that drives me up the fucking wall

1557
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:42,140
because the intellectual content of Ghost in the Shell

1558
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,300
is the most interesting thing in the world.

1559
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,260
And all anyone's fucking talking about

1560
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,100
is the race of the main character.

1561
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,220
You're missing the entire fucking point of the thing.

1562
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,940
I do think it's saying-

1563
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,540
It really fucking sucks and makes me mad

1564
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,260
that they made them all white, but whatever.

1565
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,100
That's not important.

1566
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,940
That's not important.

1567
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,380
Well, I just think it's far, far more important

1568
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,380
to talk about transhumanism.

1569
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,420
I would kind of find it hilarious.

1570
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,540
Her name's fucking Kusanagi.

1571
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,780
Why the fuck is she white?

1572
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,620
Never mind.

1573
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,900
Look, I'll tell you all about it.

1574
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,740
Shut up, I will say something.

1575
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,740
Yeah, okay.

1576
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,620
That fucking once you're training, it's paying off.

1577
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,060
Yes, yes, yes.

1578
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,300
Breathe in, son.

1579
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,660
All right, I was gonna say it was just a joke,

1580
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,980
but I was gonna say it would be legitimately hilarious

1581
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,340
and I would love it if they went too far with the thing

1582
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,340
and they made the entire Avengers,

1583
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,380
but everyone's a black guy or everyone's a black woman.

1584
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,220
And it would just be like-

1585
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,980
Dude, give Marvel the Avengers,

1586
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,980
they're working on this to comics.

1587
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,300
Yeah, they can make a Ghostbusters remake with all the women.

1588
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,940
Oh, God, that would never work.

1589
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,420
That wouldn't make any sense.

1590
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,740
It's a man's story about a man's business

1591
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,060
and a man finding a place in the world.

1592
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,020
Women have no place in the workforce.

1593
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,420
That movie would never work.

1594
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,260
Yeah, you know, really?

1595
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,460
I would just plain the legend of Zelda.

1596
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,540
You may have heard of it

1597
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,420
and when you said that, the controller dropped out of my hand.

1598
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,980
What do you think you're talking about?

1599
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,060
But games.

1600
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,500
I am the most blue-pilled.

1601
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,020
I am the most blue-pilled.

1602
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,500
Ghostbusters, the remake is my favorite movie.

1603
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,180
Coming soon, the Avengers, the Spike Lee joint.

1604
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,580
What do you think about the whole thing

1605
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,900
where if you've got a team of dudes, it is now-

1606
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's a real problematic premise

1607
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,300
for a movie.

1608
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,780
That doesn't pass the Bec Del Test,

1609
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,380
even one little bit, buddy.

1610
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,460
I didn't even mean all men, I just meant people.

1611
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,460
I just used the word dudes.

1612
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,940
Well, that's problematic too.

1613
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,940
I know that's problematic.

1614
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,540
So if you've got a bunch of people in any group or whatever,

1615
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,300
it's now expected that the ratios will be like,

1616
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,300
okay, you can have one white guy,

1617
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,980
and then you want one of each race.

1618
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,820
Yeah, tokenism.

1619
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,180
Right, tokenism, but the thing is,

1620
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,980
well, what I'm talking about, tokenism is one issue,

1621
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,620
but I'm just saying, the fact of the matter is,

1622
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:00,460
like white people are roughly 60% of America right now,

1623
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,460
so you'd expect there to be

1624
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,580
roughly 60% representation in whatever.

1625
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,620
But that doesn't seem to be acceptable anymore.

1626
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,660
You know what I'm saying?

1627
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,300
This gets to the heart of the issue of representation,

1628
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,700
which is like, I think that it would be pretty swell

1629
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,020
if everyone was more or less equally represented,

1630
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:22,860
but I also think that it sucks when people are like,

1631
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,180
let's have our cast of characters, they're all white.

1632
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,940
We gotta make some black ones.

1633
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,620
We gotta make some gay ones.

1634
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,660
We gotta do that.

1635
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,460
Like, I hate that, and it's terrible.

1636
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,300
I hate when those decisions are made for a good reason

1637
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,140
that isn't artistic.

1638
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,460
Everyone thinks that everyone, yeah.

1639
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,220
Everyone, no, no, no, wait, wait, let's talk, let's talk.

1640
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,060
Let me see, let me see.

1641
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,460
I'm just saying, I hate it that the playing field is skewed,

1642
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,020
but I think that the measures taken

1643
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,860
to deliberately unskiew it are skeevy and almost worse.

1644
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,460
It just seems like everyone thinks the way to empower

1645
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,060
one group is to disenfranchise or tear down another.

1646
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,420
Could Tom repeat a statement,

1647
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,500
because that's like my favorite thing.

1648
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,540
Can you say that again, Tom?

1649
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,380
I forgot what I said.

1650
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,220
Well, you just said like, you hate that any decision

1651
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:03,060
is made for a good reason.

1652
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,560
Oh, any decision and anything is made for any reason

1653
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,580
other than artistic reasons.

1654
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,540
And that's, you know what?

1655
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,300
It almost, it's almost like this makes me

1656
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,300
almost like approaching racists sometimes.

1657
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,060
That sounds terrible, but let me explain.

1658
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,460
When they take something, you know,

1659
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,100
like when they recast a character

1660
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,540
and make always a black guy now,

1661
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,060
or they just have like a black guy in like something

1662
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,300
or any sort of like non-white person.

1663
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,780
Now, because like social justice is everywhere

1664
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,360
and I know about and I can't get out of my head,

1665
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,140
I always have to think, was this an artistic decision

1666
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,460
or are they playing the fucking SJW card?

1667
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,900
Yeah, that sucks because sometimes.

1668
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,220
And I can't appreciate their performance anymore.

1669
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,860
I just want to appreciate art.

1670
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,940
Fuck you for making you have to even think that shit.

1671
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,780
I know you're gonna say it.

1672
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,620
I want to say it.

1673
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,460
Let me say it.

1674
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,660
I'm gonna say the exact same thing you're gonna say.

1675
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,860
Fine.

1676
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,060
Thank you.

1677
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,620
Okay, there are some times we're fucking like,

1678
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,380
oh, like, oh, I'm a corporate exec.

1679
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,540
I have money in my pockets.

1680
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,140
Let's go do it.

1681
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,740
Put the black people there.

1682
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,020
Well, most of the time I would argue

1683
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,140
is that that's what the guy, he wants it to do.

1684
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,580
Like, I like black people.

1685
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,700
I'll put a black guy here.

1686
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,500
Yeah, sometimes it's good.

1687
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,140
Sometimes it's good, but the times.

1688
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,900
Because that's what Hillary wants.

1689
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,780
Sometimes it's good, but then like,

1690
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,060
there's the other times when like,

1691
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,420
it's clearly tokenism and that makes it all bad.

1692
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,340
But Jesse, let me break up an example.

1693
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,380
Let me break up an example real quick.

1694
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,780
And it's one Jesse told me about.

1695
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,620
So in the Dark Tower movie they're making,

1696
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,260
like they're making the main character dude

1697
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,580
played by a black guy, but in the original,

1698
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,140
and so I guess they're making a change artistically.

1699
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,640
And that's not a big deal in and of itself,

1700
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,340
but like, there are issues

1701
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,540
where there is a black female character

1702
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,300
that has very specific race-based relations

1703
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,340
with the main character that are now fucked.

1704
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,380
Like what is the, the entire arc of like the third book

1705
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,260
is Dettel Walker and Odetta Holmes.

1706
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,380
She's like, she's two people.

1707
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,220
She's a split personality.

1708
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,660
But like the whole arc of her character

1709
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,460
in the third book is her, you know,

1710
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,780
kind of getting over her prejudice and racism

1711
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,660
because she grew up in fucking like segregated

1712
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,140
60s world against Roland, this old white ass

1713
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,940
Clint Eastwood looking motherfucker gunslinger.

1714
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,300
And like that's her arc.

1715
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,980
I mean, I don't even know if she's gonna be in the movie,

1716
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,820
but it's-

1717
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,700
Wait, the black person has to get over their racism

1718
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,860
towards the white person?

1719
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,700
Yeah, we can't have that.

1720
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,540
That doesn't make sense.

1721
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:20,380
That doesn't make sense.

1722
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,220
That doesn't make sense.

1723
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,580
Guys, the obvious answer is we're just gonna make

1724
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,260
the black girl a white girl

1725
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,420
and then it'll be exactly as good.

1726
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,540
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no, no.

1727
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,900
You cannot have a white woman or any white character

1728
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,660
ever upset with the race of another person.

1729
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:33,500
That's not allowed.

1730
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,340
It's not allowed.

1731
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,740
What I hate about the, like the race-baiting

1732
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,580
in like Hollywood casting,

1733
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,820
because I see it a lot and it's not just that they do it,

1734
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,220
but like the dishonesty and the like outright lies

1735
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,700
from everyone involved, like you'll have like,

1736
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,140
like when they cast Hermione as a black chick in the-

1737
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,500
I was just gonna bring that up.

1738
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,340
Yeah, like-

1739
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,180
I was just gonna bring that up.

1740
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,180
Like J.K. Rowling being like,

1741
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,020
well I never said she wasn't black.

1742
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,500
Like, yes you fucking did!

1743
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,340
You literally slid the buck.

1744
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,780
Yeah, it hurts you really?

1745
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,620
I think she tweeted.

1746
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,220
I think she tweeted like, you know,

1747
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,460
it never says she's not black.

1748
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,020
Yeah, but you know, because she's,

1749
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,860
all it says is like she's got frizzy hair.

1750
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,220
Shut up, J.K. Rowling.

1751
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,140
Like, there's other characters in the book,

1752
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,180
like Blaise Zambini and that guy who fucking,

1753
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,180
the Gryffindor who reads the fucking announcements

1754
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,300
at the Quidditch, that's explicitly called them black.

1755
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,660
If Hermione was black, you would have said black,

1756
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:26,300
because you said that about other characters.

1757
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,620
Don't fucking lie to me.

1758
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,460
Yeah, you're right.

1759
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,300
Yeah, and I kind of should be raising my thing for you.

1760
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,140
She did the same thing with Dumbledore.

1761
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,740
She did the same fucking thing with Dumbledore,

1762
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,780
pretending that he was gay all along.

1763
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,140
No, he fucking wasn't.

1764
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,940
You don't even know what being gay means, J.K. Rowling,

1765
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,420
because Dumbledore is clearly asexual,

1766
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,900
and he had a crush on a guy one time like 70 years ago,

1767
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,900
and you're like, oh yeah, he's gay.

1768
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,340
He's always been gay.

1769
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,180
J.K. Rowling, you-

1770
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,220
That's just so they can check the gay character box.

1771
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,060
That's what they want to do.

1772
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,900
Exactly, that's what they want.

1773
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,740
You fucking cuck.

1774
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,260
Don't pretend like this was your grand plan.

1775
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,900
You, ooh, I love your work, but I hate you so much.

1776
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,260
Hey, guys, I'm excited to meet you.

1777
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,580
Can I just bring up one more example?

1778
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,340
Wait, it's kind of, it's kind of gone.

1779
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,940
That kind of reminds me of a, of a, of a-

1780
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,380
Fuck, kill me.

1781
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,580
I feel so Caucasian.

1782
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,420
Shut up.

1783
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,260
I'm sorry.

1784
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,460
Homestuck's important.

1785
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,300
Homestuck, right?

1786
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,780
Like, fan art, I've seen like, like every single character

1787
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,940
in every single color.

1788
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,260
And at first I was like, ah, that's, I thought,

1789
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,300
mm, I didn't, mm, I guess that, ooh.

1790
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,620
It's like, I wasn't sure about it,

1791
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,980
and they hadn't been explicit,

1792
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,460
because like, all the characters are like,

1793
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:34,900
literally like, ff, ff, ff, ff, ff, white.

1794
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,740
Right, right.

1795
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:37,060
Because that's just the, the style of the thing.

1796
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:37,900
But then the-

1797
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,740
They're supposed to pay respects, ff, ff.

1798
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,100
But then there are the, yeah,

1799
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,700
then there are the trolls, which are like gray,

1800
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,220
so they have a skin color.

1801
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,060
Right, right.

1802
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,540
And then is, are all the other characters white?

1803
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,780
And some people say, well, it's up to interpretation.

1804
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,180
And then it's like, I guess.

1805
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,980
Hussey says like, yeah, you know,

1806
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,740
I never said they're white,

1807
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,500
like it's open to interpretation.

1808
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,500
And the response, like the shitty response to that is like,

1809
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,580
oh yeah, but they're white-coded.

1810
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,340
And then, and then that gets into like,

1811
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,740
okay, well what is white-coding?

1812
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,980
Like, what is a white person supposed to be?

1813
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:10,620
What behaviors signal a white person to you?

1814
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,460
And like-

1815
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,300
Oh, you know, I'm a superior intellect.

1816
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,140
It's just that I remember that it sort of,

1817
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,860
it sort of rubbed me, rubbed me the wrong way initially,

1818
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,100
but now I'm totally cool with it.

1819
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,900
Like, if I see like, somebody does a fan out of sands

1820
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,820
or something, and he's like, he's a human sands,

1821
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,980
and he's like, you know,

1822
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,580
he's got all these weird tumbler things.

1823
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,380
Oh, are you talking about human tail?

1824
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,540
Yes, that's a similar sort of thing,

1825
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,300
where people tumbler things,

1826
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,860
they love attributing characters for things,

1827
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,860
making them human, and then giving them a bunch of shit,

1828
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,700
and it's like-

1829
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,660
You know what fucking grinds my gears anymore?

1830
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,180
About human tail, what grinds my fucking gears

1831
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,780
is how they do this thing where they're like,

1832
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,220
assigning sexualities to each character,

1833
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,140
where like, that's not evident in their,

1834
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:50,060
like, okay, like-

1835
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,540
Well, here's the thing, here's the thing with that.

1836
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,420
Pretty clearly gay, or bi, or something.

1837
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:55,340
But like, we don't know that Frisk

1838
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,100
is a weird pansexual demi-

1839
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,940
Demi-boy.

1840
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,780
Demi-boy.

1841
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,620
That's not evident.

1842
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,460
Yeah.

1843
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,700
My point is that it used to rub me the wrong way,

1844
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,180
but I realized they're just having fun,

1845
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,140
so I don't really care.

1846
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,460
So I just let them have their fun.

1847
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,220
Yeah, I mean, to that extent, yeah.

1848
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:11,940
Real quick, I'm rereading it as we speak,

1849
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,780
and the only character so far

1850
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,100
that has been canonically white has been Bro.

1851
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:17,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1852
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:19,340
I mean, he's been stated that he's been white.

1853
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,180
Yeah.

1854
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,020
Oh, okay.

1855
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:21,860
That does happen.

1856
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,700
So, Dave-

1857
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,300
From that, we know that his genes were given to both,

1858
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,340
you know, Roxy and-

1859
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,740
Spoilers.

1860
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,580
Oh, yeah.

1861
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,100
Spoilers.

1862
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,620
Homestuck, guys.

1863
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,540
Welcome to the Homestuck PCP.

1864
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:38,540
So we know that Dave and Rose are both at least half white.

1865
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,700
This is what we know.

1866
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,460
What the fuck is homestuck?

1867
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,300
No one knows, dude.

1868
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,340
Can I just bring up-

1869
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,420
Good.

1870
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,980
Let me bring up just one more example

1871
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,860
that always bothered me, and then we can move on.

1872
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,700
And it was just in The Witcher 3,

1873
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,140
The Witcher 3, I'm a Pollock.

1874
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,980
I'm a Pollock.

1875
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,020
My people are from that land.

1876
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,820
It's a story made by Polish people about Polish lore,

1877
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,860
and there aren't, I mean, in the 16th century

1878
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,700
or whatever the fuck,

1879
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:07,260
there were not a lot of non-Polish people,

1880
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,660
non-white people,

1881
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,740
and when people see that game,

1882
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,500
so imagine you're playing this game,

1883
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,340
you play through it,

1884
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,900
and all you see are white people,

1885
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,660
and imagine getting mad that this game

1886
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,340
did not have people who don't belong here historically?

1887
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,300
This leads in directly to what I wanted to say.

1888
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,860
You know what fucking pisses me off

1889
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,060
and what I hate about people?

1890
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,780
SJW or otherwise.

1891
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:30,780
I hate, fucking hate, how for some reason,

1892
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,260
some people have to be like,

1893
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,740
I can't relate to anything unless they look like me.

1894
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1895
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,780
Yeah, I know you're 100%.

1896
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,780
Those people need to be beaten up badly.

1897
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,900
I don't know if I agree.

1898
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,340
I mean, yeah, I think you probably,

1899
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,060
I mean, I think you should be able to identify-

1900
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:49,900
Ben!

1901
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:50,740
Let me finish, let me finish.

1902
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,600
I think you should be able to identify

1903
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,900
with a protagonist of any race.

1904
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,220
But I think if you lived in a world

1905
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,060
where like all the movies you watched,

1906
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,740
like everyone was Asian and you were a white guy,

1907
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,700
like even if there were other white guys around-

1908
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,540
I watch fucking anime.

1909
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,280
I think you would feel, well, that's different.

1910
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,860
I think you would feel weird.

1911
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,820
I think it, I really think it would affect

1912
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,120
how you saw yourself.

1913
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,220
You know what, okay, here's the thing.

1914
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,180
I don't know if people might get mad at me about this.

1915
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,460
Well, it's related.

1916
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,260
It's that I think, yeah, I think you should be able

1917
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,380
to relate to a protagonist of any race in theory,

1918
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,820
but it's like when it's systemic

1919
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,660
and when it's like, when there's broad trends,

1920
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:30,780
like broad trends affect in this sort of thing,

1921
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,900
affect how people feel and think.

1922
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,740
Okay, well-

1923
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,380
So you're saying it's okay for them to get mad

1924
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,420
at something that's historically accurate?

1925
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,580
What?

1926
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,420
No.

1927
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,140
I'm talking like the Witcher 3, like the Witchers, yeah.

1928
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,500
Cause it's like the Bechdel test, right?

1929
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,740
Like the fact that a movie does not pass the Bechdel test,

1930
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,020
does not in and of itself make it a bad movie,

1931
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,700
it's the fact that like so few movies

1932
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,740
pass the Bechdel test.

1933
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,460
That means that none of these individual movies

1934
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,580
are necessarily damned and like a bad movie

1935
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,740
because they don't pass it,

1936
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,180
but it's the fact that this widespread trend

1937
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,820
is like speaks to like a systemic problem.

1938
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,900
Well, all right.

1939
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,860
Same with like, and same with the overwhelming whiteness

1940
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,300
of like protagonists in movies, that's what I'm saying.

1941
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,460
Okay, but like, all right, with Witcher 3 specifically,

1942
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,180
would you say that the solution to that anger

1943
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,420
is to let them be angry and not change it

1944
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,900
or to change the game and add different races in

1945
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,420
even though they wouldn't make sense?

1946
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,620
No, you should let them be angry

1947
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,980
because in that case it makes sense

1948
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,620
that everyone would be white.

1949
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:28,900
Yeah, okay.

1950
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,740
Right, right.

1951
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,100
Well, here's the thing.

1952
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,300
I don't know if I'm gonna get in trouble with saying this,

1953
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:38,300
but like I sort of agree with Ben in at least a sense

1954
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,140
because I mean, just one way I think about this

1955
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,460
is I watch movies about, you know,

1956
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,460
people who are from different cultures than me

1957
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,900
and like I definitely can relate to it less

1958
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,660
than I do to like a middle American, you know, story

1959
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,420
or whatever, and as well as like,

1960
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:57,220
I've moved to a mostly black neighborhood now

1961
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,940
and like it's just like a sort of a different culture

1962
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:03,100
around like, I grew up around like 99% white people.

1963
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,100
Yeah, I'm a little white boy.

1964
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,100
And like the neighborhood I live in now is just different

1965
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,620
and it's not that the people are necessarily different,

1966
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:12,860
it's just like when I'm in this neighborhood now

1967
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,580
and if I see a black person, I just,

1968
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,060
I know that they're like, or I don't know,

1969
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,180
but like it's an indicator

1970
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,060
because I'm a visual oriented creature as a human being,

1971
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,060
it makes me think like, okay,

1972
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,580
this person is from like a different culture than me

1973
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,660
because this place I live now is different.

1974
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,240
They're not the same sort of thing

1975
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,580
that I've known my whole life.

1976
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:32,700
So like there, and I'm, yeah, like I'm assuming

1977
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,260
because I don't actually know this person,

1978
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,420
but it's just sort of a hint

1979
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,620
that there's a difference here.

1980
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,820
And yeah, that's probably not, you know,

1981
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,580
I hope I don't sound horrible here, but it's just a fact.

1982
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:42,820
Like, you know, I agree.

1983
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:45,460
Like, like, I'm like, I don't really feel,

1984
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,420
I don't really feel like I'm racist at all,

1985
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,100
but like, with it, when I feel a cultural,

1986
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,660
well, like it's not about how people look,

1987
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,740
it's about when I feel a cultural difference.

1988
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,020
Like if they're speaking in a way

1989
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,540
that is like not how I'm used to speaking,

1990
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,140
then I'm like, well, that's different.

1991
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,620
I don't know how to relate to that as well, you know?

1992
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,460
I don't think there's anything,

1993
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,100
is there anything wrong with that though?

1994
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,380
I don't, there really is, I don't think so.

1995
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:08,060
Like, I know it's probably, I think it's good,

1996
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,860
it's good to be multicultural.

1997
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,060
It's good to be multicultural, but like if you're not,

1998
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,740
like, I don't think you're a bad person.

1999
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,860
Yeah, Ben, what's the point you're trying to make?

2000
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:19,700
Are you saying we, like, I agree with Tom.

2001
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,860
I was just agreeing with Nate

2002
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,340
that I feel that same way about cultures.

2003
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:25,620
If I agree with Tom and that the artist is always the one

2004
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,700
who should decide what the races are, we shouldn't,

2005
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,300
like, do you want us to force more races?

2006
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,740
He already said no, he already said no.

2007
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,580
I said no to that.

2008
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,020
Well, then what's the point?

2009
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,660
I feel like, what are we even talking about?

2010
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,100
Wait a minute, so we're talking about

2011
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,060
having more representation in media,

2012
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,100
and I think the point right now is that if there's,

2013
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:49,620
but like, my point is that I think that no change

2014
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,140
to be made that isn't done for artistic purpose.

2015
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,900
And if for whatever reason, all these creators are just like,

2016
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,060
this is how we think about it.

2017
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,860
I don't think it should be arbitrarily changed

2018
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,020
because, well, we need more black people.

2019
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,780
I would, I don't, I'm not disagreeing with you

2020
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,460
saying that like more, like, diverse cast

2021
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,060
would necessarily be a bad thing.

2022
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,500
All I'm saying is I want to be done

2023
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,780
for natural organic reasons and not to check boxes off.

2024
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,020
Here's what I think, I, this is, this is,

2025
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,300
this is my opinion on this issue,

2026
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,140
and this applies, this applies.

2027
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,700
Hippo's been trying to say something, Ben.

2028
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,540
What?

2029
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:20,620
Let him say, let Hippo say something,

2030
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,140
he's been trying to again.

2031
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,980
I mean, it's like too late now, almost,

2032
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,100
but I wanted to bring up the fact again,

2033
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,260
like you said at the beginning,

2034
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,940
I'm the only English guy in this American-centric podcast,

2035
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:35,420
and that the whole thing of like things being unrelatable,

2036
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,860
the vast majority of media that I've ever consumed

2037
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,260
has been from America and with American things

2038
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,780
like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,

2039
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,500
like that, I don't know what the fuck that is.

2040
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
Taco Bell, we don't have that.

2041
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,340
You don't have Taco Bell?

2042
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,180
Oh, God.

2043
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,020
You poor bastard.

2044
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,860
I'm never moving there.

2045
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,700
You know, that's Munchie's dad.

2046
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,020
Munchie's dad is Taco Bell.

2047
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,180
It's like all these American things that have been in like,

2048
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,620
you know, every cartoon I've ever watched,

2049
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,340
like Rugrats, I don't understand most of the things in that.

2050
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,620
I mean, they're babies and they're weird,

2051
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,500
but like there's, there's American things in there.

2052
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,500
There's American references in all things that I've seen

2053
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,140
to the point where I don't find it like,

2054
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,980
I don't find it that I can't relate so much

2055
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,460
if something is a different culture

2056
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,580
because it's just, it's just one of many cultures

2057
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,060
that I can relate to in, in that I know that they're different.

2058
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,900
I don't really know what like not being,

2059
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,780
it not relating to me.

2060
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,660
I don't know what that does.

2061
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,260
I don't know whether, like if I watch an anime

2062
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,140
and it's got Japanese buildings and stuff,

2063
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,540
like what does that mean if I can't relate to that thing?

2064
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,260
I know, if I see enough anime,

2065
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,700
I will be able to relate to it.

2066
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,300
If I see enough American things,

2067
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,020
I will be able to relate to it, you know, through that.

2068
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,660
And then I don't even know what it means

2069
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,660
to not relate to something.

2070
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,740
What does it even do?

2071
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:41,580
Yeah, Ben, could you,

2072
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,140
could you maybe speak to like the damage you see being done

2073
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,340
by there being a lack of representation?

2074
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,260
Like is it just the level of comfort or something?

2075
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,380
No, it's not the, it's not the level of comfort.

2076
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:54,580
I think, I think that if when there's not enough,

2077
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,700
when there's not diverse representation,

2078
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:00,580
then it just contributes to an othering effect wherein,

2079
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,980
wherein the inside group and the outside group

2080
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:06,820
see themselves as distinct and opposed to one another.

2081
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:07,660
So, okay.

2082
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,140
I think that more, I think that,

2083
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:12,500
I think that when media, if media was more inclusive,

2084
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,220
then it would mean, it would, it would lessen,

2085
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:18,900
it would lessen that like in and out group psychology.

2086
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,260
So how do we do this, Ben?

2087
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,340
Do you want, do you want like a government forced diversity

2088
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,700
in your TV show or what?

2089
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,380
No, here's, here's the best thing.

2090
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,540
Here's the best solution I come up with.

2091
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,580
No, I wouldn't, I don't think anyone should be,

2092
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,460
compelled to do anything or make art any way

2093
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:36,500
that they don't want to.

2094
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,740
I think that the only viable solution to this at all,

2095
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,900
and it's not great, but it's the best I can come up with is,

2096
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,140
I just think that people should try to have,

2097
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:48,820
should try to view novelty like positively

2098
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:52,100
in a way that like, you know, like if you've got two,

2099
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,820
I don't know, movies you wanna watch,

2100
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,620
and one is like an American film,

2101
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,780
and one is like a Pakistani film,

2102
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,820
and you've never seen a Pakistani film before

2103
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,260
or a film with like, with like a Pakistani director.

2104
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:04,740
Maybe you could be like, oh, well that's neat.

2105
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,340
You know, I just think, I think we should look,

2106
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:08,740
I just think, I wish we just looked positively on that,

2107
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,380
and I think if societally, we looked positively

2108
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,900
on things that come from like diverse cultures,

2109
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,980
and a novelty, and a novelty in that way, then I-

2110
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,460
Only white movies win Oscars, like Moonlight,

2111
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,140
that was an all white movie, just won the best picture.

2112
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,020
Well that was like, it's like one dude, it's like one.

2113
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,300
Are you fucking kidding me?

2114
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,900
Look through the Oscar list of the last 50 fucking years, dude.

2115
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:30,100
I think that should mostly be due to the fact

2116
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,180
that the Oscars are bullshit,

2117
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,020
and nobody should care about it.

2118
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,260
Are you making an argument that they're just,

2119
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,060
I'm just wondering, that there is

2120
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:37,060
proportional representation in the Oscars for-

2121
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,060
I'm not saying, I'm not saying-

2122
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,060
Not you, I'm asking monkey.

2123
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:44,180
Okay, are you saying that society on a whole

2124
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,900
doesn't like things that are different,

2125
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,540
and I just proved them wrong with the Oscars, I guess.

2126
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:50,380
Well, you didn't actually present anything to say that.

2127
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:51,220
What do you mean, what do you mean,

2128
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,940
what is the trend in the Oscars that you're talking about?

2129
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:55,700
I mean, the idea is that if society

2130
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,100
doesn't like things that are different,

2131
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,580
then the very white Oscar voting people

2132
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,100
would only vote for the white movies,

2133
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,940
so clearly they do have some-

2134
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,660
So, hang on, are you saying that because Moonlight won,

2135
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,820
that alone proves that there is no problem?

2136
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,020
No, it's an example that shows that Ben

2137
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,980
isn't entirely right in what he said.

2138
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,820
I think-

2139
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,660
I don't think that's true,

2140
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,180
because a very small number of people actually decide

2141
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,820
who win, and those are big lip cucks,

2142
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,100
so first of all, they don't represent America in general,

2143
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,940
and that doesn't solve any kind of problems.

2144
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:22,540
It's not just about whiteness,

2145
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,500
it's not just about blackness.

2146
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,500
I don't know what movies won the Oscars

2147
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,820
for the last 50 years,

2148
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:31,260
but I'm betting that there's some noticeable trends

2149
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,740
in what kinds of movies win Oscars.

2150
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,580
I think-

2151
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,780
For instance, they're all self-important and awful.

2152
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:40,340
People like things that are familiar,

2153
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,180
like in general, like on a human level,

2154
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,940
I don't think you can ever change the entire universe.

2155
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,020
And that's not a crime.

2156
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:45,860
Yeah.

2157
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,700
Well, I think it should be.

2158
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,220
They're gonna like, I mean, yeah,

2159
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:51,700
you can have ideals that we should all be introduced,

2160
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,620
mixing and trying out new things,

2161
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,140
but the fact of the matter is,

2162
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,340
people generally don't care to do that,

2163
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,340
and it's hard to try and convince them,

2164
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,900
and I don't even know what the problem is anymore.

2165
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,340
Okay, Beth, I have a question for you,

2166
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,180
since you're kind of a social justice guy,

2167
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:09,260
I wanna kind of satisfy you, okay?

2168
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,620
Cause, no, because maybe you'll be on board with me on this

2169
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,060
and thinking this is stupid,

2170
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,420
because you're saying right now,

2171
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,540
people should definitely try and experience more culture,

2172
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:20,940
and go look at other stuff outside of their sphere

2173
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,940
and bubble that they're familiar with.

2174
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,580
Yeah, it would be nice.

2175
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,140
Why is it that the same people who talk about that

2176
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,740
also say that cultural appropriation

2177
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:29,620
is the worst thing ever,

2178
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,020
and you should stay inside your bubble

2179
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,860
and never touch anything?

2180
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,740
Cultural appropriation is the best thing ever.

2181
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:35,500
Yeah.

2182
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,420
Because it doesn't make any sense

2183
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:41,460
that to get back to social justice worries in general,

2184
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,500
I guess, is that, again,

2185
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,100
they want all this more representation

2186
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,460
of people to understand things outside their culture,

2187
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,340
but then as soon as you touch anything else,

2188
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:50,340
they're just like, that's mine, you can't have it.

2189
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,580
They're just like, well, you're just raising the barriers

2190
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,860
and bitching that there are barriers.

2191
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:54,860
So what the fuck?

2192
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,300
Yeah, I hate that.

2193
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,780
I think we should all culturally appropriate all the time.

2194
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,460
It would be, I wish I culturally appropriated more.

2195
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,820
Sometimes I feel bad.

2196
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,620
Sometimes I feel bad, like just how fucking white

2197
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,940
me and my upbringing and my culture is.

2198
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,380
But then I think about branching out,

2199
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,340
and I'm like, that sounds hard,

2200
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,860
and not doing that is easy.

2201
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,020
I would really like more toast in my movies.

2202
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,980
You want the government to force people to eat toast?

2203
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:25,220
No, I just think that societally,

2204
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,460
we should agree to give toast more money in the box office.

2205
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,740
Hey, you know, I had an uncle Phil, right?

2206
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,660
And he was white, because, you know,

2207
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,860
my family's white, I'm a white boy.

2208
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,860
Unfortunately.

2209
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,940
Yeah, but I had an uncle Phil,

2210
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:45,780
and that means that I could technically be

2211
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,900
a white Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of White Bel Air.

2212
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,420
Could I, would it be cool?

2213
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,020
Imagine a reboot of Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

2214
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,180
Yeah, would it be like cool?

2215
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,420
Well, it would not be allowed.

2216
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:01,780
What do you mean it wouldn't be allowed?

2217
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,060
My whole thing is like, I don't think that's cool or uncool.

2218
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:05,340
It should just be a thing that happens.

2219
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,420
It should be completely neutral.

2220
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:08,420
There should be no, it's just like, whatever.

2221
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,380
The thing about that is that the point of Fresh Prince of Bel Air

2222
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:14,780
is that they're an upscale black family

2223
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,340
living in a white neighborhood.

2224
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,700
Okay, well, for the audience,

2225
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,260
but if you switched it,

2226
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,860
then it's like a poor white family

2227
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,380
moves to a rich black neighborhood.

2228
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,540
Is that, that's not a thing.

2229
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,380
Well, I don't know.

2230
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,980
Maybe nowadays it's a little different,

2231
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:31,820
and maybe it could happen.

2232
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,180
That was just being a stupid joke, sir.

2233
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,460
Well, I'm fucking, well, I'm taking it way too seriously.

2234
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,300
You're welcome.

2235
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,580
I do find Carlton a fascinating character though,

2236
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,220
because God, one of the best scenes

2237
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,220
is when him and Will got pulled over one day

2238
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,660
when they were just driving down the road.

2239
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:49,380
And you know, Carlton's been sheltered his whole life,

2240
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,340
so he doesn't know about the shit.

2241
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,980
And like they were pulled over for driving like too slow

2242
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,740
on the side of the highway and like got arrested

2243
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:55,900
and some real shit went down.

2244
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,420
And then afterward, like Carlton's just like, Will,

2245
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,620
like we were, like, of course the police pulled us over.

2246
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,780
Like we were acting suspicious.

2247
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,420
And Will's like, dude, if we were white,

2248
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,700
never would have fucking happened.

2249
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,460
And Carlton, Carlton just does not understand.

2250
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,140
Like it's not in his worldview

2251
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,140
that the police are discriminating against

2252
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,060
in a particular race.

2253
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,140
And that is a very interesting phenomenon.

2254
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:15,900
Cause to Will, this is just life.

2255
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,380
This is every single day, you know,

2256
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,260
he just thinks that that's just how he thinks about shit.

2257
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,140
Cops are out to get him.

2258
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,660
And Carlton does not process, like his dad's a judge.

2259
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,220
So, you know, probably has a more favorable view

2260
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:25,060
of the law system in general.

2261
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,460
Cause he, cause Carlton's,

2262
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,420
Carlton's got fucking privilege, man.

2263
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,980
He's got privilege and he's been sheltered.

2264
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,500
And his privilege allows him to,

2265
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,580
his privilege allows him to ignore and deny

2266
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,940
that privilege exists.

2267
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,540
I'm just saying, I would sure like it

2268
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,340
if everyone could was in a position with Carlton,

2269
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,740
with like, yeah, this doesn't happen.

2270
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,380
It would be great if we all could ignore

2271
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,380
fucking societal bullshit.

2272
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,460
I wish we were all like Carlton.

2273
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,980
I wanna, everyone in the world should be like Carlton.

2274
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:49,860
We'd have the best dance moves.

2275
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,700
You're that big of a Michael Jackson.

2276
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,540
That's true.

2277
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:53,860
That one commercial.

2278
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:58,100
Did Michael Jackson get more privilege

2279
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,020
when he turned white?

2280
01:19:59,020 --> 01:19:59,980
Did that happen?

2281
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:03,100
No, he actually got more privilege when he turned rich.

2282
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,620
Got way less.

2283
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,420
I mean, hey, that's how it happens.

2284
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,580
Where were you when Michael Jackson died?

2285
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,780
I was doing 9-11.

2286
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,620
I was doing 9-11.

2287
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,460
That's a good one.

2288
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,300
Uh-huh.

2289
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,660
I actually do remember where I was,

2290
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:22,900
but I don't remember when I was.

2291
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:26,260
If anything disproves the concept of white privilege,

2292
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,980
it's that, I mean, Michael Jackson,

2293
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:29,540
he was black and he was successful.

2294
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:30,380
He turns white.

2295
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,940
Next thing you know, he's fraying for pedophilia.

2296
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,660
He's being assassinated by Sony.

2297
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,860
You know, all this horrible stuff is happening.

2298
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,740
His legacy is tarnished forever.

2299
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,940
Oh, because he was white.

2300
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,700
Michael Jackson, yeah.

2301
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,580
He had the audacity to turn white.

2302
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,260
You know what the real problem with that guy was?

2303
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:46,780
He fucked with Paul McCartney.

2304
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,700
He bought a lot of the Beatles music

2305
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,580
that Paul wanted.

2306
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,420
He was not still alive.

2307
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,260
He said he was the Beatles hit squad.

2308
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,220
Wait, he bought the Beatles music?

2309
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,860
Like he just purchased the albums?

2310
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:00,060
He bought the rights to a lot of the album records music.

2311
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,420
And he was like, I don't know,

2312
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,620
but I read about it the other day.

2313
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,220
And I know that him and Paul McCartney

2314
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,100
were not such good friends after that.

2315
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,220
But they made a song together.

2316
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:09,060
That was beforehand.

2317
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,020
That was beforehand.

2318
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,260
Say, say, say, what the fuck?

2319
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:17,260
Do, do, do, oh, yeah, you're a black man.

2320
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,660
I'm black.

2321
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:21,780
Da-boo-dee, da-boo-dah.

2322
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,100
I'm black if I was white.

2323
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,940
I'd have privilege if I was white.

2324
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,580
We should make a remix.

2325
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,860
So listen up.

2326
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:33,860
Here's a story about a little bitch who fucks with a bitch.

2327
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,540
Hey, Nate, do we have any Twitter questions this week?

2328
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:37,380
No, no, no, no, I know.

2329
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,460
I have a closing statement.

2330
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,140
I want to, I want to, I have a closing statement.

2331
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:44,180
The closing statement of this is,

2332
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:47,060
just know that whatever side you fall on,

2333
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,420
there is no, in the words of my personal savior,

2334
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,140
Jan Rynkowski, a.k.a. actor of Parkour, dude 91,

2335
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,980
there are no anime villains controlling everything.

2336
01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:00,340
And everything is, every movement is not a result

2337
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:03,500
of one person maniacally cackling.

2338
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,420
They, there's just people reacting

2339
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,380
to what they see in the world,

2340
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,740
maybe immaturally or maybe materially.

2341
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,980
But it is all, it is all people just like you

2342
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:15,620
making decisions to act the way they do.

2343
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,420
I just want to say, as a final statement

2344
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:23,420
on the matter of SJWs, that I agree with everyone

2345
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,100
and everyone is bad also.

2346
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,780
Those are two things, not necessarily conflicting.

2347
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,380
And I think in general, people should take themselves

2348
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,820
out of it and not give a shit.

2349
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,260
But I also think that maybe, and this is something

2350
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,660
that I almost wish that I was more capable of doing,

2351
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:41,140
is just go with it, man.

2352
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,420
If all your friends are libtard cucks, be a libtard cock.

2353
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,660
If all your friends are fucking alt-right,

2354
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,180
be an alt-right, doesn't matter.

2355
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,100
None of this really truly matters.

2356
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,980
Just be what your friends are.

2357
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,980
That's all that matters.

2358
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,820
And if I could get a baby, fine.

2359
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,060
But that's what got us all into this situation

2360
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,900
to begin with.

2361
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,580
If I could give a final, final statement.

2362
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,820
Tonight, we talked a lot about why we shouldn't talk

2363
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,300
about SJWs, we had a lot of derailing.

2364
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,540
So look forward tomorrow to me and Tom

2365
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,780
having a real podcast about SJWs.

2366
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,660
What name is it for, Jack?

2367
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,340
I want to say, as a final name, this coffin here.

2368
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:21,340
Oh my, I'm with the king day.

2369
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,660
Wait a minute, what made this not necessarily

2370
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,660
a real conversation on the topic of SJWs?

2371
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,980
I think we covered a lot of ground.

2372
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,820
I did my level best, Mumki.

2373
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:32,460
I did the best that I could with what I had at the time.

2374
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,340
I think it was very early derailed into why

2375
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,540
we shouldn't talk about SJWs and how now suddenly everybody

2376
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,220
uses the SJW.

2377
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:42,660
I was hoping to get a little bit of nitpicking

2378
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,500
into what it actually is, but me and Tom can do it later.

2379
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,660
It's been the whole time talking about what it is.

2380
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,860
An SJW is like a work of pornography.

2381
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,860
You can't define it, but you know it when you see it.

2382
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:55,140
I agree, I agree.

2383
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,020
Okay, let's go to the questions.

2384
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,380
Okay, what do we got here?

2385
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,940
Okay, here's one, just a fast-filler

2386
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,780
until I find a good one.

2387
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,780
I think Mumki's a little sad that this didn't turn out

2388
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,140
to be the echo chamber he particularly wanted.

2389
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,780
I just thought we'd have multiple perspectives

2390
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,180
represented in, you know.

2391
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,700
I think we certainly have multiple perspectives.

2392
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,220
We're too intellectually honest,

2393
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,060
and we understand each other too well

2394
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,860
that we don't devolve into a bunch of shouting and bullshit.

2395
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:25,100
Like, what would you, what would you want to talk about?

2396
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,940
This podcast has already been derailed.

2397
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,660
We'll do it another time.

2398
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,900
The rage, the quietly simmering rage of Mumki.

2399
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,180
I don't have time for a three-hour podcast.

2400
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,740
I have a date tonight.

2401
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,540
Well, congratulations, Destin.

2402
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,140
Do you have a time for a two-hour podcast?

2403
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,500
It's only been going for like an hour and a half.

2404
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,820
Yeah, I'll save it for later, it's fine.

2405
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,540
All right, there we go.

2406
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,020
Let's go to the fucking questions.

2407
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,700
All right, Jesus Christ.

2408
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:51,700
Okay, here's one.

2409
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,620
Edwin at Edwin Jart asks,

2410
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:58,900
hey, TB Crasnayers, you become God for exactly 45 seconds.

2411
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,220
What do you do?

2412
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,460
Make racism legal.

2413
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:11,100
Who else has a good idea? Come on.

2414
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:15,060
Sex isn't legal.

2415
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,060
Makes sense.

2416
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:20,540
I remake Evan Almighty and make it good this time.

2417
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:21,540
That's, yeah.

2418
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,860
Why are you guys fucking around with laws?

2419
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,980
You became God, not like the president.

2420
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:26,980
That's not a law.

2421
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:27,980
Black political.

2422
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:28,980
Black political.

2423
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:36,460
I would buy up all the land in Missouri and then nuke it.

2424
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,460
Oh, you know what I do?

2425
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:38,460
Oh, that's a good idea.

2426
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,460
Why in Missouri?

2427
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:40,460
What did they do?

2428
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,460
I don't know.

2429
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,460
I was just thinking of a state.

2430
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,460
I don't know what states are.

2431
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,460
I'd go for Rhode Island.

2432
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
Liquid?

2433
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,460
I would probably like share.

2434
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:51,780
I would probably like fucking share the secrets of like faster than light travel with humanity

2435
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:52,780
or something.

2436
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,660
I was just going to say, what I would do is I would have an alien race like the Vulcans.

2437
01:25:56,660 --> 01:26:01,260
I would instruct them to visit Earth because that's what started Starfleet in like the

2438
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:02,260
original.

2439
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,700
Right as humans did their first warp drive test.

2440
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,580
The Vulcans happened to see them and then they became best friends and everything started

2441
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,580
from there.

2442
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,940
I think I'd give myself abs.

2443
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:15,460
What hippo were you saying?

2444
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:21,860
I was going to say, if you ask God, your plan was to tell people about the light speed travel.

2445
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:25,340
What if, as God, you realize that it's completely impossible?

2446
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,820
Do you tell them?

2447
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:27,820
Yeah.

2448
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:28,820
Oh, absolutely.

2449
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,820
Yeah.

2450
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,820
Tell them that their dreams are crushed.

2451
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:31,820
Yeah.

2452
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,580
I would prove it to them that it's impossible so that they would stop working on it.

2453
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:36,580
Yeah.

2454
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,580
Yeah.

2455
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,580
I would do that.

2456
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,580
It would be great.

2457
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,580
Some include things like wormholes though because wormholes aren't really travel.

2458
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:41,580
They're just kind of jumps between pockets.

2459
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:46,140
Whatever steps were necessary to make it happen, I would share them if there were some and

2460
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:48,340
if there weren't, I would let them all know.

2461
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:49,340
Excellent.

2462
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:50,340
Good.

2463
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,900
You know, actually I retract all my statements.

2464
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:56,420
I would ask God, I would go around the world and make geography, I would get rid of all

2465
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:01,460
the weird geography related things like Portugal, that should be all Spain, it would look better

2466
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:07,100
on a map, basically, I would get rid of all the small countries because they look bad

2467
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,100
on maps.

2468
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,100
That's true.

2469
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,100
And we'd just simulate them in the bigger countries.

2470
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,100
Fuck Luxembourg.

2471
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,100
Yeah, exactly.

2472
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,100
Like what the fuck?

2473
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,900
Luxembourg sounds like some fucking, like a Power Rangers knockoff.

2474
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:18,900
Like the Beetleborgs.

2475
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,900
The big bad Luxembourg.

2476
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:20,900
The bad Luxembourg.

2477
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:21,900
The bad Luxembourg.

2478
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:22,900
The bad Luxembourg.

2479
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:23,900
To make racism real.

2480
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,900
I thought it was pronounced Luxembourg.

2481
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,900
It's fucking Luxembourg.

2482
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,900
Get out of here.

2483
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:27,900
The original character Luxembourg.

2484
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:28,900
The cool new character Luxembourg.

2485
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,900
Here he comes.

2486
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,900
Yeah, fuck yeah.

2487
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,900
I thought it was pronounced Luxembourg.

2488
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:32,900
Yeah, but I think Luxembourg.

2489
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:33,900
Lord, naked, you hit me with another.

2490
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:34,900
Yes, okay, here you go.

2491
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:35,900
Let me slang this one for you.

2492
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:47,900
Fuck where'd it go?

2493
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,900
Oh, here it is.

2494
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
At Swagdude.

2495
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900
Yeah, at Swagdude.

2496
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,900
Oh, it's Swagdude.

2497
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,900
Yeah, I know him.

2498
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,900
What's your favorite soda?

2499
01:27:53,900 --> 01:28:01,900
And I just want to quote Anthony Fantano and say, soda's piss water is bliss.

2500
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,900
Don't drink it.

2501
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,900
It's garbage.

2502
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,900
Poisons your body.

2503
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,900
I hate soda.

2504
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,100
True that poisons your body, but it tastes very good sometimes.

2505
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,340
If monster counts as soda, then monster.

2506
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,500
But only the zero calorie.

2507
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,500
It doesn't.

2508
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,500
It's an energy.

2509
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Okay, then Coke zero.

2510
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,500
It's clearly lead.

2511
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:21,300
Hey, that's a great, you know, topic for this podcast because we were talking about SJ

2512
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,300
Doubles at CWs.

2513
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:27,300
You know, it would solve all the social ills of the world right now is a nice cool bottle

2514
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,300
of Pepsi, you know.

2515
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:30,300
Topical.

2516
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,300
Topical.

2517
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,300
Give me that Pepsi.

2518
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,300
I'm CEO of Pepsi.

2519
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,300
I'm a baby.

2520
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:35,300
I have millions of dollars.

2521
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,300
I'm your Pepsi.

2522
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Yeah.

2523
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:46,300
That's what the riot control police say when you bring them a Pepsi and, you know, they're

2524
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:49,300
beating on the blacks and they're beating on the everyone.

2525
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,300
I hate blacks.

2526
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,700
But I kill people until I get my Pepsi.

2527
01:28:54,700 --> 01:29:04,300
Someone give me a Pepsi and cut this hatred out of me and wash my hatred away in an ocean

2528
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,300
of Pepsi inside my body.

2529
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,700
We made a terrible mistake.

2530
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:13,940
What we should have done at the beginning of this podcast was so that we know how important

2531
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:17,340
everyone's points are, is compare ourselves on the, what is it, the progressive stack?

2532
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,340
On the Pepsi scale, which we are.

2533
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,940
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

2534
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,940
I wanted us to be ranked, but it'll never fucking happen.

2535
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,940
That's a number bonus episode.

2536
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,940
Yeah.

2537
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,440
Five dollars, motherfuckers.

2538
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,100
I'm going to say that I think the number one would have to go to Munchy because he's

2539
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,620
the most non-white.

2540
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,140
So that puts it up pretty high.

2541
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,740
But he's also the least gay.

2542
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,540
So that's pretty, that's pretty serious.

2543
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:46,540
You know, Ben, I think I might be the least autistic.

2544
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,540
Yeah, well, somebody's got to.

2545
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,540
Just maybe, just maybe.

2546
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,540
Okay, what do we got here?

2547
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,540
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

2548
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:55,540
I have to say my favorite sodas because I'm a soda enthusiast.

2549
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,540
I like to try, I'm very cultured.

2550
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,540
I like to try a bunch of different sodas.

2551
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,540
I always compare tastes.

2552
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,540
I'm very into suicides.

2553
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:07,540
Like as in like mixing drinks, not as in killing yourself, which I am staunchly against.

2554
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:08,540
What the fuck is this?

2555
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:09,540
I don't know.

2556
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,540
What?

2557
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,540
The sodas?

2558
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,540
Yeah.

2559
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,540
Oh, I'm way into that.

2560
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,540
That sounds cool.

2561
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,540
That's when you mix all of them like at McDonald's.

2562
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,540
Yeah.

2563
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,540
Oh, all right.

2564
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:26,540
And I say, I say that the best, the best soda in the world is as follows.

2565
01:30:26,540 --> 01:30:34,540
All right, 60% Dr. Pepper, 30% fucking root beer, and the rest Sprite.

2566
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:35,540
Hmm.

2567
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,540
It's pretty good.

2568
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:40,540
Did you know that if you mix Coke and Sprite, you get ginger ale?

2569
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:44,540
How would I have any way to test that, Jerry?

2570
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,540
I'm fucking gay.

2571
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:48,540
Kill me.

2572
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,540
I'm gay.

2573
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,540
I want to die.

2574
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:51,540
Oh my god.

2575
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,540
I know they said it on Seinfeld.

2576
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,540
That's why I know it.

2577
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,540
What of it?

2578
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:55,540
What of it?

2579
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:56,540
Yeah.

2580
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,540
I'm Seinfeld.

2581
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,540
And there's George, too.

2582
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,540
I'm Seinfeld.

2583
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,540
I lie, I'm a Jew.

2584
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,540
And there's George.

2585
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,540
Okay.

2586
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,540
Wow.

2587
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:07,540
He's not a Cuban, Homer Simpson, just Undertale.

2588
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,540
Nice.

2589
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:13,540
Did you guys, did you guys, wait, are you guys talking about Simpsons Meet Undertale?

2590
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,540
Yep, I am.

2591
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:15,540
Yep, yep.

2592
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,540
Is that a real thing?

2593
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,540
Is that real?

2594
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,540
It's the worst.

2595
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,540
It's the worst.

2596
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,540
Oh my god.

2597
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,540
It's so bad.

2598
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,540
It's fucking dumb.

2599
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,540
I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed that we've mentioned it on the hallowed halls of the PCP.

2600
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:26,540
It's wrong.

2601
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,540
Just tell me what meat, is it a video?

2602
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,540
Is that what it is?

2603
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:30,540
It's just like a little like one minute shitty animation.

2604
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,540
Okay.

2605
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:32,540
Okay.

2606
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:33,540
It's fucking amazing.

2607
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,540
Oh shit.

2608
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,540
I'm subscribing.

2609
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:36,540
I'm subscribing.

2610
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:42,540
So Monkey Away at Monkey Away asks, is watching shit in a theater ever worth it?

2611
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:44,540
That's an interesting question.

2612
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,540
I would have to say yes.

2613
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:46,540
Totally.

2614
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,540
Because I enjoyed my time in a theater just the other day.

2615
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,540
Yeah.

2616
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,540
If you're with friends.

2617
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,540
I was alone.

2618
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:52,540
I'm always alone.

2619
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,540
I guess it could be.

2620
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,540
It's not a joke.

2621
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,540
I wouldn't do it alone, but I guess it could be fun.

2622
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:00,540
I mean, you should definitely go at least once to get the experience of a huge screen

2623
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,540
with a loud speaker in a big old dark room.

2624
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:06,900
Dude, if you wait a couple of weeks, so there's no one else in the theater, it's the best

2625
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:08,540
possible way to watch a movie.

2626
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,540
That is totally true.

2627
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:10,540
I agree.

2628
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:17,260
I think the percentage of worth it your theater experiences is directly proportional to how

2629
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:20,540
good or shitty your TV setup at home is.

2630
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:21,540
I agree.

2631
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,540
I like the emcee of the theater.

2632
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:24,540
I like movie dogs.

2633
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,540
I like watching people, like with people around.

2634
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:29,540
I like watching, you know, I like having, it's a full ritual.

2635
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:33,540
They've ruined, like, 80% of the movies.

2636
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,540
Here's what I would say.

2637
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,540
Yeah, I'm kind of a solitary watcher myself.

2638
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,540
The optimal, like, movie going experience.

2639
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,540
Like, unless it's like something that you want to page engine to and like analyze and

2640
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,540
it's like, oh, it's a really heady fucking, like Scooby-Doo or something.

2641
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,540
Like, you want to watch that alone and get the bullshit.

2642
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:53,540
But if it's just some bullshit like Ghost in the Shell, you can go with your friends.

2643
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:59,540
And if we live in a perfect world, then I think the perfect place would be like a movie theater,

2644
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,540
but only you and your friends are allowed.

2645
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:04,540
So you can like scream and like make fun of the movie for bullshit.

2646
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:07,540
But you still get all the comfort and like the movie dogs and like the blackness.

2647
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,540
I see what you're saying.

2648
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,540
Yeah, I don't ever do anything with my friends.

2649
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:14,540
The theater experience can also sort of revitalize an old favorite.

2650
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:19,540
You know, if you have one of those movie theaters that play old movies in your town, you know,

2651
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:22,540
like you can go in there, you can watch like The Room, or you can watch like The Pals.

2652
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,540
Yeah, that's the one.

2653
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:27,540
Me and Nate went with some people to a screening of The Room one time.

2654
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:29,540
And it was fucking great.

2655
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:31,540
That was fucking downtown Boston.

2656
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:32,540
It was the best atmosphere.

2657
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,540
At the Coolidge.

2658
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,540
I had the most fun.

2659
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:35,540
At Coolidge Corner.

2660
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:36,540
At Coolidge Corner.

2661
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:37,540
Yeah.

2662
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,540
And we fucking, we threw spoons at the screen.

2663
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:40,540
That was so much fun.

2664
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,540
It was great.

2665
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:42,540
I loved every second of it.

2666
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,540
It was great.

2667
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:46,540
It's like one of those Rocky Heart Picture Show things.

2668
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,540
Yeah, it was so much fun.

2669
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:49,540
Everyone there was into it ruled.

2670
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:50,540
Ruled.

2671
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:51,540
Yeah.

2672
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,540
Give me another one, Nate.

2673
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,540
Okay, here's an appropriate question for now.

2674
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,540
I'm your commentator.

2675
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,540
I eat questions and comments.

2676
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:04,540
At Cloudy Chain asks, are you planning on ending the PCP anytime soon?

2677
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,540
Yes, I know.

2678
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,540
I've been fucking begging.

2679
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,540
People don't even know.

2680
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,540
I've been like bringing this up every week begging.

2681
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,540
Please guys, can we vote for it to end?

2682
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:14,540
Please, let it end.

2683
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,540
The Patriot has only just begun.

2684
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,540
We have to keep going forever.

2685
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,540
All artistic integrity has to be sacrificed.

2686
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:23,540
It should be our last Patreon goal at the end of the PCP.

2687
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,540
Just when I...

2688
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,540
We should set that like a hundred grand.

2689
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,540
Yeah.

2690
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:33,540
Just when I thought I was out, they started the Patreon and now I'm still here for them.

2691
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,540
The PCP is voluntary, Jesse.

2692
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,540
That's the only reason we're here.

2693
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:41,540
The fans of the Skriller are too important to me.

2694
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,540
He's...

2695
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:43,540
What a hero.

2696
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:47,540
I'm a true martyr for this fucking podcast.

2697
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,540
Okay, the rest of these questions are shit.

2698
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:51,540
At JerJot...

2699
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,540
Wait, JerJerRod asks,

2700
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,540
Best Gavra, do you recommend the can of beans lunch diet?

2701
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,540
Absolutely.

2702
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,540
It's fucking awesome.

2703
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,540
Just eat a can of beans.

2704
01:34:58,540 --> 01:34:59,540
That's the worst.

2705
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,540
That is the worst.

2706
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:01,540
This is coming from me.

2707
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,540
This is coming from me who will eat anything.

2708
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,540
I would never eat a can of...

2709
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,540
I would never eat a can of uncooked kidney beans.

2710
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,540
That is the grossest thing I can imagine.

2711
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,540
It sounds awesome.

2712
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,540
Nate, I have a can of black beans for lunch on the regular.

2713
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,540
Pretty awesome.

2714
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,540
Good.

2715
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:19,540
You gotta have representation for those black beans.

2716
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,540
Yeah.

2717
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,540
Baked beans are good with tomato sauce.

2718
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,540
Baked beans are good, but they got sugar and shit in them.

2719
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:33,540
We're talking about un-topped, undressed, straight out of the can with nothing.

2720
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,540
That's right.

2721
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:35,540
Stop turning the camera around.

2722
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,540
In the perfect world, we'd all eat for survival and nothing else.

2723
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,540
This whole eating for pleasure...

2724
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,540
I disagree.

2725
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,540
We're gonna have to bring that into the food cast though.

2726
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:43,540
Oh my God.

2727
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,540
I'm very much a pro food.

2728
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:48,540
I didn't even get to talk about how much I fucking hate fat people.

2729
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,540
God damn it.

2730
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:50,540
That's the biggest thing.

2731
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:51,540
That's true.

2732
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,540
I'm also pro hating fat people.

2733
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,540
It's very complicated.

2734
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:58,540
Yeah, so fucking fix your diets people.

2735
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,540
Okay, well, that's it.

2736
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:01,540
All the other questions are garbage.

2737
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,540
Thanks for watching everybody.

2738
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:04,540
I am an SJW.

2739
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,540
I take all the blue pills, but I've also taken red pills.

2740
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,540
I'm dying inside.

2741
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:09,540
There's an internal conflict within me.

2742
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,540
Thanks for watching everybody.

2743
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,540
Everybody sing.

2744
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,540
I need my blue pills.

2745
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,540
Bye.

2746
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,540
I need my blue pills.

2747
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:16,540
I need my blue pills.

2748
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,540
I need your pro pills.

2749
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:22,540
Oh my God.

2750
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,540
No, we can go for days.

2751
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,540
You can leave your kids.

2752
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,540
I can't...

2753
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:32,540
I can't do the Loudspeakers anymore.

2754
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,540
Hilary?

2755
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:39,540
I'm supposed to be working right now

2756
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:44,540
I'm supposed to be working right now

2757
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:47,540
But I'm not working

2758
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:50,540
I'm doing nothing

2759
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,540
My dick I'm jerking

2760
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,540
Myself I'm sucking

2761
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,540
I am an asshole

2762
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:00,540
I am a stupid

2763
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,540
I've got a deadline

2764
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,540
Don't wanna do it
