1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,480
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,640
Okay, I'm recording.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:24,180
I am also, also what?

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,660
I am also recording why?

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,680
Context clues.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,940
Uh, yeah.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,540
Context what?

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,540
Clues.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,540
What?

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,540
What?

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,540
What?

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,540
What?

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,540
What do you mean what?

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,540
What?

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,540
Huh?

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
Welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,540
Oh, we gotta sync.

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,540
Okay.

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,540
No, that was a good start.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,540
No.

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,540
Let's leave it in.

22
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,540
No.

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,540
Okay.

24
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,540
On the count of three, say sync.

25
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,540
One, two, three.

26
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,540
Sync.

27
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,540
Sync.

28
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:02,400
Eleazar, leave that intro in, it's good.

29
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Uh, yeah, welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,040
I'm weary, I guess, exhausted because I've been moving furniture and cleaning stuff

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,520
all day.

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh, why is that?

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,700
It's like a spring clean, moving stuff around.

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,860
Hmm, yeah, okay, fair.

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,700
It's nice every so often to be like, okay, well, furniture has been here for so long.

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,260
Why don't we just put it somewhere else in the room?

37
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,100
It'll change the feeling of it.

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:51,540
Did I tell you, when I, this was several years ago, I lived with a guy, coincidental

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,280
only named Conrad, no relation, who was, uh, uh, what's the word?

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,160
He was, oh, no, was it OCD?

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,840
No, it was bipolar.

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,800
He was bipolar and he would have moods and when he would get manic, there was one time

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,200
in particular that I caught it.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,440
I didn't really realize this was going on at the time, but he was, he was in a manic episode

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,320
and he was, uh, he insisted to me, like we have to move the furniture around, like we

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,500
have to move the furniture around, like right now, like we have to move the couch from one

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,100
side of the room to the other side of the room and like we have to move this chair

49
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
up the stairs.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,220
You've got to help me move this chair up the stairs and like we have to move these shelves

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
to the other side of the room.

52
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,220
We have to, we have to just reverse everything and then like mostly kind of put it back where

53
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:46,220
it started and ever since I don't, I don't think people with mental illnesses should

54
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,220
have, should have equal rights.

55
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,680
Oh, I thought you were going to say I don't think people with mental illnesses should

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,120
own furniture because then they wouldn't be able to move it.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Well, yeah, that's, that's, that's one of the rights I think should be.

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:13,720
You'll sleep on the floor and here's this nice straight jacket, padded, so classic.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:21,620
Here's a, here's a, here's a, here's a single pizza oven for you to cook the rest of your

60
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,620
meals for all eternity.

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,460
That's pretty good.

62
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,460
You can make pizza.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
Yeah.

64
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Yeah.

65
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Yeah.

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,460
Yeah.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Yeah.

68
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,460
We don't give them much, but we give them a rustic, a rustic wood-fired pizza oven and

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,660
a pizza pillow and all the fresh vine ripe, fresh Jersey tomatoes.

70
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,660
Oh, like I talked about, I thought I was making a PCP.

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Reference, but no, that was, I talked about, I talked about Jersey fresh tomatoes on my

72
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
main character syndrome podcast on Cheezy's channel with YOLO swag.

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Oh, yes.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I hadn't got around to listening to that.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
It was pretty funny.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,400
We talked about fucking the subject of, the subject of pizza sauces came up and I referenced

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,140
what's that one, what's that one that comes in the can?

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Papa, no, Don, Don Pepito, Don Pepitos, Don Pepitos sauce made with fresh Jersey tomatoes.

79
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,260
Whenever, whenever you like, I don't know, whenever I have like Googled around for like

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,300
authentic pizza sauces, Don Pepitos is always one of the, one of the first ones that pops

81
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
up.

82
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Pepito.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,400
It was, I opined there like, wait a minute, isn't it Pepito, a pumpkin seed?

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I guess it's Spanish and they're not the same language, but I don't know, is he, is he Don

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Pumpkin seed?

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,120
We'll never know.

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,480
There's no way to find out or verify this.

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
You know what?

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm going to do it right now.

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Translate.

91
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Here we go.

92
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
Here we go.

93
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
Uh, enter text.

94
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Uh, all right.

95
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Spanish.

96
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Right.

97
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,660
Here we go.

98
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
We're going to find out.

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Why is a Spaniard got a pizza place or a sauce?

100
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
Spitalian.

101
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Oh wait.

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm, I'm sorry.

103
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,180
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,180
When I try, when I attempt to translate Pepito, which I have certainly seen pumpkin seeds

105
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,060
called, the translation it gives me is nugget.

106
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,920
So I'm a little, I'm a little bit taken aback here.

107
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Pumpkin nuggets.

108
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:49,080
They're, that's not, they're, no, no, under no, uh, no, under no frame of reference.

109
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Here we go.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Here we go.

111
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:59,240
In Italian, uh, Pepito is nothing, Pepita is also nugget.

112
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Okay.

113
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Whatever.

114
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Great.

115
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:09,980
So he's pop, he's Don Nugget, maybe I don't, I don't, I don't trust, uh, I don't, I don't

116
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,580
really trust Google translate to, I'm missing some context here.

117
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,700
It's fine.

118
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:25,340
I've learned nothing, but you know what I didn't learn nothing doing, going, wait, no,

119
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,740
yes, I did.

120
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
Going to the library.

121
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I finally went to the library.

122
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Oh my God.

123
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,240
I've been threatening to go to the library for months and I finally did it yesterday.

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
What did you read?

125
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Yeah.

126
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,400
Well, I was looking, I looked for, I looked for some Foucault because I want to read Foucault

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,440
and they didn't have any.

128
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,400
So I put some on hold and I reserved some from another library and they're going to send

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
that.

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm not sure when it'll be there soon, probably.

131
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,860
In the meantime, I checked out, I checked out two like, uh, sort of like career advice

132
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,020
books just to like, maybe I'd learned something useful from these and, uh, I've read like

133
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,580
30 pages of one and I don't, I don't think the advice in there is for me.

134
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,300
I don't think it's really what I was hoping it was.

135
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,780
Step one, go to business school.

136
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,660
Step two, write a self-help book.

137
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
Heh.

138
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660
Heh.

139
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
I mean, yeah.

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Uh, no.

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
This, I, hold on.

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,320
This was called, let me find it.

143
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,240
Yeah, I started reading one that I just grabbed randomly off the shelf.

144
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,920
It's called What You're Really Meant To Do by Robert Steven Kaplan and, uh, I feel really,

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,800
I read like the intro and started the second chapter and it seems like this is for someone

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,800
who has been like working a job that like a nine to five that is starting to bore them

147
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,980
or they've decided that they're not that good at and they want to like switch careers.

148
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,700
They were like, oh, I actually always wanted to be a concert pianist.

149
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Oh, but my wife and kids won't understand if I stop being a jewelry salesman.

150
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
You know?

151
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah.

152
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,540
Uh, it's like, well, I don't know, it's exactly what it is.

153
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,580
It implies that you have the capabilities to, to save up using your current job you already

154
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,360
have in order to, to make a big splash on a new scene.

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Um, right?

156
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,840
Well, that's what I feel like a lot of these things are, that they assume you have more

157
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,880
means than you actually do.

158
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,720
That's not really what I, that's not really what I'm getting at.

159
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,480
What I'm getting at is that this is for someone who's like in a job they don't like and like,

160
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,520
I want to pursue my, my real dream.

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
What's my real dream?

162
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,880
And I guess I, I guess I'm already doing that.

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,220
Like I guess I already don't have a nine to five.

164
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:55,300
I already sustained myself, such as I do, uh, you know, doing art or whatever.

165
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,180
And you know, my advice is not how do I quit my job and follow my dream?

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,660
I guess I already did that.

167
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,980
How do you follow through, well, maybe the later chapters are like, how to, once you

168
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,820
got your dream, what do you do now?

169
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,900
Yeah.

170
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,780
You die, probably.

171
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,560
Uh, yeah, you just, um, you just wait to die.

172
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,280
You just burn through all of your shit.

173
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,000
There's no more mountains to climb.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Um, I was thinking about it.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,920
I just, I just liked, I just liked, uh, working on, I just liked making cool stuff in like

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
a team.

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,720
I think, I think that's what I liked.

179
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,860
Uh, I liked being a part of something.

180
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:52,260
And, uh, I think the most fun I ever had working was, uh, making T-Bap with Nate back in the

181
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
day.

182
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:01,380
Uh, and, uh, I don't know, I guess I would, I guess I would like to do something that

183
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:09,980
feels like that used to feel, you know, uh, I don't, I mean, making, for instance, making

184
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,420
Phantom's Revenge was good and all.

185
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
I mean, it was a good, uh, it was a good thing to do.

186
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,680
It was, uh, it was fun to work on in its own way, but it didn't have that, uh, didn't

187
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,040
have that feeling of like I'm part of something, you know, because I was all by myself.

188
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:36,280
I was all by myself making it for, basically just making it for, for me, uh, and it was

189
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,920
different, you know, you know, so I think that's part of what I'm like.

190
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,440
I think that's part of what I'm feeling now, like something's missing.

191
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,720
And it's that.

192
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,840
What if you try doing art for someone else's comic?

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,360
What if, what if I write a comic and then you draw it?

194
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:08,640
I mean, uh, that's not, I'm not saying that wouldn't work, but it's not.

195
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,540
Yeah.

196
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,460
Well, when you think about like being part of something is like, does, do you need to

197
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,500
be emotionally disattached from it or like super engaged with it?

198
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,980
And also someone else happens to be the same engagement.

199
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,820
Like with tea back, I'm sure like who, who you got Nate to watch my little pony, right?

200
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,700
I think so.

201
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,220
I started, yeah, I think I, I, I roped him into checking it out first.

202
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,520
Yeah.

203
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,360
And then when did you decide to make a show?

204
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,560
How did that happen?

205
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
Maybe, maybe a couple months after.

206
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,400
Well, like, like, I think I've told the story.

207
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,560
The idea, the thing was we would always watch the new episode and then we would

208
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,840
always be like, lol, what'd you think of that new episode?

209
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,240
It sucks, uh, it stinks.

210
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,800
Um, and then we were like, Hey, you know, we always like have these conversations

211
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,140
about the new episode.

212
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,980
Why don't we record them and make and put them on the internet?

213
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,660
And that's what we did.

214
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,980
Um, like who was, whose idea was that?

215
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,260
Do you remember to like make videos?

216
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,660
I believe it was mine.

217
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,580
I believe it was me who was like, we should record these.

218
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,700
I think so.

219
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,380
You know, you know what though?

220
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,740
I should, it's, it's two things.

221
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,100
There's two, there's two distinct elements here that should be split from each other.

222
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,000
There's the, there's the jolly cooperation and like being a part of a team thing.

223
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,200
I did like, when we were all of it, when we were all single-minded of purpose,

224
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,000
that's good.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,160
And I, and I do like it.

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
But the other aspect is, is that it was part of like a scene.

227
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,920
It was part of a scene and there was like a community and people and there was like a,

228
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,760
you know, phantoms revenge is not part of a scene.

229
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Right.

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,520
Uh, uh, or at least not a scene, despite getting on equestria daily.

231
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,100
And I guess despite being like CWC relevant, I don't even know if you could call

232
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,740
that a scene.

233
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,340
And even if it is a scene, it's a scene that I despise.

234
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,580
So, so there's no real scene there.

235
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,700
I liked that it was part of a, uh, uh, part of a scene, part of a community,

236
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
part of a conversation.

237
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,020
Um, and that lately, it just feels like I'm just talking to myself.

238
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,700
You know?

239
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,380
Yeah.

240
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm going, I'm going crazy.

241
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,860
The pony thing was like a good rallying point, I guess.

242
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,780
Yeah.

243
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,740
I think a lot of my, my like creative drive is like, I feel inadequate.

244
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:53,660
And so I need to prove to myself that I can do things that I want to do.

245
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,020
Be like, I'm not that good at drawing.

246
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,180
Ah, I gotta make drawings then.

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,620
Hmm.

248
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,900
Yeah.

249
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,340
Sure.

250
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,740
That's funny.

251
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,700
It's, it's not like, I don't, it's, I don't have that particular hangup.

252
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,300
My hangups are different.

253
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,180
It's like, uh, not that that's like the sole reason for making anything.

254
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,620
I have like creative drive, uh, in general, just like, oh, I want to do that.

255
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,100
Everything I do is solely motivated by proving that I am not bad at the

256
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,620
specific thing I'm doing.

257
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,540
Yeah.

258
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,280
But like, I brush my teeth in the morning.

259
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,520
I, oh, they said I couldn't brush these teeth.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,920
They said I couldn't do it just because I'm British.

261
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,160
Yeah.

262
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Uh, I showed them.

263
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:50,160
Um, but like, I don't feel that like isolation as like a drawback, like, oh, I

264
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,600
make something, I guess it is a bit like upsetting sometimes when you make

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
something, it's like, ah, that was good.

266
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,760
And then nobody, nobody likes it.

267
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Like physically, like, I'm sure people enjoy it, but they don't like click the

268
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,880
like button and like, dang.

269
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,080
Yeah.

270
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
And that's what it's, and that's at the end of the day, that's what it's all

271
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,680
about.

272
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,920
It's all about that feedback.

273
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,600
It's all about that engagement.

274
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
You know, it's all about that algorithm.

275
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,960
I mean, I know it's, well, I mean, the algorithm is whatever.

276
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,600
It's just sort of like, if you don't get feedback of any kind that people are even

277
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,880
paying attention, then it does feel like you're literally throwing things into

278
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,400
avoid.

279
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,760
It's like, why did I upload this?

280
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,700
Why did I make it?

281
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,820
Do I like it?

282
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,340
And then you look at it and you're like, do I like, I don't know.

283
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,140
Maybe it sucks.

284
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,220
Maybe that means I sucks.

285
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,300
I passed, uh, I passed 300 downloads on phantom's revenge, which is a number

286
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,140
that I feel mixed about.

287
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,460
I feel like, you know, in one sense, it's kind of a good number.

288
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,300
Like, like someone downloading the game and hopefully playing it is higher

289
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,900
commitment.

290
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,200
Like that's worth more than someone watching a YouTube video or liking a

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,400
tweet or something, but also just, just not enough.

292
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,280
It's just not enough people.

293
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,640
And, uh, I, uh, I don't know.

294
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,160
I need that I'm a little, I'm a little, uh, I don't know.

295
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm frustrated because I know I need to, like I anticipated that I would need to

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,680
do more after it was done to get it seen.

297
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,400
Uh, I need to make a trailer.

298
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,980
I don't want to make a trailer, but I have to make a trailer.

299
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,060
Um, um, mostly I have to do the Kickstarter.

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,180
I have to do the slime and punishment Kickstarter.

301
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,980
And I feel like just that alone is going to get some eyes on the game that

302
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,140
wouldn't have seen it before.

303
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,500
Cause Kickstarter, for some reason, Kickstarter is always like generate.

304
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,260
There's always sort of like generate hype in and of themselves.

305
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,180
It's pretty cool, I guess.

306
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:48,900
So I don't know.

307
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,380
Like that's, that's a big, that's an instrumental part of the whole thing.

308
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,520
I won't, I don't feel like I can look back on the, on the launch of phantom's

309
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,680
revenge and call it like, you know, a failure until that's over.

310
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,040
And then I can, and then I can truly look back and be like, so how did it actually

311
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,360
do?

312
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,360
What did people actually say about it?

313
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,040
Um, yeah.

314
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,800
So I don't, it's just a lot to do.

315
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
It's just a lot to do.

316
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,780
And it just continues to feel like I'm just talking to myself and going insane

317
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
and losing my mind.

318
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,980
And for what?

319
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah, nothing.

320
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,900
I can't think of like what, like a solution to that, that feeling.

321
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,980
It's like, oh, just, just have it be different.

322
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
Like, I don't know how does that work?

323
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:48,460
I know, I know, I know, I know, all you got to do is take a cup of flour, add it

324
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,240
to the mix.

325
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,000
Sometimes I have mused, sometimes I have mused about like, uh, getting a job at

326
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,320
like a, getting a job at like a small game studio or something.

327
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,320
That would be my, that would be my, my, probably be my dream job.

328
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,480
As long as I like liked my coworkers, I would just want to be, that would be my

329
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,640
dream job as long as like, I, Mike, I thought my coworkers were cool.

330
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,640
And I respected them and they were all, and I considered us all to be, uh, uh,

331
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,720
instrumental parts of a, of a team.

332
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,640
That would be very exciting, I think.

333
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,040
But it's so, cause like, what if I, what if I tried, what a nightmare scenario?

334
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:39,760
What if I tried to do that and I do it and I get a job at a studio and I, and I

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,720
feel like just a cog in a machine.

336
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,880
It would literally just be worse than not, than nothing.

337
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
It would just be a trap.

338
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,100
Hmm.

339
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,500
Yeah.

340
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,980
Life is very stupid.

341
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah.

342
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,900
Dude, you hear about the pumpkin alley, pumpkin patch?

343
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,180
Yeah, I didn't play it, but I saw the announcement.

344
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,780
Uh, Sixten actually found all the lizards.

345
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,380
No shit.

346
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,700
No shit.

347
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,100
How many lizards are there total?

348
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,820
Uh, there's eight.

349
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:12,980
Wow.

350
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,500
Okay.

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,440
Fuff.

352
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,840
Fuff.

353
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,840
Fluff.

354
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,360
What color?

355
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,040
Woof.

356
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,960
What colors are they?

357
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,760
Um, all the colors of the rainbow.

358
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,240
There's, there's only seven colors in the rainbow.

359
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,280
You, Nini?

360
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,160
Uh, well, um, the, the, to the rainbow.

361
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,800
The turquoise is a color.

362
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,440
Shut up.

363
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
Uh, there's an infrared one.

364
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
He's invisible.

365
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,940
There's a, there's a chroma key one and not a chroma key.

366
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,500
Uh, what do you call it?

367
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,940
Like the, the, the alpha channel is an alpha channel colored one.

368
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,420
It's invisible.

369
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,740
Oh, oh, I see.

370
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,220
I see.

371
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:02,340
There's a, um, well, there's, well, there, there, the, the colors of the, there

372
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,100
are the colors of the more inclusive, uh, LGBT flag.

373
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,820
They had, you got the six colors and then you got brown and black for, for people

374
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,400
of color, I don't know.

375
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,120
Uh, you got one, you got this, you got the seven colors of the rainbow.

376
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,320
And then you got, um, and then you got brown.

377
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,160
Oh, the black, but there was a, no, there's not a black one.

378
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,920
There's a white one.

379
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,640
I guess if there's all the colors, the seven colors plus white would be kind of,

380
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,960
I know there is a white one.

381
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,080
I saw Keyblade Spirit find it on her stream and I was like, whoa, a white one.

382
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,320
Ah, I want to give this one like a better test score on it.

383
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,180
Standardized tests and like, give it a job.

384
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,700
I want, I want to make this one my executive vice president.

385
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,380
Hmm.

386
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,940
I relate, I relate to this one.

387
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,860
I want to see this one in my superhero movies.

388
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,540
Is there a lizard based superhero?

389
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,900
Wait, wait, uh, uh, you, you have no right to judge him just because he was white.

390
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,660
Wow.

391
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,880
Uh, you, Kimba, your fur is white because you come from a long line of great leaders.

392
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,280
Wow.

393
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,120
I hope I can be like my ancestors as well as look like them.

394
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,200
Yes, Kimba.

395
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Wow.

396
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Wow.

397
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,280
You're just a white pussy cat.

398
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I look, do you know that?

399
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,800
You've seen that YMS Kimba video, right?

400
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,320
Yes.

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,120
That does.

403
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,720
He's the whole subplot about who's persecuted for being white.

404
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,380
I mean, it makes, it makes sense for an animal, but it's still just really funny.

405
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,060
Yeah, especially since it's in Africa.

406
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,060
You're right, right.

407
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,900
Africa, the whitest land.

408
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,140
Persecuted for being white.

409
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,460
So this is what happened, this is what happened, this is what happened to Davoo.

410
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,180
When Davoo went to, was it South Africa to be, it was somewhere in Africa to be a missionary

411
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,220
and she, and the only white people she had around for comfort was Mario and Luigi.

412
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Wait, what?

413
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I remember that.

414
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Do you remember, she said, she went to Africa for that, but like her parents did like missionary

415
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,360
work in Africa and she said, I don't know, I don't want to blow it out of proportion,

416
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,120
but she, she definitely commented for once or twice that there were no other white people

417
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:33,120
and she, and she occasionally found it comforting when she would play, I think it was Mario,

418
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,540
Superstar Saga, I think, on the GBA and she'd be like, oh, look, I relate to these, my fellow

419
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
white people.

420
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,340
Well, I mean, I forget how young she was then.

421
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,100
Even though Italians aren't white, but I mean, you take what you can get, you know,

422
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,980
when you're in the, when you're in the heart of darkness, so to speak.

423
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,340
When you really strip it back, is there like, like white is not actually a thing, it's just

424
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,040
a color of skin.

425
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:09,400
Do people mean like a specific thing and then like, oh, well, these Europeans are not technically

426
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
white.

427
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,360
What do people mean when they say that?

428
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Yeah.

429
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Well, I mean, it's very.

430
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
It's always arbitrary.

431
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,760
It's Italians and Irish used to not be considered white.

432
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Yeah.

433
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,160
Jews are sometimes, some people don't consider them white and it's all, it's all arbitrary.

434
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Yeah.

435
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,820
You could, you could just be like, well, it depends on the, on the tone of your skin.

436
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,860
But I mean, you know, some Asian people have the same color skin.

437
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,100
It's like, are some Asian people just white because they're paler?

438
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
I don't know.

439
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
I don't think so.

440
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,540
Very few, very few people would say that.

441
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Yeah.

442
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,940
At the end of the day, it is all just kind of, it's all kind of made up.

443
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,980
That's why I think transracialism is good and based.

444
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,980
I actually kind of do though.

445
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,320
I actually, I actually kind of was thinking about, and like, I really do think that like

446
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,280
race really is just as socially constructed and there, there really is no reason why,

447
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:12,440
like if someone said like, I actually consider myself to be, you know, white, like what am

448
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,600
I going to, what am I going to, and you know, they're black or whatever, I, what am I going

449
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,320
to stand there and be like, well, here's why you're wrong, sir, here's why I disagree.

450
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,920
Here's why you can't do that.

451
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,120
I would never do that.

452
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,100
I think it's weird, no, you know what, I think it's weird, not weird, but like, it doesn't

453
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:38,220
work like from, to say like, oh, I identify as white because it's, it's not a specific

454
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
nation.

455
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,940
Like, there's like, it's vague enough that that's like, not as weird, but like, if you

456
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:53,140
say I identify as black, there's a lot of like cultural significance tied to the skin

457
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:59,840
color, at least in the Western world, white, white just means it's the color of your skin.

458
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,640
And it doesn't just mean that.

459
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:09,360
No, but like, if I said I identify as Italian or something, I feel like, I feel like people

460
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,640
would be like, well, no, we're not from Italy, it's like, yeah, yeah, I mean, nationality

461
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,900
is a little, I mean, it's honestly, honestly, I feel like you could probably construct a

462
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,660
similar, I kind of think if someone was like, I identify as Italian, I'd be like, well,

463
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,900
who am I to say you're not, I guess, I mean, I guess to be like, well, have you ever been

464
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
to Italy?

465
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,100
Like, do you know any Italians, you ever, you ever eat a pizza?

466
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,340
I understand this, like it's arbitrary, but like, I feel like it would be weird.

467
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:54,560
And like, I wouldn't expect anyone to respect that, yeah, like race or nationality, I mean,

468
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,360
if you go in there and live there, well, here's, then I think it's different, but like, when

469
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,440
it comes to like black and white, people look different.

470
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Yeah.

471
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:13,480
Uh, I think we should, I think we should stop, I think we should stop respecting racial distinctions

472
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,080
more, I think we should respect them less.

473
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,840
I think we should, we should acknowledge that they are socially constructed, and therefore

474
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,640
subject to an individual simply deciding that they don't believe in them, or don't agree

475
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
about how they're defined.

476
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,440
And I think we don't, I think we, I think we have to, I think we have to accept that.

477
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I think it's true.

478
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Okay.

479
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,840
I mean, I guess, like logically, it's fine.

480
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,760
I'm thinking of like, I'm thinking of like practicality, though, like, when it comes

481
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:00,440
to like trans, the boundaries between men and women are arbitrary, and like this, you

482
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,400
know, but there's also a lot of people who are socially constructed.

483
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,320
It's socially constructed, but there are a lot of people who are trans, so it makes

484
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:15,520
sense then to respect like trans identities, because does it only make sense because there

485
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
are a lot of them?

486
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,200
I think there's an argument where like, I mean, hypothetically, I say there's exactly

487
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,600
one person in the world who is trans-racial, and they feel that way.

488
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't want to be like status quo.

489
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
You got to kill them.

490
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
No.

491
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,200
You just got to kill them.

492
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,840
I think it's just sort of, status quo, status quo, status quo.

493
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,800
I've never thought of like, arguing this for this thing, because it's like, it's odd,

494
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,000
because you don't hear about trans-racialists, like really existing.

495
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You don't.

496
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
You hear about that one lady.

497
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:03,160
That one lady, and I guess, practically, like, logically, logically, sound.

498
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,660
It's true.

499
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,660
Nobody does it.

500
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,820
Nobody seems to want to be like, I actually just feel like a white person on the inside.

501
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,460
Well, I mean, that's not true.

502
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,580
What I mean is, it's so weird and unusual that it's like, kind of not worth currently,

503
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
at least.

504
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Not worth worrying about.

505
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,380
Trying to implement that into society, because the benefit it would give is like so minor.

506
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:41,460
If there were lots of people, like a significant portion of any population that sincerely feels

507
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,980
trans-racial, then we should actually think more about it and try to shift societies to

508
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,500
make it more acceptable in practical terms.

509
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:01,580
I guess at the end of the day, a society that recognizes trans-racial identities doesn't

510
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,660
really look any different on paper.

511
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:14,660
Because on paper, at least, nobody in general in modern countries, mostly, are specifically

512
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:21,540
denied any rights for being one race or another.

513
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:29,660
We don't have, shit, what were those laws called, like post-slavery segregation laws?

514
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Jim Crow?

515
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,300
We don't have Jim Crow laws, we don't have the remnants of them.

516
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,860
You can't use the right, that bathroom, you got to use the other water fountain or whatever.

517
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:47,100
There exists remnants from those laws in current legislation, which is that.

518
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:56,340
And there's obviously racism in the general populace, but the thing that they're racist

519
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,220
about is simply the look of the person, not necessarily what it says on their legal definition

520
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,420
of what race they are.

521
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,820
If you could get your race changed on legal documents, people would still profile you

522
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,980
for being one skin color or another or look in a certain way.

523
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:19,380
So it's not as simple as just saying, alright, this is the way it is, you have to respect

524
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:29,540
it, because not that you've got to capitulate to the people who hate change, but if there's

525
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:40,580
one person, it's different from if there's lots of people for societal change to be actually

526
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,580
important.

527
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:52,700
I mean, I'm not proposing any societal change, because like I said, on paper, there's not

528
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,580
a lot of explicit rules about what black people can do anymore.

529
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:08,500
So it's not like suddenly they're like, oh, well, just because this person identifies

530
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,060
as white doesn't mean they should be.

531
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,460
Imagine Twitter in the day, Twitter in the Jim Crow days, ridiculous, this person just

532
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,820
because we're just going to accept that this person says that they identify as a white

533
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,820
person and just because of that, they're allowed to drink from the water fountain, making everybody

534
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
feel unsafe.

535
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,140
We have to crack down on this transracialism.

536
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:42,420
The current racism in the institutions is more implied than explicit.

537
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,700
So there's nothing that would necessarily change to the institution if transracialism

538
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,860
was legally recognized and whatever.

539
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,580
They'd just shift it to be like, oh, well, you may be white, but you are still of a certain

540
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,380
culture which I don't agree with, and it's like, okay, you're still being racist.

541
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,340
I mean, that's already what they do.

542
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:15,060
They say, oh, it's not about brown people immigrating, and it's about people from a

543
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,980
different culture.

544
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,540
It's about cultural differences.

545
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,060
They're destroying our culture by cannibalizing.

546
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,220
They come over here and they have different food, and I don't like it.

547
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,740
Western values, Western values, they bring Allah, and he's-

548
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Allah, these nuts.

549
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:43,020
They should say that when they cross the border.

550
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,420
If any refugees from Syria still coming in, any Muslims-

551
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
They should say that.

552
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Why don't they say that?

553
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Why don't they say that?

554
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Why don't they say that?

555
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Why don't they say that?

556
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
I don't know.

557
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,260
They would be so much more accepted if only they said Allah, these nuts.

558
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
I think so.

559
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,660
And then everyone would go, ah, you got us.

560
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,900
That's what I would say.

561
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,140
It is all of those nuts, I would say, slapping my knee.

562
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
Okay.

563
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
Shit.

564
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,100
Do I have anything else to say about that?

565
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,660
How do we get on this topic?

566
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
How did I-

567
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:31,100
I was talking about my career books, and then-

568
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,220
And so all of a sudden, Allah, these nuts.

569
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,220
I genuinely don't remember how we started talking about this.

570
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,740
It's that COVID brain fog.

571
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,220
That's not true.

572
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:48,020
I've always been like this, but I had a horrifying thought.

573
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Let me just continue.

574
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,540
Oh, I said I went to the library.

575
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,540
Yeah.

576
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,860
And then, I don't know, whatever, point is I'm waiting for Foucault.

577
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,100
I'm waiting for Foucault to- it's like waiting for a good dough.

578
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:07,300
Foucault, the Japanese sexual lingerie model.

579
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
My favorite.

580
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,260
The one that- I think we talked about that on the booby bonus episode.

581
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,580
The booby bonus.

582
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,580
The booby bonus.

583
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,860
What do we call that one?

584
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,780
Oh, it was just ass versus nothing.

585
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,300
Oh, no, boobs versus nothing, tits versus nothing.

586
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,940
Yeah.

587
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,180
No.

588
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,700
Funny you should- I didn't even- yeah.

589
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,140
Pronounce the same.

590
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:37,980
Foucault, well, emphasis is on the- oh, but no, F-F-O-U-C-A-U-L-T.

591
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,380
Just a bunch of people who I watch on- a bunch of YouTubers that I like have all referenced

592
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
his work.

593
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,500
It's like, well, maybe I should read some of it.

594
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
So I was going to read some.

595
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,260
Instead, I got this fucking career book, which is like- this is not- I don't even-

596
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,220
It's a fucking career, North Korea, South Korea, I don't get it.

597
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Very nice.

598
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,460
And it- whatever, no need to- whatever, I don't remember how we did it, but it's okay.

599
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,700
Back on the subject of- oh, the game.

600
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:12,300
I had a horrifying thought, I had a horrifying thought, and it is that- see, like, I know

601
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,740
and I always knew.

602
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,460
I always knew that it was, like, toxic, that it was Sonichu related.

603
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:27,060
Like, I know that that's bad, and I've always known that that's bad, and I know that- how

604
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,340
it looks, right?

605
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,820
I know how it looks when you say, oh, I made a video game.

606
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
What's it about?

607
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Oh, it's about Sonichu's.

608
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Right?

609
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,740
It's specifically about murdering Sonichu's, so maybe it's, like, anti-Toxic.

610
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,740
Yeah.

611
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,220
Well, here's the- here's where my thoughts.

612
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,180
On the one hand, I was like, what if- what if the Sonichu connection is so toxic that

613
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,700
if I want this game to, like, ever be seen by any kind of audience at all, like, the-

614
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,180
the smartest thing- the most efficient way to do that is just to base- not fully remake

615
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,260
it, but basically just rebrand it and release it as a new game with, like, a different story

616
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,900
and, like, different assets and no Sonichu's.

617
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,140
And maybe no My Little Pony either.

618
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,180
Just call it- just call it something else.

619
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,900
And, like, I guess I-

620
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,220
I mean, it's, like, not even that difficult, aside from all the assets you need to draw.

621
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:31,900
Drawing the assets is not that bad, depending on how, like- depending on how much I had

622
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,100
to remake some of the cutscenes or the dialogue would have to be re-considered, which could

623
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,620
take a while, I mean.

624
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,460
I mean, here's- I mean, if I knew- if I knew- if God came down and told me, Ben, if you

625
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:51,580
just took the Sonichu's out, this game would see, you know, 10,000 people would download

626
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
it on Twitch.

627
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,740
Or on- on- on itch, rather.

628
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,140
I'd be like, okay, well, I guess I'll do that.

629
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,540
Uh, but I don't know if that's the case, and I don't know if it would be a waste of effort

630
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,620
to do it.

631
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,900
I would do it if it- if it would help.

632
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,620
And I- I put it- man, I don't know, maybe it wouldn't.

633
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,540
So I guess there's two thoughts that I had, and one was maybe, what if the thing to do

634
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,980
is just to undo all that?

635
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,820
No, I wouldn't- like, I would leave Phantom's Revenge up, and I would just release, like,

636
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,700
a- a different version, is- in- in this timeline.

637
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,820
The- the socially acceptable Phantom's Revenge, but not Phantom.

638
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,820
Yeah.

639
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,020
I would just- I don't know, I would just theme it, you know, just a little more, like, its

640
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,020
own thing.

641
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,580
I- I would- would have to think of what that would look like.

642
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
I don't- I have no idea.

643
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,300
Um, what if it was keg standard?

644
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Yeah.

645
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Mm-hmm.

646
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Yeah.

647
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
He's- he's much more marketable.

648
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Yeah.

649
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:56,020
Um, I mean, what- if it- not a pony, then what character would it be?

650
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
Would you have to-

651
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
I genuinely have no idea.

652
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
Like, design a new thing?

653
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,340
Could it be a Beastars game?

654
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Beastars?

655
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,060
No, uh, not Beastars, uh, Biscopades.

656
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,700
I mean, I don't think so.

657
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
I don't know how- I don't know what that would look like.

658
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,660
Well, you got your little guy with his helmet and he's got a weapon or something.

659
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,060
Does he have a weapon?

660
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
I forget.

661
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,060
I feel like he did.

662
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,060
No, he does.

663
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,340
A Beast Knight has a weapon.

664
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,260
Oh, he's- wait, does Beast- does Beast Hustler have a katana?

665
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,820
I- I think?

666
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
I thought he did.

667
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,100
I think- I think he- I forgot, yeah, he totally does.

668
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,420
He has a sword that he picks up off his- I totally forgot.

669
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,340
Beast has a weapon.

670
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,660
You could have little beasts come and they'd be like, eh, eh, eh.

671
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,220
I should reread Biscopades and get myself caught up on it so that I can, like, continue

672
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,220
it.

673
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,220
Yeah.

674
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,580
I need- I need to, like, remember what's actually in it before I keep it going.

675
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,660
But that's not- that's not what I want to talk about right now.

676
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,140
What I- Anyway, so that's the one way and then the other way would be, like, lean really

677
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,260
hard into the Sonichu thing, but in that way it's like- it's a game about killing Sonichus.

678
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Yeah.

679
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Phantom's Revenge.

680
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,340
The game about killing Sonichus.

681
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,020
The game about taking revenge on Sonichus.

682
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,780
The game about- the game that ended Sonichu forever.

683
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,860
It's the- it's the end of Sonichu.

684
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
It's- you kill him.

685
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:18,220
Um, and I was thinking about this because I was reading, like, articles and listicles

686
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,260
about, like, how to market your indie game and, uh-

687
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,980
Make it about killing a real person's stuff.

688
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,940
A real person's stuff.

689
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,540
Oh, that's like- that's the advice.

690
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Yeah.

691
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Yeah.

692
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Uh, no.

693
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,740
None of them said that.

694
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:43,940
Um, uh, some of them, they were talking about, like, uh, I don't know.

695
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm getting sad just thinking about it, because a lot- a lot of what I read was, like, oh,

696
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,620
you need to be- you need to be sending emails.

697
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:58,420
You need to be sending, like, emails to, like, people to, like, YouTubers and- and journalists

698
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,220
and, like, video game people, just people with clout, just send them emails about your

699
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,220
game.

700
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,700
So, you're sending emails and here's how to write a press release and a press email?

701
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
Yeah.

702
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I mean, that's not too difficult.

703
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,220
Once you've written it the first time, you just send it- find what you're sending it

704
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
to.

705
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,700
Well, here's- so they- well, yeah, how do you do that?

706
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,420
Like, genuinely, that's the hard part.

707
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,900
Who do I send it to?

708
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:27,660
Uh, I mean, I was sending, uh, or rather, Charlie sent, uh, we wrote, like, emails, uh, being

709
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,100
like, hey, this is a pumpkin alley, this is a 3D platformer, maybe you'd enjoy it.

710
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,180
And we send it to a few people who play 3D platformer games.

711
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,820
I don't think any of them, like, noticed, uh, but whatever.

712
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,660
It's just a demo right now.

713
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,940
How did you find those people?

714
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,460
How did you assemble that list?

715
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,420
Um, it wasn't that many people.

716
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,100
Charlie had just been, like, looking at, like, smaller YouTubers who talk about those sorts

717
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:59,340
of things, like, 3D platformer enthusiasts, um, thinking, okay, this guy's got a couple

718
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,820
thousand subscribers.

719
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,980
They talk about platforming games.

720
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,940
They also specifically talk about, like, new and upcoming things that you'd get excited

721
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,940
for.

722
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,980
So, like, potentially, there's a chance we can get featured on that.

723
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:19,260
So, like, aim low in terms of, like, clout to begin with, because nobody knows what your

724
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
thing is.

725
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
Yeah.

726
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,140
Um, you're not gonna, like, immediately get front-paged on some big thing, although it

727
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,260
doesn't hurt to try, I guess.

728
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Yeah.

729
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,380
I mean, even when I was, like, starting out hypocrite, I would, like, email a bunch of

730
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
my favorite YouTubers.

731
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,980
I would email John Tron and Peanut Butter Gamer saying, hey, uh, maybe you think this

732
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,980
is cool.

733
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
I don't know.

734
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,980
Yeah.

735
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,540
It was, like, really embarrassing, but, like, it's possible.

736
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:51,100
I mean, I, um, I may have mentioned this once or twice, but, uh, when I was doing, um,

737
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,940
when I started doing, it's all so ugly, you know, my, my short-lived, uh, uh, what do

738
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,940
we call it?

739
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,140
Like, what's the word for whatever it was?

740
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,140
Webcomic?

741
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Website?

742
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Yeah.

743
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,340
I feel like more, more specifically, I want to call it, like, a three-panel comic, but

744
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,940
it wasn't, like, three panels.

745
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,940
Whatever.

746
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,620
Like, my comedic joke strip that didn't last, whatever.

747
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:19,860
Uh, I, I emailed a bunch of, um, yeah, emailed a bunch of other comics people, and I asked

748
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:25,580
if they wanted to, like, uh, you know, like, do, like, a comic trade, like, you know, I,

749
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,180
they post one on my site, I post one on their site.

750
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:35,340
Um, I didn't get much reply, except, funnily, I did get a reply from the guy who does Death

751
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,860
Bulge, but I got a, like, yeah, it's, it's a comic.

752
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,660
Uh, I think it also, I think they, they made a video game, a tie-in, like, I think it might

753
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,820
have been a few years ago at this point.

754
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,940
What is it with comics and video games and the people who make them?

755
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,940
I don't know.

756
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,940
Man, dog, people just be, like, liking video games and shit.

757
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:09,380
Um, the, the, um, what was I talking, oh yeah, Death Bulge, man, made a, oh, he, he replied,

758
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:16,340
but he was like, ah, I wish, I kind of wish he didn't reply, because he, because he replied

759
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,900
being like, yeah, maybe we could do something like that, and I'm a complete nobody, right?

760
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:26,380
I have no clout, like, there's nothing, there's nothing in it for him, but I, but I, you know,

761
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,700
I was like, but he was smaller at the time.

762
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,980
He was not, he was, you know, I'd heard of him, so he was not nobody, but Death Bulge

763
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,540
definitely got bigger since then, that I, you know, he replied being like, yeah, maybe

764
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,060
we could do something like that, and I was like, okay, well, like, uh, you know, uh,

765
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,180
I tried to, like, you know, press further, be like, well, you know, how about, you know,

766
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
what do you want to do?

767
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,860
Like, I'll, I'll, I'll draw a strip in the Death Bulge, so do you want to draw something

768
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,660
that looks like mine, my style, we trade, and then he, he comes back and he's like, uh, yeah,

769
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:01,900
I mean, might be able to do something like that soon, like, maybe be able to do, could,

770
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,580
I'm not sure when exactly, uh, and like, I think I might have tried, like, one more time,

771
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:13,140
be like, okay, well, uh, you know, here, I don't know if I drew, I should have drawn

772
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,900
something, I'm thinking back in what I should have then done, what I should have then done

773
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,580
is drawn a, like, haha, this is my take on Death Bulge strip and just showed it to him,

774
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,940
and then maybe he would have been like, haha, I like it, okay, here, I'll draw one for you,

775
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,460
I don't think I did that, that's what I should have done, but nevertheless, he kind of just

776
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:39,940
continued to sort of, sort of, uh, noncommittally reply a couple times until I think I eventually

777
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:46,220
got the picture and was like, well, I guess this isn't happening, uh, hmm, hmm, yeah,

778
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,980
if I wanted to make that happen, I should have taken, I should have taken the next step,

779
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:59,460
I'm thinking about it, hmm, yeah, I guess I fucked up, oh well, it sure is really hard

780
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:07,780
getting your creative work known by anyone, yeah, in my head, I'm thinking, okay, as long

781
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,540
as I keep making, getting better at doing what I do, eventually I'll make something

782
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:18,340
that's so good that I won't even have to try, yeah, that's the dream, right, that's

783
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,700
the dream is you can just make it and you don't have to worry about, like, God, an email

784
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:29,540
list, like, kill me, like, shoot me in the fucking head, hmm, hmm, yeah, I mean, the hard

785
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,980
part for that, more than just writing the email, because I think I've gotten better

786
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,980
at, like, just sending emails, if you just gave me a list of 100 people to email, I would

787
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:46,580
just, yeah, share whatever, I just write 100 emails, like, I don't care, but how do I,

788
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:52,780
but how would I, what's so difficult about finding them, you just, like, Google,

789
00:45:52,780 --> 00:46:00,580
who, who, who, comics, websites, and find people from links from links, and then be like, okay,

790
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:07,620
this person seems like the same sort of size, a little higher, I'll just email them, write

791
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:13,100
it down in a note, it'll just take, like, a day maybe of research, I don't know, I can't,

792
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:19,140
okay, well, I've lived my entire life, and I genuinely cannot think of even a single

793
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,740
person who I would email to tell them about Phantom's Revenge, and say, like, hey, check

794
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,340
this game I made out, maybe you'd like to, well, yeah, with Phantom's Revenge, it's

795
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:36,820
a little weird, yeah, exactly, not just because the three things that are involved, there's

796
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,500
ponies, there's Endless War, which you're already, like, you know, you're part of that,

797
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:52,300
you made it, and, and the Sonichu, like, Sonichu's super toxic, the people in the Sonichu

798
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:58,020
verse are like, they hate you, or they would hate you, mostly, mostly they hate you, just

799
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,740
because, because they, you know, transphobes and all that.

800
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,980
That's part of it.

801
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:11,540
Um, and then the pony stuff is like, sort of, sort of toxic in its own way.

802
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,500
Yeah, but like, two outsiders, it's considered, it's crazy, the pony, the pony, like, community

803
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,820
is like, disbanded largely, and the big names are all like doing different things, and like,

804
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,860
either distance themselves, or like, not interested in pony anymore.

805
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,820
Yeah, the people who are left are like, I don't know, I don't know too much about them, but

806
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,020
I don't think they're cool.

807
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,620
They're just furries, pretty much.

808
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:41,340
Well, yeah, I mean, like, but like, there's nothing exciting going on in that space, as

809
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:41,780
far as I know.

810
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,300
Not really.

811
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:43,980
Not really, no.

812
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,340
There's no up and comers anymore, because there's nothing to strive for, like, what, what, what,

813
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,700
what sort of person sees the Brony community and thing, and has a twinkle in their eye and

814
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,980
starts their career.

815
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:01,620
Yeah, there's no one doing that, it's just old people, old guard who are like, just

816
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,780
committed to talking about pony on their channel or whatever.

817
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,300
Yeah, and then everyone with talent has branched out, like, Living Toonstone and, and

818
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,900
God, what's her name?

819
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,220
Jenny, Jenny Nicholson, right.

820
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,460
I mean, even Save Your Spark, you know, all those, they just doing other things.

821
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,860
So, I mean, so there, so there you go.

822
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,940
So you wonder, so you understand my dilemma.

823
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,820
I do.

824
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,740
Yeah, there's no one you could send this to.

825
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:42,460
But you said you already knew that, kind of, you knew it was super niche, niche.

826
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:43,900
Yeah.

827
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,620
Yeah, I did.

828
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,260
I did.

829
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,860
I feel like there probably is an angle.

830
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,300
There probably is some angle I could, I could sell it with to somebody.

831
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,180
I just don't know, I just don't know who.

832
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:04,300
I mean, do you think it's worth, like, just because you don't go into, like, your

833
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,900
own opinions of, of Chris Chan and all that, it's mostly just about killing

834
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,140
Sonichu and Nightstar.

835
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,580
If you went into, like, Sonichu or Chris Chan related spaces and say, hey, you

836
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,100
want to kill a bunch of Sonichus?

837
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,620
Like, you would get some people having a look, I guess.

838
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,260
Yeah, sure.

839
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,260
I'm not, I'm not above that.

840
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,020
I'm not above that.

841
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,420
And yet, like, honestly, I mean, I haven't, I kind of wonder, I mean, I

842
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,300
guess there's like the, I mean, there's the quickie.

843
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,820
But the quickie is like, okay, I guess there's like a board.

844
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,900
There is a board.

845
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,540
I wonder if Slash CWC even exists anymore.

846
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,100
I'm not, I'm not above, uh, dipping into that well.

847
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,460
But also, I'm not sure how much of it exists.

848
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,300
You know what?

849
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,060
It's, it's, it's Kiwi Farms now.

850
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,500
Like the, the, the Chris Chan community is just Kiwi Farms.

851
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:03,900
Yep.

852
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,220
I would, I would imagine so.

853
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,420
And, uh, and we know how they feel about me, which is fine.

854
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,340
I don't care.

855
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,180
Uh, I don't know.

856
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,180
I don't know if they're interested.

857
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,820
I don't know if they're interested in a game that I made.

858
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,140
They're interested in like, is Chris going to jail?

859
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:30,340
Like what is Chris writing in her letters from jail, et cetera, et cetera.

860
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:33,700
Si.

861
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,940
So I just don't, yeah, I just don't know if there's that much potential there.

862
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:47,100
Uh, I feel like the only hope it has is like people, I don't know, people who

863
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,860
just like weird stuff.

864
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,380
Um, and I mean, I like weird stuff.

865
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:02,180
So like, that can't be a complete, they can't be nobody, right?

866
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:03,820
I don't know.

867
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:09,900
Like, um, there must be some sort of a community out there that would see it

868
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,980
and be like, what a, what a, what an oddity.

869
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,540
What a curious, what a curious artifact you suppose.

870
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:16,940
Okay.

871
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,500
Well, well, I don't know.

872
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,340
I don't know the entire internet.

873
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:22,740
Yeah.

874
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,380
I'm trying to stay positive here.

875
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:31,700
What, what sorts of people, um, I guess, I don't know where you would find

876
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,620
people who like weird shit specifically.

877
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:35,900
Yeah.

878
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,180
Unfortunately, they may not even be like online that much.

879
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,700
That's, I should start, I should start a 4chan thread about it.

880
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,460
Why not?

881
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,100
On a slash MLP.

882
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,580
Law.

883
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,140
I mean, what, I mean, why not?

884
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:51,980
Yeah.

885
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,500
Um, honestly, not even something, not a terrible idea.

886
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,820
Maybe I will fucking do it.

887
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,580
Uh, who cares?

888
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,380
You know what?

889
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,900
There's no rules.

890
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,340
There's no God in heaven judging my actions.

891
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,500
There's only the devil.

892
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,740
There's only the devil and he lives in, in me and he tells me to do these things.

893
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:20,860
He tells me to make this game in spite of knowing that it has no audience.

894
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,780
And then tells me find the audience then, make an email list then.

895
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,300
You got to, you got, you got to get this on the front page of the question daily.

896
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:40,260
Uh, thanks again to Oblivionfall for, uh, thanks again to Oblivionfall for

897
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,100
telling Cepisto to put it there.

898
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,300
Cause it really is, it really is like it doesn't matter.

899
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,620
It really just doesn't matter what you do.

900
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,780
Uh, it's just, it's just, do you know a guy?

901
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,340
At the end of the day.

902
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,740
Yeah.

903
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,140
I was reading a, I was reading, it was one of those like, get your indie game

904
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,980
scene, get your, like, indie game published thing.

905
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,340
And it was like, yeah, some indies will like partner with a, you know, the

906
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:14,460
partner with like, you know, a bigger studio or a publisher, you know, for

907
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,980
marketing and it, and it literally is like the, the single biggest thing that

908
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,220
those people can do for you is that they'll know a guy.

909
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,860
Cause they know, cause publishers know everyone.

910
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,300
So they'll know a guy who can maybe get you like a table at a, at a, at a, um,

911
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,700
an expo or something.

912
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,740
And just like, that's the only way to do it.

913
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,420
You got to know a guy.

914
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,300
And if you don't know a guy, you got to like, you got to find people that know

915
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,380
guys and like pay the money for the, for the guys that they know.

916
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,940
Uh, it's just, it's just, uh, it's just a cruel world.

917
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,480
Um,

918
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,480
Yup.

919
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,460
Uh, okay.

920
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,780
Well, that's, that's all.

921
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,500
Anyway, I went to the library and I'm waiting for those books.

922
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,060
Um,

923
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,420
Uh,

924
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,060
something else.

925
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,460
Let's change the subject.

926
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:18,620
Um, well, I, I sent, I'm, I'm beginning to send the rest of the Lord of

927
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,900
ghosts things.

928
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,300
Um,

929
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,020
I sent my first few packages now that the ghost costumes are done.

930
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,740
So the, the packages, including like the plush, I think Simsies is on its way.

931
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:33,860
Oh good.

932
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,500
So Simsie will get his and a few others.

933
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,900
Um,

934
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,020
I'm going to do, try to do another big like bunch going to America,

935
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,980
right before the end of the month.

936
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,380
And I don't know, just like every day I could, I could fill out the, uh,

937
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,020
fill out the fucking thing and the customs and just put it all together.

938
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,780
I still need to do the doodles.

939
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,540
I don't have like,

940
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:07,940
I think I need to go and get some cool pens or just some good enough pens to

941
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,980
start doing those.

942
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:09,860
Hmm.

943
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:16,940
Bah, but, you know, there's plenty of that I can spend my time sending that

944
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,580
don't have doodles and I'm going to just get through as many of those as I

945
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,340
can as quick as possible.

946
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,180
And then, uh, there'll be less stuff in my room, cluttering it up.

947
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,540
I need, I need to check my PO box.

948
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,020
I haven't checked my PO box in a while.

949
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,300
I'm afraid that it's like overflowing with packages that have been returned to

950
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,620
me.

951
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,020
You know, I send a lot of packages.

952
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,300
Yeah.

953
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,100
You, you mentioned you were going to check it last week.

954
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,620
Yeah.

955
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:51,460
I was going to, and then, uh, I had a thing to do around that area.

956
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,180
Cause my, my PO box is in a different town because it's near my old address.

957
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:03,340
So, uh, I had a thing to do in the area that I was going to check my PO box

958
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:03,980
while I was there.

959
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,660
And then it turned out, oh, the thing was on a Sunday and post offices

960
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,540
aren't on Sundays.

961
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,140
Oops.

962
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,140
Uh, so I didn't do it.

963
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,140
So, uh, yep.

964
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,420
So I haven't, still haven't done it.

965
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,940
Uh, gotta do it.

966
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,140
It's just so annoying.

967
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,180
I have to take the butt.

968
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,060
I have to take like two buses to get there.

969
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,620
It takes like, it probably takes me like two or three hours.

970
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,820
Just let go and like check my fucking PO box.

971
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,620
Who wants to do that?

972
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,700
Although I guess it's getting, I guess it's getting warm out.

973
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,140
So it's a little, it's a little less miserable.

974
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,020
It's nice going on walks.

975
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:46,020
Um, I think, uh, the, the post office, the delivery office with royal mail is quite

976
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,380
good.

977
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,140
I buy the thing online and then I have like a QR code email to me.

978
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,780
So I can bring the packages to the delivery office and say, Hey, um, could

979
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,540
you put labels on these and send them?

980
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,140
Thanks.

981
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,980
And then they just print the labels right then and there.

982
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,260
So that's pretty good.

983
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,820
I don't know whether they can do that for customs labels.

984
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,820
So I bought a bunch of labels for that.

985
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,220
If I can, if I need to do them at home.

986
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:18,540
Uh, I also, last time I went or a few times ago when I went to the post office,

987
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,220
uh, they made me wait.

988
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,580
They made me, uh, wait in line.

989
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,980
I would, I would always like wait in line.

990
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,620
And then I would get to the thing, get to the desk and be like, here, here's my

991
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,380
domestic packages and here's my international package.

992
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,820
And they'd be like, okay, and they'd sign off the domestic ones.

993
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,540
And then they'd be like, here, for these international packages, you've got

994
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,980
to take these slips and fill them out.

995
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,460
And so go over there.

996
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,860
And then I'd go and I'd fill out the slips and then I'd get back in line

997
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,620
and wait a second time and then I'd send the international ones.

998
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:55,780
So the one, so I finally was like, I got you suckers and there was a stack

999
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,340
of those slips and I stole them.

1000
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,180
I stole a big stack of those slips.

1001
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,060
And now I just have them and now I can fill them out beforehand.

1002
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,260
So when I get there, I can be like, I already got them.

1003
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,060
I only have to wait in line one time.

1004
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,700
All the international ones are all, because it's not enough.

1005
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,500
It's not enough to just write the info on the package.

1006
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,260
You also must fill out a slip with the same information.

1007
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:25,060
And then they must take that slip from you and look at it and painstakingly type

1008
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:30,060
in all the information you wrote on the slip into their little computer and print

1009
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:35,060
out a label that says that information and then stick that label on, on the

1010
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:43,060
that seems so, so old fashioned, I guess, a bit like with the Royal Mail thing.

1011
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,660
Like you do all that online when you purchase the, the, the, the postage.

1012
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:52,820
And so they had, they can, they can just like print the label.

1013
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:58,220
Well, they give you like what the, the, the print, the label print like PDF.

1014
00:58:58,220 --> 00:58:59,900
So you, if you want to print it yourself.

1015
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,060
Oh, really?

1016
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,700
Take it in.

1017
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:02,580
Yeah.

1018
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,740
If you got like label paper, you can print it at home.

1019
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,780
And then stick it on and then just bring it in and drop it off.

1020
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,700
I wonder if there's a way to do that with the USPS.

1021
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,740
And not that I know of, but I could be missing something.

1022
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,740
That would be a little, that would be a little more convenient.

1023
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,460
I used to have, I used to use a website called stamps.com that lets you,

1024
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,740
I don't know if it would let you do international labels, but it would let

1025
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:31,780
you print your own stamps of any denominational, like you could specifically

1026
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:36,420
print like a dollar, $1.09 stamp, if you wanted.

1027
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,180
But it had like a fucking monthly fee.

1028
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,580
It was like $20 a month and it literally would not let me cancel.

1029
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:51,620
Like I tried to cancel and they were like, are you sure you want to cancel?

1030
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,740
And it brought me back to the website and, and, and it was the same website,

1031
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,020
but the cancel button was gone.

1032
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,060
Like it was just gone.

1033
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,420
And I was like, okay, so this website's a scam.

1034
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,100
Even though it works, even though it literally works and seems to be endorsed

1035
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,260
by the United States Post Office, it just is a scam.

1036
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,380
It's scamming me.

1037
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:13,140
So I had to call my credit cards and be like, hey, do not authorize payments

1038
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,420
to this company.

1039
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,620
Simply stop paying them.

1040
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,780
And they'd be like, well, we have to give you a new credit card.

1041
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,900
It's like, fine.

1042
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,260
Cancel my old card.

1043
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,420
Give me a new card so that I can stop paying these devils.

1044
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,780
Couldn't you have like, like customer support called and say,

1045
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,180
did you please stop charging me?

1046
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,380
Well, that's, oh, you mean to stamps.com?

1047
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,820
Yeah, to the.com.

1048
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,500
Maybe I could have done that.

1049
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,260
I, I feel like I, yeah, maybe I could have, I mean, I exhausted,

1050
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:51,220
I exhausted all of the web, web-based methods I could find.

1051
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,540
And I felt like that was proof of their ill intent.

1052
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,020
I just didn't trust them.

1053
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,260
I just didn't trust them that they were going to actually let me quit,

1054
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,460
no matter how bad I wanted to.

1055
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,140
Yeah.

1056
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,380
So, uh, oh well.

1057
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:16,180
Anyway, so that's, so that's, once again, I don't remember how we got here.

1058
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,220
I was just talking about Lord of Ghosts.

1059
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:19,700
Oh, right.

1060
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:20,980
Yes.

1061
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,380
Yes.

1062
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,140
Actually, that's a fairly, a fairly direct through line now that you mentioned it.

1063
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,100
Yeah.

1064
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:32,260
So like, aside from the doodles of which there are many, but like not like an unbelievable,

1065
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,180
like I would die sort of amount.

1066
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:43,780
It's just sort of, I want to first get as many of these like that are, that I can packaged and sent

1067
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:49,140
and hopefully before April, because like that April is like text

1068
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,220
moment, like everything before that.

1069
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,980
I forget which date, maybe it's the first of April or the end of April or some number.

1070
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,980
One of the dates would be like the text thing.

1071
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,860
And so like the income I got from the Kickstarter and then like spent would be part of that text here.

1072
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,660
And then I could write it off from that text here.

1073
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:13,140
Yes.

1074
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:13,460
Yes.

1075
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,100
So you want to wait.

1076
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:16,900
So you're waiting.

1077
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:18,740
You're waiting.

1078
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,620
I'm not waiting.

1079
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,820
Oh, you're not waiting.

1080
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,460
I'm not waiting.

1081
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:26,740
I'm trying to get it done before April, before the next text here takes over.

1082
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,580
I don't know what I'm doing, but I have just a feeling that like,

1083
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:36,100
since the income from the Kickstarter was in that text here.

1084
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:44,420
And then if I spend as much of the money that I was required to spend for the Kickstarter before

1085
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:49,940
the next text here takes over, then I could do my taxes for that year and not pay

1086
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:55,620
anything, because I would get a bunch of income from the Kickstarter, but then it would all be like,

1087
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:03,140
oh, this is, I spent it on like what it was supposed to be, including the postage.

1088
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:05,940
I really should have done all of this earlier.

1089
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,700
But you know, making a fucking video game in the meantime.

1090
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,100
So you want to wait.

1091
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,500
So you want to report your income and your expenses in the same year.

1092
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,820
That's what you want to do, so that they cancel each other out.

1093
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,500
Yes.

1094
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,180
So it doesn't count as like super, I don't know.

1095
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:30,980
You know, when like you go over the money and you can't write enough stuff off,

1096
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,860
then you actually have to pay taxes and that sucks.

1097
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,580
That's bad.

1098
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,220
That's bad.

1099
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:45,300
So yeah, yeah, but sure, you don't want to imagine like paying taxes on a bunch of money that you made

1100
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,420
and then and but then like had to spend on something else.

1101
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,700
But then you, there was like a delay so you didn't get to report

1102
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,740
the that you spent the money on the thing.

1103
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,260
You paid the taxes on it as though you weren't going to spend it.

1104
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,700
No, that wouldn't be right.

1105
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:02,500
That wouldn't be.

1106
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:07,220
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there's like ways you can say, well, there's like,

1107
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:12,420
I haven't spent the money yet, but I will because of like this.

1108
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:13,940
And you can write that in somewhere.

1109
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,220
I feel like I've seen that.

1110
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,780
But it's like a lot of business jargon and a lot of like, I don't get it.

1111
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,180
I'm just typing in numbers that are basically correct.

1112
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:25,780
Sure.

1113
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,860
Then I get my tax return and they say, wow, you're okay.

1114
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,900
I thank fuck.

1115
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,460
You got to do your best.

1116
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,500
At the end of the day.

1117
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:43,220
Well, things considered, Texas is quite easy to like figure out.

1118
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,020
It just takes a while.

1119
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,460
I guess I got to pay mine.

1120
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,540
I guess, well, I guess the deadline is like three weeks from now.

1121
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,100
So I guess I actually kind of got to do that somewhat soon.

1122
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,260
And that sucks.

1123
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,180
I'm sure I'll file for an extension.

1124
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:58,820
I always do.

1125
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,460
I have all my forms.

1126
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:15,460
I got all my forms from like Google AdSense and Patreon and whoever the fuck else.

1127
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:18,420
Taxes are actually going to be kind of shit.

1128
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,340
Taxes are going to be kind of shitty this year because I got a bunch of them.

1129
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:28,500
Because I got a bunch of COVID unemployment and you have to pay money on unemployment benefits.

1130
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,100
Yeah, it sucks.

1131
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,620
Yeah.

1132
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:35,220
I mean, I'm not complaining because I did get a bunch of free money,

1133
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,900
but I will have to pay some of it back.

1134
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,100
So I don't like that part, but I'll do it.

1135
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,780
I'll do it.

1136
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,580
God damn it.

1137
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,780
Why don't they just take that out if they're going to?

1138
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,940
If they're going to make me pay it.

1139
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:54,660
It's fine.

1140
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,140
It's fine.

1141
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,940
I had two more things on my stupid list of shit I wanted to talk about.

1142
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,580
Is that okay?

1143
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,660
Yes, it's fine.

1144
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:19,940
I don't have too much to say either because it's mostly just been like, I don't know.

1145
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,060
I guess the only other thing is that I've got another appointment

1146
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:31,860
set for laser hair removal on my arms, which is like, well, I'm just doing that now.

1147
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,060
I'm zapping my arms with lasers and my hair will stop coming back.

1148
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:38,660
It's not much to say about it.

1149
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,020
When did you start doing that?

1150
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,340
It was only a few days ago.

1151
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,300
I had my first session.

1152
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:44,820
Oh, that was your...

1153
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,820
You mentioned it on the last episode.

1154
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,620
That was your first one?

1155
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:50,020
For my arms, yeah.

1156
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:56,500
I had been doing it on my face for the last year, and that has been going pretty well.

1157
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,820
There's only a few little patches that keep coming back, and I'm like, okay,

1158
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,860
I need to do some more on that.

1159
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,740
I'd finished my 10 sessions and they're like four weeks apart.

1160
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:12,420
God wanted you to have hair there?

1161
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,780
No, no, he made a mistake.

1162
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,580
He put it there.

1163
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:20,820
Well, he made a little oopsie.

1164
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,540
He made a little oopsie, and also I piss on God.

1165
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:28,420
I shit on his grave because it doesn't know what he's doing.

1166
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:35,940
No need for you to piss off all of our God-loving fans.

1167
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,700
No need for you to trample on my free speech by saying that.

1168
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,420
You're not allowed to say that.

1169
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:49,220
No, I think it's fun to trample on your free speech, Ben St, and I will do so forever.

1170
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,220
Sound by it, sound by it, sound by it.

1171
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:05,300
I had the 10 sessions four weeks apart for a while, and I was like, okay, they're over now.

1172
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:11,460
Now I don't have any more appointments coming up, and I liked that for a bit.

1173
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,340
It was like, okay, I don't have to go into that.

1174
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,900
But then my hair a little bit started coming through the top lip,

1175
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,100
and there's a bit under my chin.

1176
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,100
I was like, okay, this is starting to feel sucks.

1177
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:24,820
I don't like it.

1178
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,300
And so I was feeling a little down just because of I'd feel in it there and being like,

1179
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,580
I shave it and it comes back.

1180
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:35,460
It's just like how it was before, but the majority of the hair is gone forever.

1181
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,260
It's just little bits.

1182
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,060
So I finally sorted everything out because I had that hanging over my head.

1183
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:50,340
I had the pumpkin alley hotfix pumpkin patch that we were working on getting done quicker.

1184
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,460
And then there was the fucking, there's always a lot of ghost stuff to do.

1185
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,100
There was the ghosts to make the costume for the ghost plush.

1186
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,620
And so there's all these things going on.

1187
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:10,740
And I'm like, God, I just, ah, and it's a little overwhelming for a few weeks there.

1188
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,940
But I finally got the next appointment.

1189
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,980
I called them up.

1190
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:18,660
It was just one of those days where it's like, everything's fucked and I need to get this thing

1191
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:19,460
done.

1192
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,780
So I called them on the phone and I got an appointment and it was so easy.

1193
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:27,060
But it was like, I don't like calling on the phone.

1194
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:27,860
Is it expensive?

1195
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:36,100
For, they said for eight new sessions on the face and eight sessions on the arms,

1196
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,060
that comes to around like a thousand pounds.

1197
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:45,940
So it's, it's expensive, I guess, but I'm paying it off like in monthly installments.

1198
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:52,980
I feel that I can, that's worth just because it makes me feel so much better.

1199
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,340
Sure.

1200
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:02,180
But you know, expensive, patreon.com slash give and take.

1201
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,020
Yeah, sure.

1202
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:08,900
I remembered, by the way, I remembered how we got on the transracial thing.

1203
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,900
It was the white sal, the white lizard.

1204
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:15,140
That's, okay, okay.

1205
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,540
Yeah, that makes sense.

1206
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:25,060
Yeah, you, oh yeah, you should play the pumpkin patch, by the way, because it's not just the

1207
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:25,540
secrets.

1208
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:29,940
There's also the gameplay, the game feels a little different, maybe a little tighter.

1209
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,540
Do you want to mention what you changed?

1210
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:39,060
Um, I mean, the patch notes explain in quite a lot of detail what changed.

1211
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,140
But like, there's things like,

1212
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:51,460
yeah, see pumpkin alley, pumpkin patch, like devlog, if you scroll down, you'll see it on the page.

1213
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,860
Charlie, charlie-batten.itch.io.

1214
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,140
Yep.

1215
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,700
Here, oh yeah, pumpkin patch.

1216
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:00,980
Yeah.

1217
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,540
Oh, there's, it's quite, yeah, there's quite a few things here.

1218
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,020
Yeah, some of it's technical.

1219
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,700
If you don't know about things you might not understand, but like,

1220
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:14,580
we're just like listing the things we were working on and being like, okay, what literally is

1221
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,300
different, jumping is different in brief, jumping is different.

1222
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,900
There's like collision differences when getting up to an edge of a platform and like,

1223
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,700
like being stuck on the platform when you jump on it.

1224
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,060
There's a few animation changes.

1225
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,340
It's just sort of like cleaning it up based on what people were saying

1226
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,820
and what we already wanted to make look better.

1227
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,660
You can turn the camera higher up so you can look up more.

1228
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:51,060
And yeah, lots of little, no, no drastic new content.

1229
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,740
Some of the geometry has changed.

1230
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:54,580
Some of the decorations have been altered.

1231
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,620
And it's harder, not impossible, but it's harder to get out of bounds now.

1232
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:08,260
So the path forwards is more clear and like signpost, like you don't accidentally feel like

1233
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,740
you're going the right way when you're like going out of bounds and jumping on top of the hills.

1234
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,900
Removed a bit of clouds for performance, huh?

1235
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,540
That's interesting.

1236
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:22,260
Yeah, the clouds objects, there were two of them.

1237
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:27,780
But instead of like, they're like generating like, it's like a particle effect,

1238
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,340
but just really big particles on the clouds at the top.

1239
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:36,340
There were two of those to fit over the whole level, but we changed it to one.

1240
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,780
And then that one like tracks the position of the player and like,

1241
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,820
it only renders in a certain radius around where the player is.

1242
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,260
So that saves on performance.

1243
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:52,020
And then there was some other stuff like people in different language computers,

1244
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:55,140
the signs weren't like, they were translating strangely,

1245
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,980
or they just weren't showing the text.

1246
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,740
So there's lots of little glitches, hopefully those are all fixed.

1247
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,340
Opening the photo album didn't work for some people.

1248
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:12,500
And that's the gist anyway.

1249
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,700
My patch was much shorter than this.

1250
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:23,940
A couple of people have said that a couple of people have reported

1251
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:28,420
a like getting a soft lock in the Phantom's Revenge,

1252
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,580
but I have not, I have not been able to like duplicate the conditions

1253
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,500
that anyone has described it happening on there.

1254
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,260
Only two people have said it happened.

1255
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:39,780
And I have gotten and tried to do what they did to make it happen.

1256
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,220
I have not been able to do it.

1257
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,340
So there may be a bug in there somewhere.

1258
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,500
I just don't know what it is.

1259
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,780
If I ever identify it and what's causing like a small amount of people to get that.

1260
01:13:52,420 --> 01:14:00,260
You should definitely ask them what of course system, no, I mean like what computer they're using.

1261
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,260
If it changes randomly on different like operating systems.

1262
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:09,860
Well Keyblade said she was running the game,

1263
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,940
she launched the game from Steam, which is a thing I didn't know you could do.

1264
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,980
But she said probably that steam.

1265
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,900
Yeah, like she launched it through the Steam launcher.

1266
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:26,340
I guess you can like you can like tie non-Steam games to the Steam launcher.

1267
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,620
I just launched them through Steam.

1268
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:28,740
Weird.

1269
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,420
Yeah.

1270
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,340
So I don't know.

1271
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:34,900
She said maybe that might have something to do with it.

1272
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:40,740
I think some people have maybe, I think sometimes it's not actually a soft lock.

1273
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,980
It's just like the game gets a little stuck.

1274
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,420
And if you like wait a little bit or like you hit spacebar a couple times,

1275
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,860
the game will eventually advance.

1276
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:51,460
It just gets a little bit like hung up, which is bad.

1277
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,940
And if I knew how to, and if I knew what was causing that,

1278
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,580
I would fix that as well, even if it's not a soft lock.

1279
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,140
I haven't been able to replicate it.

1280
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:06,180
I think it's usually has to do with when Virginia dies and like

1281
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,860
the cutscene is trying to play of a phantom like being like, no, Virginia.

1282
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,860
I think that can sometimes cause a little bit of like,

1283
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,860
the cutscene can sort of like get stuck temporarily.

1284
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,380
But yeah, that seems to be what people have said.

1285
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:29,060
But again, I haven't duplicated it and I haven't figured out what has made that happen.

1286
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,660
So I haven't fixed it.

1287
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,500
I will if I ever get the chance.

1288
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,860
I can actually, I'm pretty curious about the pumpkin patch.

1289
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,220
I would like to boot it up and just like jump around a little bit

1290
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,740
and see like, does it feel any different?

1291
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,300
How much of a change do I notice?

1292
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,300
There was an aspect of the jumping where people,

1293
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,940
they didn't like how long they had to hold down the jump button

1294
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:57,940
to get the maximum height out of the first jump.

1295
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,780
So we changed that so that you don't have to hold it down quite so long.

1296
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:07,140
And the second jump is like a fixed amount.

1297
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:10,420
I don't know.

1298
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,740
I played it and it was like, this is better.

1299
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,420
This is like, it's hard to like define with words,

1300
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,260
but like it just feels better.

1301
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,380
It doesn't feel perfect.

1302
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,980
I'm sure there'll be tweaks we make before the finished game is finished.

1303
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,980
But this is good for the moment.

1304
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,620
Yeah, neat.

1305
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:28,980
Very cool.

1306
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:34,020
I'm gonna, I'll probably look through this whole list in more,

1307
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,340
in more detail later, because I'm interested.

1308
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,500
Various alley-oop problems fixed.

1309
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,780
Well, that's just not very helpful.

1310
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:47,540
Yeah, those things with her like falling through the floor,

1311
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,340
which should be mitigated.

1312
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,340
I think it still happens if you throw it hard enough.

1313
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:59,780
All right, I'm cracking open my second gridlock energy of the day.

1314
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:02,180
It's one, it's one of those days.

1315
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,740
It's a two gridlock morning, if you know what I mean.

1316
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:11,460
I, yes, I know what you mean.

1317
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,380
What? Oh.

1318
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,420
Oh, that's not a, that's not a gridlock.

1319
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,940
That's a, that's a bang, delish, strawberry kiss.

1320
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,580
Okay, that's fine.

1321
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:24,500
It's not, it's not what I was expecting.

1322
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,260
It just has a similar color can.

1323
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,460
Refreshing.

1324
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:37,300
Um, I got two stupid things on my stupid list.

1325
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,140
Here's one.

1326
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,540
I was playing, a funny thing happened.

1327
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,500
I was playing Hades.

1328
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:48,580
I was talking to some dudes the other day.

1329
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,060
Last weekend, I was talking to some dudes about Hades.

1330
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:58,580
Munchie had not played it, but some other people had and we were discussing it and

1331
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,180
we're talking about like the mythology stuff.

1332
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,220
And I said, I think Zagreus is like, Zagreus is like an original character

1333
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,860
for context.

1334
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:14,420
Zagreus is the protagonist of Hades and he is the son of the, of the titular Hades, the god guy.

1335
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,020
And I was, and I thought he was an original character for the game.

1336
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,860
Hades didn't have a son.

1337
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:22,100
Turns out he is not an original character.

1338
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:28,020
He is in like old Greek writings, like not very much, but he is there.

1339
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:35,220
But it's confusing because he is, he is sometimes called the son of Hades,

1340
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:40,900
but he is also sometimes called, he's also sometimes a,

1341
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,460
he's like the same as Dionysus.

1342
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:49,940
He's like some, he's like an aspect of Dionysus and,

1343
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:57,460
because like Zagreus is the son of Hades and Persephone and Dionysus is the son of Zeus and

1344
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:04,020
Persephone and like, I don't know, there's some, but all, but the one who, the one who is the

1345
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:10,580
Zagreus that is, is Dionysus was like killed by the Titans and eaten and like his parts were

1346
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:13,540
cooked in pots or some shit.

1347
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,300
There's like all the shit about Zagreus that just seems to be about a completely different

1348
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,140
guy.

1349
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,100
And I read this and I was like, well, that doesn't make any sense.

1350
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,180
Probably a different author's thing going on.

1351
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:26,820
I guess so.

1352
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:32,980
I'm just going to remember just fun facts that I remember off the top of my head from reading

1353
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,180
the Wikipedia article.

1354
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:39,220
The name, the name Zagre, okay, Artemis, when you find one of her boons in the game,

1355
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,700
she says Zagreus, your name means great hunter.

1356
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,420
Haha, they must have been thinking of me when they named you.

1357
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:51,540
And in fact, his name is not, does not mean great hunter.

1358
01:19:52,260 --> 01:20:01,300
It specifically means like, it means like pit trapper is a Zagre, a Zagre is a hole in the

1359
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,180
ground meant to trap live animals in.

1360
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:07,940
So yeah, his name means pit trapper.

1361
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:13,300
Dude, that's just like in Minecraft when you don't want your horse wandering off and you

1362
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,100
don't have a leash.

1363
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,860
Yeah, I dig a hole and put them in there.

1364
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,900
There, there you go.

1365
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,260
He's the god of doing that.

1366
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,380
So, so that's funny.

1367
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,100
Anyway, anyway, so I read this and I was like, well, that's weird.

1368
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,380
Anyway, now I know that.

1369
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:35,780
And funnily enough, right as I read that, like literally, okay, like the day before I had read

1370
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,940
that I had gotten a little cutscene in the game.

1371
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:44,580
I had found a boon of Dionysus and Dionysus said like, hey, Zag, Zag man, hey, why don't

1372
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,420
we play a little prank on Orpheus?

1373
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:51,620
Why don't we like spin him like a tall tale about how we're like connected or something?

1374
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:58,180
And then, and then after I read that wiki article, or the Wikipedia, not just any wiki,

1375
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:07,940
uh, there, there, there upon began a funny little sort of subplot where every time Zagreus would

1376
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:14,740
talk to Orpheus, he would tell him like, hey, so yeah, like, actually, you know, I was originally

1377
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:21,780
born of like a snake from Zeus, and you know, I was actually like torn apart by the Titans,

1378
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:26,740
and they ate my parts, except for my heart, and my heart actually grew into Dionysus.

1379
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:29,060
And like, we're actually kind of like the same God.

1380
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:32,340
And Orpheus is like, whoa, that's crazy.

1381
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,260
And, and Zagreus is like, lol, fooled him.

1382
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:44,660
So I felt like I read, I don't know, I was just like, haha, I have the context to get this joke

1383
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:47,540
now, because I read the Wikipedia article.

1384
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:54,580
That's a very, very, if I, I guess if I didn't know that, I would just think it was like a

1385
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:57,460
weird, funny, like, goofy thing that's in there.

1386
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:04,180
But now I know it's like, oh, this is, this is inspired by like a weird, like, inconsistency

1387
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,100
in these like ancient texts.

1388
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,340
Just thought that was pretty neat.

1389
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,820
Thought that was pretty neat.

1390
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,500
Timing on that was pretty convenient.

1391
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,220
Got that context right when I needed it.

1392
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:20,740
Boyo, um, Skelly calls you Boyo.

1393
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,660
He's a guy.

1394
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,380
There's a skeleton.

1395
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,780
Did you know there's a skeleton in the game, Gib?

1396
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,220
No, I've never would have a guess.

1397
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,380
You, there, believe it or not, there's a skeleton.

1398
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:34,500
There's a, there's a funny skeleton who, uh, who hangs out in your courtyard and some

1399
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,780
mysterious benefactor is paying him to stand there and let you beat the shit out of him

1400
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,420
over and over again to, to practice with your weapons.

1401
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,020
And he loves it.

1402
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,940
And he's your best friend.

1403
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:46,500
I got it.

1404
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,740
No, un, un, not joking.

1405
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:52,980
You know, he's like an NPC and you talk to him and he's really funny and I like him.

1406
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:57,380
I like maxed out my friendship with him and he gave me the thing that lets you,

1407
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,980
I didn't even realize this was a thing at all until he gave it to me.

1408
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,660
And I was like, I can't believe this.

1409
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,380
He, he gives me his like charm that lets me summon him in battle.

1410
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,380
And his like thing that he does in battle is he, he does what he does in real life is

1411
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:18,420
he just stands there and distracts your foes and your enemies just beat the shit out of him

1412
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,220
until he dies and that's his use.

1413
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,100
And I, I, I, unironically, which felt so heartwarming.

1414
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,420
I was like, I can't believe Skelly is here with me in, in battle.

1415
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,140
He's here and he's helping me in real life.

1416
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,180
I can't believe it.

1417
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:36,260
This is the most joyful thing.

1418
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:38,980
What a pro.

1419
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,740
A beautiful, beautiful moment.

1420
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,740
Uh, it's great.

1421
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,700
Skelly is great.

1422
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,700
And I think he turns out he's voiced by the same guy who voices Zagreus.

1423
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,180
And I really like Zag's voice actor.

1424
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,940
He, he, he sounds so, um, he sounds so dignified all the time.

1425
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:03,060
He's, he's, and then, you know, and then Skelly's just like, hey, hey, boy.

1426
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,420
Oh, hey, uh, hey, why don't you hit me right in the vertebrae there?

1427
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,980
Hey, give me, give me a shot right in the eye socket.

1428
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,180
Um, uh, and they're the same guy.

1429
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,420
And it's like, yeah, pretty good.

1430
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,140
The future.

1431
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,260
Huh?

1432
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,940
Future Zagreus.

1433
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:19,380
This is what happens to him.

1434
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:25,300
I unlocked, uh, I unlocked one of my, I unlocked the final aspect of one of my weapons.

1435
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,020
And, uh, it's the aspect of a future person.

1436
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:30,900
I won't say who it is.

1437
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,620
It's a spoiler.

1438
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,100
But it's a guy who doesn't even exist yet, but you unlock it and he's like, whoa,

1439
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:43,860
this is the, this is the blank weapon of blank, like a great king who doesn't even exist yet.

1440
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:49,700
But I'm channeling his future power into my weapon and it's awesome.

1441
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:51,700
I love Hades.

1442
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,620
Um, anyway, that's been a lot of fun.

1443
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:56,580
It's a good game.

1444
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,540
It's a good ass video, it's just a good ass video game if you ask me.

1445
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:04,020
Um, final thing on my stupid list.

1446
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:08,660
This is an annoying thing that happened with my stupid roommates who I don't even know at all.

1447
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:14,340
This guy, I think I might have, I think I might have alluded to this one guy who lives here,

1448
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:19,460
who every now and then will pass through the kitchen and mutter something about, hey, you know,

1449
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,860
I've got another letter from, uh, the guy who used to live here who says like,

1450
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,860
yeah, I guess the electric bills are like still in his name and like,

1451
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,100
you know, he wants us to like, you know, send him some money for that.

1452
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,540
So like, you know, maybe I'm going to do that soon.

1453
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:38,180
Okay, bye.

1454
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:42,980
Well, he finally, he finally, uh, he finally, what's the word?

1455
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:49,220
He finally dropped the hammer and he asked me like, hey, Ben, uh, you know, this guy,

1456
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:52,420
that guy, you know, he wants the money for the electric bill.

1457
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,460
I'm going to send him some money.

1458
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,940
Like, can you give me some money to send him?

1459
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,340
And he's just like, no, leave me alone.

1460
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,140
What are you talking about?

1461
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,700
Uh, he seemed, he seemed taken aback.

1462
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:10,260
He seemed, he seemed taken aback, I guess from his perspective.

1463
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:12,500
I don't know.

1464
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:17,060
Are you not paying the electric bill?

1465
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,300
Well, here, well, there's, well, here's the thing.

1466
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:19,940
Here's the thing.

1467
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:25,300
When I, when I moved in, the landlady says like here, there's no, she said, no,

1468
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,580
you don't have to pay a utility bill.

1469
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:30,260
You just pay the rent and whatever the internet costs, like you guys are

1470
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,260
responsible for your own internet bills.

1471
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,980
I don't provide internet, but she said, this is the rent, no utilities.

1472
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,700
I was like, okay.

1473
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:44,260
And then, uh, you know, and this, what this guy is always muttering about is like some,

1474
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:51,940
he says that like the guy who used to live in my room, a guy who I have never met,

1475
01:26:52,500 --> 01:27:01,540
he claims that for some reason the electric bills or the gas bills or the power bills

1476
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:13,540
are in his name and that he has been paying them for us, which doesn't make any sense.

1477
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:16,180
Because this guy is not related to the landlord.

1478
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:21,060
This guy is not like affiliated with the land.

1479
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,980
He's just a guy who used to live here.

1480
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,940
There's no, there's no reason why the bills would be in his name.

1481
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:31,460
And furthermore, I see the bills that show up on the counter and they're addressed to occupant.

1482
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:36,900
So I don't even think, I mean, I don't even have any evidence that this is even true,

1483
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,180
that this, that this guy I've never met, who I don't see why he would be involved at all,

1484
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,220
supposedly has these bills that are supposed to be for us and we should send him money about it.

1485
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,260
So to me, this guy is just asking me to pay money to a guy I don't know,

1486
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:58,580
that I was not supposed to have to pay for some mysterious bill that I've never seen.

1487
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,300
So like, of course, I'm not going to do it.

1488
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,980
But he seemed like, does this guy even exist?

1489
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,940
Maybe this guy is just asking for money in a roundabout way.

1490
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:09,220
I kind of think he is.

1491
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,220
I kind of think he's just scamming this other guy.

1492
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:19,700
And like, sorry, he seemed taken aback because he was like, he was like, well,

1493
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,460
you know, the bills in this other guy, yeah, the bills in his name, he keeps getting the bill.

1494
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,940
And I was like, well, let him pay it then.

1495
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:33,700
Honestly, like, why, why would the electric bill, why would the power bill for this building

1496
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:39,780
be a, be in the name of just a guy who lived here last year?

1497
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,740
Why, like, there's no reason it would be like that.

1498
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:45,300
Like, the landlady is, is responsible.

1499
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,020
And this, and this guy, this muttering guy is like, uh, he's like, oh, well,

1500
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,460
if we don't pay it, they'll shut the power off.

1501
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,700
Like they won't shut the fucking power off.

1502
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,580
The landlord is responsible for making sure the power doesn't shut off.

1503
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:01,620
If they shut the power off, if the landlord is so negligent in the power bill that they

1504
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,900
eventually, which I don't even think they're allowed to, I don't think they're like legally

1505
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:08,420
allowed to just shut the power off to a building, at least they would have to give everyone living

1506
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,460
their, like, notice.

1507
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:16,740
So if, if, but if the landlady was so, uh, derelict in her duties that the, they just

1508
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:20,340
shut the power off, I mean, that's something we take her to court over.

1509
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,540
Because she's responsible for making, for making this place livable.

1510
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:28,980
So there's no way that the power is just going to be shut off and it's, and it's going to be our fault.

1511
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:34,020
So, I don't know, he seemed taken aback.

1512
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:39,940
I, to me, it's unthinkable that I would have to pay for this.

1513
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:45,780
So we're, we're at an impasse here and there's, but there's no way that he can compel me to

1514
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,900
do what he wants me to do.

1515
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,860
So I win.

1516
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,500
Mucher is zero.

1517
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,900
Speak louder.

1518
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,020
I feel sorry for him.

1519
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,940
He seems like, he seems like kind of a nice guy.

1520
01:29:57,940 --> 01:29:59,940
And I think he's just, I think he's just getting scammed.

1521
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:04,340
But this is, but I, but I, this is what I've said to him in the, in the past when he's brought

1522
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:10,020
up this bill thing, I've, I've, I've said to him, like, I don't know why this guy is even involved.

1523
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,660
Like, why are you, you even talking to this guy?

1524
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,620
Like, why is he like, I, this doesn't make any sense.

1525
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:16,900
Like it seems weird.

1526
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,220
Why is this our responsibility at all?

1527
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,740
Et cetera, et cetera.

1528
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,220
So it's not like this was like, it's, it's not like this was the first time I've expressed like,

1529
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,060
this seems weird and I don't really get it.

1530
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,340
It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense to me.

1531
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,380
But, I don't know.

1532
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,620
I was like, he was, I was like, let him pay it.

1533
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:37,220
And he was like, wow, dude.

1534
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:37,620
Wow.

1535
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,340
Like, huh, that's so callus of you.

1536
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,180
Oh, that's so, like,

1537
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:47,620
Oh no, I don't want to be known as callus.

1538
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,740
Like whatever, man.

1539
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,700
Some nonsense.

1540
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:58,660
But I, I doubt I'll, I doubt I'll be hearing about it again, because like there's just

1541
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:07,140
there's just no, there's just no further, there's just no further anything to say about that.

1542
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,140
I'm just, it's just nonsense.

1543
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,260
It's just not going anywhere.

1544
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,060
But it was annoying.

1545
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,620
It's annoying.

1546
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:14,820
And it had been building for a while because he even mentioned it.

1547
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:17,220
And I, I could, I could sense, I could sense.

1548
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:18,340
He started talking to me this time.

1549
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,460
I was like, this is the time.

1550
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:20,740
This is the time the hammer's dropping.

1551
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,220
He's finally going to actually just come right out and be like,

1552
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,660
hey, give me money for this thing.

1553
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,300
And you know what?

1554
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,740
I like, and I killed him.

1555
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:29,300
He's dead.

1556
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:30,740
Nice.

1557
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,340
I buried him under the parking lot.

1558
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:38,820
I buried, I buried him in the construction site in the, in the building that they're building

1559
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:42,740
across the parking lot from my back lot.

1560
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,620
He's going to, he's just going to be in the floor there.

1561
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,540
He's, they're pouring the concrete.

1562
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,220
So he's going to be in, in there.

1563
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,900
I'm going to save him a little bit of concrete money.

1564
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:52,660
That's going to be good.

1565
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,940
Anyway, that's what, anyway, that's what happened.

1566
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:00,020
And that's what happens.

1567
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,900
And if you don't believe me, then fuck you.

1568
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,020
Yeah.

1569
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:10,500
Yeah.

1570
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:10,980
Yeah.

1571
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,460
Okay.

1572
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:11,860
All right.

1573
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,660
Well, that was my week.

1574
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,180
That was my week too.

1575
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:18,180
Nothing happened.

1576
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:18,980
Nothing happened.

1577
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:22,580
Nothing happened, but we sure did talk for an hour and a half, but you know,

1578
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:23,700
that's not even that long.

1579
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,340
That's nothing.

1580
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:25,700
No.

1581
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,660
You want to go to voicemails?

1582
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,340
Uh, yeah.

1583
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,460
I just got a P.

1584
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:29,700
Sure.

1585
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,180
I'm back.

1586
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:36,180
I think I heard your mom.

1587
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:39,860
Yeah, his food, but I'll get it later.

1588
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,220
Is she Irish?

1589
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:42,900
No.

1590
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,060
Did she sound Irish?

1591
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,140
I mean, it was a little hard to hear.

1592
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:52,980
I thought, I thought maybe a little bit, but uh, I guess what do I know?

1593
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,420
Where is she from?

1594
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:56,660
England.

1595
01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:58,900
I mean, like, yeah, but which part?

1596
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:10,180
Oh, uh, fucking, uh, Cheltenham, which is like south, south, it's sort of a posh-ish area,

1597
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:10,900
south England.

1598
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:14,820
All right.

1599
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:15,140
Okay.

1600
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,620
It was a bit, I mean, it was a bit kind of like in and out, like just barely breaking the,

1601
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:22,180
the, uh, you know, the noise gate.

1602
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,140
Yeah, the noise gate.

1603
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,220
Uh, anyway, that was, that was funny.

1604
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,180
Hi.

1605
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:31,620
Hi, Gib.

1606
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:31,940
Hi.

1607
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:35,300
Uh, you're gonna come down, you're gonna come down for dinner.

1608
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,660
Faith and, faith and begota.

1609
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:38,820
No.

1610
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:43,060
You're gonna come down and kiss the Blarney Stone, Gib.

1611
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:49,140
No, don't you dare insinuate my mother is Irish.

1612
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,700
Yeah, don't insinuate-

1613
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:50,980
On Mother's Day.

1614
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:52,660
Don't insinuate she's not white.

1615
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,500
Of all day long.

1616
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:56,500
Is today Mother's Day?

1617
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,260
For me it is.

1618
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:58,660
Right.

1619
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:01,780
In May, May 8th in America, right?

1620
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,700
Different, different days.

1621
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,100
Different.

1622
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:08,420
Did you hear that they, I think that I heard that like they, they canceled

1623
01:34:08,420 --> 01:34:10,820
daylight savings time in America?

1624
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,140
Fucking cancel culture.

1625
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,940
Yeah, I think I saw like articles that like,

1626
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,140
yeah, they, they, or no, no, they didn't cancel it.

1627
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,260
They made it permanent.

1628
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:28,820
So it will never, it will never stop being daylight savings time ever again.

1629
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:34,500
Uh, well, whatever.

1630
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,820
I guess I'll hear about that when it relates to me.

1631
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,940
Uh, right.

1632
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,700
Well, I don't know, like, they just heard about this, like immediately after daylight

1633
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,220
savings time, like a couple weeks ago, and I think, I'm sure next time it's

1634
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,820
supposed to be daylight savings time, I will either hear,

1635
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,420
yes, they really did cancel daylight savings time.

1636
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:56,980
It's actually gone finally.

1637
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:01,300
Or, oh yeah, no, it's, it's actually not gone.

1638
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:02,980
Sorry, everyone.

1639
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,540
It was almost gone, but then they were like, no, we were just kidding.

1640
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:07,300
It'll be one or the other.

1641
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:12,180
Breath, breathless thing pieces about why either one is the case.

1642
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:17,060
Um, let's, let's listen to, you want to just listen to

1643
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,900
them on speak pipe this time?

1644
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,660
Sure.

1645
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:21,060
Okay.

1646
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:26,900
It's, I always get like fucked up, like moving the files into discord.

1647
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,180
Oh, and logged out.

1648
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:29,300
What's the password?

1649
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:34,260
Uh, here I'll just, let me just say it out loud.

1650
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,820
No, it's so secretive.

1651
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:42,980
Let me just post a, let me just post a screenshot of the password in this discord

1652
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:48,980
server where people other than our trusted confidants live.

1653
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,460
We should have, I should have another guest on a mentioned cyber cyber shell.

1654
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:58,900
I asked him if you wanted to be on last week and he said he could not make it,

1655
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:00,340
but he would be on soon.

1656
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:03,300
Did not ask him again this week, although I would like to have him on again soon.

1657
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,180
I kind of like to get snake back on because I thought snake was pretty cool.

1658
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:11,380
You know, yeah, you know, this is, um, here's something that fucked me up.

1659
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,540
I was reading some of those.

1660
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,580
I don't know if this is insane.

1661
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:15,460
I don't know who's crazy.

1662
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,500
One of us is crazy.

1663
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:20,900
Not you or me, me or the person whose article I was reading,

1664
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:25,700
an article about like how to, how to push your game, get your game seen by people.

1665
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,460
I think this was specifically in reference to like telling

1666
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:32,980
YouTubers about your game to try and get your game seen by influencers.

1667
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:39,700
This, this article said like, send them, you know, send them a, send them an email.

1668
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,540
Don't inundate them, send them an email and then if they don't answer,

1669
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,860
maybe send them one or two gentle reminders.

1670
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:50,020
And if they don't answer after that, you know, you should assume that they're just not interested.

1671
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,340
Um, but they said like, don't like bother them.

1672
01:36:54,340 --> 01:36:58,660
Don't annoy them with like, you know, don't inundate them with emails.

1673
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:08,740
Maybe send one every, you know, don't send more than like one a week or something.

1674
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,540
And like, I don't know.

1675
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:17,780
That just seems like to me, one a week seems like really fast.

1676
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,500
Really fast?

1677
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,500
Yeah, my, my, my, I don't know.

1678
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,140
To me, it's like, damn, you only waited a week.

1679
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,460
Like, fuck you.

1680
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,060
Like, I, like, I don't know.

1681
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,500
I would, I guess I just, my timetable would be slower.

1682
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,780
I would think like, if I don't want to bother someone, like I wouldn't, I wouldn't,

1683
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:39,460
I wouldn't write them back for like at least a month.

1684
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,820
I think would be my instinct.

1685
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:47,460
But I guess it depends on like how, like how big the person is.

1686
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:53,780
If they're like, like physically unable to respond to so many things.

1687
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,940
And then like, oh, yes, I was going to get around to that.

1688
01:37:57,940 --> 01:38:00,180
And like, they just need our reminder, literal.

1689
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:05,460
Or it could be, if you don't want to bother them, I feel like if, if you post,

1690
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,660
like you put an email, they don't read it because they're not interested.

1691
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,260
And then you give another email after a week.

1692
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,660
Well, then it would feel like too quick.

1693
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:18,740
But I feel like even after a month, like what would be different?

1694
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,020
Yeah.

1695
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,380
They didn't care about it the first time.

1696
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:29,540
The more I think about it, the more I think that I'm, yeah, that I'm being silly.

1697
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,620
Like, like, yeah, why, why wait more than a week?

1698
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:37,220
If you, if you wait a month to follow up and then you wait another month,

1699
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:40,340
they'll just have forgotten about the original email.

1700
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:41,940
Yeah.

1701
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,740
If they, you know, assuming they ever saw it in the first place.

1702
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:49,540
So I'm, hmm, I don't know.

1703
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:54,260
You're giving them like time to get around to seeing it.

1704
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:54,500
Yeah.

1705
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,780
And a month is like a lot of time.

1706
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:02,260
They would need to be like a super, like they would need to be so big that they wouldn't

1707
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,820
really read all of their own emails.

1708
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:07,060
They would have like a secretary.

1709
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:10,740
They're like a million sub-youtuber and they get like a thousand emails a day.

1710
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:15,380
I actually don't know if people send emails these days, but like I assume they still happen.

1711
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:24,260
They do, but like, it's for like, it's like press stuff, press release stuff.

1712
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:24,500
Yeah.

1713
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,620
I don't think.

1714
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,300
Human beings don't send emails anymore.

1715
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,420
I think probably, yeah, probably less.

1716
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:35,380
I think people mess, message each other in various ways, more, more so.

1717
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,100
At least young people do.

1718
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:40,900
Okay.

1719
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,660
Anyway, let's get the, let's get the voicemails.

1720
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:47,780
Uh, first voicemail of the day is called, uh, niggle me this.

1721
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,140
Are you ready?

1722
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:50,900
Yes.

1723
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,420
Three, two, one, go.

1724
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:58,740
What is 13 yet 51, Mr. Saint Man?

1725
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:01,620
What is 13 yet 51?

1726
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:07,220
Like 13 years old and 51 kills in Halo.

1727
01:40:11,780 --> 01:40:13,860
I don't know what that is from reference to.

1728
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,340
What is 13 yet 51?

1729
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:18,980
I have, I have no idea.

1730
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,060
Wait, is this a racist thing?

1731
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:27,540
Oh, wait, is this, is this like a, is this like a crime statistics or like a, an IQ distribution thing?

1732
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:29,300
I think this is a racism.

1733
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,700
I think, I think we just did a racism.

1734
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,100
I like my 13 year old Halo player.

1735
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:38,500
Yeah.

1736
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,700
I'll call it a new player better.

1737
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,460
I, I genuinely, I don't know what, it's something like that.

1738
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:47,780
I, you know what, I could probably figure it out if I thought about it, but I won't.

1739
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,500
Um, next, uh, next one is how's paradise?

1740
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,980
Three, two, one, go.

1741
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:56,180
All right.

1742
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:58,420
Funny, dumb racism aside.

1743
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:01,460
How is wrapping up rad con for stuff?

1744
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:07,380
The only reason I ask is cause you know, it's just a little over two years since those faded times

1745
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,900
and I haven't tuned in in a while.

1746
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,100
So I'm curious.

1747
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:14,740
I feel like I, I feel like I talked about this last week and maybe if you had listened.

1748
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:15,780
Yeah.

1749
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:20,020
I talked about this, uh, Nate is, Nate keeps saying he's going to do,

1750
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:25,460
Nate keeps saying he's going to do the, um, the, the music video.

1751
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,060
He said he would do it last month.

1752
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:28,500
He didn't do it.

1753
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:32,980
And then he said, okay, for sure Friday, he didn't do it Friday.

1754
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:35,300
And then he said, okay, I didn't do it for it, but I'll do it for Sunday.

1755
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:36,820
Today is Sunday.

1756
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:37,940
We're recording on Sunday.

1757
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:43,060
So later today, I guess I'll ask him, hey, do it.

1758
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:45,940
I have no doubt he will eventually do it.

1759
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:49,700
Um, anyway, he's got to do, he's got to do that.

1760
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:55,860
And then there's the, the OVA needs to be edited, which, uh, is the biggest thing.

1761
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,500
And then I mentioned this before.

1762
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:05,060
I hope this is, no, this is, this is not a, this is not a thing that Kaiju Koon is responsible

1763
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:07,860
for yet because he has not accepted any money.

1764
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:14,980
But I, I hope that if Kaiju Koon gets some time free, he will, uh, take on the job of

1765
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:20,660
finishing the, uh, the dojin, uh, because I don't know who else can do it.

1766
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:24,340
Uh, because the other guy bailed.

1767
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,980
The other guy, the other guy fucking, they, they bailed.

1768
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,100
They japed us.

1769
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,780
They japed, they japed pretty hard.

1770
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,220
Anyway, that's, that's the answer.

1771
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:42,100
Um, next one is called T-Bap from Gibby Wibby Cutie Woody at itsthetruth.com.

1772
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,460
Three, two, one, go.

1773
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,580
Two best buddies, bitch about pirates.

1774
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:49,620
Yeah.

1775
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:55,300
T-Bap, the Ben St. Gibb and take pirate podcast.

1776
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,380
That's what I, what did I say last week?

1777
01:42:57,380 --> 01:43:03,220
I said, um, two, whatever.

1778
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,260
I said something else.

1779
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:08,660
I thought you said something to like the podcast, but like the same.

1780
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:12,020
I, I made, I made a T-Bap joke about a different acronym.

1781
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:12,420
I did.

1782
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,540
I don't remember what it was.

1783
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:17,460
And then I said, oh, the deep, the depo cast was my joke from last week.

1784
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:20,500
Cause what?

1785
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:20,900
Why not?

1786
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:24,100
Um, next one is called I found your secret Ben.

1787
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,380
Three, two, one, go.

1788
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,260
Um, hello, Ben.

1789
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:28,820
Yes.

1790
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:30,980
I know your secret.

1791
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:33,220
I read the flight records.

1792
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:36,740
Ben saying, I know, I know.

1793
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:41,460
I saw you, you and Mr. Epstein quite close.

1794
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:42,100
Or are you not?

1795
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:49,460
I believe that, I believe that, um, your, your brother will want to hear this.

1796
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:51,380
No, don't tell him.

1797
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,660
Then he'll, then he'll never finish the music video.

1798
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,300
Okay.

1799
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:00,740
You got me.

1800
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:03,540
So such mirth, such glee in those words.

1801
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,420
He loved it.

1802
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:07,220
He, he, he won me over honestly.

1803
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:12,900
His enthusiasm for me being on the Epstein flight was just infectious.

1804
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:14,900
Okay.

1805
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,820
Next one is called a song.

1806
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:18,260
Three, two, one, go.

1807
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:25,620
Ben saying, I'm going to come to your house.

1808
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:30,580
You better start running.

1809
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:43,700
Okay, I'm running.

1810
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,340
That's a good song.

1811
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:46,980
A good song.

1812
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,100
Good song.

1813
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:50,020
Uh, intro song?

1814
01:44:50,020 --> 01:44:50,580
I don't know.

1815
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,580
I don't know if it's quite, I don't know if it's quite at that level.

1816
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:56,900
Um, next one is called congratulations.

1817
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,180
Three, two, one, go.

1818
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:03,700
Congratulations on another shit on my desk yearly.

1819
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:04,580
Great.

1820
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,260
Yeah.

1821
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:06,660
Yes.

1822
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:09,540
Hit both, hit your, your give and take.

1823
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:10,820
That's right.

1824
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:11,460
That's true.

1825
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,020
That's your name.

1826
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,460
That's my name.

1827
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:22,580
Uh, yeah.

1828
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,460
Um.

1829
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:23,700
Yeah.

1830
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:25,700
Another shit on my desk yearly came out.

1831
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,540
It's number six.

1832
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,980
How many more of those are there?

1833
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:33,380
I believe there are nine in total.

1834
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,860
And that's was what, yeah, number six.

1835
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,380
So, wow.

1836
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,940
It'll be entertaining us for years to come.

1837
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:41,140
Yep.

1838
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,580
Ah, hmm.

1839
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:52,820
I just had a weird sensation in my face and I'm wondering,

1840
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,420
am I having a stroke?

1841
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:55,780
Probably.

1842
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:58,500
Okay.

1843
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,300
Next one is called Dublin Wild.

1844
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:03,620
Three, two, one, go.

1845
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:08,980
Hi, uh, Ben Gibb, whoever the fuck else is around.

1846
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:14,740
I've been skulking around RFCK for a while and I kind of just

1847
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:19,620
wanted to call in and thank y'all because, uh, slime and

1848
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:24,180
punishment and Lord of Ghosts kind of lit a fire under me to

1849
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:29,620
like start drawing and so I've started drawing and it's all

1850
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,060
shit, but it makes me happy.

1851
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:33,300
So, uh, thanks, everyone.

1852
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,820
Well, shucks, uh, cool.

1853
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,580
That's good.

1854
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:41,620
Good for you.

1855
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:47,380
Keep at it if you like it and, uh, you will certainly, uh, get

1856
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:52,740
better and, uh, that will probably be gratifying and, uh, who

1857
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,020
knows what the future may hold.

1858
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:55,300
That's cool.

1859
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:57,940
Okay.

1860
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,900
Thank you for the voice.

1861
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,820
Wow, a sincere, a sincere voicemail.

1862
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:01,620
That's fucked up.

1863
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:01,940
It is.

1864
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,860
Oh, how are we supposed to, what are we supposed to do with

1865
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:04,260
that?

1866
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,140
Just say thanks.

1867
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:06,980
That wasn't even a little bit racist.

1868
01:47:06,980 --> 01:47:07,860
Not even as a joke.

1869
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:09,540
What?

1870
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,340
Okay.

1871
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,900
Next one is called Slime and Punishment, Physical

1872
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,500
Release and Phantom's Revenge.

1873
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:15,780
Three, two, one, go.

1874
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:19,380
Hey, Ben, what are you going to do about the game when you

1875
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:23,060
release the physical release of Slime and Punishment?

1876
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,780
Yeah.

1877
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,860
Are you going to do like the Homestuck books did where

1878
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:28,020
they took like screenshots of all their games and like,

1879
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,340
but like text underneath explaining stuff?

1880
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:34,900
Or are you just going to have like a big splash page where it

1881
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,420
says like, uh, okay.

1882
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,380
And then the game happens.

1883
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:39,220
And then go and play my game now.

1884
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,220
What are you going to do, Ben?

1885
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:42,020
What are you going to do?

1886
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:42,740
It's a good question.

1887
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,180
Mostly I'm just looking forward to reading that index

1888
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:48,100
because there's so much in that comic where I'm just like,

1889
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:50,020
what, what does any of this mean?

1890
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,540
I don't even know what, yeah.

1891
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:54,900
The index is going to be a work unto itself.

1892
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:59,620
I haven't even finished like finalizing like the page layout yet.

1893
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:04,340
I think I'm, this week, I think I should actually like pick a

1894
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:09,220
layout, order a sample copy and like get that process underway.

1895
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,740
But, uh, yeah.

1896
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:15,140
So for the game, I thought about this and I think what I'm

1897
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:19,940
going to do is the game is basically indispensable to the

1898
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,420
comic.

1899
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:23,540
Like the game is like a very important part of the story.

1900
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:26,500
I can't like, I can't just like cut away and be like,

1901
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,460
and then go play the game.

1902
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:31,140
So what I think I'm going to do, and I think this will look cool,

1903
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:34,020
I'll think it'll be good, is I will just have,

1904
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:37,140
I will just have a series of screenshots from the game that

1905
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,380
just sort of tell the story of the game.

1906
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:43,460
And what I'll do for like dialogue scenes, uh, is I,

1907
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:48,340
when possible, I will just have like, I mean, imagine, for

1908
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:50,820
instance, the, the initial, you know, when Phantom meets the

1909
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:56,020
first Sonichu, right, it'll just be like the screenshot of

1910
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:58,100
him just, they'll just looking at each other.

1911
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,740
And then underneath, I will just have the text boxes as

1912
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,700
displayed in the game.

1913
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,820
And I will just show, like in a, basically, probably just in

1914
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:08,660
like a vertical row, like all the text boxes in sequence of

1915
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:11,300
like, you know, Phantom says this, Sonichu says this,

1916
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:15,140
but, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know, those, I will,

1917
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:19,060
I will use, I will use screenshots as necessary.

1918
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:22,740
And then I will just show text boxes in sequence to show,

1919
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,820
like, this is, this is the dialogue.

1920
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,980
That, that's my idea.

1921
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:31,860
And I'm gonna mess around with it and see how I can make it work.

1922
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,020
That's the plan.

1923
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:34,580
Good question.

1924
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:38,020
Um, I think it'll look pretty cool, honestly.

1925
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:41,620
It'll be, I think it'll work pretty well, actually.

1926
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:44,740
It'll just be like reading a comic, but just, you know,

1927
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:47,460
the panels just look like a video game, but it will be

1928
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:48,580
Yeah.

1929
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:50,500
perfectly comprehensible, I think.

1930
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,340
And I'm kind of excited for that, actually.

1931
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:55,380
Um, yeah.

1932
01:49:56,180 --> 01:50:00,740
Something I'm not excited for is getting the, the, the video S

1933
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:05,460
revert into a book form, because I feel like it's going to be,

1934
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:15,620
annoying to screenshot the video to get like images for the

1935
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:19,460
book, because the, you know, the, um, I don't know if I'm going to

1936
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,180
use the right word for this, but the video is all like, you

1937
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:23,140
know, interpolated.

1938
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:28,340
So like frame by frame, you know, there might be like blur in

1939
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:28,820
between.

1940
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:32,100
Like if something is moving, there might be blur or like, what

1941
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:34,340
do you call it when you kind of see two frames at once as it's

1942
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:35,860
transitioning from one to the other?

1943
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:36,660
I, I don't know.

1944
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:37,300
Well, that's cool.

1945
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:38,340
But yeah, you know that.

1946
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:38,900
Yeah, that.

1947
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:42,900
So, um, I feel like it might result in poor image quality, which

1948
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,900
would be have the original, like,

1949
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,620
editing file for that.

1950
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:48,980
I have all the assets.

1951
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:52,660
But I would have, God, I mean, I guess I could do it.

1952
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:56,420
It would be a real hassle to like, just take the original assets and

1953
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,700
just put them in like, manga studio and just move them around and

1954
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,700
compose them into recreations of frames from the video.

1955
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,660
I mean, I could do that.

1956
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:08,180
But like, how was it created in the first place?

1957
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:11,780
Do you have like a, an Adobe Premiere file that you could like?

1958
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,260
Vegas.

1959
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,100
Vegas.

1960
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:18,340
Like, could you not like, just scrum through that and find a frame that

1961
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:20,180
isn't like, interpolated?

1962
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:21,460
Hmm.

1963
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:24,660
And then like, export frame.

1964
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:27,300
Like, that's usually a thing you can do in editing software.

1965
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,500
You know, you know what?

1966
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:30,820
Possibly.

1967
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,380
Yeah, I might possibly be able to do that.

1968
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,820
I, it's, it's a Vegas file.

1969
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:37,460
Vegas is a little bit feature light, but they'll probably,

1970
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:38,900
there's probably a way to do that.

1971
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:41,300
I think so.

1972
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:42,820
That's, that's a good.

1973
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,500
It's a good idea.

1974
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,260
I didn't, hmm.

1975
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:46,500
Yeah.

1976
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:50,660
I might do that if the, yeah.

1977
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:50,900
All right.

1978
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,540
That's an option.

1979
01:51:52,980 --> 01:51:53,380
All right.

1980
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:56,260
Next one is called a message for cyber.

1981
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,420
Well, it's shell, but it's got an apostrophe between the E and the L.

1982
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:02,100
So I guess it would be cyber shield.

1983
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:04,820
Three, two, one, go.

1984
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,180
Cyber shield.

1985
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:07,220
I heard you give me on this week.

1986
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,820
I got a very important message for you.

1987
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,540
Here, one second.

1988
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,140
Let me just do my voice together.

1989
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:16,020
I'm sorry.

1990
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,260
He said he would be on soon.

1991
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:21,780
Uh, sorry about that.

1992
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:22,820
Uh, whoops.

1993
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:30,820
Next one is called a daemon Targaryen from the rogue prince at westeros.gov.

1994
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:32,180
Three, two, one, go.

1995
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:42,900
Now, there's a joke that nobody's going to get.

1996
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:46,020
Um, I, yeah, I don't get it.

1997
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:52,660
Uh, uh, press Preston Jacobs in some of his older videos when he was talking

1998
01:52:52,660 --> 01:53:00,660
about like Westeros history, he just has a joke where anytime he mentions daemon Targaryen,

1999
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:05,380
he, he refers to, I guess he just thinks daemon Targaryen is a bad ass or the books

2000
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:07,380
just treat daemon Targaryen as a bad ass.

2001
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:13,780
So he, he always, he always refers to him as daemon Targaryen, the rogue prince.

2002
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:17,940
And then he plays that little music sting as like a panning shot up to daemon Targaryen's

2003
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,740
face plays.

2004
01:53:20,740 --> 01:53:24,340
It's, it's in like one or two of his, his older, uh, series.

2005
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,220
So I appreciated that voicemail.

2006
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:30,420
Uh, daemon Targaryen.

2007
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,020
The rogue prince.

2008
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,260
Uh, next one is called Twilight Roaster.

2009
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,700
Three, two, one, go.

2010
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:08,980
I need, what, what's, what would be the, what's the point?

2011
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:13,620
What's the point of, first of all, I mean, if it's always the same number of frames,

2012
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,180
then the damage is consistent.

2013
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:21,940
Whoa, the, the, they're tied together.

2014
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:27,060
They're tied together so they don't become dis-coupled from each other, which,

2015
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:32,500
I mean, what if your computer slows down and the frames are different?

2016
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,100
Well, if it's, if they're slowed down, it will still render the same number of frames.

2017
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,060
We'll just do it slower.

2018
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:43,860
Uh, I guess.

2019
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:49,940
I mean, some, some things that, I know that in some games, things tied to frame rate

2020
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:56,820
mean that if anything affects the frame rate, such as a, uh, like a computer, um,

2021
01:54:56,820 --> 01:55:02,420
like being unable to, to run quickly enough, it makes, it changes the gameplay,

2022
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,260
not just like visually what's happening.

2023
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:12,020
Well, unless like, unless like Game Maker just like automatically does such a thing,

2024
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:16,420
there's no such feature in Phantom's Revenge.

2025
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:20,900
So it, it shouldn't make a difference.

2026
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:25,460
Uh, it shouldn't, it shouldn't skip any frames or change the,

2027
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,580
change the outcome in any significant way.

2028
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:30,980
Uh, I guess I don't know.

2029
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:33,780
It's possible that there's something going on that I'm not aware of.

2030
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,900
Uh, I mean,

2031
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:44,740
I mean the, the damage ticker, like, I mean, I don't know, just see,

2032
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:49,140
it just seemed like the easiest way to do it, to make the damage ticker move in real time,

2033
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:54,980
is to just have the damage be dealt in one frame increments and have the timer update

2034
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:57,060
in real time.

2035
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:00,340
The, Ben, you solved the problem one way.

2036
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:02,500
Why didn't you solve the problem other way?

2037
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:04,100
The, shout out.

2038
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:05,140
Fuck you.

2039
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:06,100
Fuck voicemails.

2040
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:10,820
Um, next one is a YouTube video.

2041
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,860
I'm gonna look at what the YouTube video is.

2042
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:16,180
It's a three-minute video.

2043
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,700
Oh, it's a transistor sound.

2044
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:23,620
Transistor original soundtrack, old friends from Supergiant Games.

2045
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:26,340
Okay, uh, let me just listen to the voicemail.

2046
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,700
Three, two, one, go.

2047
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:36,420
Guys, I'm not a big fan of Bash or even Hayes, but you must play Transistor.

2048
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,180
The game is super short.

2049
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:41,700
Only six hours long, but the vibes are immaculate.

2050
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,180
Immaculate.

2051
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:46,100
If you like the song attached, this will be some of the best six hours of your life.

2052
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,420
Also, this game has sword marriage too, wink, wink.

2053
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:48,900
Oh, right.

2054
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:50,660
Very good.

2055
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:59,540
Hmm, you know, I agree that a six hour game is a short game,

2056
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:04,020
but I think of myself playing it, and I'm like, this is not gonna take six hours.

2057
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:10,020
And, uh, I don't even really play games for six hours at a time.

2058
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:14,820
Like, not always, unless I'm really into it.

2059
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:17,380
Uh, I mean, um...

2060
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,020
Pfft, duh.

2061
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:28,420
I guess, uh, I guess since I like Hayes so much, I guess I would consider taking a look at Transistor.

2062
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:30,820
Uh, I mean, I would play it.

2063
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:31,860
I'm not against it.

2064
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:36,820
I would, I mean, I definitely play in six hour bursts commonly, so that's not a,

2065
01:57:36,820 --> 01:57:37,940
that's not a problem for me.

2066
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:39,460
I might be able to finish it in one sitting.

2067
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:43,700
Um, um, uh, I mean, it's a...

2068
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:49,460
But I'm gonna listen to like two seconds of the, of the...

2069
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:52,260
Game sounds pretty good.

2070
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:54,260
Music sounds pretty good.

2071
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:56,660
I thought of something.

2072
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:57,940
I had a, I had a thought.

2073
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,100
This is, let me tell you my funny joke that I thought in my head and didn't tell anyone.

2074
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:06,180
Uh, last, last week I was talking about the music in Hayes, and I said,

2075
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:10,340
there's some kind of, you know, there's that something, something sorta guitar.

2076
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:12,260
And you said, you asked Spanish?

2077
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:13,460
Like, is it Spanish guitar?

2078
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,540
And I was thinking about that.

2079
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:19,940
And I, and I, the joke that I wish I had made at the time is what it killed

2080
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:26,100
is I should have said, I don't know a Spanish guitar from a Mexican pizza.

2081
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,060
Right? Killer, right?

2082
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:33,940
Uh, I don't get it, but yeah.

2083
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:35,940
Smashing, smashing.

2084
01:58:36,580 --> 01:58:39,860
Um, anyway, I might, I might play Transistor.

2085
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:40,740
I might, I might.

2086
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:42,900
Um, I just got a comment.

2087
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:46,340
I just got a comment on my YouTube channel.

2088
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:48,660
This is, this is not a voicemail, but let me read this comment.

2089
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:56,260
I think it's, Brendan J says, Hey Ben, as much as I like this video and the subject matter,

2090
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:59,300
I cannot in good faith subscribe or recommend your content.

2091
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,780
Why did you say the N word?

2092
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:06,260
I suspect it is because you were in a space where you, one, felt very comfortable using

2093
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:10,660
this offensive slur, two, knew no one would call you out on your behavior.

2094
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:14,180
You could have just said N word or even F word.

2095
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:16,180
Wait, what?

2096
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:18,740
That's okay.

2097
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,060
All right.

2098
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:19,460
Whatever.

2099
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:19,700
Okay.

2100
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:24,420
Anyway, I don't think you're a bad person or regularly engage in shitty behavior like this.

2101
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:29,220
It's just the level of ease you express using these slurs makes me uncomfortable.

2102
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,420
Thank you for the laughs.

2103
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:34,980
Uh, I think, okay.

2104
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:38,820
I just, this just popped up on my dash, my desktop and I was like, okay, I want to look at this.

2105
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:41,860
Uh, what do you, what do you think?

2106
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:43,780
Do we kill this guy?

2107
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,500
I'm going to kill him.

2108
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,140
That's not true.

2109
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:45,700
I'm joking.

2110
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:53,300
I mean, the people are free to decide whether to recommend a person.

2111
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,340
So like, I don't know.

2112
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:54,660
Yeah.

2113
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:59,300
This, I will, I agree that this person is right in hindsight.

2114
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:01,300
I could have, I could have just said N word.

2115
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:05,380
And in fact, I kind of think I should, I think I should have, if I were going back,

2116
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:09,940
I think I would just say N word because I'm pretty sure tales gets trolled,

2117
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:14,900
prints it with, I'm not sure if it originally printed it with asterisks,

2118
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:18,740
but like now when you read it, it's got N, like asterisks, asterisks, asterisks,

2119
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:20,900
R, I think.

2120
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:23,460
So they're talking about a specific time.

2121
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:25,060
I don't know if it originally did like sure.

2122
02:00:25,780 --> 02:00:25,940
Yeah.

2123
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:26,180
Yeah.

2124
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:29,620
In the, in the tales gets from, because you know, there's the, there's the words of power

2125
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:34,180
that cause you, um, oh, I see that, that kill your enemies and the N word is the ultimate one.

2126
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:37,540
I think it just kills you instantly or it kills your enemy instantly.

2127
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:41,860
It kills yourself instantly if you say the ultimate word of power.

2128
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:44,820
Yeah.

2129
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:49,860
So, you know, I probably should have just said N word honestly.

2130
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:51,460
So I agree on that.

2131
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:51,620
Yeah.

2132
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:59,300
I guess I said it, you know, I was, I feel, I do feel like there's a difference between

2133
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:03,540
saying it, like calling someone it versus like saying, you know,

2134
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,980
hey, this is a work of fiction.

2135
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:11,860
And in this work of fiction, you know, this word is a story, what's the word is a story conceit

2136
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:15,380
and like this is the word and this is what it is saying.

2137
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:16,820
I feel like it's different.

2138
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,460
So it's, I don't know.

2139
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:22,820
It's different, but like there's no, there's no detriment to putting the N word in place

2140
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:24,500
of it when you're talking about it.

2141
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:28,340
Honestly, there would have been no detriment to just saying N word.

2142
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:30,020
So I guess I kind of agree.

2143
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:32,100
It's not like people are confused about what that means.

2144
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:32,340
Yeah.

2145
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:38,740
I mean, that's my answer to the the ease of express using them.

2146
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,580
I wasn't, I don't know.

2147
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,940
I don't know if I would say I was using it.

2148
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:43,060
I wasn't using it.

2149
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:44,020
I was saying it.

2150
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:46,980
I was referring to it by its name.

2151
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:54,420
So I sort of, I agree with some of this comment, but not all of its spirit, I guess.

2152
02:01:56,740 --> 02:02:01,540
Also, I'm confused by the, you could have just said N word or even F word.

2153
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:06,260
Maybe they mean, maybe you say the F word.

2154
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:08,500
Do I also say the F word?

2155
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,860
I don't remember if I say it.

2156
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:11,540
I might.

2157
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,580
I mean, it probably comes up.

2158
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:13,620
It's tails gets trolled.

2159
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:16,020
Those trolls are very foul mouthed.

2160
02:02:16,020 --> 02:02:17,300
Yeah, probably.

2161
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:18,420
I mean, I guess he's right.

2162
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:21,060
Actually, I guess knuckles and shadow are very foul mouthed.

2163
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:22,020
They're all foul mouthed.

2164
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:22,420
They are.

2165
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,100
They say all the words.

2166
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:31,060
I wonder, now I don't know, he might be consistent about this.

2167
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:34,900
I wonder if this person would recommend tails gets trolled,

2168
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,860
despite the fact that it contains those words.

2169
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:42,740
I, maybe he wouldn't.

2170
02:02:42,740 --> 02:02:45,780
Maybe he'd be like, I can't in good faith recommend tails gets trolled because

2171
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:49,620
of the ease with which they use slurs.

2172
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:50,820
It makes me uncomfortable.

2173
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:51,540
That's possible.

2174
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:53,940
I doubt it, but it's possible.

2175
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:59,060
I mean, it could also just be that they, the people that they would recommend it to

2176
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:02,180
would be taken aback and offended if they heard you say it.

2177
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,580
I, it's, it's, it's honestly fair enough.

2178
02:03:06,580 --> 02:03:10,660
If you're like the fact that I say that in the, in the video is like,

2179
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:12,580
I can't recommend, I can't show this to anyone.

2180
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:15,140
You know, I get it.

2181
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:20,740
That's one reason why I think if I were doing it again, I wouldn't say it.

2182
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:23,700
I don't feel like it added really anything.

2183
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,340
And it, it, and it's, you know,

2184
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:31,700
it's kind of like, it's kind of like how I feel about the Usopp.

2185
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:37,300
Usopp's design, if somebody doesn't like it and finds it offensive, finds it like to be

2186
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:41,540
problematic, a problem affects their enjoyment, they can't recommend one piece because of it.

2187
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:43,460
Like, yeah, that's fair enough.

2188
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:50,020
And I just think, and I think it's a shame that he is designed in a way that makes some

2189
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:51,220
people feel like that.

2190
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:52,580
I think it's unfortunate.

2191
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,780
I think it's unfortunate.

2192
02:03:53,780 --> 02:04:00,580
And I kind of, for that reason, I kind of wish maybe he had not looked quite like that, perhaps.

2193
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,220
But it is what it is.

2194
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:07,380
So, okay.

2195
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:09,380
I guess that's all I have to say about this YouTube comment.

2196
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:10,740
You did.

2197
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:11,460
Okay.

2198
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:16,420
The next one is called, is Tixie still getting a cut of the Radcon for profits?

2199
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:20,420
Since she, from, since she's not a member anymore at gmail.com.

2200
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:24,020
The answer, I think I talked, yeah.

2201
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:26,820
That was one second long, so yeah, that's the question.

2202
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:27,620
Yeah, yeah.

2203
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:30,500
I think there is, I think I talked about this last week.

2204
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:31,460
The answer is yes.

2205
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:34,420
She is still getting a cut because she was involved.

2206
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:40,740
I am, I am getting part of what she would have gotten because she did not follow through on her

2207
02:04:40,740 --> 02:04:43,220
stuff, specifically with Road to Radcon.

2208
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:45,540
I would like to take all of it.

2209
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,260
I would like to deny her everything, but I can't.

2210
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:51,300
I can't, I don't have any grounds to do that.

2211
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:56,820
I think she deserves less than everyone because she famously worked the least and complained the most.

2212
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:01,380
And then wasted all of her time with the lecture that she decided to trash.

2213
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,940
But, I mean, she, she was involved, I guess.

2214
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:10,020
So, it's part of the initial agreement.

2215
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:11,540
She's entitled to a cut.

2216
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:14,260
And that's sad, sad, but true, sad, but true.

2217
02:05:15,140 --> 02:05:15,460
Yep.

2218
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,420
Rail against the cruel fate.

2219
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,900
So, yeah, she will get a cut.

2220
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:25,700
Okay.

2221
02:05:25,700 --> 02:05:28,660
Next one is called, does Ben not like Ash Vampire?

2222
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:29,380
If so, why?

2223
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:31,300
Wait, where's that?

2224
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:34,420
If you reload the second page, I think we got another one and it pushed everyone.

2225
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:35,940
All of them down.

2226
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:37,620
Okay.

2227
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:40,340
It's just, it's just the question.

2228
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,500
No, I don't like Ash Vampire.

2229
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:45,140
First of all, why do you even know who that is?

2230
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:46,900
Stupid.

2231
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:49,300
Ash Vampire is totally irrelevant.

2232
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:52,020
So, you must, so you must know them personally.

2233
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:54,980
In which case, I feel sorry for you.

2234
02:05:56,020 --> 02:05:58,020
Ash Vampire is one, a dummy.

2235
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:00,260
Two, a Nazi.

2236
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:02,340
And that's it.

2237
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:03,700
No, I don't like Ash Vampire.

2238
02:06:04,660 --> 02:06:10,180
They went on a, they went on a deranged rant about how George Floyd was just as bad as,

2239
02:06:10,900 --> 02:06:11,860
what was the cop's name?

2240
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:16,580
He had a funny name.

2241
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:18,020
It was like Big It or something.

2242
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:20,260
It was like, no, it was-

2243
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:21,220
John Big It.

2244
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:26,900
No, he genuinely, his name was like Chauvin, like Chauvinist.

2245
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:27,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2246
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:29,220
Derek Chauvin.

2247
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:29,940
Derek Chauvin.

2248
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:37,540
Ash went on a deranged rant about how George Floyd was actually just as bad as Michael, as Chauvin.

2249
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:41,780
Just as bad for being murdered as the guy that murdered him.

2250
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:44,580
They're actually, they're actually pretty the same when you think about them.

2251
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:45,940
They're just, they're two sides of the same coin.

2252
02:06:46,580 --> 02:06:47,780
No, I don't like Ash Vampire.

2253
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:49,780
If you're Ash Vampire's friend, you're an idiot.

2254
02:06:49,780 --> 02:06:50,820
And I don't like you either.

2255
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,100
And, and I mean that.

2256
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:53,460
Lamal.

2257
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,780
Also, Ash Vampire is just a dummy.

2258
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:03,380
And I haven't listened to their Bionicle lecture, but I'm sure it sucks because I have talked to Ash Vampire.

2259
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:05,860
And they're an idiot.

2260
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:11,300
Like they're, they're, I used to talk to them about, they used to be in my Discord server.

2261
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:18,420
And they used to just bore everyone with like, wanting to talk about like the submarine that

2262
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,700
they used to work on all the time.

2263
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:24,740
And everyone would like, and everyone would like, talk about them behind their back,

2264
02:07:24,740 --> 02:07:29,300
because they would like, talk about how like, they would, they would talk about

2265
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:33,380
stuff that happened, like on their, on the submarine that they were stationed on.

2266
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:39,060
And they would, they would describe like, unfair things that were done to them or like,

2267
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:43,300
things like, oh yeah, you know, they, the rules are like, like the system's designed to fuck you

2268
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:47,300
over, you know, when you do that, and like, it's really obvious that like, they're just an asshole

2269
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,100
and nobody likes them.

2270
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:53,220
And that's why like, people were like, that's why they were, they would get in trouble for

2271
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:56,740
things that other people didn't get in trouble for, like, like vaping on the submarine.

2272
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:59,780
They were like, oh, you know, they just, you know, they just had it out for me,

2273
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:01,780
because of my controversial opinions or whatever.

2274
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:06,580
But they were obviously just an asshole that nobody likes and like, vaping on the submarine.

2275
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:09,540
Yeah, other people got away with it, and they didn't get away with it.

2276
02:08:09,540 --> 02:08:11,220
They got discharged for it.

2277
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:13,460
The reason is just because nobody likes you, because you're just a dick.

2278
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:15,700
And that's, and that's it.

2279
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,980
So no, I don't like Ash Vampire.

2280
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:17,860
Good, good question.

2281
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:18,500
Great question.

2282
02:08:22,340 --> 02:08:23,700
Do you have anything to say about that?

2283
02:08:24,900 --> 02:08:29,220
I mean, I agree that they don't seem like a nice person because of the George Floyd thing.

2284
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:34,340
I do remember reading, I think it was in like May's discord when she had that,

2285
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:35,540
or maybe she still does.

2286
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:42,420
She wrote it in text in the May's discord, and then on their stream, she read it out loud.

2287
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:47,060
She read it out loud in a stream with Glink, and May and Glink were like,

2288
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:48,500
yeah, very interesting.

2289
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:49,220
Yeah, sounds good.

2290
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:56,420
Yeah, so I have no reason to defend them at all.

2291
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,620
I don't really care about them.

2292
02:08:57,620 --> 02:08:58,180
I hate them.

2293
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:58,740
I hate them.

2294
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:02,020
And then that was the time.

2295
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:09,140
That was the time, and I'll just briefly remind everyone, that was the time that,

2296
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:12,260
in response, I went ballistic.

2297
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:19,620
I went ballistic in the call on the stream, called them all.

2298
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:21,860
I genuinely, I don't even remember what I called them.

2299
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,220
I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.

2300
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:29,540
And then immediately afterwards, Trixie DMed me to say,

2301
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:33,380
Ben, you're just mad that you don't get to fuck May like I do.

2302
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:34,260
You're just mad.

2303
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:36,500
You're just mad and you need to have sex like me.

2304
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:40,820
It's a famous interaction.

2305
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:41,940
A famous interaction.

2306
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:43,700
I mean, it's famous to me.

2307
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:53,460
The moment when I think I knew that actually, Trixie's not a good person.

2308
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,340
Maybe I don't like them.

2309
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:59,700
Anyway, next one is called Ben's Weekly Reminder.

2310
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:01,140
Play Deltarune Chapter 2.

2311
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:02,180
No!

2312
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,940
I will eventually.

2313
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:08,420
Maybe when Chapter 3 comes out, I'll finally play Chapter 2.

2314
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:12,980
You won't comb through Chapter 2 enough.

2315
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:16,420
Or I still got to go back and fight Jevil.

2316
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:18,420
I never fought Jevil in Chapter 1.

2317
02:10:18,420 --> 02:10:19,300
No!

2318
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:19,540
Yeah.

2319
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:21,300
I mean, Jevil's really difficult.

2320
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:25,140
He's really difficult, but I like, I like games.

2321
02:10:25,220 --> 02:10:26,100
That are hard.

2322
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:29,700
I like, I like a, I like games that are hard.

2323
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:33,140
Like Demon's Souls, Demon's Souls.

2324
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:37,220
What's the devil may cry about part?

2325
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:38,340
No, wait, what was he?

2326
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:40,740
I forget the lyrics there.

2327
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:42,420
I don't remember that many of the lyrics.

2328
02:10:42,420 --> 02:10:44,340
I like games that are hard.

2329
02:10:44,340 --> 02:10:47,620
Like part one and three.

2330
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:50,260
Two is easy and it sucks.

2331
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:51,860
I like games that are tough.

2332
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:53,140
Right.

2333
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:54,900
Forget what game he was talking about though.

2334
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:56,100
It was Devil May Cry for sure.

2335
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:57,220
Yeah.

2336
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,260
Yeah, for sure.

2337
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,300
Devil May Cry 2 sucks.

2338
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:02,900
Famously, everybody knows this.

2339
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:03,460
Yeah.

2340
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:06,500
I, I played Devil May Cry 1 at my friend's house and I loved it.

2341
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,660
And then Devil May Cry 2 came out and I rented it.

2342
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:10,660
And I was like, hell yeah, Devil May Cry 2.

2343
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:12,340
And then I played it and I was like, this sucks.

2344
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:15,460
And then I never played a Devil May Cry game again.

2345
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:19,380
But then every other Devil May Cry, I was like fine and good.

2346
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:19,860
That's not true.

2347
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:22,340
I think I did play some of 4 and it was, and it was good.

2348
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:26,500
But they're just, they're just not my, they're not really my favorite.

2349
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:30,180
Character action games are not really my like thing and that's fine.

2350
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:35,380
Things that are tough is too tough for me.

2351
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,420
You beat Phantom's Revenge.

2352
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:39,140
It's kind of hard.

2353
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:41,540
That was a thinking game though.

2354
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:42,500
I like thinking games.

2355
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:51,780
I don't like like stress inducing like reaction time games because it's using my muscles and

2356
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:52,900
I don't have any of those.

2357
02:11:54,180 --> 02:11:54,740
I see.

2358
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:59,780
My brain's real big but my body is a skeleton.

2359
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:00,980
There's nothing there.

2360
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:03,860
That's, you gotta play to your strengths I guess.

2361
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:08,580
Next one is called, no, Twitter Sparkle.

2362
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:10,740
Three, two, one, go.

2363
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,020
Do you get those people on Twitter?

2364
02:12:14,020 --> 02:12:20,260
You know those people that go around saying that depicting everything in media is bad.

2365
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:22,420
No toxic relationships.

2366
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:23,220
No crimes.

2367
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:24,340
No enemy balloons.

2368
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:28,100
And especially, no rule 34 of anything.

2369
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,540
That isn't an adult human being.

2370
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,740
They even came after those bloody gory MLP cartoons.

2371
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,300
Where do they all even come from?

2372
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:37,060
God, I miss Newgrounds.

2373
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:45,140
Twilight, I mean Twitter Sparkle, Newgrounds still exists.

2374
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:46,100
It does still exist.

2375
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:51,860
In fact, it's like it's had a like a resurgence a bit recently.

2376
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,740
The clock gang is still posting.

2377
02:12:57,700 --> 02:12:58,980
What's up with those clocks?

2378
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:00,420
I never really clicked on any of those.

2379
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,740
I was just like why are the clocks of everything?

2380
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:10,900
They were just a group of animators who just kind of had like they were sort of a gang who all kind of

2381
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:14,420
themed their animations similarly.

2382
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,300
Damn, that must have been the life.

2383
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:20,100
That's exactly what I want.

2384
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:25,780
Is to just be in a fucking art gang, making a splash in a scene.

2385
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,820
It's all I want in life.

2386
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,820
And I've been cruelly denied it.

2387
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,900
What do you have to say for yourself?

2388
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:34,580
I mean, wow.

2389
02:13:36,340 --> 02:13:38,180
Defend yourself now.

2390
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:41,860
Well, I mean, we could start an art gang.

2391
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:44,740
I'm doing things.

2392
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:48,980
Yeah, I just, I mean, yeah.

2393
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:51,700
I mean, what constitutes a gang?

2394
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:52,260
I don't know.

2395
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:53,700
Do we need more people doing it?

2396
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:56,900
That's a good question, honestly.

2397
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:57,380
I don't know.

2398
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:04,980
I don't, I can't answer.

2399
02:14:04,980 --> 02:14:05,620
I can't answer.

2400
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:06,100
I'm sorry.

2401
02:14:06,100 --> 02:14:06,740
I don't have one.

2402
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:09,620
But it's something to think about.

2403
02:14:11,060 --> 02:14:12,020
Okay, but we'll be a gang.

2404
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:12,660
We'll be a gang.

2405
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:13,540
Yeah.

2406
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:18,580
Well, what makes a gang is we have to like wear headbands and like go around with like

2407
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:20,500
bats with nails and then like bash and stuff.

2408
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:27,300
And then, and we got to go and we got to snap our fingers and go and like break into song

2409
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,060
when a rival gang shows up on our turf.

2410
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,620
Oh, yeah.

2411
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:34,180
Those are the two criteria.

2412
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:37,060
And we're, I was thinking more of like an Italian mobster gang.

2413
02:14:38,020 --> 02:14:39,060
Like violin cases.

2414
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,220
That's also, you know, fine.

2415
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:43,940
That's, that's cool too, I guess.

2416
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:49,300
Next one is called Cyborg Ben Saint Sextal.

2417
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,180
Three, two, one, go.

2418
02:14:58,180 --> 02:14:59,460
Yeah, this sounds like me.

2419
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,460
Thanks.

2420
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:06,260
Have a great day.

2421
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:07,460
Taru.

2422
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:10,020
What the fuck is that?

2423
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:13,460
It's your favorite musketch phrase.

2424
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:14,020
Haru.

2425
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:15,780
Taru.

2426
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:17,060
Taru.

2427
02:15:17,060 --> 02:15:17,380
Oh, true.

2428
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:18,660
56709.

2429
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:21,300
Oh, Taru.

2430
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:24,660
Taru.

2431
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:27,300
56709.

2432
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:31,060
You know that, you know the 56709?

2433
02:15:31,060 --> 02:15:31,860
Of course I know.

2434
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:32,020
Okay.

2435
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:33,380
Awoo, 56709.

2436
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:34,900
Okay, okay, okay.

2437
02:15:34,900 --> 02:15:35,780
Yeah, yeah, of course.

2438
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:40,100
Um, next one is called We've All Thought It.

2439
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:41,460
Three, two, one, go.

2440
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:44,660
Do you ever, like, look at someone and think,

2441
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:47,300
how the fuck were you the winning sperm?

2442
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:49,300
Sure.

2443
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:52,340
I look at myself in the mirror like that.

2444
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:54,900
There you go.

2445
02:15:56,580 --> 02:15:57,140
I don't know.

2446
02:15:57,140 --> 02:15:59,300
I don't really think of sperm when I look at a person.

2447
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:03,380
It's not the first thing I think of, sure.

2448
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:05,220
Okay.

2449
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:07,140
Anyway, next one is a...

2450
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:08,900
All right, well, there's an Imgur album link.

2451
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,780
So let me check that out real quick.

2452
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:14,660
Oh, okay.

2453
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:15,300
I clicked on that.

2454
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,860
Wait, wait, it says voicemail is unrelated,

2455
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:19,540
so react to this first, please.

2456
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:21,380
Okay.

2457
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:26,900
Getting people to play just your game to catch all the bugs.

2458
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:31,140
You fucking lizard replay the entire game now, you loser.

2459
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:37,300
New fucking lizard.

2460
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:44,340
I mean, I mean, it's just, yeah, it's that's,

2461
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,340
I was just going to say it's just true.

2462
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:47,940
It's true.

2463
02:16:47,940 --> 02:16:48,500
It's funny because it's true.

2464
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,940
Why would you get people to play test it?

2465
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:53,940
When they could, when they could play like...

2466
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:56,180
You just put a lizard in.

2467
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:57,540
Just put a lizard in.

2468
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:59,300
Just put a lizard in, and there you go.

2469
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:00,980
Free play test.

2470
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:10,100
I get that the implication might be that if I'm going to make versions,

2471
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:12,420
I should have a beta on Alpha.

2472
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:14,020
I think we will eventually do that.

2473
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:21,220
If we make a Kickstarter, there'll be an Alpha where people can access it

2474
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:22,340
before the full game is out.

2475
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:27,700
But for the demo, we only wanted to make one other patch to solve some things.

2476
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:28,980
It's not an ongoing thing.

2477
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:35,060
But I agree, emphatically, with this meme template.

2478
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:36,900
And I will download it and use it.

2479
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:39,700
Thank you for that.

2480
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,540
Actually, yeah, this is, this is good.

2481
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,660
This is, this is, this is reusable.

2482
02:17:45,620 --> 02:17:46,580
It's very funny.

2483
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:48,820
Okay.

2484
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:54,660
Well, the voicemail is called, it's rant about voicefakes at twitter.com.

2485
02:17:55,460 --> 02:17:56,980
Three, two, one, go.

2486
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:01,380
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a good voice to fake?

2487
02:18:01,380 --> 02:18:02,740
This is my third.

2488
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,340
Actually, now it's fifth.

2489
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:08,740
Account on play.ht, fakeu.com is pretty great and free,

2490
02:18:08,740 --> 02:18:11,220
but it doesn't understand punctuation at all.

2491
02:18:11,220 --> 02:18:13,700
I have to break sentences into tiniest chunks,

2492
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:16,180
thinking like characters I am using would.

2493
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:20,260
And even then I have to retime it all in audacity to make it sound natural.

2494
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:23,700
And when character doesn't know a word or its acronym or a number,

2495
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:26,340
I have to use other words and splice them together.

2496
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:28,420
Trial period has expired again.

2497
02:18:28,420 --> 02:18:32,020
Oh, and those nostalgic critic and linkara voice banks.

2498
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:36,180
No way, nostalgic critic never said katana or anime.

2499
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:37,700
But somehow it understood.

2500
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,500
Sonichu.

2501
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,220
Understood.

2502
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:40,340
Why you want the fuck?

2503
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:41,860
What's supernatural?

2504
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:44,340
Not a single voice bank there has the word.

2505
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:44,980
Anime.

2506
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:47,940
I'll just put Google translate voicemail next time.

2507
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:49,140
Cause fuck that.

2508
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:49,940
P.S.

2509
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:51,540
Wanna hear something funny?

2510
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:52,180
Here you go.

2511
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:56,500
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

2512
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:58,340
One, one, one, one.

2513
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:01,700
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

2514
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:05,060
That was pretty funny.

2515
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:10,660
Yeah I like that.

2516
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:12,660
That the computer interprets a sentence

2517
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:17,220
filled with ones would go in that direction specifically is amusing.

2518
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:19,460
What do you mean by that direction?

2519
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:25,580
Well, you know, the pitch would change, you go one, one, one, one, one, like, and speed

2520
02:19:25,580 --> 02:19:26,580
up.

2521
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,580
It makes me wonder.

2522
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:29,100
And then it would settle into a loop at the end.

2523
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:33,820
Like, why does it think that a sentence like that should go that way?

2524
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:34,820
It's like, it's...

2525
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:35,820
Yeah.

2526
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:41,780
I did wonder, like, why are some of them at different pitches and stuff, like, how does

2527
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:42,780
it...

2528
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:47,980
Like, oh, people talk like this at the beginning of a sentence, they have a horizon, like, I

2529
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:54,540
noticed in some AI things, if you put a question mark at the end, it'll read it all, and then

2530
02:19:54,540 --> 02:20:04,300
it'll, like, have the upward lilt of, like, a question voice in there, like, not just

2531
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:10,100
at the end, like, the way people ask questions is, like, kind of specific.

2532
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:11,100
Sure.

2533
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:15,860
My fucking superintendent, or whatever you call him, is, like, bellowing at my fucking

2534
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:20,940
window over my house again.

2535
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:22,180
I hope that's not picking...

2536
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:24,620
I hope that's not picking up on my microphone.

2537
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:27,620
I guess I do not hear anything.

2538
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:30,820
I mean, I can faintly hear it.

2539
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:32,940
What is he...

2540
02:20:32,940 --> 02:20:33,940
He's always yelling.

2541
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:34,940
He's always yelling about shit.

2542
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:39,180
He doesn't know how to leave a voicemail, so he just wastes it while we're recording

2543
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:42,180
and then screams it.

2544
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:43,660
Next voicemail is called...

2545
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:44,660
Oh, okay.

2546
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:45,660
There's no voicemail.

2547
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,980
It's a second long.

2548
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:47,980
There's a link.

2549
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:50,660
I'm going to follow that link.

2550
02:20:50,660 --> 02:20:54,460
Voices.com slash blogs slash how to submit a podcast.

2551
02:20:54,460 --> 02:20:55,460
Okay, right.

2552
02:20:55,460 --> 02:21:00,500
It's because I didn't like hearing that one voicemail where you explain something, something

2553
02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:01,500
or other.

2554
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,500
No, Tom actually got back to me.

2555
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:06,340
Tom actually got back to me with a...

2556
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:09,540
What I was hoping wouldn't happen, but Tom got back to me with an explanation of how to

2557
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:10,580
do it.

2558
02:21:10,580 --> 02:21:16,740
So he said he might do it, but the fact that he explained it to me makes me think like

2559
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:19,500
I'm probably just going to have to do it for now on.

2560
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,500
Okay, whatever.

2561
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:21,900
How to submit a podcast?

2562
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:22,900
Whatever.

2563
02:21:22,900 --> 02:21:26,340
Okay, next one is called Please 3, 2, 1, go.

2564
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:29,940
Thank you, please with the broadcast on Spotify.

2565
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:31,900
I'm going to fucking kill you.

2566
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:34,940
Probably I will do that, only because Tom finally...

2567
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:36,940
I'll have to figure it out.

2568
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:40,020
I mean, he's gave me an explanation and it was really long.

2569
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:43,900
He sent me like several paragraphs, like, well, it was split into lines, but it was at

2570
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:46,860
least like 20 plus lines.

2571
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:51,540
So like there's steps involved and I don't want to do it.

2572
02:21:51,540 --> 02:21:57,740
I don't want to learn how to do it, but I guess maybe I will.

2573
02:21:57,740 --> 02:22:02,980
Next one is called Fan Theory on Tom, 3, 2, 1, go.

2574
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:04,180
Fan Theory on Tom.

2575
02:22:04,180 --> 02:22:08,260
He moved to Virginia because it was where Nate is and he was thinking that Trixie's

2576
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:09,260
there too.

2577
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:11,500
Well, is that where she lives now?

2578
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:14,300
But anyways, I know Nate lives there now, so, right?

2579
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:15,300
Yes.

2580
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:16,300
I don't know.

2581
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:17,300
Both of them, right?

2582
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:18,800
I'm not fucking...

2583
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:23,700
You're definitely wrong that that is why he moved there, but you are right that Nate

2584
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:24,700
does move there.

2585
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:27,260
Trixie also lives there.

2586
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:28,260
So I mean...

2587
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:30,260
I don't know.

2588
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:33,260
Any day now, PCPHQ.

2589
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:37,820
Yeah, three of them.

2590
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:41,260
I don't know.

2591
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,180
I don't think...

2592
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:44,740
I don't know exactly where Trixie lives.

2593
02:22:44,740 --> 02:22:47,740
I don't think she's like that close to Virginia Beach.

2594
02:22:47,740 --> 02:22:54,300
Nate is in or around Virginia Beach and Tom, I don't know where in Virginia he lives.

2595
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:59,580
So I don't actually know how close Tom could be like way out in like the boonies part of

2596
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,140
Virginia, perhaps.

2597
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:06,340
I mean, it's all boonies, honestly.

2598
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:08,300
But it would be really funny.

2599
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:15,860
It would be really funny to see like Tom in like a Trixie vlog one of these days.

2600
02:23:15,860 --> 02:23:18,500
After all, she's done.

2601
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:20,940
I mean, she didn't do anything to him.

2602
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:21,940
I guess so.

2603
02:23:21,940 --> 02:23:26,620
Well, she sort of dropped Iron Games or like wasn't...

2604
02:23:26,620 --> 02:23:28,620
I guess it's not really that much.

2605
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:29,620
Yeah.

2606
02:23:29,620 --> 02:23:36,060
He seemed a bit like maybe not even offended or maybe not even hurt, but like at least

2607
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:41,860
confused that like she didn't even mention Iron Games in that one time.

2608
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:43,820
But like, I don't know.

2609
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:48,660
I don't really know how Tom feels about anything.

2610
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:49,660
So I don't...

2611
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:50,660
I just...

2612
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:51,660
I don't know.

2613
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:52,820
I guess it would be...

2614
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:54,020
I would be surprised.

2615
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:58,220
I would be surprised to see Tom in any like Trixie thing.

2616
02:23:58,220 --> 02:24:02,500
But I guess I wouldn't consider it like impossible.

2617
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,780
I wouldn't like it, obviously.

2618
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:14,220
But like all kinds of things I don't like happen and that's just like...

2619
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,220
Next one is...

2620
02:24:15,220 --> 02:24:16,220
Yeah.

2621
02:24:16,220 --> 02:24:17,220
Yeah.

2622
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:18,220
Yeah.

2623
02:24:18,220 --> 02:24:19,220
Yeah.

2624
02:24:19,220 --> 02:24:20,220
Yeah.

2625
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,220
It is kind of funny.

2626
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:24,300
Like, yeah, they all live in Virginia.

2627
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:30,580
I don't know if they talk at all anymore, any of them.

2628
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:37,420
So maybe they'll just live in around there and just not have anything to do with each

2629
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:38,420
other.

2630
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:39,420
I don't know.

2631
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:40,420
I don't know.

2632
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:41,420
I just don't know.

2633
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:44,100
Next one is called More Buffalo Bill, please.

2634
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:46,380
Three, two, one, go.

2635
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:48,180
Okay, that's it.

2636
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:50,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

2637
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:54,500
Wasn't that a voicemail I called Buffalo Bill?

2638
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:56,500
Oh, there was.

2639
02:24:56,500 --> 02:24:57,500
Yeah.

2640
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:59,500
Yeah, why are you asking us?

2641
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,500
I mean, I guess they're just getting the word out.

2642
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:03,500
Yes.

2643
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:04,500
Okay.

2644
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:05,500
Now I remember.

2645
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:06,500
Now I remember.

2646
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:08,500
Next one is a YouTube link.

2647
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:10,500
The video...

2648
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:12,500
That's about the best video game.

2649
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:13,500
Wait, wait, wait.

2650
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:14,500
Okay.

2651
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:22,500
Next one is another, is a link to a soundtrack piece from the other Supergiant game, Pyre.

2652
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,500
So I wonder if this is the same voicemail.

2653
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:27,500
Anyway, yeah, it's called Gushing About the Best Video Game.

2654
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:29,500
Three, two, one, go.

2655
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:32,500
You brought up Pyre by Supergiant Games on the last podcast, and holy shit.

2656
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:33,500
No.

2657
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,500
Pyre is so fucking good, and people need to play it, actually.

2658
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,500
So, like, the objective is to play Magic Basketball to free your party members from

2659
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:39,500
exile.

2660
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:42,500
Success means you have to periodically get rid of your highest level characters, so you

2661
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,500
have to play and you're leveling around that.

2662
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:45,500
But if you lose, you don't get to try again.

2663
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:48,500
You just keep going, and one of the other teams gets to be freed from exile instead.

2664
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:52,500
A lot of the time, these teams are really great, too, so you might even want to intentionally

2665
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,500
throw some of your matches for their sake.

2666
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:57,500
As a result, the narrative is focused more on the modular storylines of each character

2667
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,500
and how they interact with each other.

2668
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:02,500
And in the end, you can read about every single ally and enemy to see where they ended up

2669
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:04,500
in their relationships with the other characters.

2670
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:07,500
There's this huge net of interactions that can be wildly different depending on how you

2671
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:09,500
play, and it's so fucking good.

2672
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:12,500
This is also not mentioning that the soundtrack is God-tier.

2673
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:16,500
Never to return, and especially in the flame are probably my favorite songs from any of

2674
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:19,500
the Supergiant games.

2675
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:26,500
Yeah, I watched a video about all the Supergiant games, and Pyre seems very weird, but that

2676
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:27,500
guy...

2677
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:32,500
I don't remember who it was, honestly, but he really liked Pyre, and it seems interesting.

2678
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:38,500
And it's just really funny that we had another voicemailer send in a YouTube link to a transistor

2679
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:42,500
game, being like, I haven't played Pyre, but you gotta play transistor.

2680
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:47,500
And this person is like, you gotta play Pyre.

2681
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:53,500
Here's another YouTube video about how the music is good.

2682
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:56,500
I guess I might give him a shot.

2683
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:57,500
Maybe.

2684
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:00,500
I'm still working on Hades.

2685
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:09,500
I think what I'm working on now is boosting all my relationships with all the characters,

2686
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:19,500
because I think that's gonna unlock post-game stories content, so I'm working on that.

2687
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,500
Okay, next.

2688
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:23,500
I got the credits now.

2689
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:27,500
You beat the game, but that's not the end.

2690
02:27:27,500 --> 02:27:32,500
There's more to do after you beat it, until you have to beat it in certain ways to get

2691
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:37,500
the ending, which is the credits, but then there's still more stuff after the credits,

2692
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:40,500
so that's where I'm at right now.

2693
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:47,500
Next one is called Nikolai for Voice Grail, please at gmail.com.

2694
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:50,500
I mean, he did die.

2695
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:55,500
He did die, but dying doesn't mean Voice Grail.

2696
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:56,500
Necessarily.

2697
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:57,500
I don't know.

2698
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:58,500
I don't know.

2699
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:04,500
Do we feel that Nikolai made substantial contributions to the PCP culture?

2700
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:07,500
I feel like Nikolai was alright.

2701
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:09,500
I don't think he's Voice Grail.

2702
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:11,500
Yeah, I don't know if he's Voice Grail.

2703
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:12,500
I'm sorry, Nikolai.

2704
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:14,500
Rest in peace.

2705
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:22,500
Rest in peace in hell, because you're not getting the Voice Grail, buddy.

2706
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:35,500
Next one is called, I know how much Cybershell likes these, 3, 2, 1, go.

2707
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:40,500
I'm so sorry, but Cybershell is not present at the moment, but I will pass along your

2708
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:41,500
message for him.

2709
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:42,500
Go forward these.

2710
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:45,500
Yeah, to his agent.

2711
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:51,500
Next one is called Ben Stop Listening, 3, 2, 1, go.

2712
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:55,500
I heard it in your voice last week.

2713
02:28:55,500 --> 02:28:58,500
You want to talk about the one piece stuff.

2714
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:03,500
So without spoiling, what are your feelings?

2715
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:05,500
Are you in the, this is cool camp.

2716
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:08,500
Are you in the wait and see what Oda does camp?

2717
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:12,500
Are you loving it?

2718
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:14,500
Are you bad and wrong?

2719
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:17,500
I don't think you're bad and wrong, but you could be.

2720
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:20,500
But yeah, don't spoil it for Ben.

2721
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:27,500
He'll never, he'll never expect Sanji's giant dildo foot.

2722
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:33,500
I have been, I have been not fully spoiled, but I know something about what has been,

2723
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:36,500
what has transpired.

2724
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:38,500
What do you know?

2725
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:44,500
I know, okay, what I think I know is that something has been revealed about the gum

2726
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:54,500
gum fruit that has changed, like the gum gum fruit has some capability that is,

2727
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:59,500
that has like changed everything seems is what I'm picking up from the, what,

2728
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:01,500
of the discourse I've heard.

2729
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:03,500
It's something like that.

2730
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:04,500
Yeah.

2731
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:05,500
Okay.

2732
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:10,500
Personally, I, this is the sort of thing I would have loved to talk about on the

2733
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:14,500
podcast, but like, I don't have like that anymore.

2734
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:15,500
Yeah.

2735
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:17,500
And it feels, I don't really care.

2736
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:19,500
You're not, you're not, you're not part of the gang.

2737
02:30:19,500 --> 02:30:20,500
Not part of the gang.

2738
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:22,500
You're not, you're not part of the cool art gang.

2739
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:23,500
You're not part of the scene.

2740
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,500
You're not making waves in the scene anymore.

2741
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:25,500
I'm sorry.

2742
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:26,500
You just can't have it.

2743
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:27,500
That's how I feel.

2744
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,500
That's how I feel all the time.

2745
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:33,500
Welcome to my dark twisted mind.

2746
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:34,500
All right.

2747
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:44,500
So without spoiling too much of anything, I find that it's, it's, I can see that it

2748
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:47,500
came to this point.

2749
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:52,500
And I, and people say that it's like, Oh, to plant it, just look at this, just look

2750
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:53,500
at that.

2751
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:54,500
And I'm like, cool.

2752
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:56,500
I think it was a bad plan.

2753
02:30:56,500 --> 02:31:02,500
And it undermines a lot of themes that of the whole thing.

2754
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:05,500
But I don't know exactly where they're going with it.

2755
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:07,500
It's just the way it was revealed.

2756
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:10,500
It does not leave a lot to the imagination.

2757
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:14,500
And I, I don't like what I saw.

2758
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:16,500
I'm not that into it.

2759
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:21,500
Sounds like this guy would call you, sorry, this individual whose gender I am not aware

2760
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:24,500
of trying to be any, whatever.

2761
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:30,500
This, this, this person thinks you, you're bad and wrong.

2762
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:39,500
I mean, maybe I am, but like, I, I'm not like seething and like, if this was on a podcast,

2763
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:45,500
I imagine Nate would be screaming and I would be like agreeing, but not screaming along

2764
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,500
with him.

2765
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:54,500
It's, it's one of those like, I, I, I don't like, there's parts about it.

2766
02:31:54,500 --> 02:32:06,500
I like, like the visuals, like the, the, the sort of like, it's, it's, um, I mean, it's,

2767
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:11,500
it's a problem that I've had for a while.

2768
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:22,500
Ever since, um, like the, it was sort of shifting like the importance of Luffy as a person.

2769
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:29,500
Like he was already always kind of important because he had like very powerful and notorious

2770
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,500
relatives.

2771
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:31,500
Yeah.

2772
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:37,500
Um, but like he himself, uh, is just like, he was a kid who ate a fruit.

2773
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:38,500
Yeah.

2774
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:44,500
And then like out of happenstance and then was like, had a, like a rough childhood fighting

2775
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:46,500
and wanted to become a pirate.

2776
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:51,500
And it's like, that's his journey of his, his like journey of just trying to be a pirate.

2777
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:57,500
I mean, not even, and now it's becoming, yeah, it's becoming a bit more like, and it was always

2778
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:58,500
meant to be.

2779
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:03,500
And I'm like, not, not even about this, the latest relation revelation, which I'm not even aware

2780
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:09,500
of, but like other things, like the fact that his, his dad is like the, yeah, his dad is

2781
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:15,500
the leader of the like revolution and like his brother is, is this captain of the, or

2782
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:20,500
you know, the first mate of the shanks crew and, uh, you know, he's got.

2783
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:23,500
The white bear pirates, the, the, that's what I meant.

2784
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:28,000
Um, and, uh, he's like, yeah, he's got all these powerful relatives and like Sanji's

2785
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,500
got this, like his dad is like king of the whatever.

2786
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:32,500
Yeah.

2787
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:37,200
I hate, I, I think I have the same feeling about that stuff.

2788
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,500
It's like, why has he got it?

2789
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:42,500
It's like the, I haven't watched the new Star Wars, but like how they made Ray like, oh

2790
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:43,500
yeah.

2791
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:44,500
Palpatine sir grandpa.

2792
02:33:44,500 --> 02:33:45,500
Yeah.

2793
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:46,500
It's like, why?

2794
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:53,500
It, it couldn't possibly be a story about a person who just is exceptional for their

2795
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:54,500
own.

2796
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,500
Yeah.

2797
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,500
From, from themselves.

2798
02:33:56,500 --> 02:33:57,500
Yeah.

2799
02:33:57,500 --> 02:34:01,500
I mean, I think of like a really good protagonist, which everyone agrees with is guts from berserk.

2800
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:02,500
Yeah.

2801
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:07,500
Like he's overwhelmingly strong, but that's because he was fighting since he was like,

2802
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:08,500
like 10.

2803
02:34:08,500 --> 02:34:15,000
And like he's had a really tough life constantly fighting in bandit wars.

2804
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:22,100
And then like, you know, fighting, fighting with like sell swords until he was a young

2805
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:26,300
adult and then fighting with the band of the hawk through his whole, you know, into adult

2806
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:27,800
life.

2807
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:33,640
And then after like the big thing happened, he was fighting like demons and and he's fueled

2808
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:38,000
by rage and hate and it's like, he wasn't anyone special.

2809
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Yeah.

2810
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:44,240
Like he was just some kid who got roped into this stuff and it's like, it could have happened

2811
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:51,360
to a different person and it's like, the more time, the more times the agency is taken

2812
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:57,040
away from the protagonist and put onto a special advantage that they had the whole time, the

2813
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:02,160
less I can relate to that protagonist, the less I can really feel like I'm rooting for

2814
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,160
them.

2815
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:04,760
It's not that I don't root for Luffy anymore.

2816
02:35:04,760 --> 02:35:05,760
It's not like that drastic.

2817
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:10,920
It's not like the end of like my enjoyment of one piece, but it is a bit of like a like

2818
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:17,440
a it's one of those sorts of feelings.

2819
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:24,480
I mean, I think I said this about my hero academia when I thought I thought the initial

2820
02:35:24,480 --> 02:35:28,480
premise was interesting and then I found out because it was like, oh, a guy with no powers

2821
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:31,880
in a world of people with powers and then it's like, oh, well, actually, no, he just

2822
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:34,040
he kind of gets the best power actually.

2823
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:36,200
It's like, okay, that's fine.

2824
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:37,680
All right, that's fine.

2825
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:39,840
I'm not interested anymore.

2826
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,760
The best character in Naruto was Rock Lee, because it was really compelling.

2827
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,400
It was really compelling that he's this everyone else has all these fucking is these fucking

2828
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:54,440
wizards who have these like magic spells and like his thing is like, he just he doesn't

2829
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:55,440
have any spells.

2830
02:35:55,440 --> 02:35:57,040
He doesn't have any fucking super magic.

2831
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:01,320
All he does is like, he just trained really hard and he's really strong and tough and

2832
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:05,360
he knows what he's doing and he's just he just makes it work.

2833
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:07,440
He just makes it work like that.

2834
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:09,360
It's more compelling.

2835
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:10,360
It is.

2836
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:11,360
It is compelling.

2837
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:15,520
There's a part near the end where like, there's a very dangerous fight going on and Rock Lee

2838
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:21,280
has to like, open like the gates like the and he opens too many is like putting himself

2839
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:22,280
at risk.

2840
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:27,760
Yeah, sort of like, yeah, the unfortunate reality of him not being a main character that like

2841
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:32,240
he can't rise to the heights that Naruto can rise.

2842
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,240
Yeah.

2843
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:36,520
Even if he tries his hardest, but he will still try his hardest anyway.

2844
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:39,240
And I think he wins that fight with the help of guy.

2845
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:41,120
I can't remember exactly what was I going on.

2846
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:43,160
I remember him opening the Chakra gates.

2847
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:44,520
I did see that part.

2848
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:45,520
Yeah.

2849
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:51,840
And it's like, despite everything, despite all of his hard work, he cannot be main character.

2850
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:52,840
Yeah.

2851
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:59,080
And it's sad, but it's like, it's cool that he still has a mystic viewpoint on that and

2852
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:00,640
he's like, he's going to try his best.

2853
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:04,000
It's sad, but like you can I mean, he's still at the end of the day.

2854
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,360
You can look it's like, well, he's still accomplished a lot.

2855
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:09,480
Like it's still like incredible how far he made it.

2856
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:10,480
Yeah.

2857
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:12,320
And it's like, wow, I love broccoli.

2858
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,320
He's so cool.

2859
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:14,320
He's so great.

2860
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:18,920
But yeah, and that's the sort of the thing you I feel like this is true for a lot of

2861
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:24,320
media where like the main characters, the chosen one and blah, blah, blah, whatever, they've

2862
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:27,360
got the main character syndrome where they're just sort of uninteresting.

2863
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:30,200
You kind of know what's going on with them and then you get you fall in love with like

2864
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:34,160
the side character or like the anti hero or someone else.

2865
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:35,480
They're your favorite.

2866
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:39,600
You know what was really, you know, it was a really great twist, though.

2867
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:44,240
I complained a second ago about like Sanji's Sanji being sort of an important guy for

2868
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:45,240
an important family.

2869
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:50,800
I really liked though that he's like, you know, he's from this, he's from this, this

2870
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:56,520
litter of like clone experiment children that all are like superhumans.

2871
02:37:56,520 --> 02:38:03,600
But he's like the one failure that like didn't get superhuman power, but he just like is strong

2872
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,600
anyway.

2873
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:10,000
Cause you know, it's like cause like cause one piece rules just, I don't know, Oda used

2874
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,920
to say stuff in SPS is this is like in one piece, just if you have a strong will, it

2875
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:15,680
just makes you strong.

2876
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,960
And just these characters just have so much will to accomplish their dreams that they just

2877
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:20,960
are powerful.

2878
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:25,840
And it's like, yeah, you know what, that's that's all of the explanation I need for why

2879
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,760
a character is powerful and strong and accomplishes what they're set out to do.

2880
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:32,440
They just wanted that.

2881
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:36,760
I mean, that's, I mean, that gets you, that gets you most of the way there.

2882
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:37,760
No, no, no.

2883
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:38,760
I mean, I agree.

2884
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:44,240
But like, uh, wait, it doesn't matter.

2885
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:45,720
Don't worry about it.

2886
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:50,880
I can't tell if you're being like sarcastic and being coy because I don't want to spoil

2887
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,880
anything.

2888
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:54,280
Anything about one piece?

2889
02:38:54,280 --> 02:38:55,280
Yeah.

2890
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,720
I, okay, okay.

2891
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,080
You know what?

2892
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,080
I am curious.

2893
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:07,600
I am pretty curious what everyone's talking about with his latest something or other.

2894
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:12,760
In the grandest scheme of things, um, it's not like a deal breaker.

2895
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:16,160
Like I said, it's not going to make me stop reading.

2896
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:17,160
Sure.

2897
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:21,480
Um, I'm sure it's still going to be like my favorite manga ever.

2898
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:22,480
Yeah.

2899
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:29,920
It's just like the further they push the whole like chosen one angle, the least the

2900
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:33,240
less I enjoy seeing what happens.

2901
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:34,400
Yeah.

2902
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:35,720
I feel you.

2903
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:36,720
I feel you.

2904
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:42,320
The less viscerally I feel this, the, the triumphs, even though I know like he's doing

2905
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:43,320
his best.

2906
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:44,320
Yeah.

2907
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:52,760
Uh, the, that was that voice man.

2908
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,760
I agree.

2909
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:54,760
Okay.

2910
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:55,760
Okay.

2911
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:56,760
Yeah.

2912
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:57,760
Um, all right.

2913
02:39:57,760 --> 02:39:58,760
We've got, okay.

2914
02:39:58,760 --> 02:39:59,760
We've got one more.

2915
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:00,760
All right.

2916
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:04,920
Next one is slime times weekend update 5.0.

2917
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:05,920
Here we go.

2918
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,920
Uh, three, two, one, go.

2919
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:11,240
Hello gangsters and gangsters.

2920
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:13,400
Welcome back to the slime times weekend update.

2921
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:14,400
Gangsta.

2922
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:19,480
This installment leaves your dear reporter with some based news and some difficult news.

2923
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:23,800
Last week was a week of changing alliances while this week culminated in slightly more

2924
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:27,120
sobering events since there's much to report on.

2925
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,720
And this is also a bit of a catch up job for last week.

2926
02:40:29,720 --> 02:40:33,240
I'll be separating this new segment into two parts.

2927
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:37,800
Last week, rowdy loom, a robot girl switched over to killers while mischief, a humanoid

2928
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:40,880
rabbit switched from killers to rowdies.

2929
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:45,320
This was dubbed a cultural exchange program, though either gangsta may decide to stay with

2930
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:48,400
their new posse if they find it just too cozy.

2931
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:53,040
In addition, killer Angon managed to trick Matt into pardoning himself while trying to

2932
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:55,000
pardon another player.

2933
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,160
Simply bereft of his rowdy affiliation, Matt quickly proceeded to don his best purple flannel

2934
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,240
and take a nice little picture.

2935
02:41:02,240 --> 02:41:08,400
Finally, last week, the rowdy territory control party known as Kappa Palooza took place, as

2936
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:13,520
organized by Soba, during which rowdies blasted music, shouted like idiots at each other,

2937
02:41:13,520 --> 02:41:16,360
and turned the entire map pink.

2938
02:41:16,360 --> 02:41:17,360
Ha!

2939
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:18,360
Uh, based?

2940
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:23,720
I mean, I shouldn't celebrate something like that.

2941
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:25,440
That's pretty base.

2942
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:26,440
It's kind of base, though.

2943
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,440
It sounds like fun.

2944
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:29,160
Uh, alright, well, there's the second part.

2945
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:31,480
Slime times weekend update 5.1.

2946
02:41:31,480 --> 02:41:34,160
Uh, 3, 2, 1, go.

2947
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:35,640
Part 2.

2948
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:40,800
This week, the curator of the Nalakakaw Museum decided to hold a celebration in the saloon

2949
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:43,160
and drop some archeological hints.

2950
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:46,680
As a result, a new area outside the city was discovered.

2951
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:52,880
The darkened dank caverns which harbored the Ark of the Sludgeonant, another relic of yore.

2952
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:56,760
These were the ones to solve the riddle and open the cave, but due to the obstruction of

2953
02:41:56,760 --> 02:42:01,520
a gameplay bug, the killers ended up catching up with the thrashing explorers and were able

2954
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:04,000
to take the artifact for themselves.

2955
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,280
Unfortunately, the frustration of this event proved too much for a few rowdies, and they

2956
02:42:08,280 --> 02:42:10,640
decided to take a break from the gang warfare.

2957
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:14,640
They also took some time to complain about the community and the killers in place of

2958
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:20,240
the longstanding issues, and the whole event had people from all sides pretty bummed out.

2959
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:23,120
This hoping heart will be uplifted in the weeks to come.

2960
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:24,560
That's it for this time.

2961
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:28,000
And remember, the slime time is the best time.

2962
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,640
Oh, seemed to have some time left.

2963
02:42:31,640 --> 02:42:34,800
Fuck you guy who set the PCP episode for too long.

2964
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:38,200
Fuck you for telling us that we shouldn't send in voicemails this week.

2965
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,200
Guess what?

2966
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:40,680
This one is twice as long.

2967
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:41,680
That's right.

2968
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:42,680
A full minute 20.

2969
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:43,680
Piss in your general direction.

2970
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:53,640
Your mother was a slime corp grunt, and your father was a stay dead.

2971
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:56,200
The word, pretty much the two worst things you could be.

2972
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:05,760
I was going to say, I hope the ones that decided to take a break from gang warfare, I hope what

2973
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:08,960
you mean is that they committed suicide and went stay dead.

2974
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:15,960
Historically, that is how you register disdain for gang violence, is by killing yourself

2975
02:43:15,960 --> 02:43:19,880
and being a ghost and hanging out in the sewers.

2976
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:22,480
I hope that culture is still alive and well.

2977
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:37,080
Oh, the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on.

2978
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:44,920
Okay, next one is called Prince Isolation BTWs A Question Answered, 3, 2, 1, go.

2979
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:52,240
Oh yeah, you guys were asking where that little message is, where you say that the PCP still

2980
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:56,200
has a hashtag that takes Twitter questions.

2981
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:59,840
It's on the PCP voicemail speak pipe page.

2982
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:05,840
When you click the link below your videos on the description, yeah, that's where it is.

2983
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:14,720
I see, I would never, I didn't even, hmm, okay, all right, maybe we should update that.

2984
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:15,720
Maybe.

2985
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:16,720
Maybe.

2986
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:26,840
Okay, next one is a vocaru file, all right, 3, 2, 1, go.

2987
02:44:26,840 --> 02:44:46,720
Oh, my God, my baby's about to say his first word, come here mate, look at, oh, it's Ethan.

2988
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:47,720
What did he say?

2989
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:48,720
See?

2990
02:44:48,720 --> 02:45:03,000
I can't hear it, stupid baby, stupid baby, that's barely, speak English, what are you,

2991
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:10,560
foreign babies, freak, can't understand you, give me a fucking break, anyway, there's an

2992
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:17,440
image, actually I'm not sure if this is, I think this is unrelated, yeah, the next voicemail

2993
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:25,280
is an image, that's the girl who thinks phantom horn is a trans allegory, has changed a major

2994
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:32,360
feature of his body in a way that made him happier, trans colors, there they are, yeah,

2995
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:39,440
has a dead name, but what's phantom horn's dead name, you know it, is it phantom horn,

2996
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:54,480
no, you don't remember his family name, oh, fuck, it was something like the dad is, wait,

2997
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:55,480
is it standard?

2998
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:01,600
It is standard, yeah, they're the standard family, so he's just a standard guy, until

2999
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:09,400
yeah, he changed his last name to horn, well his full name, it was substandard, lol, I

3000
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:15,240
imagine being like born and your parents call you substandard, well he was meant to make

3001
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:21,960
sandwiches at the deli, that was his destiny, but he decided that he had a higher calling

3002
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:30,840
in life, it's funny, who names the pony, like it would have been a baby, a little filly,

3003
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:35,880
he doesn't know that he doesn't have a cutie mark about subways, I think it might have

3004
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:41,760
been a digi brony thing theory, or maybe it wasn't even digi brony, maybe it was some

3005
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:51,240
other one, but someone had a theory that a pony's name can change if their cutie mark,

3006
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:54,520
that a pony can change their name when they get their cutie mark, and that would explain

3007
02:46:54,520 --> 02:47:01,120
why some ponies have weirdly on the nose names, I mean it's the only way you could explain

3008
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:07,640
that really. Yeah, so it was according to that theory,

3009
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:15,680
their family runs like a deli, and their dad was like, this son is going to make the sandwiches,

3010
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:23,720
and so they called him substandard, and yeah, I mean that's it, that's the joke.

3011
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:32,040
So it owns at least one katana, it's the next thing, I guess that's a trans, you know,

3012
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:37,400
I don't have a real katana, but I do have a fake one in the corner, little wooden one.

3013
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:43,160
I have a couple, I guess I'm not trans, but I have a couple shinai, I have the bamboo training

3014
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:48,560
swords, that's like pretty close, that should count for something, that means I'm an ally.

3015
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:53,880
That's a non-binary sword, I think. Oh, well, oops.

3016
02:47:53,880 --> 02:48:01,880
Former question mark, MLP fan, do they mean like phantom horn?

3017
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:07,560
Yeah, I mean he canonically, you know, he had the YouTube channel where he reviewed

3018
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:17,360
My Little Pony the show. Did you ever like explore like the in-world

3019
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:23,640
like implications, like is phantom horn watching a show that takes place in his hometown?

3020
02:48:23,640 --> 02:48:26,520
Yes. Like a documentary?

3021
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:34,320
The answer is just, no, I think it's, honestly, I'm not sure if it's like, if this is a documentary

3022
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:38,680
about like Princess Twilight Sparkle coming to live in Ponyville, or if it's about like

3023
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:43,720
fictional characters in a real setting. Yeah, I'm not sure which of those is true, I don't

3024
02:48:43,740 --> 02:48:52,240
think we ever really thought about it. One of them is definitely true. Like, yeah, actually

3025
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:56,760
that's a great question, like are the main six and like all the events of the show, like

3026
02:48:56,760 --> 02:49:03,760
are they canon to the T-Bap universe? I don't know. Maybe I should ask Nate his opinion

3027
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:08,680
about it. Like the T-Bap universe is, the T-Bap universe

3028
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:12,280
is the My Little Pony universe, if nothing interesting happened.

3029
02:49:12,320 --> 02:49:19,280
The T-Bap universe is the Brony Analyst universe, because like Gibb and Take and all the others,

3030
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:25,520
I love Kim Possible a lot, technically, because you appeared in her video.

3031
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:28,240
I did. I did, yes.

3032
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:31,360
Everything's connected. Dr. Wolf is part of that universe.

3033
02:49:31,360 --> 02:49:33,200
It is all connected.

3034
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:40,080
Yeah, well, the most sensible thing is that they're actors, actresses, and they play like a show.

3035
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:43,720
Like, what if our world was cool, the show?

3036
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:47,000
That's kind of like what real shows are like.

3037
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,200
I suppose so.

3038
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:56,480
What if our world was cool? Yeah, do you think that's how it is with the

3039
02:49:56,480 --> 02:50:04,920
the Brony Analyst community at large? Are the events of My Little Pony merely fictional

3040
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:11,600
events set in the world that those YouTuber avatar characters inhabit?

3041
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:15,480
Yes.

3042
02:50:15,480 --> 02:50:19,000
Then I guess that's how it is for T-Bap, too.

3043
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:22,960
Yeah, I mean, make sense to me.

3044
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:27,280
Honestly, now I wonder if there's an answer to this among like the Rift Cafe.

3045
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:29,880
I wonder if the Rift Cafe exists anymore.

3046
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:36,560
I very much doubt it exists in any forum like they used to.

3047
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:41,520
I mean, I'm sure it would be different. I would imagine people just like are still friends.

3048
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:44,640
I mean, some of them still do pony content.

3049
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:49,440
People still, there are still pony YouTubers, still pony tubing.

3050
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:55,000
Is Dr. Wolf still releasing like an analysis anarchy episodes?

3051
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:59,800
I think he is. Yeah, I think so.

3052
02:50:59,800 --> 02:51:01,560
Incredible.

3053
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:06,640
Now, I shake my finger.

3054
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:14,680
I wag my finger at anyone that tells me that Phantom's Revenge is too niche and can't succeed

3055
02:51:14,680 --> 02:51:21,760
when analysis anarchy, you know, is a cultural juggernaut in a powerhouse.

3056
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:29,480
Like that's, it's honestly, it's just, well, it's maybe not just as stupid or just as niche.

3057
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:33,240
I mean, Team Fortress 2 is something that more people know about.

3058
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:37,000
It's Team Fortress 2 and it's like jokes on the level of Big Bang Theory.

3059
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:43,520
Yeah, honestly, I guess it is even more niche than analysis anarchy.

3060
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,680
Were you there in the panel room?

3061
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:47,200
Yes.

3062
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:50,000
That we went to in the BronyCon 20 years.

3063
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,680
We sat right behind Christian.

3064
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:54,960
Oh, God, she was there.

3065
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:56,360
She was like right in front of us.

3066
02:51:58,640 --> 02:52:02,960
Well, yeah, what a time to be alive.

3067
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:05,200
What it was, they were good, good times.

3068
02:52:08,240 --> 02:52:10,040
Anyway, rest of this image.

3069
02:52:10,040 --> 02:52:10,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3070
02:52:10,840 --> 02:52:16,640
So former MLP fan and Loccom equals found family, I suppose that's true.

3071
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:18,760
Yep, for sure.

3072
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:21,320
Transitioned from Pony to SlimePony.

3073
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:23,760
That is, that is true.

3074
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:26,160
The ultimate HRT is Slime.

3075
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:31,000
You're jet, you're probably not wrong at all.

3076
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,480
That's literally alters your DNA.

3077
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:37,800
Yeah, there's, there's no, you're just right.

3078
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:40,320
You're just right about that.

3079
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:42,640
Slime has an E in it, coincidence.

3080
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:44,320
I don't know.

3081
02:52:44,800 --> 02:52:48,840
Like estrogen, like as much like estrogen, yeah.

3082
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:55,000
And epic epic communist classic trans character trait.

3083
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:56,840
Now, I'm not sure.

3084
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:59,720
I'm not sure how much of this is tongue in cheek.

3085
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:02,400
But I mean, I'll just say that, like.

3086
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:06,280
I mean, Phantom is this isn't a stretch at all.

3087
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:09,200
Phantom is explicitly, honestly,

3088
02:53:10,040 --> 02:53:13,360
originally sort of a cruel mockery.

3089
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:15,240
That's overstate.

3090
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:19,520
He's sort of a cruel send up of being trans originally in a way that I feel

3091
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:23,000
some guilt over in the way that I originally.

3092
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:25,800
Invasion, I didn't.

3093
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:29,200
I mean, I didn't mean him as like, I didn't mean him in like a cruel way.

3094
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:31,360
But in hindsight, I feel like the way that I

3095
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:36,720
designed him in a way that was commenting on like, yeah.

3096
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:39,720
I identify with having a horn.

3097
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:42,600
Yeah, I don't I don't really.

3098
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:46,920
I don't I mean, I wouldn't literally has like purple hair and has pronouns.

3099
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:48,640
I mean, he literally does.

3100
02:53:48,640 --> 02:53:52,320
He literally has his blue fur, blue fur and pronouns.

3101
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,840
He he what could I what could I say?

3102
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:00,600
What could I say about him?

3103
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:04,640
He I mean, I was I guess I was just defending

3104
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:07,360
being transracial on this very podcast.

3105
02:54:07,360 --> 02:54:10,040
And that's basically what Phantom is.

3106
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,080
So like.

3107
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:15,800
Yeah, he was he was sort of he was sort of supposed to be.

3108
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:17,920
A like.

3109
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:20,120
I hate to say it.

3110
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:22,040
This is this is true.

3111
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:25,760
But I think he was kind of supposed to be like an S.J.W.

3112
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:27,360
that takes it too far.

3113
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:28,360
You know what I mean?

3114
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:31,800
He's like, oh, well, this is this is he's he's just taken it.

3115
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:33,600
He's just gone too far with all this.

3116
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:37,040
His weird, his progressive values or whatever.

3117
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:41,560
And now I just think he's he's just I just agree.

3118
02:54:41,560 --> 02:54:43,640
I have come to just agree with him unironically.

3119
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:46,680
That's that's character development.

3120
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:49,400
I yeah, so he's no longer a joke.

3121
02:54:52,240 --> 02:54:55,720
And and that's a and that's character development.

3122
02:54:55,720 --> 02:54:57,160
Yeah, you're right. You said it.

3123
02:54:57,160 --> 02:54:59,360
So there you go.

3124
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:04,160
You're this image is just correct, I guess, more or less.

3125
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:09,160
True good to get through all I can say is true.

3126
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:14,840
Yep. OK, the next one is

3127
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:20,680
next one is called One Piece Lamel three to one go.

3128
02:55:21,400 --> 02:55:24,240
You know, I hope I still made it in time for the podcast because

3129
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:27,640
I heard you had trouble like getting it on Spotify and Google Music and stuff.

3130
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:31,320
So I hope I can help you by saying like you got all the distro kids now.

3131
02:55:31,720 --> 02:55:34,000
I heard really great service costs like ten bucks.

3132
02:55:34,360 --> 02:55:38,480
So you have to log in and it probably tells you what to do.

3133
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:41,640
I don't really know. So what it maybe check it out.

3134
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,440
I thought I thought what's he recommending?

3135
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:45,240
Obviously, you don't know how to do it.

3136
02:55:45,240 --> 02:55:47,920
So I thought I something something Spotify.

3137
02:55:48,920 --> 02:55:50,200
So keep it up.

3138
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:52,360
I've been listening to the podcast in like a couple of months

3139
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:55,800
because because I'm on Spotify, I'm like, well, I'm going to listen to it.

3140
02:55:56,160 --> 02:55:57,960
So I hope I can help. Bye bye.

3141
02:55:57,960 --> 02:55:59,520
Thank you.

3142
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:01,680
Thanks for the voice.

3143
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:03,480
I think that was a joke.

3144
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:06,720
No, I think he maybe just didn't realize that's what he sounded like.

3145
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:10,640
Like if you do it through your phone and you don't listen back to it.

3146
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:11,400
I can't tell.

3147
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:14,320
I can't tell if that was like a serious voicemail or not.

3148
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:16,400
I could barely make out what he was saying.

3149
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:21,200
I think he was just saying, hey, I'm ending some service that does something

3150
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:23,200
that helps with putting it on Spotify.

3151
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:25,920
OK, well, thanks.

3152
02:56:26,200 --> 02:56:28,640
But I think you need a little help getting it on.

3153
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:30,880
Speaking, getting it on speak. Yes. Yes, exactly.

3154
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:33,280
Yes, you're you got it.

3155
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:35,280
You got to fix your own house.

3156
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:39,920
Fix your own house before you try to clean up my living room, buddy.

3157
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,840
Next one is called puns four weeks late.

3158
02:56:44,760 --> 02:56:47,160
Three, two, one, go.

3159
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:48,120
An episode there, too.

3160
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:51,480
You were trying to come up with puns for marriage, divorce and a cliff.

3161
02:56:51,720 --> 02:56:54,320
How about they being in a rocky relationship?

3162
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:56,520
What?

3163
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:59,400
Oh, a rocky, oh, a rocky relationship.

3164
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:04,680
Yes, in the slime times, we can update about the two people getting married.

3165
02:57:05,800 --> 02:57:08,360
Yeah, yeah, two people got married

3166
02:57:08,360 --> 02:57:10,760
and then they like shoved each other off cliffs and died.

3167
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:14,800
So a rocky relationship, like they died on the rocks.

3168
02:57:14,800 --> 02:57:16,520
Oh, yeah, I think that works.

3169
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:17,680
I don't recall that.

3170
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,000
Maybe it wasn't on that one.

3171
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,680
I remember.

3172
02:57:21,680 --> 02:57:22,640
So, yeah, you know what?

3173
02:57:22,640 --> 02:57:24,440
This is better than anything I came up with.

3174
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:27,880
I would say that's a I would give this a solid B plus.

3175
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:31,600
And that's at least a passing grade.

3176
02:57:32,240 --> 02:57:33,640
I think that's it.

3177
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:34,440
Is it the last one?

3178
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:36,680
Yeah, that's our last horseman.

3179
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:37,400
There we go.

3180
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:38,600
We did it.

3181
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:40,000
All right.

3182
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,840
I feel like I got.

3183
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:47,240
I feel like I said some I had some insights to share on this episode.

3184
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:50,080
Glad I got to talk about phantom a little bit.

3185
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:55,520
Glad I got to talk about my views on transracialism

3186
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:57,440
and saying the N word on this episode.

3187
02:57:58,440 --> 02:57:59,240
Pretty pretty.

3188
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:03,960
I'm happy with I I can.

3189
02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:10,240
I can look myself in the mirror and say you're on a podcast and respect

3190
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:12,040
the face I see and say, how are you?

3191
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:13,640
How are you the winning sperm?

3192
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:19,200
I can look at myself at the end of the day.

3193
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:22,920
I can still look myself in the eye and say you are on a podcast.

3194
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:27,000
I guess that's it.

3195
02:58:27,080 --> 02:58:28,160
Yes.

3196
02:58:28,160 --> 02:58:30,360
Play phantom's revenge.

3197
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:31,560
Play phantom's revenge.

3198
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:32,840
Play pumpkin alley.

3199
02:58:32,840 --> 02:58:34,160
The pumpkin patch.

3200
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:35,520
Check out the pumpkin patch.

3201
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:37,120
Find that eight lizards.

3202
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:38,880
Can you find eight lizards?

3203
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:40,760
Can I only find four?

3204
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:41,480
Can you find?

3205
02:58:41,480 --> 02:58:42,160
Can you?

3206
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:42,840
Can you though?

3207
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:45,560
You think you can, but can you?

3208
02:58:45,560 --> 02:58:46,920
Let's find out.

02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:53,760

I was saying before there are a couple of like bonus episodes of like behind

3214

3215

I think there's like two.

3216
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,360
That's just I haven't put up, but I will this week.

3217
02:59:13,360 --> 02:59:15,040
Yeah, I'll do it this week.

3218
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:17,440
Um, that's it.

3219
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:21,000
You got any last words before I make you walk the plank?

3220
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:22,080
Yarr part.

3221
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:23,480
Yeah, yo, yeah, yo.

3222
02:59:23,480 --> 02:59:31,400
Oh, no, um, uh, uh, I just got shot and I'm dead.

3223
02:59:34,720 --> 02:59:35,440
You killed her.

3224
02:59:37,440 --> 02:59:38,560
OK, bye.
