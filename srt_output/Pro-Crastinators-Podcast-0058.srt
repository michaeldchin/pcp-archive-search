1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Food, I love food, and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog, a poo poo platter, two ding dongs, it doesn't matter.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,700
Had some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more, but don't add any salsa, cause I'll blow chunks on the floor.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,200
Wait!

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,700
I need to get back.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Welcome back to Stillin' Your Dads, if it was easy. Today we're- wait a second.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,200
This isn't the greatest podcast ever recorded that can be found on munchyshatsky.com to videogame.com slash channel.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Go to the description and look at that. This is some weird dystopian alternate reality, where the cool nuclear holocaust never happened, and the vintage hipster modernist super teenage nihilist world didn't get completely and utterly obliterated by the thousands of sickest stage 3 neurosophilists, radical galactic eternity Maltovs, which changed the chemical makeup of the planet into the individual atom level, forever thrusting the world into an infinite aesthetic of cyberpunk, post-cyberpunk, biopunk, nano-punk, steampunk, diesel-punk, stone-punk, clown-punk, elf-punk, etc.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Mith-punk, dream-punk, atom-punk, weasel-punk, trash-punk, dad-punk, seizure-punk, fancy-santa-punk, and most of all, cluster-punk, all at the same time, even the ones that contradict each other, especially the ones that contradict each other.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,200
That never happened, this cock-suckingly terrifying timeline. Everything's just like normal, not completely obliterated, it's physically, mentally, and spiritually.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,200
They haven't figured out how to thoroughly utilize an irony's fully and unbelievably destructive force and use it against one another.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Holy fuck, did you- I'm freaking the fuck out, it's crazy dude, it's crazy.

12
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:40,200
I know man, I thought that we were always gonna be in the future, and now we're not in the future, but in the other future, the not-good future is fucking-

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
We have to go back.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Also known as the present.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Oh my god, it's other people.

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
We have to go back to the present.

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Well, you don't fuck it, whatever, we're just here now, alright.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
I forgot about other people.

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Well, good work guys, hey everybody.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Welcome back to the PC bit for another fun episode.

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Welcome back to the dystopian multi-punk podcast, the piece, the procrastinator's podcast.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Multi-punk?

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, multi-punk, that's how I condense all that bullshit.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah, multi-cultural punk, yeah.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Multi-cultural punk.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm the best guy ever, Ben Sains here.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Yep.

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Did you bro?

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Hey, I'm here from the other future.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Hippocrite?

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I have just eaten many chicken nuggets, so this is appropriate.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Oh, perfect.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Munchy.

34
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Alternate universe Munchy from a different union?

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
You can write slash fiction about Munchy and alternate universe Munchy now.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
That's juicy stuff.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Alternate universe Munchy just has like an eye patch and like where's like, instead of the light and good Munchy of this universe that dresses like a hamburger,

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,200
the evil one dresses like, he has an eye patch and he dresses like, I don't know, like a dark chocolate cake.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
That's fucking wrong.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah, it's fucking wrong.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
All right, hey, shut up everybody, because Eddless Jess is here.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Yep, I sure am.

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Okay, there you go.

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
That settles it.

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
So our topic today is food.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Wait, did we introduce him?

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
I don't remember.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Yeah, we did.

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
I said chicken nuggets.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
That's right.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
LOL.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
So, Urban Dictionary Food, here we go.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
No.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,200
A substance that, here we go, a substance that you eat, then poop out, usually followed by a nap.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
That's a good one.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I like it.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Wait, who naps off to pooping?

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I napped directly on my poop, you know, it's out and then I fall in a heap.

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,200
You roll it out as like a bed when you lay in it.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
I like to be asleep during pooping.

61
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
So, God, what the fuck are we even talking about?

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Yeah, I like food.

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
It's good.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah, of course.

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Well, I think you're going to talk about is the contentious food thing.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
I think you're all going to take the opposite stance on this one.

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Yeah, I think you're all going to be surprised by my nuanced take of what I think about food.

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I fully expected, coming into this, that Jesse was going to be the opposition to the idea that food is good.

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,200
You know, guys, I've said it before, but this might be the most Jesse is right episode of this entire show.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Food in real life is the curse of, is the dark sign of real life.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
That's what addiction to food is.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
That's what it is in real life.

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
It damns us all from birth to the grave.

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
There is no escape.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
We just keep coming back like the poor saps we are.

76
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:36,200
We have to have energy, but we've come up with plenty of ways to make the energy that we intake interesting enough and different enough to be kind of fun.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Kind of, you know, you're making a best of a bad situation.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
We have stomachs, we need to feed them.

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
We may as well have good food.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Running in your body is secondary to being cool.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay, eating with my bros is more fun than eating alone.

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Because when you're eating with your bros, you have that intimate experience of like, yeah, we are re-consuming.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
We are vulnerable.

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,200
We could be sexually assaulted at any time, but you know what, we're just going to rock that.

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,200
We're just going to rock it.

86
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Does being in a group increase or decrease the chances of being sexually assaulted?

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Increase.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
It depends on the group and if they're eating or not.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
It makes it all the more succulent.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Yeah, all the more succulent.

91
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Well, let me, I think I will also probably have a slightly different stance than some people here because I see-

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I think I know what you're going to say.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I think you're going to come down on the food as fuel side of it.

94
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
That's exactly what I'm going to say.

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Food is food.

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,200
You know, we are slaves to our biological impulses that, by the way, are 100% outdated.

97
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,200
The lust we all have for salt is because way back in a fucking billion years ago when you could find like one grain of salt,

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,200
you know, fucking an entire lifetime, that's when like our desire, that's not even a lie.

99
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
That's true.

100
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Right.

101
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
That shit was programmed.

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Before this goes any further, I just want to say, I want to fast forward and say,

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
okay, Nate, you're right, but I don't care.

104
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
And also-

105
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Hashtag weird utilitarianism.

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Hashtag weird utilitarianism.

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I kind of wanted this podcast to be-

108
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
You just predicted like the end of every podcast ever.

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
It's true.

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's true.

111
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,200
But I kind of wanted this podcast to be, we each say a food and then the others say,

112
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,200
oh my god, I can't believe you like that and that would be the whole thing.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Can I start with one?

114
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Can I start with one?

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Yeah, go ahead.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Big dick.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Big-

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Flap.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You know it.

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Dog.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Yeah, okay.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I can't believe you like that.

123
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I can't believe you like that.

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Don't like that.

125
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Well, we've all learned a lot here today.

126
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
All right, here's the thing.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Here's what I'm going to say.

128
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Pepperoni sucks.

129
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
What?

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
No.

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
You piece of-

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I know, I agree.

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
He's right.

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Get the fuck out of here.

135
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Get the fuck out of here, you hot piece of ass.

136
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
You sexy little babe.

137
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
He's right.

138
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
He's right.

139
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Pepperoni.

140
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
He's a little army.

141
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Just wants to ruin everyone's time and just fucking stick their wax in anyone else's ears.

142
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,200
The thing about pepperoni is that I like all that sort of like Italian sausage stuff,

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
like the parma ham and the, you know, the pepperoni-

144
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
And the prosciutto?

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
The pepperoni!

146
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
You like the prosciutto?

147
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Yes.

148
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
I like all that sort of stuff.

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
But it's nice as like a cold meat to have with like cheese or olives or something.

150
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I got some cold meat for you, my dude.

151
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Why is it cold?

152
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Have you been fucking in the fridge?

153
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I don't know, because I got fucking jaundice.

154
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
My extremities are dying.

155
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Yep, yep.

156
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
That's what I mean.

157
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Ah, there's another person who hasn't had my attention.

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,200
But pepperoni, as I have researched, is an American invention which is sort of like

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,200
taking what it's from and then inventing it and making it gross and greasy and salty and disgusting.

160
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
And they put it on every pizza.

161
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
That's American cuisine.

162
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
The reason I don't like pepperoni is because it's so ubiquitous.

163
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
If it wasn't so ubiquitous, I'd be like...

164
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
So he's a hipster, is he, Ziai?

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Yes, I am.

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
He's a hipster crit.

167
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
That's the funny thing about it.

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,200
And I don't know if you've made it this far and biggest problem with the universe hippo,

169
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,200
but Maddox had a whole long argument about why pepperoni was bad.

170
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Essentially, raising that point that you should eat the better versions like salami and fucking all that shit.

171
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Well, no.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I think it's okay on pizza.

173
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I just don't like that everybody likes it and that's like the default pizza when it's not my favorite topping.

174
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
It is odd.

175
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I do wonder how it came to be that pizza's two default flavors are now nothing or this one specific sausage.

176
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Well, I gotta say that while I appreciate how weird that is,

177
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,200
it for me is one of the few victories I have in life because I...

178
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
That you have.

179
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
That you did this.

180
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
This was your doing.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
No, no, no.

182
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Just a spiritual victory, you know, because I love pepperoni pizza.

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,200
And so the fact that I can go to any place and guaranteed they will have my shit.

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Like, if someone says, oh, we're throwing a pizza party, I can show up with some confidence knowing they will have the pizza I like

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
because everyone has the pizza I like, which is not true of any other food.

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
There's nothing I can show up and be guaranteed they're gonna have it, you know.

187
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
That's true.

188
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,200
But across the board, pepperoni is like this thin, disgusting, greasy, little slab of meat that's not even very flavorful.

189
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
I got a thin, disgusting, greasy, little slab of meat for ya.

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
You know, I always think that pepperoni's not that flavorful until I eat a pizza without it and then I just miss it.

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
It is very flavorful.

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
It's just a specific flavor that I don't like.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,200
And I don't think salami, putting like better quality meat on it would solve the problem.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I think just, you know, maybe a different, maybe like jalapenos and chicken or something.

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
There's no other meat that I really like on pizza.

196
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
But vegetables can, yeah, you can eat a pizza with just jalapenos and it's all right.

197
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
But a lot of people can't handle the jalapenos.

198
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm not that into jalapenos personally.

199
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Hey, here's a quandary for ya.

200
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I have here something I'm very excited about.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I have a can of Diet Code Red Mountain Dew.

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
And I want you guys to weigh in on whether this is food or not.

203
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,200
All Mountain Dew should be fucking abolished and drinking it should be punishable by firing squad.

204
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
That's right.

206
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
What, diet? Diet shit?

207
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
No, all Mountain Dew.

208
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Oh, all Mountain Dew.

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, I'm ready.

210
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I was ready for someone to jump on me for diet.

211
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Cause I'm a big proponent of diet beverages.

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
They're like my favorite shit in the whole world.

213
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Mountain Dew is just like radioactive yak slime put in a can.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's the same as any other bullshit.

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
No, like all pop is poison, but Mountain Dew tastes like the poison that it is.

216
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't disagree and I drink a lot of it.

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
It's just this fucking sugary, ogre sweat.

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It doesn't belong in anyone's body.

219
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
It doesn't belong in anyone's mouth.

220
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Guys, let me, let me, let me get down on soda.

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I consider myself an expert on the, on the soda issue because I have gone roughly three years now drinking next to no soda, just like the occasional soda when it happens to be around.

222
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I spent an entire year.

223
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I went for a rose dedicated effort to drink no soda at all.

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,200
And let me just tell you, when I came back and drank a soda after that, it was like, it was so powerful.

225
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
It was so like my body was just like, what are you doing?

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,200
You guys, if you're, if you're drinking soda and this tastes like good to you, I'm just letting you know that you are, you have done damage to your body.

227
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
You are fucking it up right now.

228
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
That's all the shit.

229
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I had gone 23 years without drinking soda.

230
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I've never, I hate it.

231
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Really?

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
It's, it's never been nice to me because of that, because of that carbonated burp afterwards.

233
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,200
You know, Nate, that's actually a plot point in the dark tower because Roland is not from our world.

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:56,200
He, he gets his, like his finger bitten off by a giant lobster and like he goes to our world and he gets like some aspirin and Pepsi to like wash it down.

235
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,200
And he's never had Pepsi before and he drinks it and he like becomes a superhuman because he's never had Pepsi before.

236
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It blows his whole perception of the universe, opens his mind, it increases his Christ consciousness.

237
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
That's cool.

238
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
That story reminds me of, have you guys all seen David Lynch Cook's quinoa?

239
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I am.

240
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
No, but you've told me about it.

241
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
It's, okay.

242
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Well, it's like, it's this like dark, like black and white, just, it's just, they're just filming David Lynch in his kitchen, just like cooking quinoa.

243
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
And he's kind of shit at it, but whatever.

244
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
He like cooks this quinoa and talks about what he's doing.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:38,200
And then he goes out and sits on his porch and has a cigarette and tells this bizarre story about like a train ride through like fucking Eastern Europe or whatever.

246
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And part of the, part of the story involves like taking this girl from Yugoslavia to like Paris and like buying her the first Coca-Cola she's ever had.

247
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,200
And meanwhile he's like, yeah, he like, I don't know, he just peppers the story with weird, like they get off the train and moths.

248
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Like moth larva are crawling up out of the ground and leaping up into the air like frogs and these frog moths are just flying around.

249
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,200
And I gave, and I gave the cashier, and I gave the cashier this tiny, the tiniest little, little coin.

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
And he gave me a big piece of paper money in return for change.

251
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
And then I go to the next place and I paid with the paper money.

252
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,200
And then he just pours handfuls and handfuls of coins into my hands.

253
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
So many I have to use both hands to catch them.

254
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
And my, they're just about to overflow.

255
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,200
And there's so many coins until the moment I look up at him and then he stops.

256
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
And that's beautiful.

257
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I did make a giant batch of quinoa once and it was pretty good.

258
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Yeah, that's my relationship to that.

259
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Anyway, I just wanted to plug, I just wanted to plug David Lynch Cook's quinoa.

260
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
It's really great.

261
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Well, let me just say about that.

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,200
What's cool about that is I like that he gave someone their first Coca-Cola.

263
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Because there is nothing wrong with occasionally getting down and dirty and drinking some absolute garbage like soda.

264
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Yeah, that's a soda pop.

265
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
That's real edgy shit.

266
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
That's real edgy shit for me.

267
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I'll tell you guys.

268
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm just saying, but you can't do it all the time or you're not going to appreciate it.

269
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
That's what I'm saying.

270
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:10,200
I drank nothing but Mountain Dew for about 13 years for my entire, like, I don't know, 9 to 21 or something.

271
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,200
And like, yeah, it's addictive and it's bad.

272
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,200
It makes you feel like shit and it also doesn't taste good.

273
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,200
And then I got off of that and on to diet green tea.

274
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:31,200
And then at some point I started working soda back in because I just, what's great about soda to me is that it is like acid.

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Like, you drink it and it just melts away everything, you know?

276
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
You know what else does that?

277
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Brushing your fucking teeth.

278
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
No, no, no.

279
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm talking about like when you're eating food, like it's a palate cleanser.

280
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
You know, like you go out to lunch and you eat some stuff.

281
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
If you consider like acid washing your fucking mouth, palate cleansing, like I guess.

282
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah, like you take a drink of Sprite and then it just completely clears out all the flavors and stuff that run your mouth and makes you feel refreshed.

283
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I agree.

284
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Yeah, you take a gulp of soda and it just like sears away all the other flavors.

285
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
That's the whole point of it for me.

286
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Weird.

287
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
I don't know.

288
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
That's what like water is for though.

289
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
You take a sip of water and then you still taste whatever you were just eating.

290
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Exactly.

291
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Then you down a gallon of that shit.

292
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
And maybe you should eat some good stuff that is nice to taste for the whole day.

293
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,200
If you drink like a juice or something, it just kind of like mixes with the flavor of whatever you're eating and it's just not quite right.

294
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
That's true.

295
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Like tea, especially hot tea, will have this effect of like it'll, you know, it'll burn away everything that's in there.

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Yeah, hot tea.

297
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,200
But soda will just, you take one sip and it just, it feels like you swallowed a bunch of acid that just burns away everything that's in you.

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Surely you could get that same feeling from like orange juice because that's quite citric.

299
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Yeah, I was going to say, I'm a big orange juice and soda guy.

300
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I just said the orange juice taste mixes with the stuff that's in your mouth.

301
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Yeah, orange juice is really kind of lumpy.

302
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Lumpy?

303
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Well, I mean, did you mean pulp?

304
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,200
I told you to get the kind with the pulp.

305
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Let me just say, one of my, I'm the biggest orange juice fan of the world.

306
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It is by far my favorite thing.

307
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I'd sacrifice everything else in my life.

308
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
But the thing is, you cannot get orange juice anymore that has lots of pulp.

309
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
When I was a child, lots of pulp was a thing you could buy.

310
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Now the most you can get is some pulp.

311
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
No, that's because nobody likes the bits.

312
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I love bits.

313
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I love bits.

314
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I love lots of pulp.

315
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,200
I know, I know that they still have lots of pulp orange juice.

316
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I've seen it.

317
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Not in my fucking city, dude.

318
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
I've been to every grocery store.

319
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
I don't know.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
There's an embargo just on your city.

321
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah.

322
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
It's possible.

323
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Maybe they just hate fucking citric.

324
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,200
There's a pulp, there's a pulp, a quota that has to be met.

325
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Whenever I went to Florida, I could get some fucking pulp in my eyes.

326
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
I can't believe you like that.

327
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Here's my Breavage Diet.

328
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,200
For every one liter of soda I will drink, I will drink two, like boxes of orange juice.

329
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,200
And then for every two boxes of orange juice that I'll drink, I'll drink four,

330
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I'll drink four, whatever they're called, of water.

331
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
You know, I'm glad you said that because I was going to say the thing about juice

332
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,200
that a lot of people don't just, they probably know, but they just don't think about much,

333
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,200
is that juice is incredibly calorie dense and you can get super fat just drinking juice.

334
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Yeah.

335
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
That's why orange juice is like, like now that I'm off soda completely,

336
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,200
drinking an orange juice has been elevated to like a god-like experience.

337
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
It's just the most delicious, satisfying.

338
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,200
It's like, if that's my cake, like orange juice is like eating a fucking piece of cake.

339
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Decadent.

340
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Yeah, exactly.

341
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Yeah.

342
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
It is fucking decadent.

343
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
I love it.

344
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
I know what you mean because it's just like, it's like candy.

345
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,200
It's like, it's like fucking sugar syrup is like what a, what a juice is.

346
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Yeah, I don't actually drink that much juice.

347
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,200
You know what, maybe this is fucked up, like me being fucking health conscious is me going,

348
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,200
no, no, I won't drink that glass of orange, of fresh squeezed orange juice.

349
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I'll have this diet Mountain Dew Code Red instead.

350
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Well, the calories make sense there.

351
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Yeah, in certain, in certain, looked at from a certain angle, it's reasonable.

352
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,200
There's a couple of very important questions that I think have to be answered by this podcast

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
or else we will have failed this miserably.

354
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
The first important question is what are you eating right now?

355
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I'm, I'm eating.

356
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,200
So I actually went to the grocery store right before we started and I have a big old bag of pistachios.

357
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
And these are rather indulgent.

358
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh man, I fucking love pistachios.

359
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I mean, they're kind of salty, but they're delicious.

360
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
They got excellent unsaturated fats.

361
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Oh, it's the good stuff, man.

362
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I have not had pistachios in a while.

363
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm all about cashews when it comes to nuts because they're smooth.

364
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
Well, okay.

365
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I do, I do have a bag of cocoa, of like cocoa powder, like coated almonds in my pantry right now.

366
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Those are delicious.

367
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I don't like almonds at all.

368
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I don't like that.

369
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Oh, I fucking, whoa, whoa, whoa.

370
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Do you have toasted almonds?

371
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,200
When I, when I bite into an almond, all it does is just go into every tooth in my mouth.

372
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Like it just immediately gets stuck everywhere.

373
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Untoasted almonds are shit.

374
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Toasted almonds are the shit.

375
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,200
One time for Christmas, my mom got me a bag of almonds and I was like, these are pretty good.

376
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
But they're not toasted.

377
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,200
So I toasted them myself and I learned how to toast nuts.

378
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
It was the best day of my young life.

379
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I've had some toasted nuts for you, my dude.

380
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Alright, well that's what Nate's eating, is anybody else?

381
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm eating the leftover chocolate syrup and this double-sharp espresso that I poured myself to do the intro.

382
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,200
And now I'm just wallowing away.

383
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Are you sort of sticking your tongue down the glass, trying to lick it out?

384
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Yeah.

385
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm doing it.

386
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Sick.

387
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm not eating because I've just eaten, but I am drinking cis-white male tears of my own brand.

388
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,200
And I'm looking into freezing them into ice cubes to sell as like a food product.

389
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
That's good.

390
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
That's good.

391
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Oh my god.

392
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Cis-white males of the world.

393
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
You're sitting on a gold mine.

394
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Oh man.

395
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,200
One more advantage cis-white males have over the rest of the day is they can sell their tears.

396
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Everyone's gets rich is a gold rush.

397
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Is anybody else eating your chocolate?

398
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,200
He's got like a beehive out back full of cis-white males constantly producing tears.

399
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Jess, are you eating anything?

400
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm drinking tea, sans chicken, today.

401
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Okay.

402
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Because I feel like I'm not eating again.

403
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
No!

404
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Don't bring him back!

405
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
We haven't spoken of him in months.

406
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
He was almost gone.

407
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
No!

408
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
The dark emperor of the PCP is just trapped in the corner.

409
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Occasionally being like, let me the fuck back in guys.

410
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Don't forget me.

411
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,200
He's over there fucking rattling his chains like Marley and Marley.

412
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Exactly.

413
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I'm not eating anything.

414
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I'll never eat anything ever again because eating is wrong and cowardly and no human should ever do it.

415
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm sick of it.

416
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
It's certainly cowardly.

417
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I hit my breaking point last night where I had to put my foot down and say no more.

418
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm drawing a lion in the sand.

419
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
I'm done.

420
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm boycotting food for the rest of my life like fucking Gandhi because I was fucking sitting there.

421
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
It was like three in the morning and I'm watching Nates.

422
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Everybody be a fit boy and exercise video thinking oh man Nates.

423
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Such a pretty boy.

424
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Would that I could be so pretty.

425
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,200
But I'm sitting there at three in the morning watching this video and I'm shoveling chocolate cake in my mouth.

426
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,200
And I'm eating like three slices of microwave leftover pizza.

427
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,200
And I'm dipping the pizza in like this fucking sugary sauce because I went with my woman to a restaurant.

428
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,200
We got this sauce at this restaurant and because we're both such disgusting slobs.

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,200
We went to the waitress and said can we please have some of this sauce and like a jar or something.

430
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Can you scoop it off the wall so we can take it home.

431
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
So I've got this like restaurant sauce and this pizza and this chocolate cake.

432
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
And I'm just sitting there being a piece of shit.

433
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Being an anti-human abomination.

434
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Watching Nate be a monkey king on these fucking pull-ups.

435
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
And I said that's it.

436
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm Gandhi now.

437
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Never again.

438
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I'll never eat a food until I'm dead.

439
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
And that's my goal for this month.

440
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,200
You're not like an anti-human since that you're like the opposite of a human.

441
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,200
You're an anti-human since that you're like an anti-pasta.

442
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Like before you eat a human you will be like the appetizer before the ogre gets to the actual humans.

443
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Let me just say the whole anti-pasta movement is just the opposite of everything I like about human civilization.

444
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I can't help it.

445
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Well anyways what I'm eating is this beautiful roasted pork over what is it called mustard greens.

446
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
But they're called like something mustard greens preserved.

447
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Preserved mustard greens and cabbage.

448
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
I got it at a Chinese restaurant last night.

449
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,200
This one this is Chinese restaurant in my town that has two menus.

450
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
They have a white people menu and an Asian people menu.

451
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
They give you both if they're not sure.

452
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
You know what you're there for.

453
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
They say dude with this lucky star shirt they're like we just don't know where this man lies.

454
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,200
The one menu is just like all the standard crap you get at a Chinese restaurant.

455
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,200
The other menu is like frog and fucking jellyfish and like all this weird shit.

456
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Which I ordered this off of that menu even though it's not particularly strange.

457
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
But it's a steamed pork.

458
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,200
It's like in like a soup and the soup just tastes like it's just salt.

459
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,200
But it's pretty delicious.

460
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
The meat just fucking falls away.

461
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
It's like a very tender you know you take a bite and it just comes right off.

462
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
And then cabbage man.

463
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Cabbage should be in everything.

464
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I fucking love cabbage.

465
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Boiled cabbage.

466
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
That's great.

467
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It's such a good base.

468
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,200
It's really good when people discover a vegetable that they like and then they can eat fill up on it.

469
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
I'm surprised.

470
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,200
These fucking mustard greens which just looks like a fucking like a disgusting black massive bullshit.

471
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
But it's actually great.

472
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Everything in this is great.

473
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
I have discovered the miracle of Brussels sprouts.

474
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Brussels sprouts cooked in bacon fat.

475
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
They see it well.

476
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
They're pretty good on their own.

477
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,200
But if you cook them in a little bacon fat they become a transcendent experience.

478
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Possibly my favorite vegetable.

479
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,200
About Brussels sprouts is that I've always hated them and I decided one time to just start liking them

480
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,200
because you know every Christmas you have to eat them so I was like I may as well look like a good boy

481
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
and finish everything on my plate and I eat them.

482
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I don't think that's a thing in America having to eat Brussels sprouts on Christmas.

483
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Oh well okay whatever it's just a thing.

484
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
They're all looking at Oliver Twist over here.

485
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
He's the only one who has to eat that shit.

486
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Can I have some more?

487
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Oh I don't want any more.

488
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,200
More Brussels sprouts with my Christmas gruel.

489
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,200
But yeah it's like there's always been a thing in my family of you know finish what's on your plate.

490
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I mean my dad doesn't care so much but my grandpa was always like if you don't finish what's

491
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
because you know the war was a time when you had to ration your food.

492
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Otherwise you've got to eat everything you have.

493
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
You have a grandpa.

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
That sounds fascinating.

495
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Who would your grandpa be?

496
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
He sounds like the most interesting man in the world.

497
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I mean the grandpa I'm talking about is actually very quiet and reserved.

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Is it Winston Churchill? Just tell me it's Winston Churchill.

499
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
That's what I want to know.

500
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:32,200
He was an RAF pilot but he was very quiet and he's like me but if he didn't make a YouTube channel.

501
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Oh no.

502
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
That sounds awesome.

503
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:42,200
So anyway there was this one time when I was a little boy and I was like you know he was looking after me

504
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,200
because my parents were doing something and we were eating food and I didn't like the vegetables.

505
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I was like yeah because usually I don't eat vegetables as a kid and he's like I don't want to finish it.

506
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I can go play now and he said no sit down you have to finish it and I'm like but that's never happened to me.

507
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I've never been told to stay at the table and he kept us there for hours.

508
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
We were crying near my brothers.

509
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,200
It was traumatic but ever since then ever since then I felt bad if I leave food on a plate

510
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,200
because you know I don't want to waste anything so Brussels sprouts I eat them now.

511
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I don't like them but they're okay.

512
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
There you go.

513
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Trauma is good for children.

514
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Whoever is cooking those Brussels sprouts just tell them to cook them in bacon fat.

515
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
That's the secret.

516
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
That's the secret.

517
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah.

518
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I'll tell you Nate I totally am with you on this.

519
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm going to eat some blue pills right here.

520
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I'm totally with you on the magic of discovering a new vegetable because I grew up,

521
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
unlike a hippo's grandpa my parents were not strict at all about making us eat everything

522
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:49,200
and so I just ate no vegetables at all for like the majority of my life except maybe like a carrot here and there

523
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
or some corn which doesn't even do anything.

524
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,200
So like as I was becoming an adult I remember I had this moment of discovery with onions.

525
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Like I had always just thought onions were shitty and disgusting and then all of a sudden I don't remember what it was I ate

526
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
but it had onions and I was like oh my god this is a magical experience and I got to a point where I would just

527
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
literally boil a whole onion and eat it.

528
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
What the fuck?

529
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
That's pretty sick.

530
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I just eat onion all the time.

531
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
It's delicious.

532
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
I wouldn't just eat an onion.

533
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Yes.

534
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
That's because you're weak man.

535
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Onions are good for you because they make you cry and that's emotionally healthy.

536
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
It's important.

537
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
And you can sell what is.

538
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
They also have.

539
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
That onion paid for itself.

540
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,200
If you look up like any vegetable and then like put it into Google like is this healthy?

541
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,200
It'll just turn up like 80 articles about how healthy that fucking vegetable is.

542
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
So.

543
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
The issue of health is so complex.

544
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Because like every vegetable has some nutrients and every nutrient like does something and so like.

545
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I honestly think your average person is better off like not actually digging too deeply into like oh my god is this healthy for me?

546
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Yeah.

547
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Is that healthy for me?

548
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Like the general rule of like eating lots of vegetables.

549
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Just if you stick to that and if you can do like the Mediterranean sort of diet.

550
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Yeah.

551
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
That's like the healthiest diet.

552
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
You know you can't be like you can't be like.

553
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,200
You can't be like oh lime beans prevent colon cancer better throw some of them in my diet.

554
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Oh and right and celery prevents eye strain or better better toss some of that in for lunch.

555
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
God I hate celery.

556
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Celery sucks.

557
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I was more.

558
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Yeah I mean that's true.

559
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
But what was Jesse saying?

560
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
You cut them off.

561
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Oh.

562
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Like a rude piece of shit.

563
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Left my ass.

564
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I think we cut each other off.

565
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Isn't it like a known phenomenon that like nobody in like the nutrition community can decide if eggs are good for you or not?

566
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Well I mean there's a debate.

567
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Some people think eggs cause cancer which is a bit strange.

568
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I mean I don't know all the details.

569
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Well I mean everything causes cancer.

570
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I mean soda pop is liquefied cancer.

571
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
For what it's worth.

572
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Most people still prefer that.

573
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Eggs do cause A cancer.

574
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
They cause A cancer on the breakfast industry.

575
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,200
And I'm glad I get to rehash this rant that I called into the dick show and they didn't play my voicemail.

576
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
But eggs have ruined all of.

577
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Look I don't wake up at 5 a.m. like normal people right.

578
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I just am up at 5 a.m.

579
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:16,200
And I want to get something to eat cause I'm hungry and I go out and all anywhere will serve me is fucking eggs.

580
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Because somehow it became determined that breakfast just means eggs.

581
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Like it doesn't.

582
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
That's all it is.

583
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It's just stuff.

584
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
But we put eggs in it.

585
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
You know so like you can go to any of the fast food places that open early.

586
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Anywhere that you go that's like a breakfast place.

587
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,200
All they'll fucking give you is some variation of eggs.

588
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
And I don't really like eggs.

589
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
I mean I can eat them.

590
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
They're fine.

591
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
But I just think they're bland and boring.

592
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,200
I like eggs but I also resent being served eggs as a meal.

593
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Because I know they cost the restaurant like 30 cents for that.

594
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Like I know that that's true of everything.

595
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
But I feel especially ripped off.

596
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Because they're so cheap that like you know it's like this cultural institution of like

597
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
hey breakfast is eggs.

598
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
And every restaurant is going to be like hell yeah I want to serve fucking eggs with everything.

599
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Two poached eggs.

600
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Six and a half dollars please.

601
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
You know eggs are really revolting if you think about them.

602
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Sometimes I'm eating an egg and I think about like what it actually is that I'm eating.

603
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Like this is just like a toenail that came out of a chicken's butt.

604
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
And inside of it there's like a goopy fetus that's like not fully developed.

605
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
And I'm just shoveling that in my mouth.

606
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
And like sometimes you crack open an egg and you get those twins.

607
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
And that's even more disgusting.

608
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
You're like oh my god that's two goopy fetuses.

609
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
But I'm going to eat it anyways.

610
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Sometimes you might crack open an egg and it's like kind of developed.

611
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
And you're like oh my god am I going to eat that one.

612
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes I guess I will because I'm a piece of fucking garbage.

613
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I sometimes feel like there's like eyeballs in it and like little feathers.

614
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Sometimes I think of that.

615
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
But a lot of the time I don't.

616
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,200
But the reason is because I like scrambled eggs the most.

617
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Because it doesn't look goopy and slimy and disgusting.

618
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
It's just nice and kind of rubbery.

619
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
And you eat it with bacon and toast.

620
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
It's good like that.

621
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
At some point, I was always against this.

622
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,200
But at some point Nate converted me to the runny sunny side up eggs.

623
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Dude.

624
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I don't know.

625
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,200
You squish the runny yolks over your toast or your hash browns or something.

626
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I hate that.

627
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
It's so good.

628
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,200
If you are out there fucking cooking your yolks all the way through,

629
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,200
you are thrown away 99% of the fucking flavor.

630
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,200
You're thrown away your life away if you don't eat runny yolks.

631
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,200
If I'm going to be devouring chicken fetus, I want it as goopy as possible.

632
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Fuck yeah dude.

633
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Fuck yeah.

634
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I will admit, if you're doing it like sunny side up,

635
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
it shouldn't be hard in the yellow bit.

636
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I am a human chicken abortion machine.

637
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
That's my rank and title.

638
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Isn't fruit pretty much all just like plant vaginas or dicks or something anyways?

639
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Yeah.

640
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
It's all tree ejaculates.

641
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
We're always just guzzling cum, just in every direction from all things.

642
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Everything is cum and vaginas and goopy shit, poopy.

643
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Everything is gross and I love it and I want it all.

644
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Here's a trick.

645
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Here's a bizarre thing that I just learned.

646
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,200
If you're cooking eggplants, if you're buying eggplants,

647
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,200
go to the store and look at the bottom of the eggplant and see whether the little hole

648
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,200
at the bottom where the stem or whatever, the little point at the bottom.

649
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
See if it's round or if it's like a slot, like a line.

650
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Because if it's a slot, that's a female eggplant.

651
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
If it's a round dot, it's a male eggplant.

652
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah, and the female eggplants have more seeds and are worse.

653
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
So you always want to buy the male eggplant.

654
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
What kind of Seth Rogen food fight shit are you on?

655
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
And you always want to buy the ones with the dots.

656
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Hashtag dots not slots.

657
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I learned that from Chef John of foodwishes.com

658
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
who I've been fucking watching shit tons of cooking videos on lately.

659
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
This is a story about eggplants suck.

660
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Well, my shut up monkey, I just want to answer Nate and say that

661
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,200
my girlfriend Jackie is the best cook I've ever met in my entire life.

662
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
And yes, we watch a lot of cooking videos together.

663
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Gross.

664
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
And it's great fun.

665
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
You sound defensive about that, but I'm not being accusatory.

666
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,200
When I was a baby yesterday, I was eating an egg

667
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
and my mother was in the room and she said,

668
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
you know what that is?

669
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
And I was like, what?

670
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,200
That's meat in its purest form, bitch.

671
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
And I was like, fuck yeah.

672
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I guess it is.

673
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,200
It's actually not meat at all because meat is muscle

674
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
and there is literally no muscle involved.

675
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Yeah, it's like pre muscle.

676
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,200
It's like a pre before it becomes an actual meat chicken.

677
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Well, OK, I mean, sure.

678
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,200
All right, so there's a second very important question

679
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
that I felt had to be answered by this podcast.

680
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It'll also be a huge failure.

681
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Which is what is everybody's favorite food?

682
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Obviously.

683
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Here is something that Ben St. has stolen from me

684
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
that he can never repay.

685
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
OK.

686
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
His love for cherries.

687
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm the only person that's supposed to like cherries.

688
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I actually don't even like cherries that much.

689
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm the only person that's allowed to like them.

690
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
I actually don't even like them.

691
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Everyone else is a fucking poser.

692
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Except in the context of the hashtag Ben St.

693
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
The Greatest Beverage.

694
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
What's the hashtag Ben St.?

695
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Why don't you explain that for the audience?

696
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Well, it's the greatest beverage ever created.

697
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,200
You know, created by Munchy Shatsky for whom it is named.

698
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Yeah.

699
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
It's whole milk with maraschino cherry juice

700
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
and a couple of cherries and you put ice in it and you stir it.

701
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,200
You put in the cherry juice until it's pink

702
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
and then you fucking stir it up and you drink it

703
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
and it's nice and thick because it's cold from the ice

704
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
and it's got the nice juicy cherries at the bottom

705
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
and it's creamy and it's sweet and it's delicious

706
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
and it's the best thing ever made.

707
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Oh, it just makes me want one so bad.

708
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm gonna have one.

709
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I'm gonna have one tonight.

710
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Tonight?

711
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
I'll have one too.

712
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
We'll dine and wine and slime and chime.

713
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Mmm, slime.

714
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Chime has come spell wrong.

715
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Delicious.

716
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I mistyped in my voice.

717
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
The Ben St. is one brand of slime, but it's a good...

718
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,200
It's one of the rare good-aligned slimes.

719
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
You should do it.

720
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
You should do it.

721
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You should respectful the slime.

722
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
You two should do it.

723
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,200
You two should do it stealing your dad as if it was Ben St.

724
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
That would be good with the cherries.

725
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Then it wouldn't be a kidnapping.

726
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
It would just be a murder.

727
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
Well, okay.

728
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Is that actually your favorite...

729
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Is that actually your favorite food though?

730
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Who?

731
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
No.

732
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Well, cherries.

733
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Cherries are like, yeah.

734
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Cherries are my favorite.

736
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Okay.

737
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Some notable mentions include hamburgers and shrimp

738
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
and fridge dips.

739
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Doesn't that probably change?

740
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Oh, that.

741
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Oh, that.

742
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Speaking of which, when is that fucking...

743
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Speaking of French dips, when is our stealing your dad's coming out?

744
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Yeah, I've had it for like a week and then I forgot.

745
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
But I have all the autos, so probably come out like...

746
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
It's got to be Arby's, right?

747
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Right now.

748
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
It is Arby's.

749
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Yes.

750
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,200
It'll be out right now.

751
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
So, my favorite food.

752
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Now, it's a shit choice.

753
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
It's a shit choice for babies, but I can't help it

754
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,200
because I have too many fond childhood memories of eating mashed potatoes

755
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
for them not to be my favorite food.

756
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
It's fine.

757
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Yeah.

758
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I'm always a big fan.

759
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
And you can prepare them so many ways.

760
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
You can spice them.

761
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
You always leave the peel on.

762
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Leave that peel in there.

763
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Yeah.

764
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
That's where the flavor is.

765
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Of course.

766
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Yeah, I fucking love mashed potatoes.

767
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Do you mix milk?

768
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Do you mix milk into your mashed potatoes?

769
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Yeah, some.

770
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Yeah, of course.

771
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Some.

772
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Before we get to...

773
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I guess you don't have to.

774
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Before we go any farther, though.

775
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Potatoes.

776
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
That reminds me of your favorite game of all time, Ben.

777
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Did you let Jim spot?

778
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Portal 2.

779
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
It's a good game.

780
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
It's not as good as Portal 1.

781
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Both of you guys have named very general food, like hamburger or mashed potatoes.

782
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,200
That's fine, but I also want to know, do you have a specific favorite food?

783
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Like, Munchie, when you say hamburgers, surely you don't grade all hamburgers the same.

784
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
There must be a place you have a favorite.

785
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,200
I can't pick a specific favorite food, because like every other day, Jackie will make something

786
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
that is literally the best thing I've ever tasted.

787
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Yeah.

788
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
So it just keeps evolving.

789
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Girl plans.

790
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
It just keeps evolving.

791
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Eating real food.

792
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
People are disgusting.

793
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Yeah.

794
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
It's fucking sick of me.

795
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Munchie!

796
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
It is disgusting.

797
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
It's disgusting and it's vile, but I can't...

798
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
I'm learning.

799
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I'm learning what food is meant to be.

800
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,200
It's funny that we mentioned the bin samed, and then I get to unveil my very own the Munchie,

801
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:50,200
aka the Chastity Fortress, which is my name for my custom-made hamburger.

802
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
It is the following.

803
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Make this at home, everyone, and send me screenshots.

804
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,200
You know that one Twitter that I have pinned, and like send me pictures of hamburgers?

805
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
This is what this was made for.

806
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
The Munchie.

807
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Two buns.

808
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Three patties.

809
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Preferably buffalo.

810
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
You know, buffalo isn't kind of, you know...

811
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
You can't really kill them without people like slapping your ass.

812
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Then, for the cheese, you get pepper jack.

813
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Then you get two slices of bacon for each leg.

814
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Sorry, Munchie.

815
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I have to interrupt you because Digi is tapping or something, and it's making...

816
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
It's annoying me.

817
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
What am I tapping?

818
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
What's happening?

819
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I think maybe you're tapping...

820
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
You're moving your leg and it's making a noise.

821
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
I think you're tapping that ass, bro.

822
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Yeah!

823
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Not my own ass.

824
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm shaking on my desk.

825
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Alright.

826
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Continue Munchie.

827
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
The secret.

828
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
The fucking secret.

829
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
The way to make...

830
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,200
The way that elevates the Munchie is when you have the pepper jack, you have to use a

831
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
one sauce and Worcestershire sauce.

832
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
It brings out the flavor and the peppers.

833
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Right.

834
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
And also you can add...

835
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
You can add more...

836
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Preferably a lot of pepper jack will be there, so it gives you that tang, and that slang,

837
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
and that slime, and that plime.

838
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
I think I might have to try that.

839
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I think I might have to make some of those pretty soon.

840
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
It's really fucking good.

841
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,200
The Munchie, aka the Chastity Fortress.

842
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
The Chastity Fortress?

843
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
That's fantastic.

844
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Okay, who's next?

845
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Well, I have difficulty choosing a favorite meal, because every time I've had a meal,

846
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I'm like, well, I haven't had that other meal in a while, so I sort of switch between a few

847
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
favorites, depending on how long.

848
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
This question is just so did you can talk about his favorite food.

849
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,200
No, I don't even care that much about mine.

850
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,200
This, to me, was the only thing I could imagine this podcast being, was talking about your

851
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
favorite foods.

852
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Because it's one thing to talk about food on a broad conceptual level, like we usually

853
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
do on the PCP.

854
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
That's what I expect this to be.

855
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
But that...

856
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,200
If we're going to do a whole podcast about food, it has to get into the bones of it.

857
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
We're doing fine.

858
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I was going to give some examples.

859
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,200
I expected Nate to be like, guys, the thing about food is that when you step back and

860
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
look at it from a cosmic scale.

861
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
That's right.

862
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
That's right.

863
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
What even is food?

864
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
It's just a little way to delay the inevitable decline of the universe.

865
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
That's fine.

866
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
We need to evolve beyond food.

867
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
We kind of do.

868
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
We kind of do.

869
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I could talk about nutrition all day.

870
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,200
I could talk about this and that, but I am legitimately just interested in hearing about

871
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
individual food items.

872
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I really want to know if you tell me, hey, I ate this at this place.

873
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I'm like, I want to know about that so I can go there and also eat that.

874
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,200
The thing I'm going to say is not necessarily something you can get in a restaurant, but

875
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
it is a specific food that is made in England.

876
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
It's a Cumberland sausage.

877
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,200
The specific meal I like with it is a Cumberland sausage with olive oil and a bunch of vegetables,

878
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,200
chili and garlic and salt and pepper and a bunch of spices.

879
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Just a bunch of vegetables and Cumberland sausages all mixed up together in a thing

880
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,200
and just roasted for like an hour or something.

881
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
It just comes out and it's just perfect.

882
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I don't know how to describe it.

883
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,200
It's probably some sort of thing my dad picked up by watching cooking shows or going to Italy

884
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
or something.

885
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
He's a very well traversed culinary guy.

886
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,200
He knows a lot about different foods from different places.

887
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,200
He made it and he's great and it's great and I really like it.

888
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Is the dish you're talking about the toad in the hole?

889
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,200
No, I like that as well, but that's more like the hole is made of batter.

890
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,200
It's very easy to make that a euphemism and the toad is the sausage and the hole is like

891
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,200
the weird batter that you make and you put the sausage in there and it's kind of nice.

892
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I got a weird batter for you.

893
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I got a food podcast.

894
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Please let me have sex.

895
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,200
Finally the truth comes out.

896
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
I was impersonating you fucking cowards.

897
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
It was a joke.

898
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,200
You're not involved.

899
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah, cumberland sausages are the best sausages because they have the most crap in them.

900
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,200
A lot of sausages like German, like bratwurst and stuff, they get rid of a lot of mostly meat.

901
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
It's like 90% meat and like 10% gristle and fat.

902
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:44,200
The cumberland sausages have a lot of the grist and the crumble and the gross shit that makes it just so strangely delicious.

903
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,200
What percentage Dorito and what percentage G fuel is in those and what's the mountain dew ratio?

904
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
100% probably.

905
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Here's a thing about food, right?

906
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,200
When I was in college or something, like late in college I got real into exercising and I was like,

907
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,200
okay, I'm going to eat real healthy because at the time I was on college food plan.

908
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,200
I could basically eat whatever I want, but it made no difference.

909
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,200
So I would do like paleo.

910
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I would eat like lots of like lean meat and stuff and fruit and whatever.

911
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
And I was fine.

912
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
I was like, yeah, eating healthy.

913
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,200
But then I got out into the real world and I was like, wait a minute, I have to pay for my food.

914
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,200
And then I was like, you know what, it's not worth it.

915
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,200
I'll just eat.

916
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Oh no, I'll not let you spread those kind of lies.

917
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
That's bullshit.

918
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I'll eat whatever I can survive on.

919
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,200
There have been times, especially like post astro camp when I was just like living in someone's

920
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
like side room for free for a while.

921
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,200
There were times, I think at least one day I would like wake up, like go to the kitchen and be like,

922
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
hmm, what's here?

923
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,200
What's here that no one remembers buying that I can survive?

924
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,200
And I would eat like, I don't know, like mix up a pie crust and just like eat the pie crust

925
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,200
because that would be my food for the day.

926
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
That's pretty alternative.

927
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Yeah, like that's pretty good.

928
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
That's pretty good.

929
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Well, over saint for a reason.

930
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I would get creative with it.

931
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Like I would take that pie crust, maybe I'd sprinkle cheese on it or something and maybe make some like,

932
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,200
maybe make some like some cheese straws out of it or something.

933
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Just, you know, just trying to fucking survive in this harsh world.

934
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,200
But it is true that you do need a certain base level of, you know, money to be able to live,

935
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,200
but it is not like it's not like you'd have to be on the fucking whole diet to survive and be healthy.

936
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Yeah.

937
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Don't be like Ben, folks.

938
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Don't be like Ben.

939
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
I'm not saying anyone should be like me.

940
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
I'm just telling the story.

941
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Ben is necessarily saying that healthy food is more expensive than unhealthy food.

942
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,200
What he's saying is that any food costs any money and he would rather eat literally like,

943
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,200
like Ben eats shitloads of leftover.

944
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
So in that case, it's just, it's free.

945
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
It's free food.

946
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,200
So the question isn't what kind of food is it?

947
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
There's something.

948
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Who is eating it?

949
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
I don't know.

950
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,200
I don't know if this is like a learned association I have from those lean times or if it's just

951
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
what I'm about naturally.

952
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,200
But I have some kind of, I get some kind of primal satisfaction from taking something that is barely food

953
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,200
and like turn it and like, like, I don't know, like last night I had like a bucket of,

954
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,200
I had like a Tupperware thing of gravy and I was like, I have nothing to eat.

955
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
Like we're all out of biscuits.

956
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
I can't, I can't, there's nothing I can eat this gravy on.

957
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,200
So I toasted bagels and I put the gravy on the bagels and I was like,

958
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
this is an untraditional way of enjoying bagels and gravy.

959
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,200
But you know what?

960
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
It's satisfying.

961
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Sure.

962
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,200
All I'm saying is, yes, if you're in survival mode and you'll take whatever you have to

963
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,200
in order to survive.

964
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Which is the only mode that Ben has.

965
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,200
I'm constantly in fight or flight mode.

966
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,200
I understand that you'll just, you know, you'll do whatever it takes.

967
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,200
But I am just saying that it's like, that doesn't apply to anyone currently on this podcast

968
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
or to probably anyone listening.

969
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,200
If you're listening to this podcast, you can afford to, you know, eat.

970
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Like all it is is like, instead of buying a fucking 12 pack of fucking bagels and downing

971
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
them, instead of buying like a big fucking thing of lettuce and chopping that up and eating

972
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,200
that instead, like it's, you're probably saved by eating.

973
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Fruit is quite cheap, man.

974
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
If I had it, yeah, yeah.

975
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,200
If I had any...

976
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Fuck pre-packaged foods.

977
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Pre-packaged foods are the biggest scam in the world.

978
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Never do that.

979
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,200
If I had, if I had like any disposable income at all, I would, I would probably spend it

980
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,200
on food and to like, yeah, I would buy like, you know, like lean meats and stuff because

981
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
that's, you know, but whatever.

982
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,200
That's fine.

983
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,200
No, that's fine.

984
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,200
The problem I've always had, this is kind of not exactly food, but cooking.

985
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,200
The problem I've always had with eating healthy and stuff like that is that if I wanted to,

986
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,200
you know, cook food and, and so that I would eat food, I would have to know that I want,

987
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
I'm going to be hungry soon.

988
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
And I can never think when that will be...

989
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
But you, but you know, that doesn't make sense because you always know you're going to need

990
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
food in the future.

991
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
100% consistent.

992
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,200
There've been a couple of times when I thought, you know, I'll probably be hungry in an hour.

993
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
And then I wasn't hungry when I finished cooking.

994
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,200
And I'm like, oh, and then...

995
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
That doesn't make sense.

996
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,200
How did you get not hungry after a while?

997
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,200
No, it's that he, he wasn't hungry, but he was like, I should make this food before I

998
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,200
get hungry so that I'm not waiting an hour after I'm hungry to eat fucking food, which

999
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,200
is what my problem is.

1000
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,200
Well, the problem there is there's a lack of a routine.

1001
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
You need a routine.

1002
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
You got, this is a mechanical thing.

1003
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
It's not special.

1004
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,200
It requires practice, but fuck it.

1005
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,200
I was, I was getting to something about talking about like taking like bullshit food and turning

1006
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
it into a meal.

1007
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,200
There's, there's something that, there's something I really appreciate because, because

1008
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,200
like I've been watching cooking videos, especially Chef John.

1009
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,200
And there's something incredibly satisfying that he does that I did not realize is like

1010
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
a part of cooking.

1011
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,200
But I think this is something that like real cooks will do is he'll take, he'll take,

1012
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,200
like he'll take all the ingredients and he'll cook them together, but then he'll like, he'll

1013
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,200
use like the runoff bullshit, like, like the extra, the excess crap and he'll reincorporate

1014
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,200
it.

1015
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Like he'll, like he'll, like he'll be like making a stir fry, like a stir fry filling

1016
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
for like a pie or something.

1017
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,200
He'll fry it in a pan and then he'll take that out, but then he'll like put water into

1018
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,200
the pan and like sizzle the like the seared like, like oils and shit off the pan and like

1019
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,200
boil that down into like a sauce and like pour it onto the stuff.

1020
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Oh dude, I invented that back in high school.

1021
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
Look at my friends.

1022
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
No, it's true.

1023
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,200
Me and my pals, we invented this recipe and you can do this at home kids.

1024
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
It's real cheap.

1025
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,200
It's a real disgusting experience that will kill you.

1026
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,200
But if you're young, if you're, if you're a teenager, if you're young, if you have years

1027
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,200
of your life to burn with recklessness, if you try this great recipe that I invented,

1028
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,200
it's called the fat noodles.

1029
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,200
What you do is, is, is nice.

1030
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Fat noodles, aka the endless chess.

1031
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
I got a fat noodle for you.

1032
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
That's what it seemed after.

1033
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,200
If it's the first to make a bunch of noodles, right?

1034
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
Just a bunch of regular noodles.

1035
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Any kind of noodles you want.

1036
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
You can go crazy.

1037
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,200
It's the choice of noodles is up to you.

1038
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
This is a free form.

1039
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,200
Anyone is like a Western RPG stat building.

1040
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,200
Make your own goddamn noodle.

1041
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,200
I don't give a shit.

1042
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,200
You make, make a bunch of noodles.

1043
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,200
Then you fry up a bunch of sausage.

1044
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Now this is where it gets tricky.

1045
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,200
After you have your sausages, throw your sausages away.

1046
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Put them in the garbage.

1047
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
You don't need them.

1048
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
They're worthless.

1049
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Throw the sausages away and just take, just take the excess, the sausage grease in the

1050
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,200
pan and pour them over the noodles.

1051
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,200
And now you've got some delicious fat noodles that will kill you.

1052
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
And it's very important that you do.

1053
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Why not just put the sausage in this?

1054
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,200
That's good shit.

1055
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
I'm explaining that.

1056
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,200
It's very important that you throw the sausages away because the, the sensation of being a

1057
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,200
fat American who wastes food is part of the fat noodle experience.

1058
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
You have to be as wasteful as possible.

1059
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,200
You have to be wasteful and slimy and greasy and just pour this disgusting grease all over

1060
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,200
your noodles and then you can be a fat noodle boy.

1061
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
Yeah.

1062
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,200
You can be a real American.

1063
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,200
So instead of, instead of, instead of reincorporating the, the stuff, you're just, you're just

1064
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
destroying the main part.

1065
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Yeah, that's the opposite of what I'm talking about.

1066
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Throw them in the garbage for Ben to eat later.

1067
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,200
You can have your fucking family.

1068
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Yeah.

1069
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
I was gonna say, variant, variant on this recipe.

1070
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Don't throw them in the garbage.

1071
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Seal them in an envelope and mail them.

1072
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
Mail them to Ben St. and eat them.

1073
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Ben St. send them your sausages.

1074
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Yeah.

1075
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,200
That's, that's the fate, that's the fate of all disposed food in this world.

1076
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,200
Eventually all food flows to Ben St.

1077
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
It's just the nature of this world.

1078
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Imagine, imagine there's just, I'm just like sitting under a funnel with like just bits

1079
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,200
of sausage just dripping down into my mouth and then like camera pans out to do this huge

1080
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:46,200
network of gears and like steampunk cogs turning and tubes just funneling food from every landfill

1081
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,200
and you mean it here, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1082
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,200
Just like you are like a Sephiroth at the core of the Earth and like you have sent out

1083
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,200
your avatars, your Ben Saints around the world to gather the resources that you need

1084
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
and to, you know, complete your little missions.

1085
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,200
But all the energy is being funneled towards you at the center.

1086
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
All this garbage food.

1087
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,200
You're standing there, you're standing there in the temple of the ancients next to a garbage

1088
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,200
can about to throw away your sausages and Ben St.'s avatar commands your mind to walk

1089
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,200
over and hand him the sausage and you're waiting it with all the strength you can muster.

1090
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,200
No, he can't have the sausage to destroy all mankind.

1091
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,200
I can't give it to him.

1092
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
But you give him the sausage.

1093
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,200
You can't help it.

1094
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,200
He controls your mind.

1095
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,200
I want that sausage.

1096
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,200
I want that sausage more than in life itself.

1097
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Get a fucking job, Ben.

1098
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Okay, move it on.

1099
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Like, like, like Chef John, he'll like, he'll like, he'll take a lobster and he'll just

1100
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,700
like murder this lobster right in front of you and he'll pull out all the meat and he'll

1101
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,200
pull out all the meat and he'll be like, oh, yeah, just leave, you know, leave the shells,

1102
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
leave the guts all in there.

1103
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
That's fine.

1104
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,200
And then he'll like, he'll put, he'll put like, he'll put like the shell, like the dead lobster

1105
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,200
shell into like a stock, into like a pot and like boil it with some herbs and shit.

1106
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,200
And then he'll like take that fucking boiled shell water and like pour it over and like

1107
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,200
and cook the meat in that shit because he wants to just retain.

1108
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
He wants it.

1109
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,200
He doesn't want to lose an ounce of that precious lobster goodness that costs like $40 a pound.

1110
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,200
You know what I'm saying?

1111
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,200
And that's deeply, deeply satisfying.

1112
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,200
It's always about Father John with you, isn't it?

1113
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,200
Yeah.

1114
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,200
Mm-hmm.

1115
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,200
Father.

1116
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
Father, oh, I was going to...

1117
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,200
Earlier Nate brought up...

1118
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,200
Father Aden from Secret of Kells.

1119
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,200
Nate brought up Doritos and I had to ask, which Doritos are you guys?

1120
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
What side are you on?

1121
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Good question.

1122
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Spicy.

1123
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Spicy nachos.

1124
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Is there a sides?

1125
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,200
There's the Cool Ranch and the Nacho Cheese.

1126
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
All right, here we go.

1127
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
You fucking racist.

1128
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,200
Fuck the Cool Ranch.

1129
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
Fuck Cool Ranch.

1130
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Fuck Cool Ranch.

1131
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
I'm a nacho cheese boy for life.

1132
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,200
It's hard.

1133
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,200
I think, I just like the texture of like the powdery, the powdery cheese.

1134
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Doritos are bad.

1135
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,200
I like the nacho cheese.

1136
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
I just don't think the nacho cheese is bad.

1137
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,200
There's a spicy, there's a spicy, fiery one that these people aren't talking about.

1138
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,200
It's a third party one that know that the big wigs won't elect.

1139
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
I'm munchy.

1140
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,200
I'm not in the Doritos binary.

1141
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
My favorite Doritos.

1142
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Doritos that are good.

1143
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
There's that one that Tom's obsessed with and those ones are probably the best.

1144
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,200
Sweet chili, I think.

1145
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,200
The purple one?

1146
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,200
Yeah.

1147
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,200
But the thing is that I mostly eat Doritos because they come with sandwiches.

1148
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Like you go somewhere to buy a sandwich and they have a chip thing set up.

1149
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,200
And the only ones they're going to have are this Cool Ranch and nacho cheese.

1150
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,200
That's why this distinction is important.

1151
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,200
If the purple one was everywhere, it would be no contest.

1152
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,200
It's way better than the other two.

1153
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,200
But I think the nacho cheese ones just taste like chips.

1154
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
They just taste like any other chips.

1155
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,200
But the Cool Ranch is like a completely unique flavor to Doritos.

1156
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Oh no, man.

1157
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,200
The thing about Doritos is they're such garbage and I'm not knocking them.

1158
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,200
I like them.

1159
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,200
But they're such garbage that it doesn't even matter what they taste like.

1160
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Just the fact that they're like a piece of hard bread with salt on it.

1161
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Like that's what you're paying for.

1162
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,200
And that's what you get regardless of flavor.

1163
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,200
I detest the entire Edo's family.

1164
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Fritos, Doritos.

1165
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
I'm going to make a YouTube series called The Ten Edo's

1166
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,200
where I categorically go through all of the different Edo's

1167
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
and why they're all fucking disgusting.

1168
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
Fritos? Fritos are just toenails.

1169
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
That's all they are.

1170
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,200
They're not even a snack.

1171
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,200
I...

1172
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
No, they're fine.

1173
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Love Fritos.

1174
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
They're gross.

1175
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,200
No, because those are the actually greasiest chip on the planet.

1176
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
They are disgusting.

1177
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I hate Fritos.

1178
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
You got to put them in some bean dip and shit.

1179
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,200
No.

1180
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,200
If I just put my toenails into a Fritos bag,

1181
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

1182
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,200
That's true.

1183
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Here's the real God-tier chip.

1184
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Sour cream and onion laze.

1185
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,200
Oh, no.

1186
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,200
That's the good shit.

1187
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,200
That is the only good shit.

1188
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
I like the ridged ones.

1189
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,200
I also like the ridged ones.

1190
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
Laze is Wolkers, right?

1191
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,200
I think that's the alternative.

1192
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
The same company, Wolkers and Laze are the same.

1193
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
I've never heard of Wolkers.

1194
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,200
I've never walked before in my life.

1195
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Maybe that's the British version.

1196
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
I think...

1197
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Yeah, it's the British version.

1198
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,200
There's a flavor of Wolkers that is the best flavor ever.

1199
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
I'm not sure you have it.

1200
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,200
It's the prawn cocktail.

1201
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
Have you ever had prawns?

1202
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
The prawn cocktail?

1203
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
What?

1204
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,200
It's a very strange name, but it's a very tangy, delicious flavor.

1205
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
It's hard to...

1206
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,200
No, it doesn't taste like prawn or shrimp.

1207
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
It's a very strange...

1208
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
It just tastes like the seasoning?

1209
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,200
It tastes like the seasoning you put on?

1210
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Wait, is it like prawn as in like PR0N, as in like GamerSpeak for porn?

1211
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Is that...

1212
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
No.

1213
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
Yeah, prawns, cocktails.

1214
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,200
I'm just gonna explain.

1215
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,200
These chips just come with a big picture of an anime girl on them.

1216
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,200
Every English person knows that is the best flavor of crisps ever made.

1217
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
No.

1218
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
And I don't know whether America has it.

1219
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
I guess not.

1220
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
I've never seen it, dude.

1221
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Every Japanese person knows that consomme is the best flavor

1222
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,200
because you can take a potato chip and eat it.

1223
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Eat it.

1224
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Alright, I don't even like chips that much, so I don't want to keep talking about chips.

1225
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Let's get back to the question of favorite food.

1226
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
Wait, wait.

1227
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Who hasn't gotten it?

1228
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Okay, yeah, finish your point.

1229
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Finish your point.

1230
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Well, I was gonna go on something else.

1231
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh.

1232
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
If somebody wanted to talk about their favorite food.

1233
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
I had a dream.

1234
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
I had a dream one time that I lived in a dystopian America feature.

1235
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
Then there's just nothing to do with your favorite food.

1236
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,200
It does, though.

1237
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,200
I had a dream one time that I lived in a dystopian future and America was at war with

1238
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
the Middle East and things were getting bad.

1239
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,200
Things were getting real bad.

1240
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
Only.

1241
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,200
That would never happen, Ben.

1242
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:38,200
But in this world, in this world, the economy, the Middle East was still like the cornerstone

1243
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
of the world economy.

1244
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,200
However, they were not so because their major export was oil.

1245
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
No.

1246
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:49,200
In this world, the Middle East's major export was breakfast.

1247
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,200
Oh.

1248
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
Yeah.

1249
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,200
And one more.

1250
00:56:52,200 --> 00:57:01,200
And I awoke in this nightmare and I came downstairs to my bathroom medicine cabinet where

1251
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
everyone knows is where you go to eat breakfast.

1252
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
Right.

1253
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,200
And I opened my bathroom medicine cabinet and looked inside and was horrified to find

1254
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:13,200
there's no eggs, there's no sausage, there's no grapefruit juice.

1255
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
No grapefruit juice.

1256
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,200
My favorite.

1257
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
And they're like, damn you, George W. Bush.

1258
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
What have you done?

1259
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
We're a war criminal.

1260
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
How many have died in a war criminal?

1261
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Where's my breakfast, George?

1262
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,200
And that was it.

1263
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
That was my dream.

1264
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,200
That actually had nothing to do with your favorite food.

1265
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
It was about food, bitch.

1266
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,200
Son of a bitch.

1267
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,200
He's going on talk shows now, talking about his paintings.

1268
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Everyone's clapping like he's such a good guy.

1269
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,200
They didn't, they all forgot he started the breakfast wars and doomed millions to go without

1270
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
grapefruit juice.

1271
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
That fucking war criminal.

1272
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Oh, god, I fucking.

1273
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,200
That, you know, that should have been the plot of food wars.

1274
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,200
That's really a bore.

1275
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,400
Let me, I know, I know there's divided opinions on this issue, but I fucking love grapefruit

1276
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
juice.

1277
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
I know that.

1278
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,400
It's not for everyone.

1279
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,200
Dude, I bought a big old, I bought a big one the other day and drank that shit.

1280
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,200
It was great.

1281
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Actually, I like it best mixed with a bunch of orange juice.

1282
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,200
I like the orange juice.

1283
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,200
I'm all the way into grapefruit juice.

1284
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
I'm way into grapefruits.

1285
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,200
You know, I'm way into fucking love grapefruits.

1286
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm getting, like, the older I get, I'm starting to acquire this brain thing where, like, the

1287
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,200
healthier your food is, the better it tastes to me.

1288
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1289
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Because I know that I'm dying and I just can't take it anymore.

1290
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,200
You're getting unretarded because you were raised in a retarded, stupid system where,

1291
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,800
literally in our country, no one gives a fuck about what you eat because we are the most

1292
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
retarded civilization.

1293
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,200
Yeah, I was raised on fucking poor food.

1294
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
And now you're learning.

1295
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,200
I ate nothing but fast food until I was 20 and I got used to it.

1296
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
Disgusting.

1297
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,200
How do we even survive on that shit?

1298
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,200
It disgusts me.

1299
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Like, I eat, it's gross.

1300
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,200
I eat fast food and I'm like, this doesn't taste good.

1301
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
It tastes like poop.

1302
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,800
I've finally gotten to the point where I can't, like, fast food tastes like shit to me and

1303
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,800
it makes me feel sick, but I keep eating it just because I get in the car to go drive

1304
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,200
to get food and then something in my brain goes, I don't want to have to wait.

1305
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,200
I don't want to have to wait even one minute for my food.

1306
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,200
So I'm going to eat fast food and then I regret it for the next six hours.

1307
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
And then what happens?

1308
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,000
You go to fucking Wendy's and you order your spicy chicken and they say, oh, it'll be

1309
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
about 10 minutes.

1310
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
What the fuck Wendy's?

1311
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I only come here because I want food now.

1312
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
If my fast food is going to serve me shit and also take long to serve me shit, then

1313
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,640
they should be fucking nuked from orbit.

1314
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,640
I hate that shit.

1315
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,200
You gotta pull to the side and sit, like, on the, on, like, to the side of the drive

1316
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
to you.

1317
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:36,120
And then the fucking, the girl, like a fucking, like, like a, like a surf, like a lowly peasant.

1318
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
It's embarrassing for her.

1319
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,120
It's humiliating.

1320
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,200
I'm embarrassed for her.

1321
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,800
I want her to have a better life.

1322
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,800
I hate you.

1323
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,800
Wendy's.

1324
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,800
Die.

1325
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,400
I had that happen yesterday where I went, it was, it was like pouring.

1326
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,360
I got in the car and the second I got in the car, it started just pouring rain, like

1327
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,360
super hard.

1328
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,400
And so I was like, all right, well, I'm going to go to a fast food place that I know has

1329
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,400
an awning.

1330
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,880
Like, so I won't have to get wet at all.

1331
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,320
I want to get out of the car.

1332
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,400
So I go to Chick-fil-A and I don't notice until I'm like at a point where I can't leave

1333
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,640
that there's this huge line.

1334
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,480
So I'm in the, like, I'm thinking, oh, go there, so it'll be fast and I won't get wet.

1335
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,480
And it's like 20 fucking minutes that I'm waiting just to get some fast food.

1336
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,840
Uh, yeah, it was pointless and it wasn't even raining by the time I got the food.

1337
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,600
I have an old war story that I have never told about the horrors of the fast food industry

1338
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,840
and what happens when their gross incompetence, uh, you know, fucks you in the ass as it does.

1339
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,280
It was, it was a long time ago back in my high school days, me and my friends were at

1340
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,680
a place and we, and like, like two, two of us were sent out to get KFC for the whole

1341
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,680
crew.

1342
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,840
The whole group was all there waiting for us.

1343
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
We had a mission.

1344
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,520
We had a holy crusade to find KFC and bring it back.

1345
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:55,400
So we go in our car and we get, we go to KFC and we go to the drive-thru and KFC says,

1346
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,000
and I quote, we are out of chicken.

1347
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah.

1348
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,040
I've had that too.

1349
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,840
So what the fuck is worthless?

1350
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,680
We're like, what the fuck do we do?

1351
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,200
We didn't even know that was possible.

1352
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,200
It blew our minds.

1353
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,960
It shouldn't be a thing that happens and if there was a just and loving God, it wouldn't

1354
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
happen.

1355
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
But so KFC was like a chicken.

1356
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,960
Right, right.

1357
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,960
What do we do?

1358
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,960
The people at the house are expecting KFC.

1359
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
We had no other alternatives.

1360
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,240
We had to go to Arby's.

1361
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,240
So we go to Arby's.

1362
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,400
Those people are bloodthirsty.

1363
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,280
You cannot come back to the house without chicken.

1364
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,280
It'll be a bloodbath.

1365
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,280
We learned.

1366
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
We learned.

1367
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,280
Because we went and we got Arby's.

1368
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,280
We got these beef and cheddar.

1369
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,720
It's like, well, it's not chicken, but you know, maybe they have to understand, right?

1370
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,360
Surely they'll understand that KFC was out of chicken.

1371
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,360
Yeah.

1372
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,360
These are our friends.

1373
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,360
These are our friends.

1374
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,360
They care about us.

1375
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,520
They wouldn't cast us out into the cold.

1376
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,000
We go back to the house with our fucking Arby's.

1377
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We give them the Arby's.

1378
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,200
They go, what the fuck is this?

1379
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,480
And they like, they like, don't let us come in the house.

1380
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,480
They take the Arby's, but they don't let us come in the house.

1381
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,680
They take the Arby's too.

1382
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,240
We're finished to the outside all night.

1383
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,160
It's like, it's like, like 35 degrees.

1384
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,000
It's really fucking cold out there.

1385
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
We can't go in the house.

1386
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,320
This is all night.

1387
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,200
We are in the backyard.

1388
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,760
Me and my buddy, we had to go.

1389
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,760
We got shovels.

1390
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,760
We dug a trench, an actual World War I trench in the backyard and we huddled and cuddled

1391
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,920
in a trench for warmth all night and slept in the backyard because our friends wouldn't

1392
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,920
allow us in the house.

1393
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,840
We had, we had the dog next to us.

1394
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:34,000
Eventually the dog got let in, but we were still in the backyard.

1395
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Even that dog had more honor.

1396
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,120
I'm sure the dog had some Arby's once it was in there.

1397
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,640
I'm sure they enjoyed our Arby's.

1398
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,280
I'm sure the Arby's went over well once they actually started eating it, but we were full.

1399
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,440
By that time we were persona non grata.

1400
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,080
We were banished from the land.

1401
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,360
I just love the idea of them like in there, just like, you know what, I've kind of enjoyed

1402
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,360
these Arby's.

1403
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,360
No, fuck Jesse though.

1404
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Fuck that guy.

1405
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,360
How dare you betray our trust like that.

1406
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,480
They opened the curtain a little to peer and they can see you shivering then and just

1407
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,480
like, fuck that guy.

1408
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:09,360
We were seriously, we dug like a six foot hole in the ground and we were like, we covered

1409
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,960
the top of it with like sticks and leaves so it was like a little cave to hide in from

1410
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,920
the elements that were battering our flesh.

1411
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,920
Meanwhile, meanwhile, these fat cats inside lick their, lick the Arby's sauce off their

1412
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,920
fat winged cats.

1413
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,920
Holy shit.

1414
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,920
Oh my God, yes.

1415
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,920
That's the greatest fast food story of all time.

1416
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,920
What did you say to those people when you finally got to see them again?

1417
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,920
He said, I'm sorry.

1418
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,920
I'll never do it again.

1419
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
Forgive me.

1420
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
Please.

1421
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
Please.

1422
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Jesus.

1424
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
I'm sorry.

1425
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,920
I've brought dishonor to the clan.

1426
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,920
Please forgive me so I don't have to commit separate goo.

1427
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,920
Those guys are fucking traitors to our race.

1428
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,920
God damn.

1429
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,920
That's that's some of the sort of race we're over right there.

1430
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,920
That's that's that's one.

1431
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Well, I have one more thing to bring up which I alluded to in another podcast and I really

1432
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,920
hoped Mage would be here for this because she really, she really has strong opinions

1433
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
on this and doubtless.

1434
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:18,920
She is in the comments right now like angrily attacking me viciously for liking thin crust

1435
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
pizza.

1436
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
I mean thick crust pizza.

1437
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,920
I hate thin crust.

1438
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,920
That's the one.

1439
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,920
I hate thin crust.

1440
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,920
It's time for this debate.

1441
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,920
It's time for this debate.

1442
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,920
Thin crust is objectively superior.

1443
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
It is the best way to have pizza.

1444
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,920
I'd be totally happy eating, but I don't why can't we all just get along?

1445
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,920
I'd be totally happy eating thin crust and thick crust pizza.

1446
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
There's skin in the game, Ben.

1447
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,920
We've been all about it.

1448
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,920
Define thin crust real quick.

1449
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,920
What are we?

1450
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,920
What kind of thin crust are we talking about?

1451
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
Okay.

1452
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
Have you ever had Papa Geno's?

1453
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
You probably never have had Papa Geno's.

1454
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,920
Are we just talking about like normal pizza versus like deep dish?

1455
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,920
Because I'm actually not that into deep dish.

1456
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,920
I don't know.

1457
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,920
But when I think of thin crust, I think of crust that is like it's almost thinner than

1458
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,920
the toppings.

1459
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
Yeah.

1460
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
Is it hard?

1461
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Are you talking about hard?

1462
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
No, no, no, no.

1463
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,920
It's not.

1464
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,920
It's not hard.

1465
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
Like, okay.

1466
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,920
There's this place Papa Geno's where I actually worked for.

1467
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
Actually, I am talking about hard.

1468
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
I don't like it.

1469
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,920
Yeah.

1470
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,920
I am talking about hard as well.

1471
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,920
Okay.

1472
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
Well, let me just describe pizza from Papa Geno's.

1473
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,920
Because it sounds to me like thin crust is getting a bad rap here.

1474
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,920
What was it?

1475
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,920
I mean, I'm assuming Nate that what you're describing, what you're going to describe is just New York

1476
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,920
style pizza.

1477
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,920
Or dictionary.

1478
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,920
It's pretty much just normal pizza, but a little thinner.

1479
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
Like, well, okay.

1480
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,920
New York style pizza has extremely thin crust, but it's like, it's that kind that's like

1481
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,920
super, it's thin, but it's like almost watery.

1482
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,320
It's like, it's like, well, it's like when you pick up the slice and it folds in half,

1483
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,120
you know, like that's normal, but when you specifically order thin crust from somewhere

1484
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,080
like Pizza Hut or something like that, or like any of the places, they'll give you

1485
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,920
like this hard crust.

1486
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,920
It's like a super thin, it's like a chip almost.

1487
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
Okay.

1488
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,080
Those, those people are fucking it up.

1489
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,880
They're giving bad name because it's supposed to be you because that's what I don't like.

1490
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,880
I don't like it when it's crispy.

1491
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
You.

1492
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,880
Yeah.

1493
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,880
Thin crust.

1494
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,880
It's like really nice.

1495
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,880
Yeah.

1496
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,880
You like the, you like the.

1497
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,880
Oh, because he's a, you're a Pizza Hut boy.

1498
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,880
You're a Pizza Hut boy.

1499
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,880
I like the cracker shit.

1500
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,880
I like it.

1501
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,880
It tastes good.

1502
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
I don't know, dude.

1503
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
No, dude.

1504
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,880
No.

1505
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
No.

1506
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,880
It tastes good.

1507
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,880
It's like a party in my mouth and no one of the minorities are invited.

1508
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,880
I kind of like, I kind of like, I kind of like the thin, but like floppy, like thin floppy

1509
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,880
bottom to my pizza.

1510
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,880
Yeah.

1511
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,880
I mean, I like all crust, but thin, thin crust is getting monopolized by, they're getting

1512
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
mistreated.

1513
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
They're getting the slaver bowl.

1514
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,880
I'm a bit of an expert on this.

1515
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
Okay.

1516
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Cause I was, I was a pizza boy for many years here.

1517
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,880
So about specifically, specifically, I am, I'm a quarter.

1518
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,880
I am a big pizza boy.

1519
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
Um, so okay.

1520
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,380
The great thing about thin crust pizza and it again, like it can't be that hard shit.

1521
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,380
That's garbage.

1522
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,880
You can't overcook it, but it, it, the, the, the really idea is that it highlights the

1523
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,880
sauce.

1524
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,080
When you're biting into that, you're not like, you don't have a mouthful of fucking bread.

1525
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,280
You've got some of the bread, just a sort of a base foundation, but that's when you can

1526
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,280
really enjoy it.

1527
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,280
And Papa Jio's has really good sauce.

1528
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,280
I think, I don't know.

1529
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,280
I really love Papa Jio's.

1530
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,280
They're really good.

1531
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,200
I mean, to me, to me, a pizza place really comes down to how good is their sauce?

1532
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,200
It's all about the sauce.

1533
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,200
That's the main sauce.

1534
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,280
Like when you eat New York pizza, they're all cooked the exact same way, but if their

1535
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,080
sauce is better, then that's the one you go to.

1536
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,080
I, I, I went to, I had a lot of New York pizza, you know, cause I went to school in New Jersey

1537
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,080
and was always, you know, in the area and, uh, yeah, like they were good.

1538
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,080
I don't know.

1539
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
Papa Jio's is better.

1540
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,080
I guess that's the point I'm trying to make.

1541
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,080
I love Papa Jio's.

1542
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,400
If you're in Massachusetts to the whole Northeast, go to Papa Jio's.

1543
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
You'll love it.

1544
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,400
It's the best.

1545
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,000
Get the, get the barbecue chicken pizza at Papa Jio's.

1546
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That's my favorite one.

1547
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's pretty good.

1548
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I have a feeling.

1549
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Got barbecue sauce instead of, instead of tomato sauce.

1550
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's got red beans on it.

1551
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I want to take you, Gib.

1552
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,600
I want to take you to Papa Jio's Gib someday.

1553
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Yeah.

1554
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,800
I have a feeling that maybe pizza in the UK is just overall shit because that one time

1555
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,080
at BronyCon where we had, we had all that, that pizza delivered to that room.

1556
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,080
Yeah.

1557
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,080
Yeah.

1558
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,080
And it was really nice.

1559
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,080
It was, it was just like an actually nice sauce.

1560
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,080
Oh yeah.

1561
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,080
That was pretty good.

1562
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,080
It was a thin pizza, but it was nice and floppy and the, the tomato sauce on it was actually

1563
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,240
really, really good.

1564
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:16,720
I've never had a sauce on a pizza that good, which is why generally when there's a pizza,

1565
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,080
I only think of what meat is on it and how thick the bread is.

1566
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
And I like bread.

1567
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,080
So, you know, that's, that's the best thing about a pizza for me generally.

1568
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:30,280
Weird, weird thing in, in Poland, like they had like pizza places and like burger places

1569
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,000
were not as common there.

1570
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,680
And it was weirdly different.

1571
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,520
Like I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was, but like the pizza that I would get in

1572
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,800
Poland was just a little different than any, it's like they didn't quite have the same

1573
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,800
like, like grade of ingredients they were making it out of.

1574
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,800
Yeah.

1575
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,400
It was all like, it was all like big and soft and like, I don't know, like a little, like

1576
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,720
a little too cheesy and the burgers there, like the burgers you would get there, they

1577
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:57,480
were always like, they were always kind of floppy and pinkish in some, in like the meat

1578
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,480
was like pinkish.

1579
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,920
It's hard just to cook a fucking burger.

1580
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,920
I don't know.

1581
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,200
It just didn't, it just didn't, I think like the meat was different or something.

1582
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,840
When I was in Tokyo, like pizza was like a deluxe thing that you would, you'd see all

1583
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,760
these dudes out on scooters, like driving around delivering pizza, you could, they didn't

1584
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,360
even have like in store shit.

1585
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,360
You had to order it and like the dude would deliver it.

1586
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:18,480
And this was like a luxury item, but the pizza was still garbage and the pizzas were like

1587
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,080
way more expensive and they were fucking tiny.

1588
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,560
They're like literally a quarter the size of a pizza here in the Philippines.

1589
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,320
Like, there was a point while I was there, it was about two and a half weeks in where

1590
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,160
I was just thoroughly sick of Filipino food and I was like, I need pizza.

1591
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,160
Like I'm having withdrawals.

1592
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,360
But you can't even get like a big pizza boy.

1593
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,000
So there was one day it was like raining and I ordered a pizza from somewhere nearby

1594
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,120
and it was like, I ordered a large and it was the size of an American medium, you know,

1595
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,440
and like I ate the entire thing.

1596
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,840
It was, it was all right.

1597
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,720
But the thing is like in the Philippines, because they don't really have regular New

1598
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,160
York style pizza and they kind of have like two different variations.

1599
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,480
You've got Pizza Hut, which is everywhere over there and Pizza Hut looks like a fancy

1600
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,360
restaurant there because it costs the same amount that it does here.

1601
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,320
But it's, you know, because of the conversion rates, like five American dollars is like

1602
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:20,000
15, like the equivalent of spending 15 bucks in the Philippines.

1603
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,120
So like pizza is treated like a gourmet thing.

1604
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,280
But then the only other category is like the actual gourmet pizzas.

1605
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,400
The ones that are like artisan crafted, you know, they've got like all these really interesting

1606
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,160
ingredients and stuff and it's always like 10 toppings and like those, I love that kind

1607
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:41,680
of pizza like California pizza kitchen, you know, but it is fundamentally so different

1608
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,080
from pizza that I can't even really categorize it as pizza.

1609
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,360
When I was in Japan, yeah, like I always associated like the pizza they had there were kind of

1610
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,800
like those like weird gourmet sweet shops would like put all this bullshit fluff and

1611
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,800
I'm like, I just want to eat a fucking sweet cake.

1612
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,920
I don't need all this extra shit sticking out.

1613
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,720
It was kind of like that.

1614
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,600
One time in Poland, I ordered a pizza and it was, yeah, like, because pizza is kind

1615
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,840
of a specialty item over there, it was a bit on the expensive side, like for pizza, like

1616
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,240
considering even though everything's cheaper over there.

1617
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,720
Anyway, the point is the guy brought it, he gave it to me, I tipped him, I just didn't

1618
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,720
give a fuck.

1619
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,240
I tipped him like a convenient amount, which is 20s Lotties.

1620
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:25,760
I gave him 20s Lotties, which is like, it's like seven or eight dollars, but like in over

1621
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,240
there, like because of the fucking economy or whatever, that was like a $20 tip.

1622
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,440
And the guy gave, the guy looked at me, the guy like looked at me like he was weirded out.

1623
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,840
He was like a little like confused and weirded out by the fact that I gave him this like

1624
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,680
fucking monster tip on his pizza.

1625
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:47,680
And I was just like, well, I just, I was like a pretty fucking huge tip for a pizza.

1626
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,680
Pizza delivery in itself.

1627
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,680
I guess it was.

1628
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,680
I don't know.

1629
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:57,040
It just was like, here, have some Lotties you fuck, fucking stinky pieces.

1630
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,040
Shit.

1631
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:02,960
Well, the subject of pizzas and comparing them, that's part of why I like that pepperoni is

1632
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,960
universal because when I go to a new pizza place, I'm going to try their pepperoni just

1633
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,840
because that's like, to me, the baseline.

1634
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,920
Like you have to, like that's how I'm going to judge whether I'm coming back here.

1635
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,440
Then I'll get into your weird shit, you know, but like, I got to know.

1636
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,200
Can you do the basics?

1637
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,000
And if so, then I'll come back for a second.

1638
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,080
Here's the thing about the pizza, here's the thing about pizza is you can, you can eat.

1639
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,560
We know from Oolulilia that you can eat nothing but pizza, but still lose weight.

1640
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,440
And all you have to do is just eat a normal amount of pizza.

1641
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,280
You just got to degrease your pizza.

1642
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:41,120
You just got to soak your pizza with napkins or soak up all the grease from it.

1643
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,120
And then you eat it.

1644
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,640
And then, and then you're a healthy boy.

1645
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:49,280
I can't, like, on the one hand, I'm imagining like, okay, pizza without grease, that's,

1646
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,160
that sounds great, but you're using, you're just going to get napkin all over it.

1647
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,320
Like does it not come away tasting like napkin?

1648
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,640
You got to pay to play, dawg.

1649
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,040
Is I turn it upside down and I squish it into the plate and then you get another plate usually.

1650
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,640
Yeah, you just, you just fill it up.

1651
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,120
As I drop all my pizza into a fruit juicer and I squoze out all the grease and then I

1652
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:17,520
take this coagulated, destroyed lump that was once a pizza and I shove those in my mouth

1653
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,880
like fucking Timbits.

1654
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
Funnel, funnel the pizza.

1655
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,200
I take the whole thing before I cut it into slices and I roll it up and I squeeze it like,

1656
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,480
like over a pale, over a pale to squeeze all the grease out.

1657
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,920
Jesse, I think you just described how Tostino's pizza rolls were made.

1658
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,920
Funnel the pizza.

1659
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,920
What did I just invent?

1660
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,920
Tostino's pizza rolls?

1661
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,880
Funnel off the pizza grease and cook your Brussels sprouts in it and you will have a

1662
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,720
new favorite vegetable, my friends.

1663
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:46,320
The farthest part of Radcon 2 was eating those pizza rolls and jerking around.

1664
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,320
That was good.

1665
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:52,320
Just go and fucking find all the pizza trees, burn down the pizza forest and fucking smoke

1666
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,320
the smoke.

1667
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,920
I was eating, I was eating those leftover pizza rolls for like two weeks after that.

1668
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,520
I fucking, my body is now your communion, Ben, my body is now your communion.

1669
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,120
Ben, do you remember those days when we were up late watching anime and I'd microwave some

1670
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,920
disgusting Tostino's pizza rolls and we'd just watch adults swim?

1671
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,120
I remember those days.

1672
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,120
I mostly remember eating Hot Pockets.

1673
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Yeah, there were those two.

1674
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,120
God, disgusting.

1675
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,120
Don't eat Hot Pockets.

1676
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,520
Oh, but closing the statement, Thin Crust Hard is really nice.

1677
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,920
It's like a cracker and you can crunch into it and it's really, it's really pleasant and

1678
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,120
all of you are aliens and I'm going to eradicate you and stay at the human race.

1679
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,120
You know, I honestly don't think I've ever had Thin Crust from like Pizza Hut.

1680
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,120
Nate, what's your favorite reserve?

1681
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,120
Fucking food.

1682
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,120
Right.

1683
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,120
Okay.

1684
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,120
Let's wrap this up.

1685
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:42,620
I would have to say my favorite food, I'm definitely, food disgusts me in general, so

1686
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:49,200
I only think about it as a tool to live a better life and but you know, it matters to

1687
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,320
me how food tastes because I'm a weak human being.

1688
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,560
So I would find that my favorite food is definitely, and it is a very specific thing, but it's

1689
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,560
not a store thing.

1690
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,280
It's this, it's this crock pot, right?

1691
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,880
It's just the life of the crock pot.

1692
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,440
It's the fact that you can take a crock pot, throw in all this meat and vegetables and

1693
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,920
you can, you know, put in everything you want in there and you cook it up and this is the

1694
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
crucial step.

1695
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,160
You got to spice it right.

1696
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:17,520
I do not understand spice, so I have yet to obtain the correct way to make a fucking crock

1697
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,760
pot that isn't gross, but I'm working on it every day and it's, it's, it's the joy of

1698
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,760
the hunt of the perfect crock pot experience because I have tasted the perfect crock pot.

1699
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:32,080
When I lived, when I first moved to Cincinnati, my, my roommate who was like a Navy SEAL or

1700
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,800
something, he, oh not a Navy SEAL, he was like in the Navy or something.

1701
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,240
He, seven Fiddles dog.

1702
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,240
Yeah.

1703
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,880
He, he made crock pot stuff occasionally and he would just be like, yeah, if you want

1704
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,800
some, you know, like I made a lot, so feel free to have some.

1705
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,840
This fucking dude was the goddamn wizard of the crock pot and like the thing is he spent

1706
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,600
so little time making it.

1707
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,280
He just had the knowledge of how to do it correctly, which is exactly what cooking is

1708
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,280
all about.

1709
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,040
You know, it's about, once you understand you're efficient, you get your shit done,

1710
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:02,880
you eat right, you get your, your nutrients in, it's delicious and the stuff this guy

1711
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,920
made was out of this fucking world and I'm going to quest to, to replicate it here, but

1712
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,920
there you go.

1713
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
So there it is.

1714
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,920
Crock pots.

1715
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:11,920
I love crock pots.

1716
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,400
I just want to say as a final word on this topic, uh, that all food is bad and no one

1717
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,400
she'd eat it.

1718
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,400
It's all bad.

1719
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,400
Right.

1720
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,400
We're not on the final word.

1721
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,760
You haven't even, two of us haven't even given our favorite foods yet and you're one

1722
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,760
of them.

1723
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,760
Okay.

1724
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,760
Yeah.

1725
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,760
I meant my final word.

1726
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,240
I don't care what anyone else's is.

1727
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Okay.

1728
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,880
Everyone don't eat food.

1729
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,880
It's bad.

1730
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,920
There's only four, uh, food groups that matter.

1731
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,880
There's only four good foods and those are, uh, sushi, pussy dick.

1732
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,880
Sorry.

1733
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:45,680
Don't fucking, don't poker and co-opt my joke, you son of a bitch.

1734
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:49,880
My fucking punchline that I'm building towards is going to blow out anything that you can

1735
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:50,880
think to interrupt me.

1736
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,880
You know, I'm so sick.

1737
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,280
That's the number one problem with this podcast is I start a bit and one of you cock knobs

1738
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,440
interrupts me with, with your own bit and you fucking ruin it every time.

1739
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,000
You guys, you don't deserve my bits, but I'm going to keep powering through it.

1740
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,440
This is my fucking Kramer moment.

1741
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,480
I'm on stage right now at the lab factory.

1742
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,480
I'm blowing up on the audience.

1743
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,680
I don't even care if it's funny anymore.

1744
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,680
You're all blacks.

1745
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,800
You're all a bunch of blacks and minorities and I hate you.

1746
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,280
We should work on the interruption.

1747
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,280
That is true.

1748
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,280
Uh, okay.

1749
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Well, I don't know.

1750
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
Who, who hasn't gotten one?

1751
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,280
Does anyone who wanted two more favorite foods?

1752
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:32,280
The point that I was making, the only four good foods in the world are sushi, glass bottle

1753
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:40,580
Pepsi, lemon lime, Gatorade, and chicken and tea.

1754
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,580
I have discovered.

1755
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,580
I have discovered.

1756
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:45,280
I'm glad chicken and tea is one food, by the way.

1757
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,240
That's the, that's part of the fourth group.

1758
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:52,800
I have discovered cucumber, lime, Gatorade, and I think, or cucumber, something Gator,

1759
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,640
it is the most delicious, refreshing, it's, it sounds weird, right?

1760
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,640
But it's so fucking delicious.

1761
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,640
I highly recommend, uh, wait, what is it?

1762
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,920
They serve Pepsi and glass bottles.

1763
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,920
Duh.

1764
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,920
Fucking idiot.

1765
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:09,920
Yeah.

1766
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Yeah.

1767
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:11,920
Cucumber, lime, thirst, quenchers.

1768
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:12,920
Highly recommend.

1769
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:13,920
Go out and buy some right now.

1770
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,920
Everybody.

1771
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,920
Oh, the fucking Mexicans who, who raised me obviously before I jumped in order.

1772
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:24,480
They have some crazy, some crazy concoctions, some, some crazy modern day potions that they

1773
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:30,320
have since, uh, stored in various home depots across the nation, across this glorious nation.

1774
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,200
And if you go to a home depot, you will find there, they're crazy nectar and they're, they're

1775
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,200
they're wicked nectar.

1776
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,520
Is it called paint thinner?

1777
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,520
That's good stuff.

1778
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,800
It's called fucked up Coke, AKA just Coca-Cola, but it has really sugar in it.

1779
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
Oh, is it?

1780
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Oh.

1781
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,800
Oh.

1782
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,800
Is it Mexican Coke?

1783
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:47,800
Yep.

1784
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,800
Yep.

1785
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,720
I actually knew this like 50-something, seven foot tall monster of a man.

1786
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,320
His name, his name was Nate and he was like a fit, no, not, not this guy.

1787
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:03,320
He was, he was a fucking, he was, he was like a freelance, he was a freelance physicist

1788
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:07,080
known in the industry and not making this up as a dragon slayer.

1789
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,080
Oh, fuck.

1790
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,080
Yeah.

1791
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,880
No, because, because like companies, corporations would have like some like intractable science

1792
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,800
problem that they didn't know how to solve and they, that would be the dragon and they

1793
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,080
would hire this guy to come in and fucking like do experiments and theorizing and theory

1794
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,560
crafting and stuff to fucking slay the dragon and fucking, and fucking come in.

1795
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,680
That's literally, that's literally me from the future.

1796
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,680
That is me from the future.

1797
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,680
I guarantee it.

1798
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,680
Okay.

1799
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,680
It's, it's you and I after we merge into one being.

1800
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,680
Right.

1801
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,680
And I obtained dominance of that, of course.

1802
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,680
It takes your name.

1803
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:43,080
Anyway, he, he swore, point, point is he swore to me that Mexican Coke was the ultimate

1804
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,080
hangover cure.

1805
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,600
That was, that's where that story was going.

1806
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
That's cool.

1807
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
All right.

1808
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
I just want to know how you met him.

1809
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,880
He, he was, he was, he was one of the friends of the people at Monkey House.

1810
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
Yeah.

1811
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,880
Okay.

1812
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,480
What's the difference between Mexican Coke and American Coke?

1813
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:02,120
I don't know because I never actually got to try any, but it's just used with sweat

1814
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,880
and like ball of sweat and like.

1815
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:04,880
Munchies right though.

1816
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,400
There is, there is a difference in the recipe because they're like, you're not legally even

1817
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,400
allowed.

1818
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,400
I don't know.

1819
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,840
There's some difference, but yeah, they, there's, there's a difference.

1820
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,480
Here's a funny little story that'll make you laugh every time.

1821
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,600
You know how I'm, I'm right, I'm right next to the water.

1822
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,320
In fact, I'm underwater right now using my sick underwater mic.

1823
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,480
Um, uh, you know how there's like, there's like food in the ocean, which is fucked up

1824
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,480
number one.

1825
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,480
Yeah.

1826
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,480
Like plankton and shit.

1827
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,480
Like plankton.

1828
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,480
Yeah.

1829
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,480
Like eat it, eat it with your, eat it with your grill.

1830
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,720
I'm imagining like, like Taco Bell bags, you know, like trash, you know, that kind.

1831
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,720
That's straight up silly.

1832
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,240
That is straight up silly.

1833
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:41,960
Anyway, one time I, I would never really dabble in the dark arts, AKC food.

1834
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:49,680
I once went to the city of Denver, um, the, the, the weed capital of the universe where

1835
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,520
all the, where all the sick illamouts get their good shit.

1836
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,920
I once went there and it was a bubblegum shrimp and I reluctantly tried a shrimp and, and

1837
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,920
I thought it was really nice and now I really like shrimp.

1838
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:04,880
And more of the stories I had to go to a mountain to, to learn the secrets of, of, of the ocean.

1839
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
And that's it.

1840
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,680
That's just good to show you that food, um, bridges cultures and if you go and if you

1841
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:13,840
go eat a Muslim man's brain, you may learn his actual secrets.

1842
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,240
Food works in mysterious ways.

1843
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
Yeah.

1844
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,480
That's, that's a beautiful story, Munchie.

1845
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,680
God, I miss the fucking ocean.

1846
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,680
I hate being this piece of shit Midwest state.

1847
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
Ocean is great.

1848
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,680
Guys, move to San Diego.

1849
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,200
All the other places are gay.

1850
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,960
I'd like to move somewhere to a coast.

1851
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,520
I honestly hate living here.

1852
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,000
I hate these fucking mountains.

1853
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I hate this shit.

1854
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Where's the fucking sea?

1855
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I miss the smell.

1856
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Okay.

1857
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Anyway, moving on.

1858
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Uh, so, uh, did you, I guess you're the last one.

1859
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah.

1860
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Right, right.

1861
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,800
I'm wondering if, if Jesse is still here or if he screamed chicken and tea so loud that

1862
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,800
he exploded.

1863
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,280
Um, I think it sounds like the explosion.

1864
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,280
Yeah.

1865
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:53,280
I am chicken and tea.

1866
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,280
Devour me.

1867
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,280
I like this guy.

1868
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,960
Devour my flesh and drinketh of my flesh.

1869
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,960
I am chicken and tea.

1870
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,960
It's what I made of.

1871
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,960
It's made of me.

1872
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:11,360
I need our audience to appreciate just how often the phrase chicken and tea was uttered

1873
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:17,800
in the Digi Ben and DeVoo household because Ben, DeVoo legitimately ate like mostly chicken

1874
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,640
and drank mostly tea as, as did Ben much of the time.

1875
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,640
I was always frying chicken and I was always buying a Wawa tea.

1876
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,240
So we'd all just like eat up in the kitchen sometimes and we'd all just stand there and

1877
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:33,760
just stare at each other and go chicken and tea, chicken and tea, chicken and tea.

1878
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,520
The Doritos, the Doritos chicken that just didn't, just didn't work.

1879
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,520
It just didn't hang out.

1880
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:39,520
Right.

1881
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,800
I'm just picturing like two guys in a dark, like an empty room sitting at a table with

1882
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,800
like a, with a single light hanging over it like in a, like a spy movie, like an interrogation

1883
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,640
room just sitting across a table staring into each other's bloodshot eyes just back

1884
01:22:53,640 --> 01:23:02,040
and forth chicken and tea, chicken and tea, I'm gay, I'm gay, chicken and tea.

1885
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,000
To work, to work, like the video for DNA by Kendrick Lamar.

1886
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,760
I don't know if you've seen that video, but it's exactly what you're describing.

1887
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,760
Oh yeah.

1888
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,760
Yep.

1889
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,280
The Doritos chicken would work if you fried it and then you dusted it with the powder.

1890
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,760
It doesn't work when the powder is on it before you fry it.

1891
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,760
It just doesn't.

1892
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,760
It doesn't survive.

1893
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,400
It doesn't survive the, the, the frying.

1894
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,760
For what should be obvious reasons?

1895
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,760
Yeah.

1896
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,760
Live and learn.

1897
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,760
Well, anyway, yeah, my favorite foods.

1898
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:39,440
Uh, uh, a broad, broad category favorites would be macaroni and cheese, all kinds,

1899
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,360
and uh, it's Philly cheesesteak.

1900
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,040
Everywhere I go, I try to, like, everywhere that has a Philly cheesesteak, I gotta try

1901
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:52,520
it and like 80% of them are disappointing, but the few that are good are great.

1902
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,560
You were just in Philly.

1903
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,560
How was the cheesesteak there?

1904
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,440
I didn't, uh, didn't actually end up eating cheesesteak there, which I fully intended to,

1905
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:05,200
but it turns out the place that we were at was like deep in the heart of Chinatown, like,

1906
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,640
which is massive in Philly, like all we, like we, we, we walked several blocks in all directions

1907
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,280
and it was all Chinatown.

1908
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,920
So we ate at a ramen place.

1909
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,680
We ate at a ramen place that, that was Naruto themed.

1910
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,560
Everything in there was Naruto related.

1911
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,880
They literally served our cheques in volumes of Naruto.

1912
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,880
That is fucking unbelievable.

1913
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,560
Go, I tweeted a whole bunch of pictures and stuff from it.

1914
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:32,080
If that we ran into Sean, that, that seems like a likely spot where he would be hanging

1915
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,400
out, the Naruto ramen place.

1916
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,880
Funny story about that.

1917
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,480
I was in Philly maybe like two summers ago and I, like, I had never eaten a Philly cheesesteak.

1918
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,680
So I tried to order one and the waitress was like, dude, I live here.

1919
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,120
It's like a meme.

1920
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,080
It's like a force to me.

1921
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,200
Yeah, it is a bit of a meme.

1922
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:49,640
It is a meme.

1923
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,680
That's, that's the thing.

1924
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:55,720
I don't think it's any better there than it is anywhere else, although the place with

1925
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,040
the best Philly cheesesteak in my city is a place literally called Philadelphia.

1926
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,160
So, um, I don't know.

1927
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,800
Yeah, I'd love to try on there.

1928
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,840
I mean, I'm sure it's just as like much variety.

1929
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,040
Like there's probably some places that are good and some places that suck just like

1930
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,800
anywhere else, but, uh, but yeah, Philly cheesesteaks are generally great.

1931
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:19,160
But my number one favorite specific food in the entire world is the Kona grill

1932
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,920
barbecue chicken flatbread pizza.

1933
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,600
You have to go there.

1934
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,760
I, this pizza, this fucking thing, because the only place I've ever been to

1935
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,840
Kona girl, it's right next to the Baltimore convention center, um, where

1936
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,480
Brony con and Otacon were.

1937
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,360
And like a couple years back at, I think, Brony con, I, I was, I was just getting,

1938
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,480
I was drinking a Kona grill because it's also a bar.

1939
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,400
And I ordered this flatbread because it was like, there was like a happy hour.

1940
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,440
It's only $7 for like what would be.

1941
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,360
It's like half price.

1942
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:51,080
So we, I ordered it and it was the best thing I'd ever tasted in my life.

1943
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,120
And I was like, holy shit, this is so magical.

1944
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,160
How could this be?

1945
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,080
And like afterwards I started ordering flatbreads at different restaurants.

1946
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,280
None of them even came close.

1947
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,200
So I was like, what is it about this Kona grill one?

1948
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:05,120
And finally a year later, I go back, I go back to Kona grill and I order it.

1949
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,600
And I legitimately cried when I ate it.

1950
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,840
It was so good.

1951
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,800
You know, all the memories, you know, I just want to say, go back to Kona grill.

1952
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,360
And experience that again.

1953
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,160
There we go.

1954
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:22,040
All you have to do is pledge to the greatest podcast on earth.

1955
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,200
The pony cast.

1956
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,400
If we raise a thousand dollars, we'll go back to briny con and we'll all have

1957
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,880
Kona grill forever.

1958
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,760
We'll do it.

1959
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,000
Pledge to the pony cast.

1960
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,640
The best podcast of all time.

1961
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,960
How is that going to get me to Baltimore?

1962
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,200
It'll get you and hippo there.

1963
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,000
Well, I mean, you can come on your own dime and you can be there with us.

1964
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,920
Now it comes to my business executive to say, do not associate with the pony cast.

1965
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,600
This is the PCP podcast.

1966
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,360
Fuck those guys.

1967
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,320
Those guys are trash.

1968
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,000
Don't associate that with El Rapia.

1969
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,880
They're bad people.

1970
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,320
Hey, with that kind of attitude, you're going to walk the plank.

1971
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,160
Nate, well, there are Kona grills in other cities.

1972
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,160
That's a lie.

1973
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,080
I listen to Baltimore.

1974
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,320
But but yeah, I've had I even I talked up this thing so much

1975
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,840
that people like several people at different conventions like went there

1976
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,440
and sent me pictures of them eating the pizza.

1977
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,240
And they all said that they completely agreed with me that it was a magical

1978
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,640
experience. So, you know, dude, I remember.

1979
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,240
Yeah, we were all having dinner there.

1980
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,400
It was like you, me and a bunch of these guys.

1981
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,840
I know, like Jeff Bridges was there, I think, or not Jeff Bridges.

1982
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,320
Fucking that, dude.

1983
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,800
But yeah, birches.

1984
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,520
And I just I just throw it out of hypothesis here.

1985
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,400
I remember we had such a good time there.

1986
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,480
Perhaps that sort of instilled that particular flatbread pizza chicken.

1987
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,040
I think it was all the good vibes.

1988
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,480
I mean, that's the funny thing about you saying that, Nate, is that when I went

1989
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:44,680
there the second time, I was upset because nobody would go with me because

1990
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,360
everyone I was that like, I think Otacon and everyone I know is poor.

1991
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,280
Like no one could afford to eat Kona Grill or was organized to do it.

1992
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,680
So I went alone and it was like a long ass wait.

1993
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:58,640
Like I was waiting forever and I was just like, oh, my God, this thing is

1994
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,720
this really going to be worth it?

1995
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:03,640
Like have I have I named myself and then I ate it and it was so good.

1996
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:04,880
I actually cried.

1997
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,080
And then I went back the next day and ate it again.

1998
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:15,200
You know, I have one thing I have a confession to make, guys.

1999
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,520
There is one soda that just appeals to me on such a deep level that I have no

2000
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,800
choice but to enjoy it.

2001
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,760
All right, I'm going to post a picture in the chat here.

2002
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,320
Here you go.

2003
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,400
100% natural berry sparkling water.

2004
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,240
Luckuck is my favorite drink in the fucking world.

2005
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,280
It's just it appeals to me on so many levels.

2006
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,240
Okay, there you go.

2007
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,240
Well, I have an actual thing to say.

2008
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,080
Thank you so much, Nate.

2009
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,400
I want to say I want to say I was going to say the thing about the thing about

2010
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:56,080
the thing about the thing about that is I it smells it smells like like a sweet,

2011
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,280
delicious thing, but it's not sweetened and I just try as I might.

2012
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,720
I can't get into unsweetened soda.

2013
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,840
Are you telling me this is a drink?

2014
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,080
This is like a photoshopped image.

2015
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,440
It's not actually called luckuck.

2016
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,960
Yeah, the drink is that's a terrible joke.

2017
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,720
You got me and I got me.

2018
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,120
Damn it at our at our cousin Alex's wedding, which was like the most miserable

2019
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,840
time of my life, I went to the bar and I looked.

2020
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:23,120
I was just looking for soda and the only soda they had was LaCroix and I took a

2021
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,320
sip and I was like, oh, it's not sweet.

2022
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,160
I can't deal with it.

2023
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,560
So I grabbed some grenadine from the bar and just poured and poured it into my

2024
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,440
LaCroix to try and sweeten it and some fucking second cousin or aunt I've never

2025
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,400
met before was like, huh, you spike in your drink.

2026
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,400
And I was like, no, just just putting grenadine in my in my LaCroix and they

2027
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,200
were like, oh, and that wasn't fun.

2028
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:42,080
So they left me alone.

2029
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,200
They were weird out and never talked to you ever again.

2030
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,360
LaCroix is disgusting.

2031
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,640
He committed a serious faux pas that day and they'll never forget.

2032
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:50,360
All right.

2033
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,360
Here's a thing that I can't believe none of us have really brought up yet,

2034
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:55,240
which is dessert.

2035
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:01,400
And I have a very specific dessert that is always the best thing after any meal.

2036
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,360
It's it's it's literally perfect.

2037
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:09,360
It's one scoop, one big scoop of vanilla ice cream and a hot fudge brownie.

2038
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,240
And I have that too.

2039
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,040
Mm hmm.

2040
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:11,920
Sure, that's a good one.

2041
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,640
That's perfect.

2042
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:15,440
It's it's like it's like God and the devil.

2043
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:20,200
Like the God is the is the vanilla ice cream and the devil's like, you know,

2044
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:24,680
skin, the thick skin, the leathery skin of the devil is the fudge brownies.

2045
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,080
Delicious.

2046
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,720
The brownie, the brownie is classic.

2047
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,480
However, in my opinion, the best thing ever to eat with ice cream is my

2048
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:36,680
favorite pie, which is strawberry rhubarb pie because the strawberry rhubarb

2049
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:40,440
cooks give us the sweet, like the two, like the slightly too sweet and mellow

2050
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,720
strawberries with like the tartness, the tartness of the rhubarb combined to fill

2051
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:51,080
this, the strawberry rhubarb pie with this red tangy goo that is just the most

2052
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,280
succulent thing on that sweet vanilla ice cream.

2053
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,160
I really want to try rhubarb because I've seen people like eat it.

2054
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,920
It's good.

2055
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,840
You got to come to our neck of the woods one day because our mom grows rhubarb

2056
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,960
in our garden and that she makes these giant ass strawberry rhubarb pies and we

2057
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,720
get ice cream.

2058
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,280
It's not it's not a popular pie.

2059
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,280
And I think it's just because people are scared of rhubarb because it just looks

2060
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,800
like celery, but it is.

2061
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,880
In fact, if you cook it right, it is just wonderful.

2062
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,400
It's true. It's true shit.

2063
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,480
Yeah. I really want to try rhubarb.

2064
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,480
It I've seen it on loads of cooking shows that like people make in desserts like

2065
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,080
it's going to be a rhubarb, a souffle or whatever.

2066
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:32,720
I. Oh, I was trying to find rhubarb for the longest time because it was out of

2067
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:36,800
season and I found some in a store and I brought it home and I made a strawberry

2068
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,280
rhubarb pie.

2069
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,120
I came out OK and then I couldn't.

2070
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,520
I wanted to make another one and I couldn't find it anywhere.

2071
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:46,800
And then I was in Atlanta for a while visiting Jackie and and and while I was

2072
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:52,040
gone, Davoo found rhubarb and bought some for me, which was very nice.

2073
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:55,120
Yeah, he was like, hey, I picked up some and he sent me like a picture of him next

2074
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,240
to the rhubarb, giving me like the shit eating grin.

2075
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,720
And I was like, yeah, so he he brought some rhubarb home for me and I took that

2076
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:06,760
and I took a I took a bag of frozen strawberries and blueberries.

2077
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,640
Because so I just I put blueberries in this one.

2078
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,640
I cooked it with that.

2079
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,480
So now officially, if you make a strawberry rhubarb pie, but you put

2080
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:17,360
blueberries in it, that is now officially the Davoo barb pie.

2081
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,160
So all right, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag Davoo barb tweet tweet pictures

2082
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,920
at TP Crastinators of you making your homemade Davoo barb pie.

2083
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,520
Please fuck making art.

2084
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,520
Let's make food.

2085
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,640
We're all going to make our own restaurant.

2086
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,480
The PC, the PCP Geron.

2087
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,120
It will be really nice.

2088
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,000
Any one every food, all the food is PCP in it.

2089
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,040
That's as Antoine Ego from Ratatouille says, like, not not anyone can become

2090
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,200
a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere and watch Ratatouille.

2091
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,280
It's a good film.

2092
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,800
It is a good film.

2093
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,000
You're a rat.

2094
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Anybody else?

2095
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,080
Dessert or we I don't like dessert.

2096
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,160
No, no, no, no.

2097
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,120
Deserves real quick the best.

2098
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,400
OK, OK, two things.

2099
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,120
Number one, if you've ever wanted to be raped, go to Mexico.

2100
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,560
But also ever wanted to have the most sucky thing ever inserted into

2101
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,880
your mind into your mouth and consensually also go to Mexico.

2102
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,200
Because I was in Tijuana.

2103
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,400
Those two sound like the same thing to me.

2104
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,320
Those sound like the same thing. Funny story.

2105
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:21,400
But but they have like they have fried ice cream there.

2106
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,880
They have fried ice cream where it's like it's like a hard shell.

2107
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,280
And then when you eat it, it's like there's ice cream in the middle.

2108
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,440
It's fucked up.

2109
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,080
It's not real. It's illegal.

2110
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:34,440
And in fact, I think it might be the most scary thing.

2111
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,720
I've had my greatest scary I've ever had.

2112
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,280
They have those flambé.

2113
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,760
There's there's a couple of combinations.

2114
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,760
What was that called?

2115
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,080
What is that called when you blow torch?

2116
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,840
Yeah, that's flambé, but fried ice cream is different.

2117
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:51,040
Fried ice cream is like fried in like in like in like a bread shell kind of thing.

2118
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,040
But but the greatest scary effect.

2119
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,560
That was a lie.

2120
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,440
My greatest scary is in fact, flan, because I get so scared when I eat it

2121
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
because I know that nothing else will be better.

2122
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,960
So you get some flan and flan is my favorite and it's all it's all it's all like jelly.

2123
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,680
And it makes it makes me laugh every single time.

2124
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:12,560
I just look at it and I can't help but I see it's just so fucking funny.

2125
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,160
Flan, you make you make you got a good flan going.

2126
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,480
You got the night's meal and entertainment.

2127
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,720
Flan is really nice.

2128
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,080
I like to watch it dance.

2129
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,320
And that's the only thing that can get me.

2130
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:32,640
All right, also, also, also another great ice cream thing is literal honeycomb pieces

2131
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,360
with dark chocolate and an ice cream.

2132
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:35,760
What the fuck man?

2133
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,400
That's deep.

2134
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:40,240
Like if you get literal honeycomb with vanilla ice cream and dark chocolate sprinkles.

2135
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:44,800
I sound that sounds amazing, but I don't know because I've never eaten actual honeycomb.

2136
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:45,880
Honeycomb is delicious.

2137
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,360
I've had it.

2138
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,000
It sounds fucking awesome.

2139
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,080
Speaking of ice cream, there reminds me of something traumatic

2140
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,640
that happened to me when I was a kid.

2141
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,760
When I was in first grade, my hot, beautiful teacher took me out to get a banana split

2142
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:04,480
at Dairy Queen and she didn't even have the courtesy to molest me.

2143
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,920
Why take me out on a fucking on a banana split date if you're not going to have a banana split date?

2144
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,640
Wait, is that why it was traumatic because you weren't molesting me?

2145
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,200
Yeah, exactly.

2146
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,520
Yeah, I feel you, dawg.

2147
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:22,160
It's an always sunny bit, but it actually happened to me, so it's still, this is the real thing.

2148
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:24,760
I relate very strongly to that episode.

2149
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,880
Here, let me say my favorite real quick.

2150
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,880
This is very simple.

2151
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:35,400
There's this particular type of friendlies ice cream, I think, just called forbidden chocolate.

2152
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,480
And it is like the deepest, darkest possible chocolate flavor.

2153
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,160
And just a scoop of that is just the most delicious fucking thing.

2154
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:46,880
Nate, I remember that on our family outings as youths, when we went out for ice cream,

2155
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,320
I know you would always get a black raspberry ice cream.

2156
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,880
Was it black raspberry or black?

2157
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,560
Yeah, black raspberry with peanut butter cups.

2158
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,200
That's correct.

2159
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,600
And I stand by that as a fantastic combination.

2160
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,560
But I just don't eat ice cream a lot at all anymore.

2161
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,560
So if you like ice cream, black raspberry and peanut butter cups is great.

2162
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,280
So go ahead and try it, you piece of shit idiot.

2163
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:15,080
I mean, to be honest, what I consider like a dessert, like literally the glass of orange juice

2164
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,880
I mentioned before is my dessert, and it's fucking great.

2165
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,000
If you can trick your brain, or not trick, but like fix your brain into being like this

2166
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,520
glass of orange juice is like, oh my god, this level of sweetness.

2167
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,080
That's where you want to be, yeah?

2168
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:32,280
You reminded me of two things that I'm not sure people will agree on.

2169
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,880
Orange chocolate is great and also salted chocolate.

2170
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,600
Yeah, I agree on both.

2171
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,040
Both good.

2172
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,560
I agree on both counts.

2173
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,400
Do you ever have hot pepper chocolate?

2174
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,320
They're the best to have.

2175
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,320
Well, what hot pepper chili?

2176
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,680
I've had I've heard of that.

2177
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,720
I haven't actually eaten it.

2178
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,320
It's chocolate with chili powder.

2179
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,320
My mom likes it a lot.

2180
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,440
I've heard of like chocolate with garlic in it.

2181
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:54,880
OK, that's too far.

2182
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:55,440
Weird, weird.

2183
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,840
If you guys had white chocolate, I used to like going around as a little kid.

2184
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,000
No, that would be racist.

2185
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,640
That would be racist.

2186
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,560
I don't eat that shit.

2187
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,920
You know what, you know, I do love Hershey's cookies and cream though.

2188
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
This is white chocolate every day.

2189
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,960
Are we still talking about food?

2190
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,880
This has been going on for a couple hours, guys.

2191
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:14,720
I mean, I was trying to see our conversation towards something more fun like child molestation.

2192
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,960
Yeah, we haven't even gone off topic.

2193
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:19,960
Holy shit.

2194
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:20,480
That's true.

2195
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,640
Well, that's because food is the greatest topic.

2196
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,560
And I knew it would be.

2197
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,280
Yeah, I could go for like another one.

2198
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:29,480
When are we going to do the who got molested the most cast?

2199
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,840
That's the one that I've been preparing all this time for.

2200
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,680
I've had all my notes for years.

2201
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,600
We all like we all I'm imagining like we all come to this to sit down by the PCP.

2202
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,240
Like we've all like we're all ready to hear our hot childhood molestation stories.

2203
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,680
And we all sit down like we're playing poker and we're all like I and each other.

2204
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:51,920
We're all I and each other up and then someone someone shoots the gun.

2205
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,360
Someone shoots the gun to signal that we begin and we all throw our hands down.

2206
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,720
We all got nothing.

2207
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:00,560
And we're all like, oh, and then we cry for hours.

2208
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,720
We cry for hours on the fact that we haven't been molested.

2209
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:07,920
This is where I find out that my teacher molested all of you and me.

2210
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,720
What was wrong with me?

2211
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,240
I thought I was your favorite.

2212
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,520
Oh, man.

2213
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:16,160
Yeah, dog.

2214
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:16,320
Yeah.

2215
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:16,880
Well, food.

2216
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:17,280
Okay.

2217
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:23,200
Foodcast is the only podcast that I was actually excited about enough to sign up for at the very

2218
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,760
beginning.

2219
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,360
Like the second the Google doc went up, I was like, boom, food.

2220
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,720
First guy there.

2221
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,960
No one else is intruding on this.

2222
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,880
Well, I mean, food is just incredible.

2223
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,240
Everything about it is great.

2224
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,480
And there's literally no negative whatsoever.

2225
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:41,280
And the fact is we've only barely scratched the surface of discussion of food I would like to have.

2226
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,760
But thankfully, if you, if you too would like to hear much more food discussion,

2227
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,440
go subscribe to Munchieshatsky and listen to our podcast.

2228
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:53,280
And all together now, you can watch the best show in the universe.

2229
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,120
Steal the bird!

2230
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:59,280
As if it was easy!

2231
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:04,960
Okay, here we go.

2232
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,080
Biotch!

2233
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:13,200
Hey, there actually is a relevant question here as I'm looking at our, as our hashtag

2234
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,800
askpcp questions.

2235
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,760
Make sure you do that shit.

2236
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:16,880
You don't even have to add us anymore.

2237
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,200
Just hashtag askpcp.

2238
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,800
So let's, let's transition over here.

2239
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:26,320
Here's our dude at Dr. Butts asking, what's your go-to meal that you cook?

2240
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,600
Do you got, and he's like, you guys do cook your own meals, right?

2241
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,200
Did they know this was a food cast or is that just-

2242
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,320
No, no, this guy didn't know.

2243
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,120
This guy had no idea.

2244
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,960
Unless Dr. Butts is some sort of time wizard.

2245
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:46,080
The thing that I cook all the time is, is, is, is fucking something with pasta.

2246
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,560
I don't know.

2247
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,920
Undescended proctology.

2248
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,800
The last time I cooked was like literally a month and a half ago when me and Munchie

2249
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,360
made ramen for the Stealing Your Dads podcast.

2250
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:55,760
Yeah.

2251
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,280
I don't think I cook anything.

2252
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,800
That is cooking.

2253
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,560
Yeah, you boil the water, you pour the powder, there you go.

2254
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,680
Wait, I made a loaf of bread today.

2255
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:08,880
I made two little loaves of bread today just because we didn't have any bread.

2256
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:09,520
That's awesome.

2257
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,400
So that's, I don't make, I don't make it often, but yeah.

2258
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,920
You can make bread?

2259
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:14,880
Homemade, dude, is the shit.

2260
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,240
Homemade bread rules.

2261
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:19,040
Oh, you guys, you guys should look into homemade bread yet.

2262
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:19,680
It's fucking great.

2263
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:24,080
I make one thing all the fucking time and it's called a bread basket.

2264
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,280
And it's just a piece, it's this goofy little like thing I learned at Boy Scout

2265
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,160
camp a million years ago, which is just a piece of bread.

2266
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:35,280
And you like, you put like olive oil on it and you put it, you actually like cut out the center

2267
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:39,680
of the piece of bread and you crack an egg and you put it into the center hole and you

2268
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:42,080
just fry that and then you flip it over, you fry it again.

2269
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,920
You make sure that that yolk stays fucking runny so as to not ruin it.

2270
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,160
Oh God, my fucking lucky star is falling everywhere.

2271
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:50,720
And then you just eat it and it's delicious.

2272
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:51,520
It's the best.

2273
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,000
I used to make, I used to make, I used to make egg sandwiches for myself all the time

2274
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
because they're super cheap and easy and delicious.

2275
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,480
Put a little tomato on there and you're all good.

2276
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:06,080
But since I discovered Digi's Deep Fryer ever since then, I just, I fried chicken,

2277
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,280
just homemade fried chicken is what I've done with my life.

2278
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:14,880
That reminds me, there were two, there's two things that I will, I don't know,

2279
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,640
call it cooking or not.

2280
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:21,040
I prepare two dishes that I used to eat all the time that I was kind of proud of.

2281
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:26,880
One is just ramen, but ramen with all kinds of extra shit in there where you just like boil

2282
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:34,080
a bunch of onions and stuff in the pot like up until adding the ramen and then like add in

2283
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,600
sriracha and all this, like every fucking spice you can find in the cabinet.

2284
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,440
Just make a chaos ramen and meat, the lunch meat.

2285
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,040
You know who'd be all about that shit?

2286
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,720
I mean, this is a fucking gladiolus from Final Fantasy XV.

2287
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:53,920
There is legitimately a plot line where the real ramen, you know, branded top ramen has

2288
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,280
like this plot line where gladiolus is like just going on about how like fucking, this guy's like

2289
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,240
the biggest, most jacked dude in the fucking world and he's talking about how much he loves

2290
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:06,400
fucking top ramen and like making these piece of shit recipes where you just like, oh,

2291
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,920
it's the ultimate flavor experience.

2292
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,800
You can add a bunch of extra shit and it's fucking fantastic.

2293
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,520
I'm just saying like, I just want to put you guys next to each other.

2294
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:17,920
I want to put you guys next to each other and be like, these guys both eat the same shit.

2295
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:18,880
What is happening here?

2296
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,320
What's, what's the difference here?

2297
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,680
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't eat it all the time or anything.

2298
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:30,080
But the other thing that I enjoy making is egg salad sandwiches where you make your own egg salad.

2299
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:36,400
Like just take a cup, hard boil a couple of eggs and then throw in like a shitload of mayonnaise

2300
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:43,040
and mustard and hot sauce and pepper and salt and anything else you feel like having in your egg

2301
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:48,400
salad and then just grind that shit up and it can make a couple sandwiches out of it and it's

2302
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,200
fucking delicious.

2303
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,000
But get it on like giant bread.

2304
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,080
Get like a big crazy bread with like a thousand grains.

2305
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,840
Bigger than a continent piece of bread.

2306
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,280
Here is the second, the second munchie delectable

2307
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,960
called Father Guts because I just love dads so much.

2308
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:07,760
Here's what you do.

2309
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,440
You crack literally 12 eggs.

2310
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,720
That's how much I eat normally.

2311
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:12,960
I eat 12 eggs.

2312
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,480
That's like Gaston level eggs.

2313
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,280
Okay.

2314
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,840
And then, and then you get a huge fucking pan.

2315
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,880
Then you make scrambled eggs like normal.

2316
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,960
Then you put in the following pepper jack cheese because I fucking love pepper jack cheese.

2317
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:32,400
Then you put in honey ham and you also put in like little bacon bits and then you scramble all

2318
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,600
of that and then you just drown it in fucking pepper.

2319
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:42,000
Like table pepper and like normal like actual like big boy like actual like real man pepper.

2320
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:43,920
And it's pretty good.

2321
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,640
Sick.

2322
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,920
And it resembles guts that I would eat from a father.

2323
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,280
By the way, update, food update everyone.

2324
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,120
I have transitioned to eating a giant fucking piece of broccoli and raspberries.

2325
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,480
Excellent.

2326
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,760
I'm living like a king.

2327
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:58,240
Yeah.

2328
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:58,640
Good.

2329
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,280
Excellent.

2330
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,880
I think we're, we might probably be done for, for the food.

2331
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,160
So shall we go on to questions?

2332
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,600
You're already on this question.

2333
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,840
We are literally in the questions right now.

2334
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:08,160
Sorry.

2335
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,120
I think I zoned out.

2336
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,000
You idiot.

2337
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,600
You're dead to me.

2338
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,680
The question who else, what do we cook?

2339
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,840
Oh fucking stupid question being topic relevant.

2340
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,560
That's confusing.

2341
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,280
It is confusing.

2342
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:22,480
Okay.

2343
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,360
Well, here's, here's a question that's actually like the worst question ever,

2344
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,760
but like maybe we could just say something that's useful.

2345
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,720
This guy, this is piece of shit idiot at solely claw asks,

2346
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,360
I don't know if this was talked about in the past,

2347
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,680
but what's the origin of the PCP?

2348
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,120
You dumb piece of shit.

2349
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,120
Are you stupid?

2350
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:44,160
I feel like that's been talked about more times than anything else.

2351
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,360
So many times.

2352
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:45,600
Okay.

2353
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,560
Maybe this guy's a new guy.

2354
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,960
We just, there's nothing we like to talk about more than ourselves.

2355
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,720
Here's the story of the PCP.

2356
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,600
I wanted some clowns to entertain me and juggle.

2357
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,600
And so we thought really hard and then they started to materialize.

2358
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,480
You know, the ones, the, the, the wicked jesters,

2359
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:06,160
they started to show up and then, and do their sacred jigs

2360
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:08,000
and their, and their cursed juggles.

2361
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,080
And oh how I, oh how I laugh.

2362
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,440
Oh how I LOL every time I summon them for their powers.

2363
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:20,240
I feel like we should write a, a, a, The Saga Begins Esk History of PCP song.

2364
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,520
And then just have that out there.

2365
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,520
We should do a lecture on the PCP, University on the PCP.

2366
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:30,480
Love, you know, that there's just go in a fandom far away.

2367
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,760
Some ponies were dammaging shit, I don't know.

2368
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:39,920
Digi's Unreleased Footwear lecture was almost a history of the PCP.

2369
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,760
It kind of was, it was.

2370
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,520
Yeah, I just, I want to see it.

2371
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,880
I want to give credit by the way.

2372
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,480
It's unwatchable because the fucking audio was fucked up.

2373
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,920
Oh, there's a, oh, oh, oh, oh no it's not.

2374
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,400
Yeah.

2375
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,400
I found it. I have it.

2376
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:01,360
I have footage of your lecture with pretty decent audio.

2377
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,680
Like your audio is good, but my audio is dog shit.

2378
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,320
No, no, your audio is fine in the footage I have.

2379
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,760
Really?

2380
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,800
The only problem with the footage that I have

2381
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:17,040
is that it's a close-up on you and you don't see us in the audience, but the audio is fine.

2382
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:23,440
Huh, because when I listened to it, it was like the audience's mic was on, but not mine.

2383
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:28,960
So like you, you can hear me, but I'm like way in the distance and I sound shitty

2384
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,440
and uh and everybody in the audience sounds great.

2385
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,840
So some, some find the, I still don't know if it'll ever see the Lloyd of Day though,

2386
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,320
because the lecture itself is terrible.

2387
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:38,640
Yeah.

2388
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,720
It was done at like four in the morning.

2389
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:41,760
None of us wanted to be there.

2390
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,440
It's like seven in the morning and I'm, I'm drunk.

2391
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,200
Everyone else is tired because either they've been up all night

2392
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,960
or they had to be woken up for the lecture.

2393
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,760
So like no one is interested in doing it at this time.

2394
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,400
The lecture was about me and I was like the least invested of anyone there.

2395
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,920
No one was invested at all.

2396
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,480
I wish we could do it again and do it better, you know.

2397
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,840
That lecture was too long and rambly and you're, the fact that you were drunk really

2398
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,360
showed through a lot.

2399
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:13,760
Also I'm shirtless the entire time and I kept knocking down the board doing the

2400
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,640
exact same things over and over again that we told you not to do because it would knock

2401
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,120
down the board and you kept, you persistently did it for the entire

2402
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:19,440
journey.

2403
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:19,920
Yeah.

2404
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,400
If you want to tell the people the story of Endless Jest, just make the Endless Jest

2405
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:29,200
analysis video that you've been saying you were going to make for four years to finally

2406
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:34,560
make me have some success in this neither farce of a life that I've been scraping by in.

2407
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,200
I've been meaning to do it but you kept, over the last six months you kept insisting that

2408
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,720
you wanted to leave the internet and not draw more attention to yourself.

2409
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,120
So I was not sure if I should do it anymore.

2410
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,400
Well that's also true but the impetus is on you to find a compromise between my two wildly

2411
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,040
contrasting opinions on the subject of my own career.

2412
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,960
How about you make an analysis about a mysterious guy that you won't name?

2413
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,720
No, I'm not sure we know enough about the mysterious rhinoceros to actually make a full,

2414
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,520
yeah, you know, he's just too mysterious.

2415
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:12,800
Well, okay, so but seriously, do the analysis of Endlit G finally the people can see and

2416
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,560
it's just me and a Donatello mask.

2417
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,120
What's, I'm going to the thing.

2418
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:21,120
It's Procrastopedia.Mirahis or what's the one?

2419
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:22,080
I don't know.

2420
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,440
Mirahis.

2421
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,040
Like the, there's a wiki, okay here we go.

2422
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,240
Yeah, it's Procrastopedia.Mirahis.

2423
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:29,520
It's like a guy's personal thing.

2424
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,800
It's not actually a wiki.

2425
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,880
If you go to Procrastopedia.Mirahis, we'll put a link in the description.

2426
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,480
Dot org, that's like some, you can at least read up to get the basics there.

2427
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,240
But just like, if you just watch from the start, you're going to know like 90% of the

2428
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:42,720
shit.

2429
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:45,840
I'm sure we've had podcasts just dedicated to telling you.

2430
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,880
The bottom line is that it's all thanks to me.

2431
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,600
I'm the reason that all of these people are friends.

2432
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,320
They all got together because I am great.

2433
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:58,240
So everyone, the comments that I suck on every episode.

2434
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,800
You're fucking welcome for this podcast existing.

2435
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,680
Those people have mostly gone away.

2436
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:04,640
Mostly people love you now.

2437
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,560
Yeah, I mean, it seems like every episode is Jesse was right.

2438
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,600
The comment section.

2439
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:10,480
Yeah.

2440
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:12,320
All right.

2441
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,200
Do we have another question?

2442
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:14,480
Yeah, let's see.

2443
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:14,880
What do we got?

2444
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,840
Okay, here is a fun one for you folks at home at Muhammad underscore H.

2445
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,640
If you were a female, what boob size do you want to have?

2446
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:27,200
And how much would you actually show?

2447
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,400
I've thought about that a lot.

2448
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:32,320
If I was a female, I would immediately feel myself.

2449
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:37,680
Well, I think I'd be a modest lady.

2450
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,960
The way I've thought about it is that I like girls with like smaller to moderate size tits.

2451
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,680
Like I like smaller tits, so I would rather have bigger tits.

2452
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:52,880
So that like I could attract those girls.

2453
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,760
Like because I'm assuming I'm a lesbian if I'm if I'm of course.

2454
01:49:59,040 --> 01:49:59,840
Whatever you want.

2455
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,720
Look, I think about this literally every day of my life.

2456
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:05,040
I've no doubt what I would do if I was a lesbian.

2457
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,520
So my ideal is I've got big boobs.

2458
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:12,000
So other girls think I'm hot and they won't like girls with smaller boobs.

2459
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,360
Probably don't think there is.

2460
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,320
They probably have, you know, aren't as confident about their attractiveness.

2461
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,040
So they see me.

2462
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:17,840
Is that real life?

2463
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:18,720
I'm not sure that works.

2464
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:19,760
I'm the hot one.

2465
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,160
And I'm like, no, I think you're the hot one.

2466
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:26,320
And you know, if I was a girl, that's kind of romantic, did you?

2467
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,120
I like it.

2468
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:27,760
I guess so.

2469
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,200
If I was a girl, I would go trans and then be a mannequin.

2470
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,800
And then yeah, that's it.

2471
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,400
But how big would your booze be?

2472
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,280
I would circumvent.

2473
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,680
I would still have boobs and they would be gigantic.

2474
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:42,560
Like like dragging it down on the floor.

2475
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,760
Like I would trip over my own lips constantly.

2476
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:48,400
Oh my God.

2477
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:48,800
I'm sorry.

2478
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,240
Can we just skip ahead to this other question?

2479
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,520
Because this is fucking gold.

2480
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,080
All right.

2481
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,120
Okay. No, I'm sorry.

2482
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:54,080
I'll come back to that.

2483
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,360
I'll get to it after you finish.

2484
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,880
Munchy, how big would your tits be?

2485
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,240
You piece of shit.

2486
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:01,600
My tits would be not, they wouldn't be real.

2487
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,920
And you know, I wouldn't like it.

2488
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,920
So the answer would be, if I preferably really big,

2489
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,120
so it would hurt even more when I cut them off without surgery.

2490
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,200
Like an Amazon warrior.

2491
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:13,760
Right.

2492
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,000
Yeah.

2493
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,320
Well, for me,

2494
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:18,720
I know I talk a lot, you know,

2495
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,480
about hashtag killing all women.

2496
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:21,280
You know, that's me.

2497
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,400
I started that hashtag.

2498
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,040
That was all me.

2499
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,600
But I actually think,

2500
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,000
I actually have some empathy for chicks with tits

2501
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
because I think I might be embarrassed about it

2502
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,680
if people were looking at them too much.

2503
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:34,320
And I know that I would definitely be modest.

2504
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:35,840
I would definitely be modest about,

2505
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,520
I don't know what size they be

2506
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:38,320
because that's a retarded question.

2507
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,680
What, have I got a fucking fan fiction

2508
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,920
about my own fictional fake female tits?

2509
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:42,080
Yes.

2510
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,720
I don't fucking know.

2511
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:46,160
That's what I, I've written so many stories

2512
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:48,400
about lesbians where I'm just projecting myself

2513
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,040
into one of them.

2514
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,520
I don't know.

2515
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,080
Probably small.

2516
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:54,640
I don't know.

2517
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:56,240
Yeah, I'd be modest too.

2518
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,560
I'm, you know, I'm the rainbow-dash person.

2519
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,400
So, you know, flat DTF.

2520
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:00,880
That's me.

2521
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:02,720
What pony are we guys?

2522
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,520
What pony are we?

2523
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,760
Oh, definitely, you know, gay.

2524
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,640
That's all of them.

2525
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:13,920
Let's just move on to the next question.

2526
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:14,160
Okay.

2527
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,680
This is a fantastic one.

2528
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,080
Okay.

2529
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,600
At Yukari K. Forgold asks simply,

2530
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,520
do you tolerate children?

2531
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:22,800
No.

2532
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,120
Never.

2533
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:26,240
Under no single day of my fucking life.

2534
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:26,720
No.

2535
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,600
They're unacceptable.

2536
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,640
I'm not always.

2537
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:30,240
They are an abomination.

2538
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,240
Literally put them in a concentration camp.

2539
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:34,240
You would ever like an entire life.

2540
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,040
I'm not around children that much,

2541
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,080
but there's definitely an age range

2542
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:41,440
which is always bullshit.

2543
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:41,520
Yeah.

2544
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,760
And then there's an age range beyond which they're okay.

2545
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,360
So, as long as they're okay, I'm okay with them.

2546
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,040
But if they're like yelling and screaming

2547
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,640
and they don't know how to not do that,

2548
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,760
then I will kill them.

2549
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,480
Everybody under 25 should be in jail.

2550
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,320
I agree.

2551
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:56,880
I agree.

2552
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:57,360
I agree.

2553
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,200
Well, that's what we have school for.

2554
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:00,560
That's not even inaccurate.

2555
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:01,520
That's completely true.

2556
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,800
Yeah, I advocate for the concentration camp solution

2557
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,280
for children.

2558
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,560
They should be, you know, brave new world.

2559
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,120
That's what we should do.

2560
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,360
I think I get along with kids a lot better

2561
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,720
than most people seem to.

2562
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,240
Everyone I know.

2563
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,360
That's because you're a pedophile.

2564
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:14,960
Well, everyone I know is always like,

2565
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,520
Yeah, you have to.

2566
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,640
Oh, my God, kids are just so terrible.

2567
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,040
They're so obnoxious and they're so the shit

2568
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,720
and I'll never have kids.

2569
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:26,000
And I'm like, I think it's just because I see myself

2570
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,240
as vastly more powerful than them

2571
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:30,320
that like nothing they can do can bother me

2572
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:34,320
because I think this is just the screams of a child.

2573
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,520
You know, you're just some kid.

2574
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,200
Well, that's why I said if you can talk to them

2575
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:40,320
and they can talk back,

2576
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,160
if they can like understand words

2577
01:53:42,160 --> 01:53:44,480
and they'll be like, well, what does this mean?

2578
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,160
You know, I would humor that for a bit.

2579
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:48,720
I think I could talk to a young child that can speak,

2580
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,400
but like a like a screaming baby.

2581
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,680
I mean, you gotta eat.

2582
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,080
I think of it in terms of like oftentimes,

2583
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,160
I'm thinking of this in terms of like,

2584
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:00,720
would I would I want kids of my own, right?

2585
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:04,160
Because like when you see a terrible child in public,

2586
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,000
you always think, oh, God, kids are awful,

2587
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,880
but it's not kids.

2588
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,040
It's just that kid and his shitty parents, you know?

2589
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,360
But like, when you meet kids who are great,

2590
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:15,840
you're like, oh, right, kids can be great.

2591
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,320
It's a matter of like what kid it is

2592
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,720
and how they're being raised, you know?

2593
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:23,680
And it's like, if I know what I'm doing,

2594
01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:25,040
to at least some extent,

2595
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:29,600
maybe I can manage to have a kid who comes out cool, you know?

2596
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,840
Well, I mean, it's still going to ruin my life,

2597
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,280
no matter what, I know that.

2598
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,160
Like, you know,

2599
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,960
if anything, code name kids next door has taught me

2600
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,200
is that we must destroy them.

2601
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,080
They're coming for us, dude.

2602
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,600
They have the technology.

2603
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,840
Yeah, Vincent and Charlotte will be the perfect children.

2604
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,440
It will be, you know, twins.

2605
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:51,920
They're going to be raised properly.

2606
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,240
They're going to be good boys and girl.

2607
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:57,280
You really named your son after Ben Saints Comet?

2608
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,480
I've fucking, Ben probably named his character

2609
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,680
after my potential son,

2610
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:03,680
because I've liked that name for a fucking 15 years.

2611
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,880
I didn't even know.

2612
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,480
I didn't know about that until you,

2613
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,320
it's been like 20 years I've been talking about that.

2614
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,040
Much later.

2615
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,480
And then I remembered Vagler's,

2616
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:12,400
oh yeah, you did say you like that name.

2617
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,840
Well, suck it, nerd.

2618
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,600
I don't have a fucking copyright on the name,

2619
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:16,480
so I don't like my name.

2620
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,640
It's actually been 20 years you've been saying it.

2621
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,960
You've been thinking about having kids since you were six.

2622
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,000
Final Fantasy VII,

2623
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,920
Final Fantasy VII came out in 1997,

2624
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,800
which is when I played the game,

2625
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,000
and it's been 20 years since then,

2626
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,520
and ever since then I liked the name Vincent

2627
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,040
and thought I'd name my son after him.

2628
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,600
So there you go.

2629
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,800
When I was a teenager,

2630
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,600
I really hoped I would have a kid and name it Comwy,

2631
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,200
and now I want to kill myself.

2632
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:35,680
Oh, God.

2633
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,360
Oh my God, like from X?

2634
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:40,320
Yes, like from X.

2635
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,000
I can't believe you knew that.

2636
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,600
I can't believe I know that either,

2637
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:44,640
but fuck you.

2638
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,960
Yeah, it means it translates to child of God,

2639
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,440
I believe.

2640
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,720
Holy shit.

2641
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,880
I'm gonna name my son Naruto.

2642
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,600
I just realized that that,

2643
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:56,640
I was like,

2644
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,240
why are you all laughing so hard at that,

2645
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,640
that I realized it makes it sound like I am God

2646
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,000
if I name my kid Comwy.

2647
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:02,960
That's not what I meant.

2648
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,560
What the hell?

2649
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,280
How could you name him after Comwy and not Kusanagi,

2650
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,440
the actual only good character in that show?

2651
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:10,720
In X?

2652
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,640
Well, I never watched the show of X.

2653
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:13,280
I only saw the movie.

2654
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,360
You never actually watched the show?

2655
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,720
No, I watched the movie.

2656
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,640
I too only saw the movie,

2657
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,160
and I thought it was the coolest shit

2658
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,920
when I was like 12 years old.

2659
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,360
Because it is the coolest shit.

2660
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,120
Let's all go back and watch X.

2661
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,640
Yeah, I'm dying here.

2662
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,480
Is this the one about the brother and sister

2663
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:30,000
who are reincarnated angels?

2664
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,040
Is that the one?

2665
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:31,120
Not quite.

2666
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:32,160
I don't fucking know.

2667
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,520
I think it's the angel sanctuary.

2668
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:34,400
No, it's about a guy.

2669
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,200
That's what I'm thinking about.

2670
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,040
It's called Neon Genesis Evangelism.

2671
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,480
X is the one where there's the dragons of heaven

2672
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,600
and the dragons of earth,

2673
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,440
and there are two different seven-man teams

2674
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,480
who have to duke it out in like these like,

2675
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,760
this version of Tokyo.

2676
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,040
They're fighting in Tokyo,

2677
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,400
but they'll open up like these things

2678
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,800
where it's like they don't affect the outside world.

2679
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,240
And they duke it out with superpowers

2680
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,760
and psychic abilities and shit.

2681
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,560
But in the movie, it's all about the deaths.

2682
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:00,400
It's all about the crazy ass ways

2683
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,440
that people get killed,

2684
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,280
and then it ends with a fucking apocalypse

2685
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,320
and everything gets destroyed.

2686
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,160
And you see people fucking,

2687
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,520
there's this hilarious moment

2688
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,720
where all these people are running out

2689
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,000
of like a church or something,

2690
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,840
and you just see a pillar just fall on a guy

2691
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,040
and crush him completely

2692
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:13,840
and fall through the earth.

2693
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,120
It's fucking awesome.

2694
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:16,640
And then at the very end,

2695
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:19,040
everyone's dead except for the main character,

2696
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,040
and he's just sitting there like crying

2697
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,640
and cradling his best friend's head

2698
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,000
because he had to fight his best friend.

2699
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:24,160
So we're on the side.

2700
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:25,280
Oh, I remember that.

2701
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,720
Yeah, I've seen that image.

2702
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:27,360
Yeah, okay.

2703
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,080
It's awesome.

2704
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,840
Well, 10 out of 10.

2705
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,600
Very nice.

2706
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,720
And my socks.

2707
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:33,040
What?

2708
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:33,520
Okay, there's another one here.

2709
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,800
I cannot believe I remembered

2710
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,240
the main character of X's name.

2711
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:36,720
What the fuck?

2712
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:39,680
I saw that movie once like 15 years ago.

2713
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,360
I think it's like both the main characters

2714
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,160
are named Kamui,

2715
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:44,400
and the fact that they are named that

2716
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,920
is a big deal in the movie.

2717
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,840
So that's why it's such a memorable time.

2718
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,200
I was going to say it, Ben,

2719
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,080
because I remembered it too,

2720
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,240
but I was like, no, I shouldn't say this.

2721
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,560
It'll be too gay if I out myself.

2722
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,880
No, Ben, that's not no problem for me.

2723
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,320
You took that for me,

2724
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,200
and you got us on a cool anime conversation.

2725
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:01,920
Yeah.

2726
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:02,560
Hero.

2727
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:02,880
Here's...

2728
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:04,960
You left over St. U.

2729
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,080
Okay, here's a simple question

2730
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,760
with far-reaching ramifications.

2731
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,200
So maybe this will be our last one,

2732
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:13,680
but it's at Zilovich,

2733
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:16,320
our old friend Zilovich the Minan,

2734
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,120
asks,

2735
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:19,440
pessimism versus optimism.

2736
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,440
I like to think he's asking,

2737
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,000
what's better,

2738
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:22,880
what's more useful?

2739
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:23,600
Optimism.

2740
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,040
Optimism.

2741
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,080
Optimism, why would you tell me that?

2742
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,360
Optimism would be helpful.

2743
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,920
Pessimism actually does have some advantages.

2744
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,760
It helps you plan for bad things that could happen.

2745
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,840
It helps you be a coward and not do anything.

2746
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:36,880
Have you heard of the phrase,

2747
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:37,520
cautious optimism?

2748
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,960
Optimism is nicer.

2749
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,160
I like nice things.

2750
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,200
Like, say that again, did you?

2751
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,400
Like, have you heard of the phrase,

2752
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,840
cautious optimism?

2753
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:44,480
Like, just...

2754
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:44,800
Sure.

2755
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,400
Like, to me, optimism,

2756
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:49,120
it's not about thinking that things will go well.

2757
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,840
It's about hoping that they will go well.

2758
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,440
Like, just not as...

2759
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,760
Like, if pessimism is to always assume the worst,

2760
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,880
to think this is going to go badly.

2761
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,200
And I think that's actually more limiting

2762
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:04,320
because people won't, like, do things that are helpful

2763
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,160
because they just assume they've already lost.

2764
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:07,600
Okay, well, there are degrees, right?

2765
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,360
If you think things will go bad for sure,

2766
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,640
you'll never take any risks.

2767
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:10,800
Exactly.

2768
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,880
Well, okay, if you get paralyzed by it,

2769
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,680
then sure, I'm with you.

2770
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:15,920
But, I mean, I don't know how scientific this was,

2771
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:18,480
but once I think I read somewhere that in general,

2772
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:20,880
people who are at least have some elements

2773
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,400
of pessimism in their life

2774
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,480
are generally actually happier,

2775
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,920
and it's because they always expect things to happen for them

2776
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,040
that will turn out bad.

2777
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,520
And so, when they are surprised that they turn out good,

2778
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:34,480
that actually has a larger happiness boost to their psyche

2779
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:35,680
than people who are optimistic,

2780
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,080
who are continually disappointed by the world around them.

2781
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:38,800
What a stupid question.

2782
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,520
Have a think about that.

2783
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,000
Who cares?

2784
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,200
That really breaks that...

2785
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,680
Like, because, like,

2786
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,360
when I think pessimism or optimism,

2787
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:46,880
I'm thinking like an extreme version.

2788
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,000
Like, my parents, my mom is a pessimist,

2789
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,880
and she just always thinks that things are going to go wrong,

2790
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,200
and my dad is an extreme optimist,

2791
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,640
and just always, like, he's just always like,

2792
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:57,520
oh, it's going to work out.

2793
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,160
It will work out, no matter what, it's going to work out.

2794
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,520
And both of them are, like, wrong in the way that they think,

2795
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,920
because my mom will just not do things

2796
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,680
because she thinks that it's not going to work out,

2797
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,880
and my dad will just, you know, make,

2798
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,040
like, assume too much good is going to happen,

2799
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,760
and then it's never as good as he thinks it will be.

2800
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,280
You know, like, you need to be somewhere in the middle.

2801
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,600
You can't just have one extreme or the other.

2802
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,160
Right, right.

2803
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,240
But, like, I think overall,

2804
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:25,200
if your mindset is things can go well,

2805
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,960
then you will be, you'll be more ready to take risks

2806
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,640
and do things, as opposed to, like,

2807
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,640
always assuming that the worst is going to happen.

2808
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,360
Okay, all right, we've got,

2809
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,640
here's our actual last question.

2810
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,160
This question is the best.

2811
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:40,000
I totally skipped over it before, but here we go.

2812
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,960
This is fantastic.

2813
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,440
At Slapdash Studios asks Dream Company to shill for?

2814
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:46,880
I love this question.

2815
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,800
Patreon.com slash Ben St.

2816
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,320
Dream Company.

2817
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,120
Okay, well.

2818
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,400
Uh, Taco Bell.

2819
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:53,360
Dream Company.

2820
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:54,080
From Software.

2821
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,080
He's asking, yeah, like, what company do you want to be like?

2822
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,800
Hey, guys, I'm here today on my shitty YouTube channel

2823
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,760
to play a fucking gay, gay, guys from gay.

2824
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:02,240
Takati.

2825
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:02,800
Yeah, it's a good game.

2826
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,560
Sign me for my mother's basement,

2827
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,320
here to show you another great product.

2828
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,280
What, mine is exactly, mine is Takati.

2829
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,280
I, the beer.

2830
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:11,840
Who, is that again?

2831
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,920
I know you've described the beer, right, right, okay.

2832
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,320
I want them to just, if they would give me free beer

2833
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:17,440
to shill their beer,

2834
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,760
I would shill their beer constantly.

2835
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:20,400
Right, right.

2836
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:24,480
Taco Bell, I want that free Mario Kart, bro.

2837
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
I want that free Mario Kart.

2838
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,120
Are they the Mario Kart, you know,

2839
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:32,000
do they control the means of production for Mario Karts

2840
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,440
everywhere throughout the world?

2841
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,280
Dude, and when Mario Kart 64 came out,

2842
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,520
they were like, if you fucking do that shit,

2843
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,040
then we'll fucking hook you up, bitch.

2844
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,520
And I was like.

2845
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,520
Here's, here's a weird, here's the thing.

2846
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,120
Here's the thing I thought as a kid.

2847
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,320
It's not directly related,

2848
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,840
but I thought that if I bought stock in Nintendo,

2849
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,320
the corporation, that would mean that like,

2850
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,280
a certain percentage of all Nintendo consoles

2851
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,280
in the world belonged to me,

2852
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,560
and I could have, and I could have them.

2853
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,160
So I kind of wanted to like, invest in Nintendo.

2854
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:06,000
I was like, yeah, I could have tons of Nintendo's.

2855
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,040
I don't know, it just sounded like a really good idea.

2856
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:09,760
You could never have, dude.

2857
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:10,320
You could never have.

2858
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,240
It sounded like a real good idea at the time.

2859
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:13,920
No.

2860
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,080
Does that, would that mean you could go to a friend's house

2861
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:18,720
and take their game because you own like, one percent of it?

2862
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:22,240
Yeah, this is one of the ones that I am in legal possession of, friend, here.

2863
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,040
You should have invested your money.

2864
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,520
I own one percent of all these games,

2865
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:31,280
so therefore I get to have your games for one percent of all time.

2866
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,720
So you'll get this back after that time is done.

2867
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:40,160
Actually, I like to change my answer to a whorehouse.

2868
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:43,440
I would like to shill for a whorehouse and get free whores.

2869
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,120
That also sounds great.

2870
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:47,200
That would be ideal.

2871
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,000
I appreciate the efficiency evolved in the whore setup.

2872
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,120
I really think it's not to be under,

2873
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,920
I wish we would invest in that kind of infrastructure, Trump.

2874
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,440
That's where our money should be going right now.

2875
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:56,720
I don't even disagree.

2876
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:57,280
So much.

2877
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,400
I literally don't disagree.

2878
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:58,480
Oh, God, Alex.

2879
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:59,600
I really really believe that.

2880
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:05,200
I would like to shill for the Calypso Foundation

2881
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:07,280
for the annual Twisted Metal Tournament,

2882
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,800
because that's really what we should be investing

2883
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,320
and building towards as a country is an annual tournament where

2884
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,120
I can drive around in my car and shoot missiles and kill people

2885
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,920
and destroy pretty much the entire country

2886
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,360
and just leave smoldering fucking ashes

2887
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,320
and ruins of cities in my wake and then get a wish at the end.

2888
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,240
It's yeah.

2889
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,680
It's kind of like The Purge,

2890
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:32,400
only with sick nasty monster trucks and shit.

2891
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,600
So, you know, just better in every way.

2892
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:37,120
Dude, a fucking guy in traffic flipped me off the other day

2893
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,560
and I'm just like Twisted Metal, man.

2894
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:42,240
How much longer till we have fucking Twisted Metal?

2895
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:45,440
There's legislation in Congress right now

2896
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:46,800
to legalize Twisted Metal.

2897
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:47,520
It's coming.

2898
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,680
I'm coming for you, man, who flipped me off you.

2899
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:51,120
You thought you got away from me,

2900
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:53,440
but the Twisted Metal Tournament is coming.

2901
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:55,600
Hashtag it.

2902
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,280
It's just the way the wind's blown, dude.

2903
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:58,400
It will be legalized.

2904
02:03:59,200 --> 02:03:59,680
Yeah.

2905
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:02,000
Like state legislation is already passing it

2906
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,360
across the United States.

2907
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,040
Eventually it's going to be adopted federally.

2908
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:07,040
Yeah.

2909
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,280
Okay.

2910
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:07,840
Here's mine.

2911
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:11,840
So when I made my or I just I get a lot of shitty comments

2912
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,720
on my, on my like Final Fantasy 7 remake

2913
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,320
is going to be a piece of shit video.

2914
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:19,120
And this one guy, this one dude, my hero,

2915
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:21,440
was like, dude, you fucking fag.

2916
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:24,320
You fucking know that if Square Enix was paying you

2917
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:27,200
to fucking make videos, you'd be on their fucking nuts

2918
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,880
saying how great this remake is.

2919
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,280
And I just want to let that guy know he's 100% right.

2920
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,240
He's 100% right.

2921
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:34,080
I would definitely sell out in a second.

2922
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,160
I would tell everyone how good video games are.

2923
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:39,600
If I could work for Square Enix, I would suck Tetsuya Nomura's dick.

2924
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,440
I would do it all.

2925
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,560
It's I'm just looking for a chance.

2926
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,160
Just give me a chance, guys.

2927
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,120
I want to shill.

2928
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:46,720
I want us to be a Square Enix shill.

2929
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,680
I want to, I want to shill for, for Mickey Mouse,

2930
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,920
not Disney, just, just the mouse, just him,

2931
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,960
just whatever he's doing.

2932
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,720
I just want to tell people about his, his, his sneaky dealings.

2933
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:02,720
I would, I would shill, I would shill for the Crown City Melee.

2934
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:06,480
Come and see your favorite fucking friends and allies

2935
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:09,040
and heroes all fucking murder each other

2936
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,360
and gut each other for fun, for your entertainment.

2937
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:14,880
Where can you, where can you find a broadcast of this?

2938
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,520
SaintComics.com, baby.

2939
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,240
Handcrafted in Notepad with love.

2940
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:23,520
In another four months, you might get two more pages, folks.

2941
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,400
Fuck yeah.

2942
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:27,200
We'll kill you, but not before myself.

2943
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,400
I'll take you all out with me when I go.

2944
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,120
Okay, sounds good.

2945
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,800
I got a better, I got a better sponsor.

2946
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,320
Matt, game theory, game, Matt Pat game theory.

2947
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:41,920
I'm going to tell everybody to go, to go over there and ju,

2948
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:46,320
it's just a YouTube channel, a game theory YouTube channel.

2949
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,480
And thanks for giving me money.

2950
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:51,200
Fucking mad pat.

2951
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,280
Okay, that's enough.

2952
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:55,840
We're done.

2953
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,240
Actually, I want to change mine to Arizona iced tea.

2954
02:05:58,240 --> 02:06:00,800
So my entire pitch could just be Trayvon.

2955
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,760
Trayvon, Trayvon, Trayvon.

2956
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:05,200
I don't understand what that means.

2957
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,440
It's because you put tea on a tray.

2958
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,640
It's because you put shot, Trayvon Martin.

2959
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,120
Oh, right.

2960
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,760
You fucking set that up and it shouldn't have worked.

2961
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:22,240
And we all fucking, we all fell for it.

2962
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:23,840
We fell for it.

2963
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:24,720
We fell for it.

2964
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:25,440
Thank God.

2965
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:26,640
That was masterful.

2966
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:31,920
Patreon.com slash munchy slash calypso slash twisted metal.

2967
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:36,960
All right, everyone, make sure you send us more questions.

2968
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,680
Any time of the week now, hashtag askpcp.

2969
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:40,800
Just send us that shit on Twitter.

2970
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:42,320
We'll see it when I fucking log in.

2971
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:46,960
I wonder what Nate thinks my feet smell like, ha, ha.

2972
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,240
And then you should ask that.

2973
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,440
That's a good one.

2974
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:54,400
Or what's the gayest thing munchy is doing on today?

2975
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,480
And he'll tell you, he'll tell you what it is.

2976
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:57,360
So there you go, people.

2977
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:04,240
I think that's his commenting on a YouTube video voice.

2978
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,360
I think that's what he's doing there.

2979
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:06,400
All right.

2980
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,360
Thanks for listening, everybody.

2981
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:08,720
We'll see you next time.

2982
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:08,960
Bye.

2983
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,400
Okay, done.

2984
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:18,480
XD.

2985
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:29,360
Right now.
