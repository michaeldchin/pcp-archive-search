1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to bless that guy, that son of a bitch.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello and welcome to The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Another week, another fuck.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, that's what we do.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, that's our catchphrase, it always has been.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I want to start...

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The fuck is you listening?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sorry, go on.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to start a little quick announcement for anyone, because I don't want to bury this at the end.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
On the 29th of October, there's going to be a live band performance in Get the Image.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's going to be about a week after this episode.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, it's a charity band event, and I'm going to be playing a couple numbers at the thing.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a fundraiser in aid of Parkinson's UK.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have a link, I have an image.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The band my dad is in, and they're doing a fundraising thing, and I'm going to be there playing a few three little songs in the middle.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you want to donate, you can donate, and if you want to show up, if you can, that would be cool.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Super sick. What are you going to play?

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to play Dig a Pony by The Beatles, Black Magic Woman, and Sympathy for the Devil.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to play the bongos on that one.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What the fuck is Dig a Pony?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's from Abby Road. It's one of the John Lennon silly songs.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The lyrics don't make sense, but it's like...

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm digging a pony.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, look it up. It's a good song. I'm going to be playing the George Harrison solo stuff. I'm excited about that.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're going to be playing in the band?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, they're doing the main set, and then I'm on for a few.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I just wanted to mention it because it's good to get some extra donations.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you going to be playing as part of your dad's band, or are you going to be playing by yourself?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
As part of my dad's band.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, okay.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cool. Super cool. Super sick.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait, where is it?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The image has the location. It's the Bohemia North Finchley, and if you can make it, that would be epic.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's 12 pounds donation.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll be there.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, it just comes all the way up.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, I've got a week and a half to get my arrangements.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, from 8 p.m. to 10.30.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's the knowledge.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There you go. I've spread the word.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Radical.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, that just reminds me of international travel.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That just reminds me that I should really get that new COVID booster.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I still haven't gotten one.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Apparently, only 4% of people have gotten the new one, which is pretty cringe.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've been meaning to get it.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've been relying, or I was relying on news updates.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The vaccine is here, and there's two parts to it, so you've got to make sure to get two parts.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm like, okay, I've got to make sure to get two parts.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And now there's a booster. Okay, I'll get the booster.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But then news about current vaccine boosters has been very minimal.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I don't even know what is required, how many boosters I am behind, or if I am even behind.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm just going to say that if I die, it's not my fault.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, it is your fault.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know that there's...

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The new booster is omicron-specific, and I think it comes in a couple different varieties,

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and I'm not sure what the difference is, and I'm not sure if I should be choosing, or if it doesn't matter.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, I don't know. I've been meaning to figure it out and go and get one.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sure I could probably just call up CVS and go get one any day I wanted to.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And probably I should just do that, because it's better to get it than to overthink it.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As a Democrat, I'll just slavishly follow whatever my leaders tell me to do.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I love the mainstream media.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Susan Sarandon says I should need the booster, so I got to go do it.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's just how it is. I don't ask questions.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't even know what questions to ask.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll just wait until they say, um, get the booster now, and I'll be like, okay.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is it available over there? It's been available over here for maybe a month?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's like five boosters at this point. I don't even know.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are there?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, I feel like I've lost track. There was a booster and then another booster.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think I've had the second one.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think I've only had one booster.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know. This is the thing. The news, I need a guide to tell me.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know I've got the vaccine. I'm fully vaccinated, plus one booster at least.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And I feel like that's fine.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, that's what I'm at. I think that's it. And then the new booster just came out maybe a month ago.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know why I thought there has been occasionally a new booster.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Maybe the things I've been reading have been like, now a newer booster for 70 plus is available.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And now it's going down the age brackets and now younger people can get the second booster or something.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Perhaps, perhaps, yeah.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I just got to do it.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My stupid video is basically done, like it's basically edited.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I basically just got to watch it through and make sure there's no big fuck ups in it.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I'm rewriting my Patreon a little bit.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm rewriting my Patreon to be a little more generic and not specifically about comics.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm just going to kind of make it like, I make stuff and every once in a while I release a big project.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And you love stuff!

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Every once in a while I release a big project and if you're pledged at this tier, you'll be credited.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Whether it's a video or a comic or whatever.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, my Patreon is very specifically about comics and I really am a more of a generalist at this point.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I really am just kind of a guy who does various things.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, yeah.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Anyway, that's exciting. I'll probably release it this week.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know I keep saying it, but it really is pretty much done.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, I mean, if it's like 6, how many hours? 7?

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, it's about 7 hours 45 minutes.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm debating whether I want to put maybe a couple little bumper bits in there to just boost it up over 8 hours.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Put a dance number in there.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Put a thing where Evil Benson comes in and says, how do you get at my video and then shoot him?

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I won't spoil it, but there is a sort of little...

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's nothing super weird or anything, but there is sort of a...

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you call it? There's sort of a diagetic editing thing where Future Ben will chime in and there's a little bit of...

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I made it a little fancy. I made it a little fancy and funny and goofy, but I think I like it.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm debating whether I want to add 15 or so minutes worth of future commentary and just sprinkle it in

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
just to boost it that extra couple minutes over the 8 hour line.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Just because I feel like 8 hours just sounds better than 7.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You could just have a thing at the end where you just blatantly say, I'm padding this out.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going to play some video games. Let's play now.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Honestly, in an 8 hour video, I don't think anyone would be super mad.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And if it's at the end, if you've already watched the video...

110
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can just click off if you don't want to hear... Yeah, maybe.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But 7 hours is a lot of watching to do. That's a whole day. Just looking at it.

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That is a whole day. Oh man, I watched... I kind of watched, listened to...

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think his name is called Dylan the Storyteller or something.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He had a five hour long AVGN retrospective. I listened to it and it was pretty interesting.

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The thing that really stood out to me was how Yig like the screenwave era is.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I remember watching a video dissecting the hate AVGN has gotten.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Was that the Lady Emily video? Yeah, yeah.

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That was going into all of the crap they were doing. They're gone now, right? I think they've left.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know. Sorry, Dylan the Night Owl.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is from February of this year, so yeah, screenwave might be gone at this point.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not sure. But yeah, just very much how AVGN, when he would give updates, he would say,

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
everything was falling apart. My internet didn't work. It was hard to shoot or whatever.

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But screenwave says they're going to get it right.

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Screenwave is going to fix everything for me.

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Screenwave hooked me up with a whole new internet and a whole new setup and a whole new da-da-da-da.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then everybody hates the product.

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah. Very riley-esque.

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Knowing that those Yig guys are on Tony from Hack the Movies YouTube channel a couple of times,

129
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
they know him.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Did you know that?

131
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think I remember that Tony.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's the screenwave Tony, yeah.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The Hack the Movies guy had Yig Studios on and he looked at it for a few minutes and I was like, okay.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, I had forgotten that, you know, he's been in a couple of AVGN skits because he's one of the guys that ruined AVGN.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They had that show. It was like conceptually, like a bunch of guys in a video store, the set they had.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You mean Hack the Movies?

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Not Hack the Movies. On AVGN they had this show that I never clicked on because they just were not charismatic.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I haven't really seen it.

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I haven't really seen any Ladder Day. I've seen some Bored James, I guess.

140
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I guess that's like Ladder Day, AVGN stuff, kind of.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But even that is kind of old at this point.

142
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That is kind of old. They had like a big finale. There was like a crazy short film.

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, I haven't seen any of the Screenwave era, AVGN stuff.

144
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I wanted to see old stuff.

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know, just to see what it was because it looked like the kind of content I didn't want to see and it turns out that I was right.

146
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But that hadn't been that out of the ordinary because Cinemassacre, the YouTube channel, always had a bunch of stuff that was just sort of whatever.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like the streams with James and Mike?

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, James and Mike Mondays. They were sometimes pretty good, but ultimately it's like lower tier content than the actual episodes.

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Like some stuff with Bootsy.

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

153
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It was alright, but I would never click on it.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And so the Screenwave stuff happening was like, it's the same. It's just different guys that I won't click on.

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I sort of missed out on like the outrage because I would never engage with it.

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And I guess I'm glad for that.

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think, I mean, a lot of people were already not watching by the time all that happened.

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just a funny connection because Riley knows Tony and it's like, I'm going to do for Yeeg Studios what Screenwave did for Cinemassacre.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's going to be great.

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you remember Maryweather, right?

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah.

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I saw, did you see what was going on with him on Twitter these past couple days?

164
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I saw, I mean, when I looked into it, the comments, the tweets had been deleted or something.

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There was something like a goth comic.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There was a goth comic, tweets by like haters have been deleted, so I don't know what the controversy was.

167
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But I believe it's something about like a goth comic where there's a quote unquote ugly bastard stereotype.

168
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay.

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And the ugly bastard stereotype is like defended because it's like, it's not very nice really.

171
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's just some like, come on.

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then people got really mad at that, I guess.

173
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Honestly, I kind of had to reconstruct what happened.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Okay.

175
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So to my understanding is that there is a sort of a like a continuing series called the goth girl and the jock.

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it's sort of like a, what do you call it?

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like a romantic comedy thing where like a goth, a goth chick and a jock boy, I guess, overcome the social barrier between them and fall in love.

178
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I haven't read it, right?

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, me neither.

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I've seen a similar thing where it's like nerd and jock that also has a goth girl involved.

181
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that also?

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
By a different artist.

183
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, okay.

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's just sort of like in right now to have jocks in your comics.

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Rehabilitate and jocks.

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We're bringing them back.

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Himbos sort of made a comeback in recent years.

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So yeah, rehabilitate jocks.

189
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can see the appeal.

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think it was like trying to remember like there was a nerd and a jock, but they were super gay and they didn't realize it.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh, was a boy, a boy nerd and a boy jock?

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think that blew up and that was cute.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know who made that or if that was a trend that was larger than just one artist.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's probably why right now jocks are jocks are in.

195
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It sounds familiar, but I'm not sure.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Jocks being the bullies that are always the enemy has sort of been like, yeah, but what if they aren't?

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What if they're just nice?

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sometimes people who are physically attractive and exercise are not evil.

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wrong.

200
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Wrong.

201
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're not ready for that conversation.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Uh-oh.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's...

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wait.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

206
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, right.

207
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The goth girl and the jock is sort of a series.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But on the side from that, there are sort of these side comics that he's been doing recently that are called things like the goth girl and the ugly bastard or like the goth girl and her boyfriend.

209
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And they're about a...

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
These are not like continuing stories.

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
These are one-offs.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But it's just a hot goth girl and like a fat or nerdy or ugly or shrubby or whatever guy.

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And in every single one, just some guy comes up to them and is like, what the fuck?

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why do you have a hot girlfriend when you're ugly?

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then the girl is like, hey, bitch, fuck you.

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
My boyfriend is hot.

217
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No, she doesn't say he's hot.

218
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They never say, actually, he's not ugly.

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's always taken for granted.

220
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yes, my boyfriend's ugly, but he's nice to me and he's good in bed.

221
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And why do you judge him just by the way he looks?

222
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're an asshole and that's why you don't have a girlfriend.

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Owned.

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I think I saw one of them like that.

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And they're very...

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
They're just very like, very straightforward, very like...

228
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is a mean comparison, but they're a little bit...

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They remind me of Darman videos a little bit and how like a completely ridiculous scenario

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
happens in order to teach a like really like hit you over the head with like blunt level,

231
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
like moral of like, don't judge a book by its cover.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Don't be mean to people just because they're ugly.

233
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes, very, very unsubtle, but you know, that's fine.

234
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think they are a bit self-aware.

235
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The more I've thought about it, I think that the reason he makes them is because they annoy people.

236
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Like I think he does it to make a certain kind of person mad because that generates engagements.

237
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, I guess.

238
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's hard to imagine someone getting mad about it, but I guess it happens.

239
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, I haven't really...

240
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I haven't seen...

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Apparently some people get really mad about them for reasons.

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't really understand why, but I guess they annoy some people.

243
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But anyway, so there was one this week.

244
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It was called...

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't even remember which one it was.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It was the goth girl and her boyfriend or the goth girl and the ugly boyfriend or whatever.

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And you know, I saw this.

248
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I saw it posted and I read it and I said draw, you know, make one where the girl's ugly.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I just said make one where the girl's ugly.

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And you know, I scrolled through the comments and I saw some other people who had made the same comment.

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They had made the same request that I had.

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And some of them got dog piled and screamed at by like people that were like,

253
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
fuck you, you draw it yourself if you care.

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You know, who are you to...

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't tell them what to draw.

256
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't...

257
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.

258
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Like what the fuck kind of stupid...

259
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Who would want to see that?

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Like what's wrong with the SJW cock pushing an agenda?

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Get your politics out of this, right?

262
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hideous.

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hideous.

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hideous.

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And...

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's just a suggestion, buddy.

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I know.

269
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I didn't understand it.

270
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It was deranged.

271
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And there's this one artist that I follow whose name is Raven.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
She made a...

273
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
She did a quote tweet where she was a little snippy about it.

274
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
She was like, I dare the artist behind this to draw like a gender swap version

275
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
without throwing up, right?

276
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It was like, they would never draw an ugly girl.

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That is so fucked.

278
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No, I mean, I agreed with the sentiment that like this is...

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The reason these exist is because it's sort of an excuse to draw tits, right?

280
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Like a lot of the comics on that thing.

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's like, it's really a vessel for drawing like a hot girl with big tits, right?

282
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Right.

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So they wouldn't make...

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So they would never make a gender swap version.

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, but the idea that you would throw up because drawing an ugly girl is like...

286
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't know.

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What a way to say that.

288
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm a Raven defender, all right?

289
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

291
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
She was being mean about it, but like, so what?

292
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's fine to be mean.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Anyway.

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Anyway.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He did actually, he did make a gender swap version with a funny egg-shaped girlfriend

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and a sexy goth boy, which was kind of funny.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Like, okay, that's when I saw it was when that was posted.

298
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What was the controversy?

299
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Was Mary Weather like holding out on drawing that?

300
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No.

301
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Or did he just say, okay, and do it?

302
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It was just, I mean, just my experience was just I saw people asking for a gender swap

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
version.

304
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I saw people really like being mean about saying like, no, don't ask for that.

305
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like, why are you asking for that?

306
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Fuck you.

307
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then he did it and everyone loved it.

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, it just, it made me mad because I feel like it's the same people that told, I'm thinking

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,880
of one girl, not Raven, a different girl who asked like, switch the genders and she got

310
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
shouted down for it.

311
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,000
And I think it was the same people that told her like, fuck you, keep your politics out

312
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
of this, were probably like, oh my God, Mary owned you.

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Mary owned you by doing what you asked for, right?

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Like the attitude, the gross attitude of the don't make requests.

315
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's just so like, I can't imagine getting so worked up about any step of this.

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is the hard part for me to understand.

317
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Why would anyone get mad in the first place?

318
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, the only thing that made me mad was the commenters dogpiling those people.

319
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah.

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, whatever.

321
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
People are crazy.

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I know.

323
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Especially on Twitter.

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I know.

326
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I had to like, I had to take a step back from it and be like, you know what, Ben?

327
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You know what?

328
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
Just remember, everybody, everybody sucks on Twitter.

329
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,500
Twitter comments are always terrible.

330
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
You know what?

331
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
This is normal.

332
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
This is just how it is.

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah.

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You know, I'll say, I was worried because I made the request.

335
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,500
I said, you should draw the Judd Genderswatt version.

336
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,080
But in the back of my mind, I thought, you know, if they did, they might do, they might

337
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,300
cop out and draw like a quote unquote ugly girl, but like she wouldn't, she would still

338
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
be cute.

339
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
You know what I mean?

340
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,200
Like maybe they make, like maybe they'd make her a little chubby and like maybe give her

341
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,080
glasses, but like she'd still be cute looking.

342
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,540
But no, they, they, they gave her like a egg shaped body and like a very like fat lower

343
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
face.

344
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,160
And I feel like they, I feel like they followed through on the concept to an adequate degree.

345
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,080
So I was, I was pretty satisfied with it.

346
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,520
Uh, I guess it was a happy ending.

347
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,160
I don't know.

348
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,680
I think it's good to draw ugly characters.

349
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,920
I obviously don't do it that much because my characters are all so cute.

350
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,360
I just draw them with big eyes every time.

351
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Right.

352
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,700
But like, uh, I'm reminded of, of this, this role doll, little, little, little thing where

353
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,700
like you posted something, I'm posting it.

354
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Um, let me see.

355
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,820
It's a, oh yeah, for some reason, you said doll and I thought of dolly, but yeah, role

356
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:33,620
doll and it's like the, the idea that somebody can look ugly, but there as an, if they're

357
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,140
a nice person, they're the good vibes will shine from within, even if they got crooked

358
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,600
teeth and a, and a fucked up nose, uh, anyone can be nice and, and, you know, welcoming.

359
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,160
You don't, you don't need to have big tits to be the best person.

360
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Yeah.

361
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Actually.

362
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
No.

363
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Wrong.

364
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah.

365
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Um.

366
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Oh, as an aside, quick to the, the whole goth thing.

367
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,120
Uh, I got my goth girl get up.

368
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,400
I got a bunch of stuff.

369
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,740
Good to your Halloween costume.

370
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,420
My Halloween costume was a ruse.

371
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
It was just a trick.

372
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,100
I was saying I was going to make a costume, but it's actually just an outfit that I'm

373
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
going to wear all the time.

374
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Oh no.

375
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,620
God, I fell for it.

376
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:31,020
Uh, I got like fishnet top and a corset and a goth skirt and some black lipstick.

377
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,940
Um, I'm going to go crazy.

378
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm going to go insane.

379
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm going to take a picture and I'm going to post online at some point when I feel like

380
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,880
I look good enough.

381
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,380
Okay.

382
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Sounds good.

383
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Sounds like a plan.

384
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Yeah.

385
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Sick.

386
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
Wait.

387
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,380
What's the outfit?

388
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,000
Um, I posted the little rough drawing on Twitter.

389
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's basically.

390
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah.

391
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Is this, does this include the witch hat?

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,960
I don't have a witch hat yet.

393
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I think there's a witch hat in the old Halloween box and I looked on Amazon for like, oh,

394
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
a witch hat.

395
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
They suck.

396
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
They all suck.

397
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,200
So I'm probably going to have to go to a dedicated Halloween place.

398
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Look around.

399
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
I mean, yeah.

400
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,140
Where else would you get a witch hat?

401
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,940
Nobody wears them just as a, as a normal thing.

402
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:20,220
You know, I've watched, I've watched Beetlejuice the other day and the movie, yeah, the movie

403
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,820
and the girl there is like, she's goth, but she's wearing like a Lydia.

404
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
Yeah.

405
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,940
She's wearing like a sun hat that has been painted black.

406
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,860
It's just like a summer sun hat, but it's black and it looks great.

407
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,480
So I could just get a hat and dunk it in like a vat of ink.

408
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,520
I mean, I, I feel like a black sun hat that seems like something normal, but like you

409
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,720
would wear to a funeral.

410
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah.

411
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Yeah.

412
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Yeah.

413
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
It doesn't sound that, that crazy.

414
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,520
So like, it doesn't need to be a witch's hat, although the witch's hat is the most

415
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,000
aesthetic for the occasion.

416
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,160
You know, I, I've realized there's, there's like a vintage clothing store, like right

417
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,020
down the street from my house, and I've been meaning to go and just see what they got and

418
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,420
see if I can find anything cool there.

419
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,620
It's really like an eight minute walk from my house, but I just keep putting off going.

420
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,960
That's it.

421
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,780
That's the whole story.

422
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,280
There's nothing else.

423
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,080
Nice.

424
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,580
Yeah.

425
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,080
Thanks.

426
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm glad you liked it.

427
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,340
Ben, did you beat Outer Wilds?

428
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,900
Oh, yes, I did.

429
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,440
There was a lot of spoilers.

430
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,160
There was a lot more play the game to go than I thought there was.

431
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,600
Let's talk about it.

432
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,120
Yeah.

433
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,000
Outer Wilds spoilers.

434
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm going to spoil everything.

435
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,080
Damn.

436
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Um, yeah, I thought I'd seen basically everything on a friggin giants deep.

437
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,880
I thought I'd seen everything on.

438
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,840
I thought I thought I'd seen everything turned out there was like, I hadn't I hadn't

439
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,220
even gone around in like the hanging city.

440
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,740
I hadn't gone around in the Sunless City.

441
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,620
I hadn't found half the stuff in there.

442
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,380
What, what else did I did I end up having to do?

443
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,220
Oh, the the fucking.

444
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,860
You know, I did, there were a couple of things that I kind of spoiled for myself,

445
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,540
but none of them were like that big.

446
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,560
And at some point I was like, then you are not allowed to look anything else up.

447
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,280
No more spoilers.

448
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,360
And then I and I did.

449
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,720
And then so I feel like all the big stuff I was what did you get spoiled on?

450
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,760
I got spoiled on I look I looked up the solutions to I look.

451
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,360
Well, I looked up hints for the quantum imaging tower puzzles.

452
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,620
I also, OK, I looked at I looked up how to do it.

453
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,500
But I already kind of thought I knew how to do it.

454
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,420
And I just kind of looked up and confirmed how for how to get past the

455
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,100
angler fish and how to get inside the jellyfish.

456
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,860
Like I already kind of was like, I think I'm supposed to go inside the jellyfish.

457
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,900
But I but I died trying to do it.

458
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,220
And so then I went and I looked it up and and it was like, yeah, you could just go

459
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,840
inside the under under the tenant.

460
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,520
I was like, OK, that's that's what I thought.

461
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,280
I just the jellyfish was for me the first moment I got properly stuck.

462
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,120
And I needed a hint from a friend because because I I went to the.

463
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, yeah, I got all the information.

464
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,360
I'd been to Feldspar and I'd gone and seen through Dark Bramble,

465
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,240
the dead jellyfish, yeah, hanging out.

466
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,040
And it's like, oh, this is probably good for insulation, but it's not good for much else.

467
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,440
And I'm like, OK, yeah.

468
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,260
Obvious jelly, jellyfish is an insulator against electricity.

469
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,940
The giant steep is electric.

470
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,300
The jellyfish are electric.

471
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,420
I can't touch the jellyfish and I assumed because of how jellyfish work,

472
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,460
that the tentacles underneath would also electrocute me, but they don't.

473
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,500
They just go up inside.

474
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,860
It looks like they will.

475
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,540
They have electricity all over them and it does not look safe.

476
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,020
But it doesn't look safe.

477
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:16,120
I did remember going up in inside the dead jellyfish on in the Bramble.

478
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
So I kind of knew how to do it.

479
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,520
Yeah, I didn't.

480
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,160
I looked it up and confirmed that like, yeah, and I I knew I knew that the anglerfish

481
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,840
were blind and they kept saying the anglerfish are blind, the anglerfish are blind.

482
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,240
And I was like, OK, and then I tried to sneak past them and it didn't work.

483
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
And I was like, what the hell?

484
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,480
And I looked it up and and it's like, yes.

485
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,260
If you do not use your thrusters at all, the anglerfish will not react to you.

486
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,100
Yeah, I was like, OK, that's the annoying part.

487
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,700
The worst part of I mean, I I would say the worst part of the game

488
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,300
is Dark Bramble, just because when you go into one of the entrances,

489
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,780
you have to stop completely and then point very accurately

490
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,780
in the direction of travel, thrust for a bit and then turning off

491
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,980
your thrusters and hope that you're not sailing right into one of them.

492
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,920
Because if you touch them, they'll notice you.

493
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,240
And if you smash into like a branch that you didn't see coming,

494
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,840
you'll have to use your thrusters and then you're dead.

495
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,600
So it's like, yeah, getting getting through that reliably is semi undoable.

496
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,920
You just have to be sort of lucky.

497
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,120
Well, I had to I did it over and over again

498
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,600
until I got to the point where I knew like exactly which paths I could take.

499
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,720
That didn't risk anglerfish attack.

500
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,100
But, you know, I had to do it a lot before I got to a point.

501
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,340
It was really annoying.

502
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,300
Right at the very, very end, I realized that the strategy you're supposed

503
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,180
to do is to shoot your probe ahead of you.

504
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,540
So you know that what you're about to sail into is free of obstacles.

505
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,420
Did you not?

506
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,940
Did you do that?

507
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,380
I figured that out.

508
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,900
Oh, my God, it must have been that must have sucked.

509
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,740
Not knowing that I knew that the lights because I would use.

510
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,320
I never got like, I never went in there blindly, just going towards the light,

511
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,880
except the first time where I went towards the red light and it was the fish eggs.

512
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
And I didn't know what else to do.

513
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,920
Well, strangely, I didn't bump into anything on the way there.

514
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,680
But well, the other times it's like I used my audio scanner.

515
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,840
And once I knew the locations, I could just use the locations.

516
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,700
If I go to the map, you type, click the thing.

517
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,280
So I never like used the lights as a source of like, oh, I should go towards the light.

518
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,500
Because I know some of them are fish.

519
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,180
I did.

520
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:47,380
I did use the lights as like, OK, I didn't think to go inside of the egg clutch until like, like, OK,

521
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,820
I would shoot my probe into the into the one with the three angler fish and the egg cluster inside.

522
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,420
And I knew that there were eggs in there.

523
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,220
But to my mind, that was just like, oh, this one's full of fish.

524
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,300
Definitely don't go in there.

525
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,820
So I just didn't.

526
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,440
I never went in there at all.

527
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,960
And I thought I wasn't supposed to.

528
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,120
And so I eventually was like, I know that there's because I found the murals.

529
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,120
I know that the vessel is somewhere in the dark Bramble.

530
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,480
I just have to find it.

531
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,480
So I tried going to I just tried going to every light in every chamber of the dark

532
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Bramble that I could.

533
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,880
And it was a real nightmare because, I mean, there's the one that Feldspar is in,

534
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,900
which he's pretty much the only thing in there.

535
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,020
There's one that just has like a fish and nothing else.

536
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,580
There is the egg clutch.

537
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,060
There's there's one where it's full of the little like pods with holes in them.

538
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,260
But all of them like interconnect to each other.

539
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,780
And there's like six different ones.

540
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,820
But they're all and if you throw your probe inside that one, it'll come out the other side.

541
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,580
But then it'll just keep going and go through another one and then go through another one

542
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,680
and just go through another one.

543
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,520
And the probe will just keep going through an infinitely recursive series of these little pods.

544
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,560
I never found that one.

545
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,760
Well, there's nothing in there.

546
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,960
So because I because I never like I never just blindly because like I assume

547
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,460
when I was one of the yellowish ones when I was in dark Bramble,

548
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,280
I always assumed that the every path leads to like a multiple of different paths.

549
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,520
So like if you go the wrong way like the first time,

550
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,960
you're going to be on like you're going to have to like try 17,000

551
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,120
different permutations into until you find it like randomly.

552
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,020
So I didn't even try.

553
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,320
I didn't even explore that way.

554
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,860
I only went in there when I had like a solid goal

555
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,420
that I had from like reading a note.

556
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,020
I'm like, OK, there was there's a use the oh, the signal.

557
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,720
The the what's the what's the word?

558
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,960
The signal scope, the signal for specifically

559
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,160
abandoned ship pods, the distress beacons, distress beacons.

560
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,860
Like I followed that because I was like, oh, the mural shows that one of them didn't leave.

561
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,400
So I got to find that one.

562
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,300
And so I found that I followed them and they're like, oh, shit,

563
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,760
we got to get back to the vessel.

564
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,540
They followed the thing into the thing and there's like a seed and they died.

565
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,340
And then I shot my probe through that and I used my probe signal to get to the vessel.

566
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,940
Oh, God, I didn't even think to do that.

567
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Yeah, I'm so stupid.

568
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,840
That's not very smart.

569
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,680
I felt very smart when I was like, wait, the probe.

570
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,540
Oh, I can just follow where the probe is.

571
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,640
I leave it on the vessel.

572
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,840
I go and get there.

573
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,720
And then once I'm there, the vessel, I have the the coordinates for that.

574
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,640
Wow, it's so obvious.

575
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,020
It's so obvious when you say it.

576
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,480
Yeah, this the probe, the probe would land.

577
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,780
Well, so you had to end up going into the egg, the egg pod, right?

578
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,200
No, I think you can you can go like a side from that.

579
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,780
You're joking.

580
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,840
No, I mean, it's so hard for myself.

581
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,400
Let me tell you what I had to do.

582
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,880
I, yeah, I knew that if you found the distress beacon, you could find that seed.

583
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,480
And if you shot the probe through the seed, it would land on the vessel.

584
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,080
And I did not think to leave the probe on it foolishly.

585
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,900
So I tried to go to I just tried to go through every permutation of

586
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
or no location.

587
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,520
It didn't take it didn't take that long.

588
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,700
I mean, it's kind of it's a lot.

589
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,000
It's a lot smaller than it like makes it look.

590
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,620
I mean, I did I did get eaten by a lot of anglerfish.

591
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,000
It probably took several hours, maybe like two hours.

592
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,420
But yeah, I just I just tried going everywhere I could inside the bramble.

593
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,060
And eventually there was nowhere else to go except for the egg pod.

594
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,220
And I'm like, I guess I need to go in the egg pod.

595
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,980
And, you know, I had to look it up so it'll be like, OK, you just

596
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,780
if you don't use your thrusters at all, the fish will not come at you.

597
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,780
So yeah, I just had to you go through the thing and you just let

598
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,980
your momentum sort of carry you slowly towards the the egg cluster.

599
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,220
And when you're in the egg cluster, there are a bunch of lights and yeah,

600
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,820
just kind of near the egg cluster.

601
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,140
One of there's a there's like a hole you can go through.

602
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,620
And some of them, what am I saying?

603
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,940
A few of them don't go anywhere.

604
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,260
Like a few of them just lead you back into the same room.

605
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,540
And I just had to like shoot my probe through those.

606
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,860
And if I got like like error, you know, duplicate signal, then I'd know, like,

607
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,740
OK, that one doesn't go anywhere.

608
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,220
And so I just had to find another one that didn't do that.

609
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,180
And then that ended up leading me to the vessel.

610
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,660
And that's how I found it.

611
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,900
It worked, took a while.

612
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,140
But the vessel was.

613
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,300
The vessel was kind of frustrating because like because I didn't.

614
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,060
Yeah, I didn't.

615
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,140
I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do with like the coordinate input

616
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,860
thing. I didn't realize that.

617
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,940
I mean, OK, I knew the I coordinates,

618
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,420
but I didn't put it together that like, oh, those coordinates.

619
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Are what you're supposed to enter on that thing.

620
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,340
So I spent a long time just fucking around with that console

621
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,260
without realizing that, like, I can't do anything because I need the warp core.

622
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,140
I did when I had the when I had the realization of like, oh.

623
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,500
If I oh, the warp core, it looks just like this thing.

624
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,700
If I bet that's what I have to do, I have to bring the warp core here.

625
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I figured that out on my own.

626
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,060
I had I had a bit of a thing with that.

627
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,900
Like, I knew that when I got there,

628
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,180
I didn't have the information to solve this puzzle with the the coordinates.

629
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,340
So I'm like, OK, I'll leave that.

630
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,940
I didn't know the coordinates yet.

631
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,020
Yeah. And then I got the broken warp core.

632
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,260
And then I remembered that the black hole forage is where they made warp cores.

633
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,300
So what if I get to the vessel, bring the broken thing to the black hole forage

634
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,060
and then somehow repair it.

635
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,380
Oh, and nothing happens if you bring it all the way there,

636
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,180
nothing happens, you can't put it on anything.

637
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,780
Did you try it?

638
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,180
I was like, what do I do?

639
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,820
Did you try to like get into the black hole forage

640
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,300
while it is like down at the black hole?

641
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,300
Yeah, like I did the lever thing to make it go down.

642
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,660
And then I go down to the bottom using like the Ash Twin Zappy thing

643
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,900
to to teleport you up there.

644
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,140
And then Zappy thing.

645
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,980
You know, the the towers that black hole like transporters,

646
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,740
one of them leads you to the bottom where the black hole forage is like low down.

647
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,260
What?

648
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,860
Yeah, wait, no.

649
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,980
There's one.

650
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
Wait a minute, hold on.

651
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,020
The hanging city is upside down.

652
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,100
So when you say when I say down, I mean toward the black hole.

653
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,460
Oh, wait, no, I'm yeah, I don't think you're able to get there in time.

654
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,820
No, when you press the lever.

655
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,220
I don't I don't know.

656
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,060
I don't think there's any way to get into the black hole forage

657
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,180
while it's down at the black hole.

658
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,140
Yeah, what I did is I left the the warp car, the broken warp car in the place

659
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,220
and just did something and then I brought it back up and nothing happened.

660
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,900
Yeah, I was like, OK, obviously not the correct.

661
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,340
So much. Oh, God, that must have been.

662
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,460
Yeah, that was one of the things that was the most irritating

663
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,700
was getting into the black hole forage because because you have to go to the city,

664
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,300
find the control, use the control,

665
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,860
and then you have to somehow get from the hanging city to the black hole forage.

666
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,660
But you can't just like do that.

667
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,700
I mean, I guess, yeah, you can't just do that.

668
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,980
You pretty much have to go through the Ash Twin teleporter

669
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,460
because it's the only way to get like onto the the gravity floor.

670
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,060
I figured out. Yeah, that was really annoying, actually.

671
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,940
I figured out that there is because I looked around in the hanging city a lot.

672
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,380
And I think in one of the districts,

673
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,820
you can climb up to a shortcut that's on the surface.

674
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,780
You don't have to go like a special way.

675
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,620
So like really land.

676
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,180
Yeah, there's a little hole in the ice near.

677
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,460
I can't remember. Oh, where it is. Yeah.

678
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,860
But you can you can jump down that slide down a bit

679
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,100
and then you're in the hanging city.

680
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,460
You can click the the lever really fast, get back up there in your ship,

681
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,540
go to Ash Twin and then teleport and I could do it pretty quick.

682
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,700
But then when I had to do that after I'd gotten the thing from the vessel.

683
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,540
Yeah, I was trying to do all of this shit.

684
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,460
Yeah, I only just barely got in there and nothing happened.

685
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,180
I was like, no, no, I had the same thought.

686
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,900
I also tried bringing the warp core to the Black Hole Forge,

687
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,820
but there's just nothing there.

688
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,700
Well, once I once I realized, oh, I got to bring it to the vessel.

689
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,820
It I immediately was like, oh, yeah, obviously, obviously, that's what it needs.

690
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,900
It's got a broken warp core.

691
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,020
There's a working one inside the Ash Twin.

692
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,060
Yeah, I didn't really figure that out until I was in Ash Twin.

693
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,620
I was like, oh, yeah, warp core, warp core from here.

694
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,180
I got to the I got inside of the Ash Twin chamber

695
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,940
well before I found the vessel.

696
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,820
Crazy, I didn't figure that out for a very long time.

697
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,820
No, finding the vessel was like the last thing that I did.

698
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,740
Well, that's not quite true.

699
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,860
But yeah, I got inside of what it was.

700
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,660
Um, yeah, once once I figured out what the towers do,

701
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,100
getting inside of the Ash Twin was like the first thing I did with that.

702
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,180
OK, what is your thought process?

703
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,780
Because I was I was stuck on that.

704
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,900
There was the very, very last thing that I completely stuck on.

705
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,100
Yeah, and I think it was because of an assumption I made

706
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:00,100
based on a misunderstanding of of like the the thing they said

707
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,060
that there's a a a something point,

708
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,820
like a reference point in between the two planets, the Ash Twin and in between.

709
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:11,140
Yeah, they say that like it doesn't really mean anything.

710
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,460
Well, what it means, I didn't I didn't realize this at the time.

711
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,660
What it means is that in order to teleport,

712
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,140
you need to be looking up or like that is the point in between the two planets

713
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:28,340
has to be where you're looking because you can't look inside of Ash Twin

714
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,900
to go to Ash Twin.

715
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,220
Yeah, so that's why it works when like the other planet

716
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,660
and between is going.

717
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,220
But the problem is the roof is thing like I think.

718
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,180
Yeah, as soon as I realized that it does work,

719
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,700
it was fine.

720
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,140
It's just that I was running around the whole game

721
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,740
because every other thing, every single other mystery had been solved,

722
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,580
except for how to get into the Ash Twin.

723
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,100
And I just I just didn't understand

724
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,100
I that you could teleport into Ash Twin.

725
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,260
I thought it was impossible because I think I'd read something

726
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,940
where it says it doesn't work.

727
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,140
I was like, OK, there must be another way in and there wasn't.

728
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,620
I was just done.

729
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,580
I. OK, when.

730
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,740
I felt I felt stupid because it felt like the.

731
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,500
It felt like the Ash Twin Towers Twin Towers.

732
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,700
They were funny.

733
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,100
That's just to tower to tower.

734
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,020
Lord of the Rings.

735
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,780
OK, it felt like those would be like a really convenient way

736
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,500
to get around and explore stuff.

737
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,900
And I felt like I had missed out, you know what?

738
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,420
I guess not really, because like your ship is easy enough

739
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,580
to get from place to place, like whatever.

740
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,860
I felt like I was finding it out really late,

741
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,980
like I should have figured it out a long time ago

742
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,020
that the Ash Twin Towers let you go from planet to planet.

743
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,180
Like I had done it before by accident,

744
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,020
but I hadn't really figured out that like, oh, no, yeah, just

745
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,860
that's sort of the whole point of these of Ash Twin

746
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,460
is that they they lead to all these different places.

747
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,260
Yeah, I mean, you read up about like all of the people talking

748
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,660
about Ash Twin being like useful to come to get everything

749
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,020
towards the Ash Twin project really quickly.

750
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,740
Yeah. And it's like I only figured out all of that.

751
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,620
Like I flew through the the black hole into the white hole.

752
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,260
I was like, oh, I'm not dead.

753
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,420
I thought I would die.

754
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,580
There was there was multiple times where it did you talk to

755
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,020
Gabbro to learn to meditate?

756
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,340
Not the first time I met him, but like later,

757
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,140
eventually I talked to him again.

758
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,580
Yeah. And then sometimes I wished I had I had found that out sooner.

759
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,180
Yeah. I mean, that's very useful.

760
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,580
But like when I was be like falling in

761
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,900
brittle hollow towards the black hole, I'm like, OK, I'm dead.

762
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,100
Meditate. I didn't actually fall through it until a few times later.

763
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,780
I just let myself go and I was like, oh, you don't die.

764
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,700
And then after that, how to meditate until like way late falling.

765
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,940
I fell through the black hole like really early, like like pretty terrified of it.

766
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,340
I mean, I there was I fell into it and I was like, I guess I'm going to die.

767
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,460
But there was nothing I could do about it.

768
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,820
So I just did.

769
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:11,060
Like, oh, it's actually like kind of scarier when you're through the white hole

770
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,540
and your ship is like thousands of kilometers away and you have your jet pack

771
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,420
and your oxygen, which is just you don't have time to get back.

772
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,740
Yeah, you're just dead.

773
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,860
Well, then you find the the station and it's like, yeah, here's how to get back.

774
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,660
It's like, oh, cool, looking looking at the white hole.

775
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,860
They solve they solve this problem already.

776
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,300
Looking at the white hole, it's hard because it warps the light around it.

777
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,980
I I thought it was just rubble.

778
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,820
I didn't even see the station until I realized there was a station.

779
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,500
And then I went looking for it.

780
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,700
Well, when it when it spits you out, it spits you out sort of like

781
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,220
you're you're falling in the direction of the station.

782
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,340
Like you're going right towards it.

783
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,340
I mean, I can see it.

784
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,500
It's it's around if you like if you panic and you like, oh, shit, oh, shit.

785
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,540
And you and you start firing your thrusters, maybe like you go somewhere else.

786
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,580
But if you just fall through it and you just let like the momentum carry you,

787
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,460
you just land like on the station and you see the gravity floor you can walk on.

788
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,980
I didn't know that I fell through the black hole a lot of time.

789
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,820
So I got used to it.

790
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,380
But then the the high energy lab was like another tricky one.

791
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,300
That one that one was pretty hard to find.

792
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,780
But once I knew I was looking for it, I eventually found it.

793
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,860
And I was like, OK, like getting getting into that area really early.

794
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,020
And then that's on the same doesn't right.

795
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,900
Yeah, in between the Sunless City.

796
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,220
Yeah, the Sunless City is really irritating

797
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,300
because like you have to go there right away.

798
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,500
And if you go right away for various things, it's it's all buried.

799
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,180
Yeah, yeah.

800
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,220
There is another there's a shortcut into the Sunless City.

801
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,700
Yes, yes, there's like a hole.

802
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,380
I found it a couple of times. Yeah.

803
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,780
So that makes it kind of easy.

804
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,180
And then you get in there and you're walking through the sand

805
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,820
and then you've got the the the little test chamber

806
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,700
where you can switch out the black hole, white hole things.

807
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,500
You shoot your probe through it.

808
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,340
Yeah. Oh, yeah, did you experiment?

809
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,860
Did you have the funny thing happen?

810
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,060
I had the funny thing happen, but not there.

811
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,540
What do you mean?

812
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:23,100
You're talking about the you have broken the fabric of reality, right?

813
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,460
Yeah.

814
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,180
I did get that ending, but I didn't get it that way.

815
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,020
Wait, how do you not get it?

816
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,420
Where else could you do that for?

817
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,340
Wait, first of all, to OK, I know what you're talking about.

818
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,540
But to do that, don't you have to like?

819
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,620
Don't you have to like pull the warp or like the black hole core

820
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,380
out of the machine in a window of like a hundred thousandth of a second

821
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,620
or something to make the probe like duplicate itself?

822
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,020
Yeah, I mean, in the game, it's pretty easy to do.

823
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:58,100
You just have hover your mouse over and like and then like.

824
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:02,300
Because you shoot the probe it when it gets close enough

825
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,660
because they the probe appears outside the white hole

826
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,020
of a few seconds before it enters the black hole. Yeah.

827
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,420
But it's quite lenient, I felt like I got it on my second attempt.

828
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,100
No, I didn't even think to try that because, you know, all the text says,

829
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,260
like, oh, yeah, it's like a thousandth of a second.

830
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,860
It's like an irreceptibly small window of time.

831
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,460
That's that's like you can you can see it when you're shooting it,

832
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,180
that there are two of them and I feel like like like most of a second.

833
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,740
I did shoot a probe through the black hole.

834
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,500
I did not notice the the time paradox.

835
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,900
So I'd know I didn't do that.

836
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,540
No, the way that I broke the fabric of reality was

837
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,380
because I got inside of Ash Twin, I think earlier than you did.

838
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,380
Where because,

839
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,580
yeah, like basically as soon as I figured out what the Ash Twin towers were for,

840
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,820
the first thing I did was try.

841
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,780
Well, first I tried to get to the sun station and I couldn't do it.

842
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,980
And actually, the very last thing I did after I got the ending was I went back

843
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,580
and I got and I figured out how to get to the sun station.

844
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,820
And it turns out all you got to do is just fly over some cactuses.

845
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,700
There's just a little like the sort of trick.

846
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,860
You know what I'm talking about?

847
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,300
I do know what you're talking about.

848
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,220
You don't have to fly over them, though.

849
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,700
Yeah, get there really early.

850
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,620
The sand is still like going down.

851
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,940
You can walk over the sand and get there.

852
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,860
Like before the sun, the Sun Tower.

853
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,740
Yeah, the Sun Tower, the sand is like going down.

854
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,140
Like it reveals the Sun Tower.

855
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,980
If you get in there as soon as possible, the sand is still high enough

856
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,180
so you can walk over the top of it.

857
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,380
Yeah, it's what you can walk over the top of them.

858
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,780
So that's like the very first thing you need to do if you want to get.

859
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,700
Well, well, you know, I mean, it actually worked.

860
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,620
Like I just kind of, you know, I there I hit some cactuses.

861
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,420
I had to repair my suit a couple of times, but like it was fine.

862
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,780
I just kind of did a little bit of like tricky flying over some cactuses,

863
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,340
got into the thing.

864
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,540
Yeah, I should have just I should have just gone for it.

865
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,140
It wasn't actually that hard, but I thought it was impossible.

866
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,740
But yeah, so the first thing I tried to do was the Sun Tower,

867
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,180
but I couldn't figure out how to do it.

868
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,180
And then the second one I tried was, yeah, I could tell that the two towers

869
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:24,020
were for the twins and I just was figured out, OK, one of these brings me

870
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,260
to the Ember Twin, I guess the other one must bring me to the Ash Twin.

871
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,220
And I was like, oh, shit, I'm inside.

872
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,820
I'm inside the chamber now. OK.

873
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,180
God, it was just because I was so sure that I had read somewhere that it doesn't work.

874
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,660
It didn't even occur to me to because I was because I was just fucking around with it.

875
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,860
And like all the other towers, you're supposed to look up.

876
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,380
So I just looked up and it just brought me in.

877
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,700
So I didn't even think to look down.

878
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,820
Another thing, though, like I the thing with that

879
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,820
that I remember being difficult is that I did go there.

880
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,700
I did fuck around and I did look up.

881
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,140
But because the sand lifts you up.

882
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:02,300
Yes, it didn't work.

883
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,380
Well, yeah, you have to.

884
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,180
You have to go there a few seconds after the sand has passed,

885
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,380
which I didn't think to try.

886
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,300
Does that work because they have they have a note that says like

887
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,060
the five degree lenience, right?

888
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,580
There's a lenience of five degrees.

889
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,260
So you can wait a couple seconds, which means that the high energy lab

890
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,980
or no, it's in the Black Hole Forge.

891
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,700
It says like there's a five five.

892
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,740
Yeah, the one for one guy says that.

893
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,860
And like I shot my probe on the thing to see what the timing was.

894
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,700
And it really was like more lenient as long as you're not standing there

895
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,860
when the sand comes. You shot your probe on the what now?

896
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,460
I shot my probe on the the thing so that the probe would get teleported.

897
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,580
So I could see when it teleports the probe.

898
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,020
Yeah. What the fuck?

899
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,220
I don't know why, but I just thought I didn't like that.

900
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,980
That's a good way to test when when is like the right time to do it.

901
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,660
So after the probe goes through, I take I wait like half a second

902
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,500
and then I run in there and I shoot my jet pack down so I'm on the thing

903
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,940
and then it works. Yeah. Yeah.

904
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,540
That's that's so funny.

905
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,940
The way the first the first time I got it to work was I tried I land

906
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,940
because, you know, the reason the sandstorm picks you up off that pad

907
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,340
is because they're like the ceiling is open.

908
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,980
So I tried just like landing my spaceship like on top of it to sort of like cover it up.

909
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,500
And it actually worked.

910
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,860
It actually shit. Well, I couldn't replicate it.

911
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,620
It worked one time and then I couldn't get it to work again.

912
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,180
But yeah, that's how I got inside the Ash Twin chamber the first time.

913
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,340
And then the second time that didn't work.

914
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:41,220
So what I would do was there's a little alcove like behind the teleporter pad

915
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,260
with which you can stand in and you're safe from the sandstorm.

916
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,980
I would stand in that alcove and I would wait until Ember Twin was right overhead

917
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,220
and then I would jump up and then I would fire my thrusters down and sort of just like.

918
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,540
Rock it myself onto the pad so I could hit it despite the, you know,

919
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,060
the sandstorm pulling me up and that that would that would work fine.

920
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,740
That's very convenient, though, that you can just wait until a little bit

921
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,660
after the storm passes. Yeah, that's funny.

922
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,660
Because I yeah.

923
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,660
But.

924
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,060
You want the.

925
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,700
Was I supposed to tell you about how I broke the fabric of reality?

926
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,980
Yes. Yes. Yes.

927
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,220
The way OK. Well, the way that I did it, it's funny.

928
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,140
I went into the chamber and I'm in there and I read the warnings

929
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,220
and I realized like, OK, what's in this chamber is the whole

930
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:39,500
like it's the whole in game justification for why like you start over again after you die.

931
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,020
And I and I was really scared because I thought like if I if I fuck with this

932
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,900
warp core and then I die is the loop going to end and it's like game over

933
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,660
permanently and I have to start over.

934
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,940
I was very worried when I first took it out.

935
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,740
I was like, wait, yeah, this is powering this.

936
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,180
Yeah. But without this, like the whole the whole what's the word,

937
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:06,340
the diagetic reason why dying results in like not a game over is gone.

938
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,540
Yeah. And and it's so stressful because the the sun blowing up music

939
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,220
starts playing regardless of how quickly you've done that.

940
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,100
So like and then it's like the special version of the song.

941
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,500
It's like super tense and I'm like, no, no, I can't do it.

942
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,700
Well, I did I did eventually I just was like, fuck it.

943
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,060
And I and I pulled the thing out.

944
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,900
I pulled the warp core out.

945
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,500
Well, no, I was in there and I and I moved the ball to open the thing

946
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,820
to expose the warp core, but I was too afraid to take it out.

947
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,940
So I just kind of stood there and waited.

948
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,060
And and I and it was late in the cycle.

949
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,100
And I started hearing the supernova music and I was like, what's going to happen?

950
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,060
Did you did you ever did you ever die inside the chamber?

951
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,740
You know, I didn't.

952
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,340
I guess I would have assumed it just.

953
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:06,540
But no, the outside shell, the outside shell was supposed to like

954
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,980
like like retain its like it is.

955
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,180
It is like the it is supernova proof, but only for a moment.

956
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,820
Yeah, so like I guess I should have tried that that that would have been interesting.

957
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,300
What happens? I did I did try.

958
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,060
Well, what happens is if the warp core is still inside

959
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:32,500
of the of the of the the machine, but you know, the doors are open to expose it.

960
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:39,300
Like as the supernova is happening, a black hole forms around the warp core

961
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,900
and then, you know, you just wait.

962
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,460
And then after a few seconds,

963
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,260
there's well, there's like a like a know my like inscription pattern sort of

964
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,740
appears in your field of vision and you get you get time warped back.

965
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,100
You don't die, you just get time warped back in the loop.

966
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,580
If you take the if you take the warp core out

967
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,220
and then you let the supernova happen, then a few seconds go by

968
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,740
and then eventually, you know, the walls break and the supernova explodes

969
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,940
and you die and you die for good, you get the you are dead message

970
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,060
because the project was not online.

971
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,860
But so I tried it the first time and I saw that a black hole happens

972
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,500
when the suit went like right before the time warp activates.

973
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,100
And I was like, huh, so I went back and I opened the doors

974
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,940
and I waited for the supernova.

975
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:32,340
And as the Ashwin project is activating, the black hole forms

976
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,340
and I jumped into the black hole and it warped and it just restarted the loop.

977
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,500
And I was like, OK, it just I just died.

978
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,900
So I go to the map and I'm like, and I'm like, all right, well, I got to go back.

979
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,980
I got I got to try it again.

980
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,300
I got to try another permutation of like, what if I die after

981
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,060
taking the warp core out before I do this and after I do that and whatever.

982
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,060
So I go and I check the map because I've got to fly back to the Ashwin

983
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,140
and I see there's a duplicate signal.

984
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,580
It's like error duplicate signal.

985
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,460
And it shows me both where I am and inside of Ashwin.

986
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,060
Oh, my God. And I'm like, that's funny, the game glitched.

987
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,500
The game didn't expect me to do that.

988
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,780
So it glitched and and it thinks I'm in both places.

989
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,020
Well, no, that sounds like it.

990
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,660
They deliberately did that is because I went there and I went inside.

991
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,100
And there's another copy of you standing there and you can talk to yourself.

992
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,780
Oh, my God, I got to try that. Yeah.

993
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,220
But when when the supernova happens that time,

994
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,740
you get the fabric of reality breaking ending.

995
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,300
That's so strange.

996
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,260
So like, I guess I'd never really thought about it.

997
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,020
But of course, the Ashwin the Ashwin project is a black hole

998
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,420
that sends things to a white hole, but like so powerfully

999
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,980
that it does it like 20 something minutes into the past.

1000
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,340
Yeah. Yeah.

1001
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,620
It sends memories back.

1002
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,300
But if you go back.

1003
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,140
You are being sent 22 minutes into the past.

1004
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,660
The apparent, I guess, just like one version of you

1005
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,260
comes out the white hole inside of the Ashwin project.

1006
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,860
And another version of you gets like sent back in time

1007
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,580
to wake up on Timberhearth.

1008
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,540
Right. Because 22 minutes in the past, you are waking up and you, you know,

1009
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,140
the only things been sent back is your memories, not yourself.

1010
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:24,860
So your memories of that are in your old body,

1011
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,300
which was already existing 22 minutes ago.

1012
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,580
So yeah, you duplicated yourself by jumping in.

1013
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,980
Yeah, I guess so.

1014
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,220
But but yeah, that's that's how I got

1015
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,540
the break, the fabric of reality ending.

1016
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,620
That's so funny. It was very weird.

1017
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,220
And I was like, oh, my God, I found something.

1018
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,220
I found the secret.

1019
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,860
What else? What else?

1020
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,180
What else can I say about what else I do?

1021
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,180
But I got a little thing I can talk about.

1022
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, this was this was like,

1023
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,900
I didn't want to say it last time because it was going to be spoilers.

1024
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,580
But this was like the thing that really got me hooked

1025
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:08,620
into like the exploration of Outer Wilds was I landed on Giant Steve.

1026
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,260
That was the first planet I explored.

1027
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,940
And I was like using like the little slabs

1028
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,300
on the the scrying pools or whatever they are.

1029
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,940
And the ones that like sort of let you see another planet.

1030
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:24,300
Yeah. Yeah. And I did the one that was like the inside of the third probe

1031
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,660
or the memory probe or whatever, when the cannon shoots the probe out.

1032
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,860
Yeah, it sends its information back to this little data bank.

1033
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,740
And I looked at the windows and it's like, oh, there's a lot of electricity out there.

1034
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,420
That's funny. I don't know what the hell that is.

1035
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,260
That's I never saw that until like way later.

1036
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,700
I knew I had used those memory pools,

1037
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,580
but I never I feel like I never saw the inside of the Ash Twin project

1038
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,300
or like the the core of Giant Steve, even though

1039
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,820
there are things around that can let you see that.

1040
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,700
The Ash Twin project one was so scary

1041
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,580
just because it's like there's no lights in there.

1042
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,980
The sound to the like the humming sound is kind of like I have no idea what I'm looking at.

1043
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,900
Yeah. And oh, I love, by the way,

1044
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,260
I love when you look in the Ash Twin project, you can scroll around.

1045
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,100
You see three of the six or seven.

1046
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,260
So also know my masks or lit up.

1047
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,060
And I know that one of them is me because I'm in the loop.

1048
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,420
Gabbro is another one.

1049
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,180
And I was like, and then who's the third?

1050
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:31,060
And I realized later that the third is the memory bank for the probe launcher.

1051
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,500
Yes. So it sends the the data from the probe

1052
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,380
fired in the last cycle so they can shoot in a different direction,

1053
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,220
which is why the probe always shoots in a different direction every time,

1054
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,060
which is so fucking cool when you figure that out.

1055
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,740
Yeah. Sorry, spoiled gamers.

1056
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,260
It makes it make sense.

1057
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,900
I was like, I was like, wait a minute.

1058
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,540
But like if the probe always fires, like doesn't the probe like forget

1059
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,260
where it went last time it fired?

1060
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,500
No, it remembers for the same reason that you remember.

1061
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,580
No, my statue mask technology.

1062
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:06,780
It's so fucking sick. Anyway, so so the thing I was like,

1063
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,700
I went to Giant's Deep once and I was like, what is this this thing?

1064
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,220
It's like got like water and stuff.

1065
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:17,420
And then I found later, I realized that there's a thing like floating around

1066
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,780
the the orbiting Giant's Deep.

1067
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,220
And I was like, oh, that's that thing that blows up.

1068
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,580
I'll land on that.

1069
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,580
The probe cannon.

1070
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,500
So I went on the probe cannon wreckage and I was like looking in there

1071
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,020
and I recognize the architecture as like similar to that one

1072
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,020
with the water and the electricity.

1073
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,820
And I realized that there's three like like a room.

1074
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you mean you

1075
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,740
recognize that the architecture inside of the orbital probe cannon

1076
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:46,340
was similar to what you'd seen through the like the scrying stone

1077
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,140
inside of the Giant's Deep core?

1078
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,020
Yes. So I was like this and I learned that there were three

1079
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,900
like capsules, like rooms.

1080
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,980
Oh, yes. And one of them you can go into the other one.

1081
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,500
You have to go outside the spaceship and go in through the window.

1082
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,220
And then the third one is somewhere.

1083
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,820
And I was like, it's there. Yeah.

1084
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:11,700
And I figured out that that it was the third like capsule from the orbital

1085
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,580
probe cannon and where it was based on the electricity.

1086
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,620
I was like, I saw electricity.

1087
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,500
It's in the core.

1088
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,300
Like I think I got some information that says it's in Giant's Deep.

1089
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,100
I was like, oh, it's in the core.

1090
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,620
Now I got to find out how to get down there.

1091
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:29,740
And then there was the the water like gushing, like pushing me away.

1092
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,940
I'm like, OK, now I've got to find out all of this stuff.

1093
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,060
And then I was hooked.

1094
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,980
I was like, yeah, I love this.

1095
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:41,660
This is like I have some information and it's leading me towards learning more.

1096
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,460
It's great.

1097
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,620
I, yeah, one of the first things that I think like the very first thing I did

1098
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:53,460
on my first launch was I go I went to the interloper because I thought it looked weird.

1099
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,700
And then on another very early loop,

1100
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,900
you know, one of the first things I did was check out the orbital probe cannon.

1101
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,940
And it took me a while.

1102
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,300
I think I had to go back a couple of times before I figured out how to open

1103
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,620
the doors with like the glowing balls, you know.

1104
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,060
Yeah, I didn't quite figure that out right away.

1105
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,940
But eventually I was like, oh, wait, if I move those balls around,

1106
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:18,620
that is like a manipulating switches, basically.

1107
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,660
So I went back and I went inside and, yeah, I found, you know,

1108
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,660
there's three, there's three parts to the to the probe or whatever.

1109
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:32,700
And I only I went in the one that it lets you go into.

1110
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:38,300
And for whatever reason, I went back later and I figured like, oh,

1111
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,780
there's three parts and I can just go into the second part.

1112
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,500
I just have to get in my ship and go around the outside and go in the broken

1113
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,940
window. I didn't figure that out because if you check, if you I think there's

1114
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,180
a scrying pool thing that allows you to see inside one of them.

1115
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,780
And it's like, it's got a broken window.

1116
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,180
Yes. It's like, oh, I can get in through the broken window.

1117
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,580
I did not even think.

1118
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,660
Yeah. Thought that like, oh, the way is blocked.

1119
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,580
I can't get in.

1120
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:02,980
Oh, yeah.

1121
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:06,100
There's a lot of those like doorways that would be so convenient,

1122
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,940
but they're just they're just in the wrong place.

1123
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,580
And then way later, I realized that like, oh, there's three parts and the third

1124
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,660
part that I had already seen.

1125
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,340
I had seen the core of Giants Deep.

1126
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,460
And I knew that the Giants Deep core was full of electricity.

1127
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,700
And then when I finally figured out that like the scrying stone was seeing

1128
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,580
the third part of the orbital probe cannon, I'm like, oh, well, OK,

1129
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,420
I see it's surrounded by electricity.

1130
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,260
So it must be inside the core of Giants Deep.

1131
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,460
How do I how do I get there?

1132
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:39,900
And then, you know, I had I had already met Feldspar and seen the the jellyfish.

1133
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,100
And I was like, OK, well, it's got to involve using these jellyfish

1134
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,420
to insulate myself from electricity somehow.

1135
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,580
Yeah, that I felt I felt like when I figured that out, I was like,

1136
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,420
I should have figured this out like this.

1137
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,300
I had like I had already been inside of the Ash Twin project

1138
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:03,660
by the time I figured out like where the third part of the orbital probe cannon was.

1139
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,860
And I was like, that feels like I did that in the wrong order.

1140
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,020
But it's fine.

1141
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,180
Yeah, I mean, I guess there's nothing stopping

1142
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,100
a brand new player from accidentally beating the game immediately.

1143
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,780
It's just very unlikely that you can go anywhere.

1144
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,100
No, there's there's just it's just sort of the knowledge

1145
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,740
of what the hell you're looking at.

1146
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:28,060
I mean, you have to slowly gather after reading

1147
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,220
like logs all over the galaxy, the solar system.

1148
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,420
I watched a hundred percent speed run of it and it took about an hour.

1149
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,220
I bet like I bet an any percent speed run.

1150
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,060
I mean, let's see, you would just have to.

1151
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:46,740
Well, you could go right to giant steep and you could go right to actually.

1152
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:51,140
OK, well, actually, no, technically, you don't even need to go into giant

1153
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:55,100
steep because the the coordinates are the same every time.

1154
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,220
Like I think if you know the coordinates,

1155
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,940
you could just go right to the Ash Twin.

1156
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,860
Tower, go inside the Ash Twin project.

1157
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,420
Wait, no.

1158
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,740
OK, I learned this from the speed run.

1159
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,020
In theory, you would think you could go right to Ash Twin,

1160
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,780
go inside, grab the.

1161
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,820
The warp core and then immediately go to the vessel, put it in

1162
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,500
and then put the coordinates in without ever actually finding them.

1163
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,020
Because if you know them ahead of time,

1164
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,940
you don't need to find them in the orbital pro cannon in giant steep.

1165
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,660
But you can't do that, actually, because and this is very funny.

1166
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,900
There's until you turn the gravity on in.

1167
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,460
What do you call it?

1168
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,540
Yeah, until you turn the gravity on, there's no way there's something.

1169
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,780
It's something about like you can't put the warp core down

1170
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,100
to move the broken warp core.

1171
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,940
Wait, no, you know, I feel like they might have patched this or something

1172
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,820
because I feel like I did bring just I just brought this this particular

1173
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:04,580
this speed run that I watched, he had to go to the vessel

1174
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:09,780
and move the broken warp core out before he could go to Ash Twin.

1175
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,420
Yeah, that doesn't make it because you could just like put things on the ground.

1176
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,060
Right. Well, you can't just put them on the ground

1177
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,420
or at least this guy couldn't just put it on the ground until the gravity was on.

1178
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,260
Right. So he had to go to the vessel.

1179
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,140
But like no, I feel like maybe they changed that or something

1180
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,700
because I feel like I did not.

1181
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,460
I definitely didn't go and move the the broken core before.

1182
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,060
Yeah, it's just floating next to it.

1183
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,420
Yeah, no. So that might be different.

1184
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,060
Yeah. So I think if you just wanted to beat it right away,

1185
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,940
if you if you knew or somehow managed to guess the coordinates,

1186
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,980
you could just go to Ash Twin, grab the warp core, go to the the bramble,

1187
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,980
find the vessel, put the core in and put the coordinates and go.

1188
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,340
And you could you could beat the game in 10 minutes.

1189
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,220
Yeah, the longest time you'd have to wait

1190
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,700
is for the sands to go down far enough for you to get into Ash Twin.

1191
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,340
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

1192
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,860
And you could just sleep.

1193
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,260
You could just sleep until it's long enough.

1194
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,260
Yeah.

1195
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:12,420
I am I'm trying to think I I did get the DLC,

1196
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,660
but I wanted to like I'm trying to think like,

1197
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:19,260
is there anything else I want to say about the core game before I start talking about that?

1198
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,500
Well, I haven't played the DLC yet.

1199
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,460
So. Oh, OK.

1200
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,700
Guess you can talk about it for the moment.

1201
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,660
There I'm not I don't think I'm that far into it.

1202
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,620
I'm a little ways into it.

1203
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,180
And there are some things that I think are cool about it.

1204
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:40,860
But I I kind of feel like I'm not really digging what they did with it.

1205
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,980
I feel like they did not.

1206
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:46,220
If I if I understand where it's going correctly,

1207
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,900
I feel like they didn't really lean into the strengths of their game

1208
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,300
and they kind of just tried to make a different kind of game in their engine.

1209
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,940
And it's like, OK, well, I'll try it out anyway.

1210
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,020
Yeah, I mean.

1211
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,060
I I'm I'm not I haven't given up on it quite yet.

1212
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,900
But I'm not sure if it's really super my jam, but whatever.

1213
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,820
What what do you think?

1214
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,980
Oh, by the way, when you got to the sun station, how do you feel?

1215
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,660
Oh, oh, OK.

1216
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,660
I tried landing on it so many times.

1217
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,300
Yes, I was trying not to like hint that you should not land on it.

1218
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,260
No, no, I don't even know if it's impossible.

1219
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,140
I had already figured even when we talked last week,

1220
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,500
I had already figured out that, like, OK, I'm not supposed to land on it.

1221
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,180
Like, I think definitely there's some other way to get there.

1222
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,220
And yeah, of course, the Sun Tower is how you get there.

1223
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,660
I did manage to hit it.

1224
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:53,660
I managed to collide with it, but I like bounced off.

1225
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,100
I cracked my windshield and I bounced off of it.

1226
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,180
And I realized like, OK, this is theoretically possible,

1227
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,660
but there's definitely this is not the way you're supposed to do it.

1228
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,140
So I I quit.

1229
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,740
I quit trying to land on it.

1230
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,460
But I you could you could definitely do it though.

1231
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,300
Hypothetically, if you if you go fast enough

1232
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,860
and don't go too close to the sun, but you get you have

1233
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:22,020
a fast enough orbit, yes, and like like resist the pole.

1234
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,820
If you very carefully controlled your

1235
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,620
if you very carefully controlled your your trajectory

1236
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,860
and managed to get into a somewhat stable orbit around the sun

1237
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,540
and managed to line yourself up with the sun station,

1238
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:40,460
you could theoretically sort of lower yourself down onto it and land on it.

1239
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,740
It'd be very hard.

1240
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:44,540
Um.

1241
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,900
How did I feel about it once I got there?

1242
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,060
Yeah, because I thought that was a really cool,

1243
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:54,460
like scary thing where you have to jump from one part of it to the other

1244
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,100
right over the sun.

1245
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,340
You know, I had I didn't get there until after I had already seen the ending.

1246
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,900
And so doing that in the sun station, I kind of was just like, eh.

1247
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,180
Eh, so what if I fall into the sun?

1248
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,380
No, biggie. Yeah.

1249
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,700
Yeah, I guess if you if it's happened so many times,

1250
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,740
I hadn't actually fallen into the sun

1251
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,140
until like much later in the game when I was just getting frustrated

1252
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,700
and just flew in there deliberately.

1253
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,820
You know, I yeah, I remember making that jump.

1254
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,220
I kind of just didn't even think about it.

1255
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,780
I kind of was just like, oh, I guess I got to just kind of float.

1256
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,340
OK, it's one of those.

1257
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,340
It's one of those moments where it's like relative

1258
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,260
velocity is like crazy.

1259
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,620
It's like I'm spinning around the sun as first as the sun station is.

1260
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,420
You know, it feels like nothing is moving at all.

1261
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:45,340
Maybe if I had just had taken a second and looked around,

1262
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:49,900
I might have been impressed by that because I can imagine like if I looked down,

1263
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,860
I would see the surface of the sun like shooting past me.

1264
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,020
But I just kind of didn't,

1265
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,540
although that's interesting and makes me kind of want to go check it out again.

1266
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,740
What a thing.

1267
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,780
What a freaking game, man.

1268
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,460
It's all I feel like it's an all timer for me now.

1269
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,820
Oh, yeah.

1270
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:11,340
Definitely epic.

1271
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,340
Definitely, I would say it's definitely epic. Yeah.

1272
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,860
What do you feel?

1273
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:17,940
How do you feel about like the way it ends?

1274
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:21,580
Because it's it's not like a like you save the world.

1275
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,140
It's like your world, the longer you play.

1276
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,380
Initially, I was like, oh, we've got to stop the sun exploding.

1277
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,580
But no, the sun is exploding.

1278
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,140
Everything will be destroyed.

1279
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,940
It's just how much are you going to figure out before that happens?

1280
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,060
Yeah, it's your universe is dying.

1281
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,300
But in your universe will be created.

1282
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:47,820
So so the so the lore is that like the sun station was not able to induce a supernova.

1283
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:54,300
And so therefore this is just they just had to wait until the natural end of the sun's lifespan.

1284
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:55,260
Right. Yeah.

1285
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,260
And then and then the know my like, dang, it didn't work.

1286
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:01,580
Fuck. Well, hey, look, there's a comet.

1287
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,780
Let's go see what what's that all about.

1288
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,900
That could be interesting.

1289
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:09,500
And then the comet spews like the radiation all over the solar system.

1290
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,740
The old ghost matter, right?

1291
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,900
That's where ghosts matter from. Yeah. Yeah.

1292
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,100
Which is really sad when you think about it.

1293
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,460
Did that did that wipe out know my civilization?

1294
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,860
Is that like what I'm supposed to take away from that?

1295
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:27,700
I think that's I mean, if you talk to what's his face with the playing the banjo?

1296
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,620
If you if you come back to him because he's the archaeologist,

1297
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:33,580
he loves hearing about all the information you you find out.

1298
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,780
So you can tell him about how the know my died via the ghost matter.

1299
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,300
And he's like, wow, that's how they died.

1300
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:44,740
So I think it's very clear that that is the story you learn is that they died

1301
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:49,340
from exploring this comet that entered the solar system and then exploded.

1302
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:52,780
Yeah. It just it just the ghost.

1303
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:53,940
There's just not that much.

1304
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,380
I mean, maybe there's just not the much ghost matter.

1305
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:00,460
And it's not very threatening in in in current in current year.

1306
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:06,020
Yes, I think the idea is that it went all over the solar system

1307
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,660
and killed everything, but then slowly like decayed.

1308
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,380
And then there's only a few pockets of it left,

1309
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,940
which is why life can continue to exist and how you evolve.

1310
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,860
Yeah, it makes sense. It makes sense.

1311
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,340
I felt like that was the implication.

1312
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,980
But I was like, really, really?

1313
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,740
It's like, I just it is a kind of I don't even talk about ghost matter.

1314
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,980
But it's so it's so interesting, like the reason that there's all this stuff

1315
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,140
to explore and no one to tell you about it.

1316
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,860
Yeah, all these ruins across the solar system and all of these weird things.

1317
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:47,140
And the Ash Twin project, which only is, you know, it it was just left running

1318
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,860
because nobody was there to like turn it off or anything.

1319
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,860
And then it just so happens to start working when the sun naturally hits a

1320
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:58,500
supernova. Well, well, it was like a really cool setting for all of this.

1321
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:04,580
It was it was it was designed to activate, you know, to be powered by the supernova.

1322
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:10,500
So yeah, so it's not a coincidence, but it it makes it makes sense.

1323
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,500
It makes a lot of sense.

1324
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,100
It's like, yeah, I guess if they if they could if they needed a supernova

1325
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,340
to power this device and they couldn't induce the supernova,

1326
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:22,300
then just nothing happened until, you know, a billion years later,

1327
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,260
a supernova, you know, is the inevitable result of happening.

1328
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,820
And it just had to wait until it just happened anyway.

1329
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:32,940
And then now you're here and you just it works out that the

1330
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,340
this is how it this is how it shakes out.

1331
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,460
Well, it's it's activated now.

1332
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,660
And now we've got to do something about it.

1333
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:45,060
Yeah, it's really great how you just.

1334
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,380
I mean, there's tech.

1335
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,700
Yeah, they they left they left scrolls and stuff.

1336
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,580
Or I got to say, every time I like picked up a scroll,

1337
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,140
I was just thinking like, oh, return a score.

1338
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,900
I couldn't get away from it.

1339
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,820
You put the scroll in the in the wall.

1340
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,940
I love that the way that the technology is designed.

1341
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,700
It's very funny.

1342
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:07,060
It's very weird and cool.

1343
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,740
And and the the way that the the scripts.

1344
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,900
I mean, it's not very space efficient, but it's kind of a neat idea that

1345
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:19,780
like the writing sort of spirals out in like branches.

1346
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,580
It's neat.

1347
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,300
And I don't think the writing was like amazing, but it was fine.

1348
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:27,260
I I felt like it.

1349
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:33,340
It I there was an element of like character development, but I didn't really

1350
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,980
pay too much attention to the names of the people until much later.

1351
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,580
I was like, I was starting to like I was rereading things because I was stuck.

1352
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,540
And then I was like, oh, yeah, this person and that people.

1353
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,420
I was a little confused about like the generations of Nomai that are taking place.

1354
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:53,420
Like some people came from the vessel and potentially grew old and died.

1355
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:57,140
And then younger people from the same, you know,

1356
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,380
civilization that they built in the in Brittle Hollow and other places

1357
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,060
grew up to build the Ashwin project.

1358
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,900
Yeah, there were like it's a little hard to follow.

1359
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:11,420
But I liked I liked the the dialogue because it it serves very good

1360
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,740
gameplay function without being like, yeah, too clinical.

1361
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:18,740
Yeah, I like that there's some humanity in these like ancient people.

1362
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:24,860
The I could tell that there were like distinct groups of names

1363
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,460
that were part of like different generations.

1364
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,460
I didn't read and I could tell that like, OK, there's

1365
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:37,900
there's there's the group that is working on the the Sun Station project

1366
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,460
and building the Ashwin project.

1367
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,740
And there's the guy who has to make the warp core.

1368
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,060
And I think his name is poke.

1369
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,620
Or something pokey pokey.

1370
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1371
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,700
And there's a there's another one that starts with a P.

1372
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,580
And I know that like two of them.

1373
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,020
There's two that are like flirting with each other.

1374
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,020
And I think at some point they might get married.

1375
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,900
I think at some point they might switch to referring to their spouse.

1376
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,900
Or maybe there's another group that were married in another pair that were flirting.

1377
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:09,100
Yeah, I didn't really I didn't really pay that much attention to like who's who.

1378
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:14,540
The trouble with that is that your ship notes down the relevant information,

1379
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,980
but isn't note down anything else.

1380
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,260
Who said what? Yeah.

1381
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,180
Who said what and what their names were and like the the quips.

1382
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,340
They're they're definitely are you have to write it down yourself

1383
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:28,300
if you actually want to like understand everything.

1384
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:33,300
There definitely are little little stories going on between the characters.

1385
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,940
And they definitely have a little bit of like a distinct voice,

1386
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,020
but it's not it's not like that distinct.

1387
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:41,860
It's not like it's not that I think I think it's it's good

1388
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,900
though, because it's if if you're a little unclear about something,

1389
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,900
seeing a familiar name will be like, oh, that guy, that guy's here.

1390
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:54,100
And so you might have a bit of like you would associate something

1391
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,780
that that other guy was talking about with this current thing,

1392
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:02,300
which might help you piece together like how they're connected and like solve a puzzle.

1393
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,460
There's something simple like that.

1394
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,220
There's the one that had to build the warp core.

1395
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,860
And then he says, like, no, it's not ready. I need more time.

1396
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:13,700
There's another one who there's there's one that's like,

1397
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:17,020
we should build this the sun station, even though it could destroy the solar system.

1398
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,860
And another one's like, no, we shouldn't build the solar the sun station

1399
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,100
because it could destroy the solar system.

1400
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,660
It is pretty scary that their that their plan was to induce a supernova

1401
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:30,460
and have this thing of this Ash Twin project

1402
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:34,020
and relying on it to accurately send the memories back.

1403
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,660
So yeah, they like would know.

1404
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,620
I hope they were. I mean, I'm sure they tested it and stuff,

1405
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:44,860
but it was like inducing a supernova so that they could send a probe out

1406
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:47,780
to find the eye of the universe a million billion times.

1407
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:54,500
Is a and I guess, yeah, little, little, little much, a little bit.

1408
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,940
They hope they were really confident it was going to work.

1409
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:03,500
And I guess I guess in theory, then they could do it over and over again

1410
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,860
a million times. And then when they finally found the coordinates

1411
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,140
they were looking for, then they could prevent it from inducing it again.

1412
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:14,540
Right. Yeah, they just turn it off and not induce the thing.

1413
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,140
And now we know where the eye of the universe is.

1414
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,700
But that dang comet just had to come out of nowhere.

1415
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:24,780
It's a pretty funny like conceit, though, that like, OK,

1416
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:28,900
we need to find this thing out, but it's going to be really hard.

1417
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,700
It's going to take a lot of time to find it out.

1418
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,740
So let's just create a stable time loop

1419
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,740
that will iterate itself 900 million times.

1420
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,740
And we won't even notice that because then it'll like after the last time

1421
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:48,380
it resets, we'll just cancel it, but we'll have the information.

1422
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,700
It's funny. It's good. Yeah.

1423
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,620
It's a well, it's a very it's a very well considered.

1424
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,100
Uh, thing, I guess the only.

1425
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,020
No, I guess it's not a plot hole.

1426
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:03,740
It's not a plot hole.

1427
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:06,740
It makes sense that the probe would fire in different directions

1428
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:09,420
every time because the know my mask would remember

1429
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:14,220
which it already fired in so it can decide like, OK, well, now I'll use a new one.

1430
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,700
Random different one. Yeah. Yeah.

1431
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:22,900
It is kind of insane that like it eventually did find the eye of the universe.

1432
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,140
Like, how isn't it a quantum when it move constantly?

1433
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,940
It does move constantly, but.

1434
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,580
Well, I mean, it's, you know, I don't think that really matters because

1435
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,140
at the end of the day, where it is is random.

1436
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,740
Wait. Oh, are you are you saying that like once it's observed?

1437
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:50,100
Geez, well, what would resetting that would resetting the time line

1438
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,780
with that with that?

1439
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,020
Would it? Oh, no, it's fine location.

1440
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:02,380
I actually I think it's fine because it's not time travel necessarily.

1441
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,860
It's memory travel.

1442
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:08,020
So you are just experiencing linear time and then.

1443
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:14,740
You are like adding versions of memories from the future onto yourself.

1444
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,820
And so you're you're gaining things.

1445
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:20,860
So you haven't technically observed it.

1446
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:21,700
You haven't technically.

1447
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,420
So like the probe finds the eye of the universe and.

1448
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,580
That's where it is.

1449
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:32,540
And so every time, every loop, which is the same linear time path,

1450
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,300
it's in the same place because that's where it is.

1451
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,820
That's where I found it.

1452
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,020
Yeah, I guess I buy that.

1453
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,740
I guess. Yeah, I mean, I never really thought about it before,

1454
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:45,700
but like it's a lot of like half science anyway.

1455
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:51,340
Because because in this in the timeline where you go there,

1456
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:56,100
it has not the probe has not yet has not observed it.

1457
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,420
No, you know, it is observed at once actually.

1458
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,300
Oh, I kind of think I kind of think maybe you're right.

1459
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:09,380
You're on to something there because.

1460
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:14,660
Because since it's quantum, it has no location until observed.

1461
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,300
Therefore, even if the locations in one time line,

1462
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,620
if the location was observed in one place,

1463
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:25,260
why would it necessarily be in the same place before?

1464
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,860
It's quantum behavior would mean that it could be.

1465
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:32,420
In any that it could it could be anywhere upon the next time.

1466
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:35,660
That it was observed, I think.

1467
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,220
I don't know.

1468
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:41,100
I mean, I think the idea is that you are not in this in the cycle

1469
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:43,940
where the probe found it.

1470
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,300
You're in a new you're in a, you know, another cycle

1471
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:49,900
where the probe didn't find it's just shooting continually.

1472
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,380
Yeah.

1473
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,220
And when you use the coordinates,

1474
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,820
you go there and you immediately observe it.

1475
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,980
And since you're constantly observing it,

1476
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,220
you don't close your eyes, isn't move.

1477
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:07,540
Oh, and also there's the whole thing like if you're on something,

1478
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:09,140
you travel with it.

1479
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,620
So once you're there, you're there.

1480
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,140
But what? Yeah.

1481
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:16,060
But what I'm saying is if it's behaving quantumly,

1482
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:20,580
it's its location is not defined until it is observed.

1483
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:25,740
And the act of observing it would basically make it pick a location.

1484
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,620
So even if it's start, you know, it's its position is in a super.

1485
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:35,900
It's its location is in a superposition of states until the probe observes it.

1486
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,580
And then it has a location because it's been observed.

1487
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,260
But if the same probe were to observe it twice,

1488
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:47,020
there's no reason why it would be in the same place both times.

1489
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,780
I don't know.

1490
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:56,820
I know a list about quantum mechanics.

1491
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,180
I mean, that's that's how the moon is.

1492
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,460
That's how the quantum moon is.

1493
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,180
I don't know.

1494
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:04,900
I guess the the the eye of the universe could behave.

1495
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,180
It could its quantum behavior could be different.

1496
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:11,060
I mean, it's obviously a magical impossible thing. Right.

1497
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,100
It's fun, though.

1498
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:16,660
Like, yeah, getting getting there and doing all that stuff.

1499
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,700
And like the the ending.

1500
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,780
It was fine.

1501
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:24,660
It was a little wacky.

1502
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,940
It was a little out there.

1503
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,900
I liked the noticing that

1504
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,780
when I talked to the people, they were not real.

1505
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:36,740
They were for similes that I understood them as because the Nomai was there,

1506
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:40,300
but they didn't need the translating like rocks.

1507
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,380
They could just talk to me, which is not something they could actually do.

1508
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,860
So they were all fake.

1509
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,420
They were all in my imagination.

1510
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:49,180
That's interesting.

1511
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:50,940
I didn't even think about that.

1512
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,980
Yeah. But yeah, why would they be there?

1513
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:56,660
And the the eye of the universe is based off of like, I guess,

1514
01:25:56,980 --> 01:26:00,980
things I have experienced because I see things there that I know of

1515
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,220
as a as a little

1516
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,420
Harthian is a little guy.

1517
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,420
Just a little guy.

1518
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,180
Just a little guy.

1519
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:12,940
You know, yeah, it makes it makes more sense for them to be.

1520
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:18,060
Imagination, imagination, projections, memory, projections.

1521
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,500
And yeah, I know that guy does not speak your language.

1522
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,820
He does not.

1523
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:27,340
He really should have been talking with his little rock tablet.

1524
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,700
No, it makes sense.

1525
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,020
I.

1526
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:33,020
It's a little bit.

1527
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,500
It's I guess it's kind of what do you call it?

1528
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,540
2001, a space Odyssey, like.

1529
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:46,780
Go into the universe's core and what's there is like a projection

1530
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:49,620
of your your own memory or something.

1531
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,020
I mean, a little bit, I guess.

1532
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:55,020
I mean, I think that the idea is that like you.

1533
01:26:55,940 --> 01:27:01,620
And your universe and your galaxy and solar system and the planets and all that.

1534
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,740
When you're in the eye of the universe, I don't think you're really alive anymore

1535
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:11,460
because you sort of get to understand that the universe itself is dying

1536
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,700
and then will be reborn.

1537
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,780
But the only thing that's odd about that is like afterwards.

1538
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:21,260
I mean, I shot my probe into like the big cloud of stuff.

1539
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,140
And then at the end, the probe was like flying around.

1540
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:26,500
What? You mean over the fire?

1541
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:27,860
Over the fire.

1542
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:31,940
Like it's like like the after the big explosion, the big bang.

1543
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:36,980
There's like a different race of aliens with their own campfire.

1544
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,220
And then your probe flies around.

1545
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,700
What? And I'm like, is that my probe?

1546
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,700
Like, I think that's supposed to be my probe.

1547
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:44,460
What do you what do you mean?

1548
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,420
You're what do you mean your probe flies around?

1549
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,700
What are you talking about?

1550
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,780
Well, when you're at the eye of the universe, everybody sings their song.

1551
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,220
It makes a big cloud of stuff.

1552
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,300
Yes, you jump into it to end the game.

1553
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,300
But I shot my probe in there.

1554
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,900
So my probe went through into something.

1555
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,140
And it seems.

1556
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,860
Did you see what was did the probe show you what was on the other side?

1557
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,180
I tried to take a picture, but it said like impossible.

1558
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,380
Like I couldn't recall it.

1559
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,780
I couldn't do anything. It was just gone.

1560
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,220
So weird. OK, no, I didn't do that.

1561
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,460
And then I just saw the probe in the image.

1562
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:19,740
Yeah, like like there's the the the painting or whatever.

1563
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:23,860
It's like a nice image of like planets, new planets, new universe.

1564
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,260
Oh, so beautiful space.

1565
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,180
And then your probe like flies across the screen

1566
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,940
and then it goes to black and the credits and stuff.

1567
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,140
That's so fucking funny.

1568
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:31,780
No, I didn't I didn't do that.

1569
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,380
So I don't know whether that happens every time

1570
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,900
or if it's just if you shoot the probe.

1571
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,300
I guess it didn't didn't happen for me.

1572
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:43,340
OK, so yeah, there's like implications that you survive somehow

1573
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,300
because your probe is there.

1574
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,060
You physically would have gone through that.

1575
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:53,060
Yeah, I mean, yeah, if you if your probe survives going through, why not you?

1576
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,420
I guess.

1577
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,900
So basically, it's home stuck.

1578
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,540
And this is the new it is home.

1579
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,620
It is home stuck. It is just home stuck.

1580
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:05,940
Every every good story eventually becomes home stuck if it goes on long enough.

1581
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:11,260
Well, I mean, I guess the probe could still

1582
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:15,180
I mean, could theoretically last 14 billion years.

1583
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,780
I mean, you wouldn't live that long.

1584
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:21,140
I'm just thinking of like a stupid mud

1585
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:26,020
where you just replace the the Nomai text with like troll texts, chat logs.

1586
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:30,180
You just read about them talking about troll things.

1587
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,740
Like, oh, who are these trolls?

1588
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:34,300
Yeah.

1589
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,820
Everything else is the same.

1590
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,420
It's just that the trolls were doing it instead of the Nomai.

1591
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,980
I feel I feel like.

1592
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,540
I feel like it wouldn't even be that hard.

1593
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:47,780
I feel like, yeah, if you just change some text, you could you could theme.

1594
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:52,020
You could theme the game as though you're playing a game of spurb.

1595
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:58,180
Yeah, with with simple with simple text changes, I feel like it could be done.

1596
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,700
Damn, it's like it's like, man, I finally I finally experienced

1597
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:13,740
what it's like to actually play spurb since home stuck was too fucking cowardly

1598
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:17,420
to actually show any of the machinations of the game itself.

1599
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,140
Thanks. Thanks, Outer Wilds.

1600
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,740
I appreciate it. You did it. You made.

1601
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,020
You made a game. You made home so good.

1602
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,500
You made home. You've fixed it.

1603
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,180
Man.

1604
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:36,700
The it's like a Twitter reply, like, fix that for you posts game.

1605
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,780
I want to I want to finish the DLC.

1606
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,740
It's not it's not going to be like.

1607
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,420
It's very it's different from the main game.

1608
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,540
It's not it's not it's not going to scratch the same itch as the main game, though.

1609
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,820
Well, I mean, for me, this the itch to scratch was like

1610
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,020
exploring and learning and figuring out puzzle stuff. Yeah.

1611
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:04,700
If that if it has that, then I don't mind like the the the world destroying

1612
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:09,140
like super like, oh, my God, realizations are great.

1613
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:14,780
But like the like moment to moment enjoyment is like OK, having a plan of action

1614
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:18,260
and then going there and trying to try to find something out.

1615
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,980
I mean, there there is mysteries to uncover.

1616
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,060
I mean, yeah, they're.

1617
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:29,420
It's it's I'm trying to I'm trying to decide.

1618
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,780
Do is it actually different or is it just like?

1619
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,980
It's kind of similar.

1620
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:41,100
It's it's sort of similar in the act of that you go places and discover

1621
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,260
things that might lead you to investigate stuff.

1622
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:48,500
So, I mean, it definitely still has that going for it.

1623
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,300
Actually.

1624
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,300
Well, I don't get into it.

1625
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,020
I I did enjoy it somewhat.

1626
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:04,020
I don't I don't think I really like the direction it's going.

1627
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:08,580
But I feel like but maybe if I push on a little more, I'll find more to like in it, perhaps.

1628
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:12,580
I feel like I probably shouldn't give up on it.

1629
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:18,980
Well, yeah, that's that's the Outer Wild spoilers.

1630
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:24,500
Yeah, I think I think that's pretty much all I had to say about Outer Wilds.

1631
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,660
Oh, one last thing.

1632
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:30,100
Sure. Did you ever drive your ship so hard into something that it snapped into

1633
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,980
and you couldn't repair it?

1634
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:35,300
I did have my ship explode a couple of times.

1635
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,220
What once once a couple of times it exploded while I was not in it.

1636
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,300
And then one other time it exploded while I was in it, like trying to pilot it.

1637
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:44,460
It's interesting.

1638
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,860
There's like specific parts that get if they get hit like it can cause an explosion.

1639
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:53,420
But I got like hit specifically so that it didn't explode.

1640
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:56,820
But the two halves like snapped and flew away from each other.

1641
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,180
So the front half of that I was sitting in, I was in the chair still.

1642
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,940
I got out of the chair and the back half of the ship wasn't with me anymore.

1643
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,700
Did the ship still like function at all?

1644
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,580
No, I mean, I would have had to somehow put them together,

1645
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,020
but they were just apart.

1646
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,460
I couldn't interact with it at all.

1647
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,260
I.

1648
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:18,180
Yeah, actually, I think just yesterday I had it happen for the first time

1649
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:22,900
that my ship blew apart and I was still I was still in the cockpit.

1650
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,700
But like the ship, the cockpit was just kind of spinning.

1651
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:32,020
And, you know, like I couldn't, you know, none of the functions of it worked.

1652
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:36,220
I had, but I had to get up and just kind of like jump out the back of my

1653
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:40,180
totally piece piecemeal ship.

1654
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:45,620
And fortunately, I was near enough to my destination that I just like jumped out

1655
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,940
and jet packed the rest of the way.

1656
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:51,060
But I just was like, well, I guess I'm not.

1657
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:55,260
Wasn't planning on going home anyway, so no worries.

1658
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Yeah, it never happened for a while.

1659
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:04,020
I think there was one time and maybe I crashed on Ash Twin or something

1660
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:10,020
and it it dealt a lot of damage to the ship and I got out and I was like,

1661
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:13,300
ah, fuck it, like I wasn't planning on going home anyway.

1662
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,140
And so I didn't bother repairing it.

1663
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:18,700
And after a while, like, you know, the master light had been blinking.

1664
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,940
And after a minute or two of that, the whole thing just blew apart.

1665
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,100
I was like, oh, I didn't even know that could happen.

1666
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,420
But it did.

1667
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:33,740
I like how many how many different gruesome, terrifying ways you can die.

1668
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:38,100
There were a couple of times when I jumped out of my ship

1669
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,860
forgetting that I had not put my suit on.

1670
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:45,820
And I was like, oh, fuck, no, I got to do it all over again.

1671
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,740
Yeah, at some point, there was one time my my ship crashed

1672
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,860
or like something happened to it.

1673
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,980
And I was like, fuck, I have I don't know why.

1674
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,660
I think I was trying to get through

1675
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:06,900
dark Bramble and thinking my personal thrusters are probably not as loud.

1676
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,820
And that is true.

1677
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:12,220
You can do your thrusters with a jet pack, but only up to a point.

1678
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,060
They will still hear you if you get too close.

1679
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:15,420
But it was too.

1680
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,820
It wasn't enough jet pack fuel.

1681
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:19,780
So I sort of ran out of jet pack fuel floating through dark Bramble.

1682
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:20,820
And then I ran out of oxygen.

1683
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:23,660
I was like, fuck, this sucks.

1684
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:27,100
Uh, what do you think?

1685
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:27,620
I.

1686
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:35,820
So I think some of the most one of the most frustrating deaths that I had was like.

1687
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:42,900
I ran out of time a bunch of times while I was trying to fuck around in the vessel.

1688
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:46,740
Like I tried to find like alternate doors and like other areas in the vessel.

1689
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:51,940
There's I was a bit disappointed how little of the vessel you can actually like see.

1690
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,820
You could basically only see like the bridge and the hallway.

1691
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,180
I kind of thought it would be bigger, honestly.

1692
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:04,900
I spent a lot of time like like going around it and trying to find like maybe broken parts

1693
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,940
I could enter or like other doors that would open or something.

1694
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,380
And I just you can't.

1695
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:13,820
I guess you can't really run out of air.

1696
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,020
No, yeah, you can in a vessel.

1697
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,060
You can. There's no trees.

1698
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,620
You're right. Yeah, it's broken.

1699
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:24,580
Yeah. So I had to like run back to my ship and like refuel and reoxygenate a bunch of times.

1700
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:25,340
And then I would run it.

1701
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:29,940
I would hear the music like, oh, God, because getting back there is pretty annoying.

1702
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:34,780
It's it's one of the one of the more out of the way places.

1703
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:40,180
It's one of those those moments where it's like, you know, you don't have time left.

1704
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:45,900
And so you're like, OK, well, I guess I'll just watch the solar like the explosion.

1705
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:51,340
And in certain places, it sort of looks really like if it's if you're really far away

1706
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:52,940
and they're the White Hole Station or something.

1707
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,940
Yeah, it's like, wow, it's so slow.

1708
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:57,660
Did you? Oh, here it comes.

1709
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:01,780
Did you ever try to flee the solar system?

1710
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:08,300
I I accidentally flung myself like near the boundary.

1711
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:12,220
And then the autopilot kicked in and said, oh, you're going back to the sun, actually.

1712
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,700
Yeah, it does that.

1713
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,900
But you can turn it off if you want.

1714
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:17,980
Yeah, I didn't try.

1715
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:20,900
I didn't think that would be much happening.

1716
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,340
I guess I should have tried it.

1717
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,620
I actually got an achievement for it because once.

1718
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,260
Well, I had a thought and it was a stupid thought.

1719
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:34,500
But I was like, hmm, in this ship, there's, you know, the ship gives you infinite fuel.

1720
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:37,100
I this is really dumb.

1721
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,820
I feel embarrassed that I even had this.

1722
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,660
I was like, what if I tried to reach a relativistic speeds?

1723
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:45,500
I wonder if I just accelerated forever if I could exceed the speed of light.

1724
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,940
Well, you know, obviously there's not enough time for that.

1725
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:55,820
You would have to get going at like three times ten to the eight meters per second.

1726
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,060
So I tried it.

1727
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:03,380
I tried just like going just accelerating away from the sun for as long as it would let me.

1728
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:10,220
And I think I managed to get up to like four or five, like like 50,000 meters per second.

1729
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,340
You know, just just accelerating as long as I could.

1730
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:18,940
And it's funny, you get far enough away that you can't even see the sun anymore.

1731
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,700
And then it's so cool.

1732
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,580
If you if you if you look at the map.

1733
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:27,140
While you're really far away, all of the

1734
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:33,780
like the indicators, like the names of of things and the like little

1735
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:39,420
like crosshairs that appear over whatever you're locked onto, they're like jittery and shaky.

1736
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:45,260
And and if you get really far out, they're shaking so much that like you can't read them anymore.

1737
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,620
And I don't think that's like intentional.

1738
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:55,780
I think that's just like the sort of the engine kind of like struggling with with the distance.

1739
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:02,180
You know, something I heard I watched a little documentary on the making of it.

1740
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:05,340
And they said, did you did you watch the the the no clip?

1741
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:07,740
Oh, yeah, that was it.

1742
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:08,700
I watched that, too.

1743
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,140
And the guy mentioned something about how like things would jitter.

1744
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:16,900
And I was like, I think I experienced engine jitter from trying to leave the solar system.

1745
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,060
I think I found that artifact in the game.

1746
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:26,060
What sort of blew me away was like they say that the planets are hurtling around the sun and stuff.

1747
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:31,180
And they they're not necessarily on pre-programmed paths.

1748
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:33,340
I mean, they do spin around the same way.

1749
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:37,020
But like they are actually acting on each other gravity wise.

1750
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:40,540
Oh, I'm like, wow, how the fuck.

1751
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:46,540
And I guess it's sort of like your actions are not enough to change the course of a planet.

1752
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,900
So you don't notice.

1753
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:54,620
But like in theory, if you could like become huge, you could like if you could like crash yourself

1754
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:59,900
into a planet and like send it off of its orbit, creating off his orbit and then falling into the

1755
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,620
sun, which obviously they didn't program.

1756
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,620
So it would just sit there, I suppose.

1757
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:04,940
Yeah.

1758
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:10,780
Or like fling itself way out out of the solar system, which is really very interesting.

1759
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:12,940
There's a lot of technical problems.

1760
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:19,420
I mean, I couldn't imagine how complicated it would be to make all of these planets

1761
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:21,100
with their individual gravities.

1762
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:24,620
And also having like interiors.

1763
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,220
Honestly, yeah.

1764
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:30,380
It's so like bizarre how it works so well.

1765
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:38,460
While you're like on a planet, is it is the game still like considering like how the planet

1766
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:43,820
itself is like moving through the solar system and like how it's being affected by the sun's

1767
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:44,460
gravity?

1768
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,740
That's that's fucked.

1769
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:46,700
That's fucked up.

1770
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,420
But that works.

1771
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,060
Yes.

1772
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:55,100
And and the the anti-gravity like chamber in in Timberhoff, you know, the little mining thing.

1773
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:55,500
Yes.

1774
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:55,740
Yes.

1775
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:00,700
The reason it's anti-gravity is because that is the center of Timberhoff.

1776
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,900
So there is no.

1777
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,780
You're shitting me down what you're not gravity pulled.

1778
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:08,460
So they didn't they didn't like custom code that area.

1779
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:11,580
It's just like, yeah, in the center of the heart of.

1780
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:15,260
Yeah, that's the reason you're yeah.

1781
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:16,300
I mean, that's what they said.

1782
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,580
I feel like it would work differently on something like dark Bramble because that's so insane.

1783
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,380
But I don't know.

1784
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:30,380
They have like an astrophysicist like rocket guy who was working on the programming.

1785
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:34,700
So I'm like they wanted to be as scientifically accurate as they could.

1786
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:36,140
Oh, hang on.

1787
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:42,940
Well, I mean, in the real world, I mean, yeah, you would be you would be.

1788
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:49,980
Well, that they they explained it like in the center of Timberhoff, there is no core.

1789
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:55,020
It's just space and you're in there and the the mass of the planet is surrounding you.

1790
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:59,100
So you're not being pulled to a center point.

1791
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,060
Yeah, I mean, that is true.

1792
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,100
The whole thing is like pulling you equally from every direction.

1793
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,380
So it feels weightless.

1794
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:04,700
OK.

1795
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:10,860
But I but I feel I feel like that's their reasoning and it's sound reasoning.

1796
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:16,860
But I still think that like they must have in the code like defined that like inside of this area,

1797
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:21,740
you know, you're not you're no longer pulled towards the center of Timberhoff.

1798
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,700
Yeah, I mean, yeah, maybe.

1799
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,540
I don't exactly know how they do it.

1800
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:29,260
I think they said one of them said something like

1801
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:37,900
the way they calculate your position and stuff.

1802
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:43,740
It wouldn't work if the because all these plants are moving.

1803
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:49,420
They don't base it off of the world's location.

1804
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:50,220
They work.

1805
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:53,020
They base everything else off of your location.

1806
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:53,500
Yes.

1807
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:58,620
So like when you jump, the entire solar system goes down instead of you actually jumping,

1808
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:00,780
which is how they explain that.

1809
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:02,940
And I'm like, I can't wrap my head around that.

1810
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:07,260
But like, maybe it's easier for the game to render it like that.

1811
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:13,420
I'll say that the game the map had trouble displaying like when I did my

1812
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:18,140
little experiment, like see how fast I could go, see how far outside this whole system I could get.

1813
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:22,940
When I looked at the map, like, yeah, all the the names and indicators were fucked up.

1814
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:27,660
Everything else looked normal, except that the twins were like not positioned correctly.

1815
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,500
They sort of were like on top of each other.

1816
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:34,940
And I just kind of thought that was like a glitch in the display.

1817
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:39,900
Maybe the game actually thought that like it was like fucking up in the way it was trying to

1818
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:45,820
position them around there, you know, shared, what do you call it, center of gravity.

1819
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:52,700
But interesting thing that happened when I did that when I flew outside the solar system,

1820
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:56,860
you know, obviously I was too far away for the supernova to get me.

1821
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:04,300
So instead of dying, it was the same thing that happened in when I when I left the core in

1822
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:10,220
the the project. But the supernova happened. I didn't die.

1823
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:14,540
Instead, they're like a know my etching sort of appeared over my my vision.

1824
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:19,580
And like, I just got time traveled back in time instead of instead of dying and going back.

1825
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:22,460
Time travel. So like

1826
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:28,940
when yeah, like when when the supernova kills you, it's like flashes.

1827
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:32,060
It's like the screen goes white and then you die and then you go.

1828
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:38,540
Yeah, I guess it's not actually tied to your death. It's just tied to the Ash Twin project.

1829
01:44:38,540 --> 01:44:47,100
Yeah. Yeah, that's what that's right. It's like, if you die, that's just a the time travel happens

1830
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:51,660
whether you die or not. So if you die, it's just like, well, okay, you don't remember anything

1831
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:57,180
that happens after that. But then you get because you did. Yeah. But if you survive and you if you

1832
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:01,900
survive until the time travel happens, and you don't die, then you see this weird like

1833
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:09,100
patchwork, a rectangular like thing sort of etch over your vision and then you travel back

1834
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:14,220
and you still see the, you know, the mask and all your recorded memories and stuff.

1835
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:17,100
So so what is implied to have happened then you didn't die.

1836
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:25,180
But you just send back in time. So your memory is ripped out of your future self.

1837
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:29,980
Yeah, I think into your past self. Yeah. Or is it or is it that

1838
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:38,620
like hypothetically of this version of yourself is now alive and you're not playing them as them

1839
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:43,660
anymore. You're now playing continually as the person with the memories. Oh, like,

1840
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:50,220
like did you leave your that your that's like your other self in like an alternate timeline.

1841
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:55,980
And that that person's memories were just copied into a new version of you in a new timeline.

1842
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:01,340
I guess I don't like thinking of it as timelines because it's not technically

1843
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:06,460
a timeline. It's not a different timeline. It's the same one. It's a stable loop with

1844
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:12,540
yeah, it's a state. It's a mostly stable loop, a pseudo stable loop. It's unstable because the

1845
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:19,340
memories like cause differences. Yeah, I don't know. I think

1846
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:26,860
like do you because if I don't think it's just the memories I think it's just the

1847
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:31,100
memories that go back in time as information. Yeah, I think it's just that the player the player

1848
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:39,340
like is playing out a wilds. If you escape your memories that you have are sent back in time,

1849
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:45,500
you know, but presumably you still exist in the future having not died. I think so.

1850
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:51,340
I think so. And I didn't do this, but I read that if you take the warp core out of the Ash

1851
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:58,140
Twin project and then you try to escape the solar system, you get a slightly different ending

1852
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:03,660
where it says like you drifted forever until your your your fuel ran out and you died basically.

1853
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,300
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

1854
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:12,700
Because I mean you can't you can't go far enough to reach another star system in your

1855
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:20,060
stupid little ship. Yeah, in tiny little shack ship. I guess that's the ultimate fate of the

1856
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:25,580
the version of you that escapes the supernova is that you die eventually. Although and and

1857
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:31,500
eventually your memories that are sent back come to you and you wake up again. Although

1858
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:40,300
I do all the if if you had like, instead of 22 minutes, if you had like several hours or days,

1859
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:45,660
you definitely could reach relativistic speeds and then who knows what would happen some some weird

1860
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:51,740
maybe you could reach another star system with time dilation that way. I don't know.

1861
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:57,340
I think ultimately though like your character is not immortal, so they will die of old age

1862
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:03,500
even if they find another star system. Yeah. And then the the memory of you know, you'll wake up

1863
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:09,340
back at the thing. Well, well, they'd only have the memory. They don't have the memory from before

1864
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:14,300
only that 22 minute period that gets sent back. So so maybe when the thing is like blacking out,

1865
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:18,780
it's like, it's just because the memory that you're having when you wake up does not involve

1866
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:24,140
anything past this point. That makes sense. So even if you had memories and you had experiences

1867
01:48:24,140 --> 01:48:28,780
and you'll survive for a very long time and then eventually died, none of those memories get sent

1868
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:35,820
back. You only remember when the solace of the supernova happened. I think that's I think that's

1869
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:46,620
reasonable. God, so fucking good. I love it so much. So it's so it's so gratifying that you can

1870
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:52,380
think about how this works and it's it's not and it makes sense and it's internally consistent

1871
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:57,260
and you can be like, oh, yeah, yeah, I guess I guess I guess they thought of that. You know,

1872
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:04,780
like, yeah, no, there is an explanation for that. Like, yeah. It's a very it's a very well considered

1873
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:14,220
time travel story. Yeah, it's it's very cathartic when you think about it. And it's like, you're not

1874
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:20,220
you're not like, you know, shushed for thinking too much. Like, oh, don't don't worry about it.

1875
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:23,980
It's just time travel. Who cares? It's just for fun. Like, no, you can't think about it. This is

1876
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:30,460
not for fun. This is serious. This is serious cerebral thoughts I'm having. And I'm enjoying it.

1877
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:35,340
And I'm rewarded because it's it's it's logical. It's consistent. It's great.

1878
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:43,420
Yeah, I think there were times when I probably did see with a ascending stone or whatever they're

1879
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:49,820
called, I probably did see the inside of the Ash Twin project. And it's just like, I think you said

1880
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:54,860
before, because like, what am I even looking at? Like, it's completely dark, except for the glowing

1881
01:49:54,860 --> 01:50:01,100
masks on the wall. And it's very scary. And what looks like stars swirling around, which is actually

1882
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:06,460
just the timber hearth stone. But you don't know that at the time. I think I probably did see it.

1883
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:15,420
And I just was like, it's just some spooky nonsense. Fuck it. Oh, you know what I could try

1884
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:22,540
is going to Ash Twin, putting a probe there or like turning the gravity off or something

1885
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:27,020
so that it looks different and then going somewhere else and using the scrang slab to like

1886
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:31,180
see what it looks like and see if it's like a live feed or if it's like a memory, because I don't

1887
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:35,900
actually know. I think it would be a live feed. I would expect that, yeah, it would it would show

1888
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:41,260
you the the change state. And you could probably look up and see if you had taken the warp core

1889
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:47,740
out, you could probably look up and see that there's no warp core. Like what if what if you did

1890
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:52,460
like the thing you did where you jump in the black hole and you're in Ash Twin, and then you're

1891
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:56,780
playing the game, and then you go find an Ash Twin slab and then you look at that and then you can

1892
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:04,220
see yourself. I think you already there. I also think I think that the next time you die after

1893
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:10,380
that, I don't think you actually have to meet yourself to have the like break the fabric of

1894
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:15,500
reality. I think just the next time you die, the fabric of reality would break whether you go and

1895
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:21,340
like find your alternate self or not. I suspect, I don't know. Because I mean, when you check the

1896
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:28,540
map, you can see. Yeah, it was so funny. I was, I thought it was just glitching. I thought just

1897
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:34,620
like, ah, the game, the game didn't account for me going through that hole. It thinks it has,

1898
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:39,100
it has failed to update itself to reflect the fact that I'm no longer in the Ash Twin and now it

1899
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:45,020
thinks that I'm in two places at once. Haha. Haha, I fooled you game. Haha. Oh no, the game fooled me.

1900
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:47,100
No, it knew. It knew what I was going to do.

1901
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:57,980
Ah, brilliant. What a fucking game. Yeah. This has been, this is now like the third episode in a

1902
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:04,300
row we've been talking about, Outer Wilds. Yeah, but that's good. Definitely deserves it. Yeah.

1903
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:15,500
I was honestly, a part of me was like, I should wait for a sale to buy the DLC,

1904
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:23,900
but I didn't. I was like, nah, fuck it. Wait, waiting for sales is something I used to do,

1905
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:28,220
but like it never happens. It's just sort of like, yeah, months and months go by and I'm like,

1906
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:33,820
I could be enjoying a video game right now. I'm not. I want to save like 17 pounds. It's like,

1907
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:38,460
who cares? Did I mention on the show, like when you told me about it and I checked,

1908
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:42,300
it just so happened to be on sale and I was like, well, shit, I got to buy it right now then.

1909
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:47,740
I was very lucky. Very lucky. It was like 40% off or something. I saved like 10 bucks.

1910
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:55,900
I guess I got to buy it. Yeah. It's probably not on sale anymore, unfortunately.

1911
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:06,380
But it is for sale. True. I think the DLC was like 15 bucks, which is like, I don't know,

1912
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:12,860
whatever. The devs deserve it anyway. Even if the DLC was just like nothing.

1913
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:19,180
They can have that 15, but they deserve it. Well, I think we should stop talking about it,

1914
01:53:19,180 --> 01:53:23,980
just in case somebody actually honored the request to not be spoiled for this game and

1915
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:28,780
didn't listen to the entirety of the episode. I would feel bad for that person because they would

1916
01:53:28,780 --> 01:53:33,740
not get particularly much out of it. That's like most of this episode they're going to have to

1917
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:41,100
skip, unfortunately. I mean, whatever. Fuck it. No, no, no. Well, they should

1918
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:47,820
just go play out or wild and then they can come back and listen to all that and then

1919
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:52,780
it'll be even better. That's their reward for playing amazing video games. They get to listen

1920
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:59,180
to the procrastinators podcast. I'm happy for them. I really am.

1921
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:05,980
Yeah. The only thing else I have on my notes is the UK is fucked.

1922
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:11,660
The UK is fucked. I mean, obviously, but how so this week?

1923
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:20,300
Well, this trust was doing a lot of stupid shit. That guy you told me about got fired.

1924
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:23,980
Yes, he's no longer the chancellor. Nihwaj something?

1925
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:31,340
quasi-quarting. Yeah, I'm sure. Same.

1926
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:38,140
So Liz Truss had a terrible budget plan that she had in lockstep.

1927
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:46,700
She's the new prime minister? Yes, she's the new prime minister. She was voted for by a few

1928
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:54,540
Tory MPs to replace Boris Johnson, who was, you know, he stepped down because people were

1929
01:54:54,540 --> 01:55:02,140
saying you're a you're a you're a blagger. You're a bastard. You drank and had a COVID party

1930
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:08,380
during lockdown. You fuck. Is that really why? It's mostly why, I think. It's just sort of like

1931
01:55:08,380 --> 01:55:15,180
bad PR and it's, I mean, whatever. There's so many worse things. So many worse things.

1932
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:23,980
It's a little hard to understand. But I mean, lots of people hated Boris Johnson at the time.

1933
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:28,860
But I think they would love him to come back because Liz Truss is so much dumber than he is.

1934
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:38,140
But she had a shitty budget, which lowered taxes for the rich and

1935
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:46,700
essentially just sort of like made the the economy like the whole people of all of the

1936
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:53,340
economy people were like that's stupid. I love the economy. Like that was just a very badly

1937
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:57,500
planned thing. She didn't know what she was doing. How long has she been in charge?

1938
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:03,820
Like six weeks. Oh, five weeks. It's not. It's not that long. Okay.

1939
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:10,620
I know this. I'm remembering that one guy who like got really mad at me for like

1940
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:13,980
badly explaining British politics. So I'm sorry. Was that a voicemailer?

1941
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:20,860
I think it was a voicemailer. The point is the budget was bad. And she stood by it until

1942
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:27,340
she finally got the message and said, okay, I understand that it's bad. I'm going to change it.

1943
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:31,820
And but I'm still I'm still going to work with my chancellor because he's smart and

1944
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:37,900
I still trust him. Is that quasi? No, I yeah quasi. Oh, actually, I want to I'm going to throw

1945
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:43,900
him under the bus and I want to still stay prime minister even though I'm so bad at my job and

1946
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:53,180
nobody trusts me and I have no like, what's the word? No swag. No swag. She doesn't have any

1947
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:59,820
government squad swag. And so she's got a new chancellor and it's Jeremy Hunt.

1948
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:05,820
I can't I can't possibly be his name. It's Jeremy Hunt. But okay, everyone calls him Jeremy

1949
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:13,260
Hunt because he is a real piece of work made it too easy. Yeah. Yeah. He was the the

1950
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:22,300
health secretary for a while. And he's like, as far as I understand, most famous for being

1951
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:28,540
really heavy on cuts for things that people need like the NHS. Nice. And, and, you know,

1952
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:33,900
social programs and stuff that helps the poor. Good. He loves cutting funding for all that.

1953
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:38,300
Well, he loves. Cool. All right. He's the man for the job. He loves selling off

1954
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:43,500
things like the NHS to the highest bidder. And who doesn't, you know,

1955
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:49,100
he's a relatable. I can have a beer with a guy that loves selling the NHS to private interests.

1956
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:54,620
So now he's in charge of the economy or the, you know, the chancellor, the ex-checker or whatever

1957
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:59,660
that actually means he's going to come up with a new budget. And predictably, he's being like,

1958
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:07,340
yes, in order to pay for things, we're going to raise taxes, hopefully on the rich, but I

1959
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:11,340
he hasn't specified yet. So I don't think it's going to be the rich. I think it's going to be

1960
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:16,700
middle and low income people are going to have to have taxes raised because of course, but you

1961
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:21,180
know, hasn't actually happened yet. Excellent. Excellent. And he's saying he's probably going

1962
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:26,140
to be lots of cuts. And I'm expecting them to be cuts to things that people need to live,

1963
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:32,860
such as the NHS, because he just loves hating the poor, because he's a, you know, he's Jeremy Cunt.

1964
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:39,740
Understandable. So like before, Liz Truss was saying, we're going to lower taxes.

1965
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:47,340
And we're not going to cut anything. And we're somehow going to pay people's energy bills because

1966
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:52,540
of the rising gas prices, which is like stupid, because the question then becomes if you're not

1967
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:58,380
raising taxes, and you're not cutting spending, how are you going to increase spending on these

1968
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:02,300
things? Where's the money coming from? And she didn't have an answer for that. And eventually,

1969
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:08,780
she's like, okay, Jeremy Hunt is going to cut everything and raise taxes.

1970
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:14,140
Okay, it's like, okay, well, I guess it makes sense now. That's better than like,

1971
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:18,540
not having an answer for how you're going to pay for stuff. But it's Jeremy Hunt. And

1972
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:25,820
it's just going to be bad. I don't trust him at all. I mean, it sounds like he has vowed to do

1973
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:35,580
bad things. I just based on past experience of things that he's, you know, obviously for. I mean,

1974
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:42,460
he's a Tory. So he's like pro rich, pro rich anti poor, like generally speaking,

1975
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,860
they'll always lie and say, we're doing this for the good of the country. What they mean

1976
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:51,820
is for the good of themselves. Because if the country's rich and the rich are rich in the country,

1977
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:56,300
then he can be part of the rich in the rich country. Regardless of how many people in the

1978
01:59:56,300 --> 02:00:02,220
poorer brackets are dead or dying or living in poverty or just having a bad time. And that's

1979
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:07,740
just sort of like the Tory way generally. Right. And what's the problem? So the problem is I don't

1980
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:11,340
like it. And I want to fuck an election. Well, have you tried not being such a snowflake?

1981
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:19,580
I melted. Thanks. Yeah. Climate change. Well, looks like it was like everyone got what they

1982
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:25,100
wanted then. Yeah, that was just sort of a little rant. I didn't really have anything special to

1983
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:31,740
say. I just, you know, I think we got a voicemail about this, but I might as well mention it.

1984
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:41,100
How do you feel about the soup on the Van Gogh? Soup on Van Gogh. Oh. Yeah. I mean, whatever.

1985
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:47,100
Yeah. I don't care about that painting particularly. It's old. Vincent Van Gogh was pretty cool. Yeah.

1986
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:54,140
Made some good stuff. But like, I don't hate them because they're trying to raise climate

1987
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:59,340
activism. Yeah. It is just sort of annoying that the majority of the response is like,

1988
02:00:59,980 --> 02:01:05,260
God, these fucking stupid bitches. I hate the environment now. Like, I don't know. Yeah,

1989
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:10,380
I don't like that. I don't like the petulant. Like, this makes me want to burn even more fossil fuels.

1990
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:18,700
Like, shut up. No, it doesn't. I'm a little on the fence about whether I think like

1991
02:01:19,580 --> 02:01:30,220
it's good to... Part of me is like, well, they got people talking. Well, they raised awareness.

1992
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:36,300
Uh, another part of me is like, yeah, but like to one end, like, does that accomplish anything?

1993
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:41,180
Will anything be accomplished by raising awareness? Are we just perpetually locked in the cycle of

1994
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:46,060
like, raise awareness for issues that everyone already knows about and it doesn't really do

1995
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:51,980
anything? So is there really a point to it? I guess I think that the destruction of art is

1996
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:58,380
generally bad. Although I understand that like, you know, if climate change destroys the world,

1997
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:03,500
then like, art will have no value to anyone. So like, yeah, there are definitely more important

1998
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:09,100
things. There are definitely... The climate is more important than Van Gogh's sunflowers. Sure.

1999
02:02:10,140 --> 02:02:14,620
But if destroying Van Gogh's sunflowers doesn't accomplish anything meaningful in pursuit of

2000
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:19,180
climate change, then maybe it's not worth doing. So I kind of see both sides on that. What really

2001
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:23,100
fucking gets me, though, is the fact that the painting is literally fine and nothing happened.

2002
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:27,020
And there's literally nothing to be mad about. So when I see people getting upset about it,

2003
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:32,780
I like, cannot understand. Like, what is even bothering you about this, sir?

2004
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:39,340
It feels more like a minor Twitter drama moment than it does, like,

2005
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:47,820
anything really significant. Yeah. I mean, it's totally just a thing that a certain kind of

2006
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:55,980
person can point to and be like, ah, kids these days are doing this. Ah, society has inverted.

2007
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:05,740
Remember that? Remember that line? I don't. What was that from? It was from the old

2008
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:09,980
Digi Bro asterisk war. Society has inverted.

2009
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:19,420
Because asterisk war is set in a place called Invertia, where people's morals have inverted,

2010
02:03:19,420 --> 02:03:27,740
or something. What a stupid fucking conceit for a setting. I don't know. Something,

2011
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:31,740
I'm thinking about it. And I'm like, damn, if I understood correctly, because obviously I never

2012
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:36,860
watched the show, just from that video, having it explained to me in as brief a time as possible,

2013
02:03:36,860 --> 02:03:43,740
it sounds like the setting of the asterisk war is literally just like society has generated.

2014
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:49,500
These days, everything is fucked up and people suck. Not like the good old days.

2015
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:57,340
But it's like text, like explicit text. Society has inverted. Morality has been turned on its head.

2016
02:03:57,340 --> 02:04:02,700
Evil is good now. This is all completely aside from the point I was trying to make,

2017
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:09,180
which is that vandalism is good and artifacts should all be destroyed all the time.

2018
02:04:10,460 --> 02:04:17,980
I saw like one take that was like particularly annoying, which was somebody who was just sort of

2019
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:22,860
not really saying anything, but pointing out that I don't think they realized that van Gogh

2020
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:28,620
was like a working class, like low class artist, and he struggled. And it's like,

2021
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:35,900
yeah, but he's dead. And this painting is worth a lot of money. I don't think he cares that somebody

2022
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:40,780
threw soup on it. I don't know what they're trying to get at. They're just trying to appeal to like,

2023
02:04:40,780 --> 02:04:45,900
oh, but you can't hurt that guy's art. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

2024
02:04:46,620 --> 02:04:53,100
He was a struggling artist, and you know, that's bad. You should be hurting like rich people art,

2025
02:04:54,380 --> 02:05:01,980
I guess. Like destroy a dolly because dolly was famous? Like whatever. Who cares? It's just a

2026
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:06,300
painting. It currently exists physically in the world. Yeah, I agree. That's a stupid fucking

2027
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:13,260
point. I mean, I've seen the opposite point, which is that like, you know, van Gogh was kind of like

2028
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:18,940
a freak and a weirdo and engaged in all kind of like, what do you call it,

2029
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:26,300
histrionic destructive behavior. So like, just just trashing some valuable shit,

2030
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:30,460
just for no reason is kind of exactly what van Gogh would have done if he was alive.

2031
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:37,820
Perhaps. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It's just sort of like, besides the point, like it's a very

2032
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:44,300
valuable piece of artwork. Yeah. And the idea of a valuable something or other being destroyed

2033
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:52,300
is like, makes people mad. And I don't think the climate message got through in a way

2034
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:57,420
to people who wouldn't already agree. I guess they're trying to push the envelope,

2035
02:05:57,420 --> 02:06:02,780
but I don't know what the idea of the point is. I've seen some... It's just sort of like,

2036
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:08,860
outrageous for the outrageous sake. Yeah, it is. That's why like, I'm not really convinced it

2037
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:17,660
was super helpful. I've seen some claims that like, the org that set it up is actually like,

2038
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:22,860
funded by oil and it might be some kind of like, deliberate op to like, make climate activism

2039
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:31,580
look bad. I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't put it past oil companies to try and do that. Maybe.

2040
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:36,220
But how could they get, how could they get a woman with pink hair and pronouns to do it?

2041
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:45,100
It's impossible. It's impossible. Yeah, I don't know. No, there was something about like,

2042
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:51,340
that or something about like, that org that made those shirts that they were wearing is actually

2043
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:58,380
like, funded by oil or something. So it's like, what's what's the motivation here? What's the

2044
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:06,060
underlying point? And nobody knows. Like, climate activists look bad. Maybe. But the, and then

2045
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:12,140
like, either way, I don't know. Question mark, question mark, question mark profit. Yeah, like,

2046
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:18,620
will people like, purchase more unrecyclable plastics because of, because they're mad at

2047
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:23,260
these two girls? Is to make pundits on Twitter go, this just makes me want to burn more oil,

2048
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:28,220
and then everyone starts burning more oil. What if that was the point? They just buy

2049
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:32,940
a barrel of oil and then don't burn in the backyard. Take a picture of it, film it like,

2050
02:07:33,740 --> 02:07:39,180
fuck you climate activists. Like that picture of Ben Shapiro outside of the Home Depot with

2051
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:44,060
like the one piece of wood. But it's like, Hey, look at me. I bought a barrel of oil.

2052
02:07:46,940 --> 02:07:54,060
I'm going to slather it all over my body. Take the oil challenge. Speaking of oil,

2053
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:57,820
wait a minute. Speaking of oil, oil challenge would be a real thing.

2054
02:07:59,420 --> 02:08:03,980
In this, in this day and age, waste as much oil as you can. Speaking of oil, somebody,

2055
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:09,820
I think somebody threw out my bacon grease. I was saving my bacon grease. And I think someone,

2056
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:17,580
just someone thought it was icky. I don't know. Maybe I can't find it. You know, I had a little

2057
02:08:17,580 --> 02:08:23,660
jar had a little glass jar. I cooked a whole over the few days, like I had some bacon that was like

2058
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:28,460
nearing its expiration date. So I cooked it all and I ate it all over the course of you. And I

2059
02:08:28,460 --> 02:08:33,580
saved all the grease. I preserved it in a little jar. And now I can't and today I looked and I

2060
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:44,380
can't find the jar. Maybe someone else ate it. Maybe they spread it on toast like a butter.

2061
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:48,460
You know what? If someone else used it, I wouldn't even be that mad. But if someone just like got

2062
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:53,580
rid of it, I would be very mad because like, obviously I put it in a jar and saved it.

2063
02:08:54,860 --> 02:09:01,260
Like what the fuck? Maybe they thought it was cum. Yeah, that would explain it.

2064
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:09,660
I don't want that shit in my fucking house. Why does this guy's cum smell like bacon? Hmm. Oh well.

2065
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:19,500
I can't find the jar. If I found the jar and it were empty, I would know like someone sabotaged

2066
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:27,900
my grease. But until I find the jar, I'll just consider it a mystery and like maybe I misplaced it.

2067
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:32,860
I think I remember where I put it. I think I know where I put it.

2068
02:09:33,740 --> 02:09:38,700
It's like someone's fucking with my stuff. Someone's fucking with the stuff in my fridge,

2069
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:44,940
man. What the hell? I don't like it. You gotta label it. You gotta put a little tracking device on

2070
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:52,060
it. I might be a couple days out from the power getting shut off at my house. I'm not sure about

2071
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:59,180
that. Why is the power getting shut off? Well, because that girl, she was paying the power bill

2072
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:06,860
and I think she canceled her account and I'm not, I don't want to do it. I don't want to take over.

2073
02:10:06,860 --> 02:10:11,900
So like somebody's got to do it, but like nobody has. And so like I'm not sure if like

2074
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:16,940
there's a time limit on like when are they gonna, if nobody does it, are they just gonna

2075
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:20,940
shut the power off at my house? It would be pretty funny if that happens.

2076
02:10:21,980 --> 02:10:26,780
Get some candles. Make sure to save your projects immediately, like every five seconds.

2077
02:10:26,780 --> 02:10:36,460
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, in theory, it would be a solvable problem. I don't know. I'm not sure.

2078
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:41,340
Okay. On the one hand, I kind of don't want to be responsible for it. On the other hand,

2079
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:50,300
maybe I should be responsible for it because maybe I could generate a credit card, a cashback.

2080
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:56,940
Hmm. So maybe I actually, maybe I actually should volunteer to take over everything.

2081
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:04,140
Hmm. Currency. Hmm. Money. Did I mention that I got those bonds? Did I mention that I got the

2082
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:13,340
treasury bonds? Oh, you got them? I did. Yes. You know, they said it could take up to 12 weeks

2083
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:18,860
for them to approve my account. Fortunately, it did not take 12 weeks. It only took a few weeks.

2084
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:26,780
And I was able to, yes, I have the bonds. I'm gonna get that interest for the

2085
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:36,460
July, June to October period of 2022. And then next year, and then next year, I can buy even more

2086
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:41,340
and get even more interest. And I hope the interest and I hope the inflation rate stays high so that

2087
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:49,580
my eyeballs continue to accrue. Hell yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

2088
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:57,820
And standing ovation. Yeah. The government didn't screw me over this time. So good for them.

2089
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:09,260
Hooray. Hooray. And yeah, okay. Other than complaining about my bills and my bacon,

2090
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:14,380
grease, I guess I don't really have anything else. Did anything else happen this week? No, not really.

2091
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:17,820
Really, really close to being done with my stupid video.

2092
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:25,820
I showed, I showed my patrons in my patron, in the secret patron channel of my Discord server.

2093
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:32,460
I showed them some little funny animated bits that I made for the in for like the very beginning

2094
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:38,380
and the very end. And they seem to find it amusing. And I'm pretty proud of how they turned out. I

2095
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:44,860
think they look good. So I'm excited. I'll be excited to post that. Nice. And you know when I

2096
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:50,300
post it, I'm going to message Mary and I'm going to say, Hey, Mary, you, you encouraged me to make

2097
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:57,100
another video. And I made this and I appreciate the encouragement. So I'll let him know that he had

2098
02:12:57,100 --> 02:13:05,260
a hand in it. And I hope he is pleased. Did I mention that like kind of the reason why I made

2099
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:10,540
the video was because Mary asked me like, why don't you make videos? I think you did mention it.

2100
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:17,900
Okay, okay, okay. Well, I won't re explain it. But that was like, was like months ago at this point

2101
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:26,140
now. Yeah, he might he might be he might be shocked to if I tell him that like, yeah, that thing you

2102
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:35,980
said to me like seven months ago, I did it. Lamal. Hmm. Well, yeah, that's all I got. You want to go to

2103
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:49,580
voicemails? Yes. Okay. Well, the first voicemail that I see is called this channel is trash and

2104
02:13:49,660 --> 02:13:56,460
you're lucky it's so big. It might be empty. It might be one of those empty voicemails.

2105
02:13:56,460 --> 02:14:03,340
It's just a sound. It's just a sound. Okay, never mind. Okay, the next one is called it's true three,

2106
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:13,020
two, one, go. It's the same guy. I think he's doing like a bunch of nothing.

2107
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:18,460
This is just a way is the point to waste our time on purpose. Yeah, the next one and the

2108
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:24,300
next one after that, they're probably the same. Yeah, next one's called for real, though. What?

2109
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:36,700
He said something. I don't care. He said for real, though, I think under his breath. Okay,

2110
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:39,580
next one is called I'm not lying three, two, one, go.

2111
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:51,020
What's the point? What's the point? I think a lot of these are the same guys just.

2112
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:59,100
Yeah, next one is called call of three, two, one, go. We've taken the lead.

2113
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:09,820
No, no, no, that's enough. That's enough. Next one's called my favorite PCP member is did you bro?

2114
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:16,540
Okay. Then the new cod sucks. I'm disappointed in activities. Okay. The next one is called where

2115
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:22,060
is Tom? This has got to be another. No, there's nothing. Hey, Ben new fan here. I hope we can

2116
02:15:22,060 --> 02:15:28,300
meet this Nate guy one day. Okay, he sounds really cool unlike you. Yeah, true. They should

2117
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:34,460
make a death stranding to okay. PCP speak pipe is not a message board. Could this be a real one?

2118
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:42,220
No, I really don't think so. I think it's still him. Next one's empty, empty, empty.

2119
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:47,580
Next one's called art. Could this be real? Do you think this one's real or no?

2120
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:56,540
Could be 35 seconds. Okay, three, two, one, go. What's the point to try to classify what

2121
02:15:56,540 --> 02:16:00,060
is an artist art? It feels like it's just a prestige thing how they're trying to get it for

2122
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:06,460
yourself or deny it from others. Please respect me. Video games are art. Oh, that guy with his AI

2123
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:12,620
generated images. That's not odd. What are you stupid? Like to some extent, every category and

2124
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:16,780
word like this is arbitrary, but this feels way more arbitrary than most. Even gender is more

2125
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:20,460
real than this, at least participating in someone's categories of gender has them treating you

2126
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,940
differently. I can buy what's art feels more like an ad hoc thing. After you've already decided how

2127
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:29,900
you want to treat something, you arbitrarily say that it is or isn't art to back that behavior up.

2128
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:38,140
I wouldn't even say that's incorrect, because if I hate something,

2129
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:44,380
when somebody says, yeah, but it's art, though, I would just say I don't care. I hate it.

2130
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:51,020
I think sometimes it is sort of a prestige thing. If you like something, you want to call it art

2131
02:16:51,020 --> 02:17:02,060
because it sounds good, but something can be art, but still be bad. I do feel like that's a pitfall.

2132
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:08,620
I genuinely don't use the word unless it's one of these conversations about what is art. I only

2133
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:13,340
think about whether something is good and literally what it is. Oh, it's a painting.

2134
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:19,740
If it's a painting, it's a painting because it's got paint and you use paint to make it.

2135
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:28,300
At the end of the day, art or not, it's a very vague way of saying whether you like or respect

2136
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:35,020
or whatever you personally feel the word art connotates. Because people feel slightly different

2137
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:40,780
or vastly different things to it, it's just a conversation like deadlock and it's annoying,

2138
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:50,060
and I don't like using it. At the end of the day, it is an arbitrary distinction. I generally think

2139
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:59,580
basically everything humans do is art. I think I have a pretty broad, I think it's better to be

2140
02:17:59,580 --> 02:18:10,700
broad with it than exclusive. With AI-generated art, it's art if you want it to be, but I don't

2141
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:16,940
like it because of what it represents for the people who are profiting from it. As a tool,

2142
02:18:16,940 --> 02:18:21,900
it's fine. The fact that you can do it is cool. I don't want to repeat the conversation we had

2143
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:32,460
the last week, but it's a tool and that's true. I think if you said is it art, I would say yes it

2144
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:40,300
is, but the talk about AI art and whether it's art, for me, it's not about though this isn't art,

2145
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:48,620
and I have to say that in order to disqualify it from being good. It's like, okay, well who

2146
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:58,300
deserves the credit for this is the pertinent question. Because credit in capitalist society

2147
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:06,620
involves payment generally, which is a necessary prerequisite for being alive.

2148
02:19:06,940 --> 02:19:14,540
Yeah, resource allocation. So credit is kind of important, and that's why it's such a big talking

2149
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:19,900
point whether or not something is art because we all want to live and it doesn't feel right when

2150
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:27,180
people who could be considered worthy of the credit, not getting the credit, and therefore having a

2151
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:35,020
more difficult life. I think that's why that particular thing keeps coming up. If people

2152
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:40,940
didn't have to worry about making ends meet, I don't think it would be quite as heated a

2153
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:48,220
discussion as it has become. Did you hear about the Bayonetta voice actress?

2154
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:58,300
I did. I didn't watch the video, but I heard she was paid like $4,000 for the entire game of the

2155
02:19:58,300 --> 02:20:03,100
third in a series of extremely popular games where she's the voice actress, which is like

2156
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:09,660
embarrassing. I don't know anything about the voice acting profession. I mean, that sounds pretty

2157
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:21,900
low. It's very low. Voice actors are frequently shit upon by the industry of any voice acting,

2158
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:30,140
whether it's for dubbing or video game stuff or usually that's the only two things, animation

2159
02:20:30,220 --> 02:20:37,100
or video games. I mean, for a well-known character, for the voice actor to reprise their role as a

2160
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:46,300
well-known character in a highly anticipated AAA video game, that just does seem like a silly low

2161
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:54,620
number. Maybe if there wasn't much voice acting in the game, it would be justified if there just

2162
02:20:55,340 --> 02:21:01,900
wasn't much of it. I think the reason was because Nintendo moved away from a union

2163
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:07,820
for voice acting talent so that they could afford, so they could be allowed to pay their

2164
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:12,940
voice actors so much less and the Bayonetta lady was like fuck that. It just seems like such a

2165
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:20,540
drop in the bucket to quibble over when it's like this is like the, in so far as a video game has

2166
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:25,740
a star like this is it like this is the star talent of the game basically and you're like

2167
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:33,980
why would you fuck with them? I don't know. I mean game companies and the workers get fucked over

2168
02:21:33,980 --> 02:21:38,860
a thousand dollars like an intent like platinum studios or whatever are you gonna fucking break

2169
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:46,060
the bank if you pay this person like 20,000 instead of 4,000 like what the fuck? What are you doing?

2170
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:55,340
Super bad. Super bad press. You have not saved yourself any grief by doing this. You fools.

2171
02:21:55,340 --> 02:22:03,900
Everybody loses. And it goes in like in contrast to like the way that the Mario movie has all

2172
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:11,820
of these super high profile celebrity voice actors instead of voice actors as like Chris Pratt is

2173
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:18,940
gonna be paid millions to do like a shit Mario. Yeah. And everyone's like okay whatever fucking

2174
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:24,380
but that's just that's how it works. If you're a celebrity you get big paycheck and if you're a

2175
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:38,620
professional you get shit because the unions are not as strong. Sad. Sad times. I mean I can only pray

2176
02:22:39,580 --> 02:22:47,580
to Allah that like his wrath will be visited upon the undeserving inshallah inshallah I pray that

2177
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:52,940
I pray that every did a triple A developer goes to hell no matter what that's all I can do.

2178
02:22:55,180 --> 02:23:02,140
True. Okay the next one is called I got a notification in the middle of this recording.

2179
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:03,820
Three, two, one, go.

2180
02:23:26,220 --> 02:23:28,700
You do that. Do you ever have your wisdom teeth out?

2181
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:33,980
Oh is that why he was talking? I didn't. Yeah he said he said he had his wisdom teeth out.

2182
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:43,340
No um my teeth are dumb so they stay. Oh lucky. I had mine out in high school and I looked

2183
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:50,540
really fucked up. I didn't they didn't hurt like they said like it might hurt for a while afterwards.

2184
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:56,620
I didn't find it very painful but my face was all swollen and looked like shit for like a full

2185
02:23:56,620 --> 02:24:04,780
week afterwards it was terrible. I had a date I had a date with like an an older girl that I had

2186
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:13,340
to crush on at the time and I had it happen and I had it while I was like fucking my face was all

2187
02:24:13,340 --> 02:24:24,780
fucked up. That's a nightmare. How'd it go? You know it wasn't like you know she wasn't like

2188
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:30,700
interested in me or anything. It was just like we were going to hang out so I don't think she cared

2189
02:24:30,700 --> 02:24:35,740
because to her it was like I'm just hanging out with this guy. For me I was like I have a huge

2190
02:24:35,740 --> 02:24:41,180
crush on you and I want to hang out with you and I god I wish my face wasn't fucked up but

2191
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:47,660
I mean it probably doesn't matter really. It wasn't like we were going to hook up if I had looked

2192
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:57,900
normal. Just an extra layer of humiliation. Wisdom teeth really turned me on. Do you have any?

2193
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:10,780
The next one is yeah thoughts on the Van Gogh incident. Three, two, one, go. Go. Three, two, one, Van

2194
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:21,580
Gogh. Hey art is cool right? Paintings Van Gogh. I wouldn't care if every single painting in the loo

2195
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:28,300
was scorched if it like accomplished something from the climate charts. Do people think that

2196
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:33,660
paintings will be around to be appreciated after mass extinction? Like priorities.

2197
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:41,020
Sorry, I mean Van Gogh would probably be on board with having his painting be vandalized.

2198
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:47,260
Yeah. I think we're on the same page with this guy. It's just a question of like

2199
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:55,100
is it effective? Yeah, was that the best way to do it? Did it work? I would have been like okay

2200
02:25:55,100 --> 02:26:03,100
saying yes try it and I don't know whether it would work but like you tried. I just don't know.

2201
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:13,740
Yeah. Okay, we've already been over that. Next one is hey Ben new fan here. Where's this video being

2202
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:18,140
uploaded to and how are you? Hey Ben, what's the channel this video will be uploaded on?

2203
02:26:18,140 --> 02:26:22,940
Hi Ben new fan here. What's the video and why are you making one? Ben, you're a good teacher.

2204
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:28,060
You should quit the PCP and be one. Happy birthday Ben. This one's 12 seconds long. Three, two, one,

2205
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:36,940
go. Oh no, nothing. Next one's part two. Three, two, one, go. Oh no, nothing. Okay.

2206
02:26:38,060 --> 02:26:44,140
And then there's a YouTube link which I will not check. So many nothing voicemails this time.

2207
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:48,140
For Halloween I'm going as Ben St. What does he look like? So Ben is your new video going to

2208
02:26:48,140 --> 02:26:53,260
be a lecture. Ben's weekly reminder. Play Delta Room Chapter Two. Ben's weekly reminder. Catch

2209
02:26:53,260 --> 02:27:01,740
up to one piece. Voice Jail Request. Three, two, one, go. Can you guys voice jail the actually

2210
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:12,700
carbon offsets NFT guy? Every voicemail they send is annoying. Humble request. Please accept.

2211
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:21,740
I appreciate the sentiment and inshallah he will get what's coming to him but I feel like at the

2212
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:28,460
very least his questions are asked in good faith and I have to appreciate that much. Yeah, I don't

2213
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:32,940
find him like malicious. He's just sort of like. I don't think he deserves voice jail.

2214
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:40,540
And but besides we've defunded the PC police so. That's true and thank goodness.

2215
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:51,580
All right, skip another fake one. Okay, we got an Imgur link. Oh boy, I love Imgur.

2216
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:57,020
Finally something. I love Imgur. Yeah, I love content.

2217
02:27:59,900 --> 02:28:05,660
Let's see here. Okay, it's more it's more video. Astronaut Ben St. or rather Ben's space.

2218
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:13,100
It's another VD. Drifting aimless drifting through space aimlessly. My only hope

2219
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:19,740
is not to collide with anything of greater momentum. I had some plan to stay adrift but

2220
02:28:19,740 --> 02:28:28,460
it's been so long I forget what it was for when I took lift off. I had an idea with doing math and

2221
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:33,820
sounding smart but then I got a bit funny a bit a funny bit in mind. That's what he says. I do

2222
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:38,620
have to keep in mind even if a small meteorite comes close to me that even if it doesn't collide

2223
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:45,900
my center of gravity may shift and throw off my trajectory. My Eunice mission. My mission will

2224
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:55,900
not end in failure. You have my word as an astronaut Ben St. I think that's Trixie on our

2225
02:28:55,900 --> 02:29:03,900
broomstick. Oh, hey Ben funny coming across you out here. Oh my fucking god Trixie space is my thing.

2226
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:10,300
This is illegal. You have to pay royalties to be in space.

2227
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:16,700
Uh you don't own space Ben. Oh no she's right. Who the fuck do you even think you are the mayor

2228
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:21,420
of space? Shut the fuck up Trixie shut the fuck up. You shut up Ben. I was actually applying

2229
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:29,820
myself with my college degree. College is fucking bullshit. You're out there doing jack shit.

2230
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:35,660
I literally did math to get out here and to where I'm going. I literally did math to be

2231
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:40,380
at lengtherspace. I did math to get here. Who are you? Who are you to criticize?

2232
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:45,420
You're literally going fucking nowhere. Why the fuck are you out here? I just got high as

2233
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:51,420
fuck weed as a hell of a thing dude. Get the fuck away from me Trixie leave me the fuck alone you

2234
02:29:51,420 --> 02:29:57,900
bitch. Whatever Ben I fucking do what I want. I'm just going to go get higher without you bitch.

2235
02:29:58,620 --> 02:30:06,620
Fucking bitch mother fucker. So true. Oh my god I've reached oh I see a finger.

2236
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:14,220
I see a finger on the side of that one. Oh race reveal. True. Ha ha I've made it the sun that last.

2237
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:23,820
The beautiful sun. Finally eternal warmth of my goddess.

2238
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:34,460
Yeah I'm not sure if we can I mean it's probably fine to put this on screen but it's a giant

2239
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:41,420
celestial but a posterior of celestia at the pony. I think we can put it on screen but we

2240
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:48,060
shouldn't link to it because this was flagged as mature content so I'm afraid to link it so no link

2241
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:56,380
but no link. I think we can show it what a lovely day to enjoy a book too. That's how I talk about it.

2242
02:30:57,340 --> 02:31:06,060
I love enjoying a book today. This might be my favorite of any content. Yeah this is great.

2243
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,100
This is tremendous.

2244
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:16,380
The beautiful sun.

2245
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:23,740
Oh god. You know what I feel like all the characters were

2246
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:30,940
were believably in voice. They all spoke in there in there just as they should have behaved

2247
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:38,140
and I just appreciate it so thank you for that. I like to imagine this is out to wilds

2248
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:43,180
and I'm just on the planet reading a book. I think that's while you're doing that. I think

2249
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:51,100
that's the the inspiration for this right. Yeah outer wild space exploration. Beautiful sun.

2250
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:58,460
Benny you're you're fucked. This is this is fucked. What the fuck is wrong with you twisted.

2251
02:31:59,660 --> 02:32:05,340
Keep posting. Does your wife know that you drew a big pony ass? What would what would she say huh?

2252
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:12,140
She would say draw a bigger draw the Luna draw Luna but next draw Luna orbiting.

2253
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:21,420
Next one is called unrelated. I love you guys. You had no reason to continue this three two one go.

2254
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:26,460
Pokemon go go.

2255
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:36,060
Okay Pokemon go.

2256
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:44,300
What is this next one poke community dot com show thread link.

2257
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:53,580
Okay. Let's let's let's let's find out poke community.

2258
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:57,020
Yeah. Is it loading for you? Oh there it goes.

2259
02:32:57,980 --> 02:32:59,660
Pokemon emerald studio.

2260
02:33:01,420 --> 02:33:08,380
A rogue like Pokemon game. Pokemon emerald rogue v one two one the questing updates.

2261
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:14,940
Ever wondered what Pokemon might look like as a rogue like yes it's a Nuzla right.

2262
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:20,460
When you go on an adventure all routes encounters and items we procedurally chosen

2263
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:25,260
based on your progress into a run. After a certain number of routes you will encounter

2264
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:29,580
a random gym leader who have a procedurally chosen team they're assigned type as you progress further

2265
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:36,860
into a that's neat. That's interesting. Huh. It's like Pokemon mystery dungeon but normal Pokemon.

2266
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:46,540
Wow. Kind of. The fact that you go into dungeons and it's a bus. Oh yeah. Yeah that's true.

2267
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:54,940
Hmm. That's pretty cool. I wonder if it's any good.

2268
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:04,620
It sure is Pokemon. I might I might I might look into this a little more. I'm kind of

2269
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:13,980
intrigued. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. Yeah. It's what is it called Pokemon emerald

2270
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:22,620
rogue. Rogue version one point two point one the questing update. Fascinating.

2271
02:34:25,580 --> 02:34:31,580
What do we got next one is called son it's son of Marowak three two one go. Oh wait wait

2272
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:35,340
a minute wait a minute wait a minute sorry there was a voicemail that went with that Pokemon one.

2273
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:43,180
We got to listen to it three two one go. Do you like Pokemon do you like vogue likes

2274
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:50,860
that you should play Pokemon emerald rogue it's pretty good. Okay that didn't add that much I'm sorry

2275
02:34:51,980 --> 02:34:55,580
sorry interrupted you son of Marowak okay son of Marowak three two one go.

2276
02:34:57,420 --> 02:35:01,180
So we're renting out a movie theater for my friend's birthday to play video games

2277
02:35:01,980 --> 02:35:08,940
given the chance and money not being an issue what would you guys want to play whether it be

2278
02:35:08,940 --> 02:35:16,220
games you want to play for your own reasons or any game you'd want to play with a crowd

2279
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:22,780
whether it be you playing for a crowd or you playing with a crowd what would be your ideal

2280
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:31,660
video gaming any theater experience. How do you how do you play like are you playing like on the

2281
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:39,740
movie screen. Yeah I mean I don't know if this is how Game Grumps Live works but they've done

2282
02:35:39,740 --> 02:35:48,540
shows they probably play a game in a theater and riff live with an audience. Oh hmm okay I'm going

2283
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:57,820
to assume you're just playing it on the movie screen yeah what would be a good game for that.

2284
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:05,180
I guess like if there's a crowd I'm trying to think of like what would be

2285
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:13,260
because you can't okay like it like with the twitch screen stream like the chat is like the

2286
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:19,260
crowd for simile is like it's basically the crowd but you can easily ignore it by not looking at

2287
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:24,620
what's being written but with a crowd they're speaking they're audible so like

2288
02:36:25,580 --> 02:36:32,380
I have something where you can hear them go whoa and cheer and stuff. You know what I think would

2289
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:39,980
be fun but only if the crowd knew how to play is like playing like something like Dungeon

2290
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:44,700
Crawlstone Soup in a theater and like the crowd if the crowd is like watching and sort of like

2291
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:52,540
yelling and sort of like shouting out like commands shouting out like no don't do that like.

2292
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:57,100
Yeah I think something that would be like make for a fun rowdy experience.

2293
02:36:57,900 --> 02:37:03,420
Something like that. No like backseat gaming but entire like like theater people doing it.

2294
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:09,900
Something that like people I mean if the crowd knew how Dungeon Crawlstone Soup works they could

2295
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:16,460
be like they could react to like if a new monster comes on screen or like you know if you choice

2296
02:37:16,460 --> 02:37:23,180
of class and stuff like that. If everyone was engaged in it I think that could be pretty fun.

2297
02:37:24,220 --> 02:37:28,140
So I mean if not that then maybe what would be another game that would be good in that way

2298
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:35,900
like something something turn based. Something turn based but maybe something that you can play

2299
02:37:35,900 --> 02:37:45,660
in like a single evening. I mean I guess if I think about it like anything that's an esport

2300
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:53,660
like a fighting game. A fighting game with two people is always going to be like oh cool I

2301
02:37:53,660 --> 02:38:02,300
hit him used the button but it's kind of normal. That's too fast for there to be like meaningful

2302
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:08,380
audience participation. Oh right you're thinking like that. I don't know what like I'm thinking

2303
02:38:08,380 --> 02:38:12,220
of it being a large theater if it was like a smaller one we could actually hear what people are saying.

2304
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:17,740
I'm assuming there will be a crowd of maybe like two dozen people or something like that.

2305
02:38:21,980 --> 02:38:29,580
You know it's hard to know. It is hard to know. Playing something like a walking simulator or

2306
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:32,700
something slow is an obviously bad thing because it's just going to be a lot of dead

2307
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:40,380
like nothing happening. Yeah. Something like Dark Souls where if you are good people would be like

2308
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:51,340
wow cool and if you suck people like oh boo sucks I guess. I'm sure something something that's not too

2309
02:38:51,340 --> 02:39:02,620
long turn based and there's like choices to be made. Something something that like audience can

2310
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:07,180
meaningfully like have input on like your strategy or whatever. I don't know I can't I don't know if

2311
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:12,700
I can think of anything like that off the top of my head. I'm sure something like that must exist.

2312
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:21,100
Shit. Fuck. Sonic Adventure.

2313
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:35,340
I'm I'm I'm drawing a blank. I don't know. Commenters leave a comment if you can if there's you can

2314
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:38,540
think of a game that meets those criteria because that sounds like it would be fun.

2315
02:39:39,340 --> 02:39:45,820
But I'm too dumb. The next one is called Son of Marowak promo three two one go.

2316
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:52,540
For anyone who might like to rent out a theater for playing games.

2317
02:39:53,420 --> 02:40:01,020
Cinemark is the theater chain that I will be renting for. The prices range from 200 to 350 dollars.

2318
02:40:01,980 --> 02:40:09,820
Why are you telling us this because it's a presumably good.

2319
02:40:11,180 --> 02:40:15,980
I mean all right. It's not that much money though.

2320
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:26,060
Well that was the last one. I think it's a reload. No no that is the last one.

2321
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:36,460
I just feel like I should come up with a game. Come up with a Minecraft.

2322
02:40:37,820 --> 02:40:46,300
Honestly Minecraft would be fun. I don't know. A lot of Minecraft's like moment to moment gameplay is

2323
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:54,700
chopping stuff and placing stuff and waiting for things to happen like smelting. It it would

2324
02:40:54,700 --> 02:41:03,340
be very boring because like yeah it's fun to like see a time lapse of somebody building some

2325
02:41:03,340 --> 02:41:10,780
amazing structure but like yeah I don't know about watching it. Speaking of which we should play

2326
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:18,140
Minecraft on stream. We should play Minecraft on stream. We should maybe I could do that this week.

2327
02:41:18,460 --> 02:41:26,060
It's worth a shot. It's worth a shot. Even though my new internet seems a little weird it might work.

2328
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:31,340
We got my Steam library.

2329
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:35,660
Mm.

2330
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:40,620
Cyclonials.

2331
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:52,620
Yeah visual novels definitely a bad idea. You know what game I think I want to.

2332
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:59,500
I think I want to try Inscription. Have you ever seen that one? I've seen a few GIFs. I've seen

2333
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:04,780
a few clips. I've heard a little bit about it and I've had it recommended to me enough that I feel

2334
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:13,180
like I should should give it a shot just to see. I've what I've heard is like confusing because

2335
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:17,180
people say oh I don't want to spoil you about inscription. Yeah and I look at it and it's a

2336
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:23,660
card game and I'm like okay so it's a card game with something that's hidden. It's about it because

2337
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:28,540
you don't want to tell me. I know that it's a card game but it's a card game that you're playing

2338
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:35,980
diegetically in a place and so I'm assuming that some stuff in the game happens in response

2339
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:42,380
to how you play the game. Like if it's like Jumanji you play the snake and then there's snakes in

2340
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:50,620
the room maybe. It looks like you're in a place and you have an opponent and the opponent is a

2341
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:57,580
character. Yeah that doesn't seem so wacky though. I don't know why people would like so like oh

2342
02:42:57,660 --> 02:43:02,860
I don't want to spoil you. It's so good. I don't get it. What on earth could it possibly be? It's

2343
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:07,020
a card game. Well I don't know but I've heard enough people have told it to me and I've looked

2344
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:12,940
at it and been like what's going on here that I think I'm like I should check it out because like

2345
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:19,900
I'm honestly I'm not I'm not drawn in by the promises like the vague promises of oh dude you've

2346
02:43:19,900 --> 02:43:26,700
got to try it but I can't tell you a dang thing about it. I'm like well I don't when I hear that

2347
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:36,540
enough eventually I get curious. What I do is I try to think what it could possibly be

2348
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:41,820
and I don't I I'm not impressing myself with my imagination so I'm not interested in actually

2349
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:50,300
playing it. I could be totally off base. I'm imagining some kind of like some kind of like

2350
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:56,700
portal style reveal where like it turns out that like instead of like continuing the test chambers

2351
02:43:56,700 --> 02:44:02,460
you have to like break out of the testing area and go into like you know some kind of secret

2352
02:44:02,460 --> 02:44:09,580
side room where you use what you learned in like a sort of subversive way. Yeah I just feel like

2353
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:17,180
that's pretty good. Like that's not going to blow my mind or anything. I think the thing that I

2354
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:24,220
think for me is that I don't like card games but they annoy me. So like saying it's a card game is

2355
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:30,140
not enough. I guess I'm neutral about card I neither like nor dislike card games so I'm

2356
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:36,940
that's kind of a wash for me. I think it's Hearthstone that made me hate card games just because

2357
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:43,260
the idea of having a deck and then pulling a new card out and it being not the card you need

2358
02:44:43,260 --> 02:44:47,980
it's just sort of like well fuck me then. Well how am I supposed to win? Well what turns me off

2359
02:44:47,980 --> 02:44:53,660
about like card games is that you have to like buy and assemble your deck but like yeah I don't

2360
02:44:53,660 --> 02:44:59,260
like that. That's the part that I hate but like inscription is like you know you have your cards

2361
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:05,260
the game gives them to you. So imagine if chess was a game like that we had to buy like booster

2362
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:13,180
packs of chess pieces until you had a full set. Yeah yeah it's ass it would be it would be ass is what

2363
02:45:13,180 --> 02:45:23,340
it would be. No I can't I can't I want to give it a shot. I don't know if I'll have time this week.

2364
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:33,180
Anything else? Wait how much is inscription? Let me find out. Let me find out real quick.

2365
02:45:33,980 --> 02:45:43,900
One billion rubles. That's right it is 20 dollars. Oh fuck. I can't oh you think I made a money?

2366
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:52,780
If it were on sale though. If it were on sale I would I would probably buy it immediately.

2367
02:45:53,580 --> 02:45:58,060
I want it. I just don't want to pay full pay full price for it. That's all that's all I'm saying.

2368
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:03,420
Um you have anything else you want to talk about before we wrap up for the day?

2369
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:12,140
Just want to reiterate the thing with the 29th of October at the place that I said where it's at

2370
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:22,060
the Bohemia in North Finchley. Check out that link the image for Parkinson's. Show it on screen.

2371
02:46:22,140 --> 02:46:27,900
Show it on screen again. It's the zone. It's my dad's band. It used to be called Dad Zone.

2372
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:35,420
It's changed its name. Was it named after your dad? No it was like it was they met at like my old

2373
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:41,260
school my old primary school. They were a bunch of dads and they were like hey we all play instruments

2374
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:48,220
let's form a band. Let's call it Dad Zone. Like Kid Zone but we're dads. Why did they change the

2375
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:53,820
name? I'm curious. Did they think it was just more appealing to a general audience if they didn't?

2376
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:58,860
I guess so. I don't know. I don't know the reasoning. Less alienating for non-dads.

2377
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:05,740
Yeah I mean whatever. I kind of liked Dad Zone but. Our music is by dads but it's not just for

2378
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:14,220
dads. It's for everyone. Yeah although it is a lot of dad rock. Sure. Yeah Dad Zone is more I mean

2379
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:20,780
it's funny. It makes me chuckle. Maybe that's the thing. It was too funny. It has to be very serious.

2380
02:47:21,340 --> 02:47:28,300
Very serious business. But yeah Saturday 29th of October if you can make it it's like 12 pounds

2381
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:34,140
donation to get in to the charity and you can just donate if you want to donate to the charity

2382
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:41,740
if you can't make it and that'll be great. What would you do if like a couple of PCP fans showed up?

2383
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:50,620
If they came up to me like after the show or something I'd say hi. The fact that they came all

2384
02:47:50,620 --> 02:47:56,940
the way over and like you know paid to get in. That would be nice. That would be that would be

2385
02:47:56,940 --> 02:48:07,420
remarkable. Sounds like a good time. I'm excited to hear how it goes. Yeah. Yeah well I got I got

2386
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:14,780
