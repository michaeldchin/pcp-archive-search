1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Jump down, jump down, and then say some fucking gay shit.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,140
I'm gay!

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast!

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,880
That's right everyone, you should be excited because this is a very special week, but first let's introduce everybody who's here today.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,840
It's me, of course, the best guy ever, King of the Castle, Lord of the Manor. We also have Ben.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,160
It's me, Ben Saint, of Patreon!

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Wow, wow, what a meme.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,080
Digibro!

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,960
Hey, what's up, buddy?

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
We've got Hippocrit.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
I wasn't prepared for saying anything.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,760
And we've got Jess Endlet G, also called Larry the Comic.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,600
And finally, Tom Oliver, the best one of the three.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,000
That's right, okay, so today is a very exciting day because what we're doing today is we're touching each other's dicks.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
We're putting them in our mouths. We're making a

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
spherical circle and we're just going all kinds of crazy because this is the great circle, Jerk!

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Yeah!

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,760
You see, you see viewers, as it happens, we're all the best and today we're gonna tell each other that over and over again.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,640
It's come to my attention that there has been far, far too little shilling of ourselves on this channel.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,440
It's become a big problem. The people need it, the people crave it, and so this is our response.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,960
I wouldn't say shilling. I would describe it as fluffing.

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,280
Well, you can shill yourself.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,840
I mean, you know, it's, you know, pick your turn, it's all good.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Let me fluff my ball here.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,840
I would describe it as campaigning.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Yeah, everyone's all about campaigning nowadays.

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,360
All the campaign trail.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,400
Suddenly, all of us, like, just spontaneously grew ties out of our shirts.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Yeah!

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,920
And I don't know if this is relevant at all,

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,040
but it does so happen that we are recording this on Guy Fawkes Day, the man who tried to blow up Parliament and upset that

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,720
establishment, and that's why you need to vote for Bernie Sanders.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Write him in on the fucking ballot.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm for that. I'm for writing in Bernie Sanders.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
And, you know, yeah, write in whoever.

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,840
Write in, write in this guy.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
Write in, and let G, write in me, write in anybody.

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
Okay, so let's, let's, what are we gonna do here?

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,840
We're gonna pick somebody and then talk about how they're the best.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Is that what we want to do?

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,560
The concept here is each of us is gonna take our hand and we're gonna just, you know, 45 degrees to the right.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Grab the next guy's dick.

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Jack, jack at it, jack at it, jack at it, jack.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay, so why don't we start?

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
I mean, I'm looking in, in the chat.

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
We got Ben is the first.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
So let's just all start with Jack.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
No, no, no, not me.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
Jack and a dick.

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Oh, I'm sorry, Ben. You're the top of the bill here.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,520
Jack and a dick.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,880
Um, here's, for friends, is what I like about Ben's work.

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,160
No!

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
It's, it's something Ben first.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
I can't take what's helpful.

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
Let's do Nate so he can shut up and he'll have to listen to us talk about him.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Uh, okay, I guess.

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
If you want.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Uh, who wants to talk about how cool Nate is?

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Oh god, this is gay.

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Right, that's the point.

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
It feels weird, right?

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I didn't know it'd be gay.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I think without a doubt.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
This is the most homoerotic one.

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Yeah.

67
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
This is the part where everyone's realizing.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
No one actually wants everyone to say where it's cool.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Okay, if you guys want to do me, I can take it.

70
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I've steeled myself.

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
All right.

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:53,520
If we actually were at Radcon, if we were to do the gay thing, I think what would happen is we would get our dicks out.

73
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Sex?

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,520
But we would be like, oh, I don't want to be the first guy to touch someone else's.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Well, yeah.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Even if you're not gay, that makes you the most gay of the group.

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Standing in a circle without dicks out, looking at each other like, oh.

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
All right, all right.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm going to be the man to grab the dick first.

80
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I volunteer as tribute.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Everyone, please praise me.

82
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Just heap my well-deserved praise upon me.

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Ben, I know you.

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I've known you for the longest.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,320
And I remember back when your art was not what it is now.

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
In fact, when we started TBAP some four years ago, perhaps now.

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Three or four years.

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
I think it was four years ago.

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I thought I think it was less than three.

90
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Or maybe just about three years ago.

91
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
It was the end of 2013.

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Right, okay.

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
So that's three years.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Three fucking years.

95
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
And your work was much less polished.

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Comparing the stuff that you were producing then to what you're doing now with the Vapors and the Champion.

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,920
It is incredible to me that someone could advance that much in the span of time.

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Yes.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,920
And I've always liked how you are not like me where I need the security of making a plan.

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I have my job because I don't trust myself to just go jump out and do something.

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
But you have never been like that.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
You always just go jump headfirst into things.

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
And I've always admired that.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
So there you go.

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
And you did it with your art.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
And you know, TBAP was a similar sort of venture.

107
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,720
It was your suggestion, even though we both contributed mostly equally.

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Yes.

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I'm sure I'm glad.

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Yes, wow.

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
That was very heartfelt, Nate.

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
And I appreciate that.

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't know what to say.

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I was really gay though.

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Real gay though.

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm just impressed with the way you can make like...

117
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm just impressed with Magda.

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
I like her. She's great.

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Magda's the best character design of all time.

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Her hair is so awesome.

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
I love everything about it.

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
It's the coolest thing.

123
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
And she's got a very distinct silhouette.

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
I am jealous in terms of art skill.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Because I've always wanted to make like a comic.

126
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Even a small one.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
And then you just like, I'm going to make one and you did it.

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
And you made a website.

129
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Over like six months I did it.

130
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I mean, yes.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
You had an idea and you just...

132
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It was good.

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
It's got a good style.

134
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Let's talk about the fact that Ben's area of expertise

135
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
is inherently more valid as art

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
than what most of us do,

137
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
which is YouTube and which is worthless

138
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
and should not exist.

139
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,320
I am the only real artist among us.

140
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Yeah.

141
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,320
I lend us an air of much needed credibility.

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You know, even aside from credibility,

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
it's good to just have diversity of any kind.

144
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Aside from just a bunch of video guys

145
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
who just make videos,

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
it's good to have it.

147
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, I like that because Ben's...

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I mean, Ben is kind of a video guy.

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
And I like that some of us

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
can do more than one thing, you know?

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Like, I basically don't do anything

152
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
other than videos and podcasts.

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
So it's cool that we have people around

154
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
who can simultaneously

155
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
can be in a video if need be

156
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
and can be good in a video if need be,

157
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
but also have like a whole different thing,

158
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
which Ben and Tom both...

159
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
You did just produce an album.

160
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I don't want to get to the circle jerk of

161
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Digit too hard right now, but I'm just...

162
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
We'll bring that up.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
We'll touch on that.

164
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I just several times stroke on it.

165
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I respect the fact that Ben

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
is of a different breed

167
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
from most indie comic

168
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
people.

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Because when you read

170
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
the Vapors, for example,

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
they're not falling in love

172
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
and nobody is a woman with a dick

173
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
and there's not any

174
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
trance, icky trance stuff

175
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,320
happening.

176
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Yeah, thank God.

177
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
I'm confused. I'm confused what you're praising right now.

178
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Well, I mean, compared to the landscape

179
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
of DeviantArt and Tumblr comics

180
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
that are bursting out of the internet at the scene...

181
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
You have the sort of like

182
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Seinfeldian

183
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
aversion to anything trying too hard

184
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
to be deep.

185
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
So everything that you write comes off as

186
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
pretty sincere and real because it's not trying too hard.

187
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Oh.

188
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I feel that way too.

189
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I feel like...

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
I hate to write a story

191
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
that's just easier, that's been written before.

192
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Or that could be

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
described as conventional in any way.

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
I agree with Jesse in that I feel like

195
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
when I see most

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
art on the internet, I think

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
I immediately like

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
find a trend I'd compare it to.

199
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Even great art. Like someone

200
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
like a GGDG

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
with cucumber quests. Like beautiful, beautiful art.

202
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
But when I see it, I think

203
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
this kind of reminds me of the New Wave Cartoon Network stuff

204
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
and what's going on on Tumblr a little bit, you know?

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
And I see all this art that's very

206
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
homestuck or very Tumblr, very this or that.

207
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
And I look at your stuff

208
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
and it's obvious that your manga inspired

209
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
but it doesn't look like manga

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
but it also doesn't look like

211
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
OEL, you know?

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
It's just its own thing.

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
It doesn't quite look like any other...

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
It doesn't make me think, well, this is

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
obviously where he comes from, you know?

216
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Well, yeah. It could stand out

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
if it was on a shelf from other people

218
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
trying to do comics.

219
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
For sure.

220
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Ben, I think there are two distinct things

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
about you that I really respect and appreciate.

222
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
The first is just like your raw ability

223
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
and like being able to draw the way

224
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
you draw the way I wish I could draw.

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Like if I imagined in my mind

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
how my art style would naturally develop

227
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
over the course of five years, it would end up

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
something like yours.

229
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Just like, because I've always been

230
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
a really big fan of like

231
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
bold line art, like really distinct

232
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
character styles and like your art

233
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
especially with the champion really brings that

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
but you still have a lot of like sense of detail.

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Like things are simplified

236
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
and streamlined and cartoonish but there's also just

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
enough detail there to give it like some dimension

238
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
to the grit that a lot of super simplified styles

239
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
don't have anymore.

240
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
And that's something I've always struggled to try

241
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
and do in my work that I've like streamlined stuff

242
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
but it's kind of gotten too streamlined

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
and I think it looks too basic.

244
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
But you definitely like ride that line really well.

245
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
And then the other thing that I really appreciate

246
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
about you is the fact that you like are able

247
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
to just like focus in on one thing

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
because like I wanted to do my comic

249
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
or I wanted to write my book and stuff

250
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
but I still want to do the YouTube

251
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
because I can't really let go of that

252
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
to the YouTube part. I want to do videos

253
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
and I want to do writing, I want to do blogging

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
and all these things but like you did T-Bap

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
they're like T-Bap's done, now I'm doing comics

256
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
and like just focusing on that one thing.

257
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
And I can't do that.

258
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I am really good at focusing

259
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
but it's to my benefit and detriment

260
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
because I get obsessed

261
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
with one thing and I can't think about

262
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
anything else.

263
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
I've observed this cataclysmic

264
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
effect this could have in person.

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I feel like the benefits would be

266
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
worth it especially for someone with my

267
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
mentality which can't do that at all.

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
It's always going to be a bit of the grass

269
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
is greener like if you're not like that

270
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
you'll see the benefits but yeah it's still

271
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I mean there's certainly plenty of benefits

272
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
and I too would praise Ben for that

273
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
although I also have watched how

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
like none of the champion

275
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
was drawn in the last month

276
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
because of the Pokemon

277
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
I did get

278
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
obsessed with making the Nuzlocke vids

279
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
to the champion's detriment

280
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
I think the videos came out really good

281
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
but yeah.

282
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
There's a term for that kind of

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
hyper-focusing on one thing to the exclusion

284
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
of other things. Does it start with an A?

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
It may.

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I'll leave it open to interpretation.

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Another real cool thing in fact

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
just your very last... Artist.

289
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Artist is the word.

290
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Of course.

291
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
The last Nuzlocke

292
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
you did

293
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
that amazing

294
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
horrifically

295
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
tragic ending with the whole musical bit

296
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
that was great

297
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
and you know since you don't

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
do a lot of video editing on the whole

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I very much am glad to see you

300
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
kind of adapt and do something like that

301
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I mean nothing about it was hugely complex

302
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
but to take the extra effort

303
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
to put it in. I spent

304
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
a lot of time on that ending

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
because like I finished

306
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
that episode and I was like this is really

307
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
sad and I felt really sad

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
and I was like you know what

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I should really edit this

310
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
I should really just go all out

311
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
and just push the sad angle of this scene

312
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
and just do everything I could

313
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
just do the flashbacks and the music

314
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
and cut out

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
the words I'm saying so that

316
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I cut out a couple of like jokier lines

317
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
that sort of detracted from the pathos

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
of it.

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Change the end card

320
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
just have it fade out on a whole different thing

321
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
and it was well done

322
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
yeah but I did

323
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
because I'm not really a video guy

324
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
it did take me an extraordinary amount of time

325
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
but I had a fucking vision

326
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
that I wanted to realize with that

327
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
ah well it was

328
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
yeah it knocked it out of the park

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
and if everything goes according to plan

330
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
the fucking finale will be

331
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
even more like that

332
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
I hope. Awesome.

333
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
I gotta say my time observing Ben

334
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
as an artist has been a constant

335
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
one upping of impressing me

336
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
more where like my first

337
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
exposure to Ben is

338
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
the first t-baps

339
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
which were not good it was

340
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
shut up you were great man get the fuck out of here

341
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
you don't know they had keg

342
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
and phantom that's the first couple of them

343
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
well they were sent to me because I was

344
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
the EQD poster guy

345
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
and I get sent this video that's like

346
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
you know these I

347
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
I didn't really take in the designs of the OCs

348
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
which are great but like the actual drawing

349
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
was not that amazing

350
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
it was a ritual we were performing

351
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
and the audio was really bad

352
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
but then suddenly I get sent this one

353
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
where all of a sudden the designs are great

354
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
and I assumed that you guys like

355
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
you know paid some artists

356
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
to like revamp your OCs or something

357
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
when I first saw it like oh wow

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
now suddenly the art is good and the audio is decent

359
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
and then alright I'll definitely post this on EQD

360
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
and then all of a sudden each episode

361
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
there's all these new

362
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
artistic styles coming in

363
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
there's all these different ideas

364
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
there's this one where phantom horn is like in live action

365
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
and he's spilling ink all over the page

366
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
trying to draw stuff

367
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
that was fucking genius

368
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
that was the moment when I was like

369
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
whoa these guys are fucking great

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and then phantom reviews

371
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
and keg reviews these huge art

372
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
like animatic projects

373
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
spent like six months

374
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
drawing fucking phantom reviews

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
spent me so much

376
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
I could do it so much faster now

377
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
that's the only thing I can say

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
and then when I met you guys

379
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
and you were like talking about your OCs

380
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
and all the shit you'd made up and I was just like

381
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
this wellspring of creativity

382
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
being wasted on ponies

383
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
and then finally

384
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
we made the, we had the

385
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
collection of the greatest pony OCs

386
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
every single one of our OCs was the

387
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
greatest pony OCs ever made

388
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
that is no hyperbola right there

389
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
sticky situation needs his own comics

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
there was sticky situation

391
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
there was ultimate pumpkin

392
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
there was a horsefister

393
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
horsefister oh there was a silver lining

394
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
silver lining a good one

395
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
he was awesome are we forgetting any

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I think we might be forgetting some

397
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
but eventually that great talent

398
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
stopped being wasted on ponies

399
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
and then for like months

400
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Ben's like I'm working on this comic

401
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
and now I remember when I like

402
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
when we did the comic trades

403
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
at a brony con and I know Ben remembers

404
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
me saying this but I was just so impressed

405
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
with how dynamic Ben could make

406
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
the poses of the ponies like so

407
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
fast because the comics jam is you have

408
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
five minutes to draw

409
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
one panel of a comic and then we all trade

410
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
you know and everyone else would just try

411
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
to draw like an okay

412
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
picture it would be like

413
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
I'll try to draw the

414
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
face and make it look okay you know

415
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm talking about other like people who consider

416
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
themselves artists other deviant art artists

417
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
and stuff you know people were friends with

418
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
they're drawing like a

419
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
a decent looking

420
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
photo of a pony

421
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Ben would draw these super dynamic

422
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
poses of like a character

423
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
doing something you know like

424
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
doing some really interesting

425
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
thing that totally brings it to life and I

426
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
would split I would split it into

427
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
I would split my panel into multiple panels

428
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
and draw like scenes

429
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
playing out

430
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
and like just I remember that

431
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
you know over time

432
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I mean I eventually saw the Vapors

433
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
this is fucking great you know I love the characters

434
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
I love the art style and everything

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
and then

436
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
everything you've done since then has impressed me more

437
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
like I liked Brunswick

438
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
even more than chapter one of the Vapors

439
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
you know I like

440
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
champions art is even more impressed the character designs

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
are fucking just gorgeous

442
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
in champion those are my favorites incidentally

443
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
is both the girls from champion

444
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
yeah

445
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Agatha is the cutest Agatha is

446
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
number one waifu from the Beniverse

447
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
and then I was shocked all over again

448
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
when inktober started

449
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
because you started doing these like really sketchy

450
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
ink drawings

451
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
with like different colored pens

452
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
in totally different styles

453
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
because I only know you for like the minimal look

454
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
and then suddenly you're drawing these like really

455
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
detailed robots and like

456
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
these muscle men and shit

457
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
and fucking and I was like where did this come

458
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
from because this is almost

459
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
even cooler like even cooler

460
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
than what I know you for like I like the

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
minimal Scott Pilgrimmy stuff but the

462
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
the hyper detail stuff I was like man

463
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I want to see Ben draw a fucking post apocalypse

464
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
war story now with mechs and

465
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
shit um you know totally

466
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Erygia anyone who doesn't know

467
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
what I'm talking about go to Ben's twitter look at his inktober drawings

468
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
all of those were like

469
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
like literally concept completion

470
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
in like 30 minutes like even the big robot

471
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
like that's a completely chilling what's Ben's

472
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
twitter handle it's at Ben something

473
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
it's also ugly it's all so ugly

474
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
with two L's on the all

475
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
but like that robot is

476
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
a completely original robot design

477
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
it's not based on anything Ben just

478
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
came up with a robot and drew it and it

479
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
looks like what would be

480
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
in you know like an 80s

481
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
cyberpunk manga or something

482
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
but it's it's not actually

483
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
it's not someone else's design

484
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
here's a here's a flattering comparison

485
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
since we're talking about robots do you know that Aichi

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Ryota has said that if he finished

487
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
one piece one day he'd like his next series to be

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
a mecha series or some sort of robot

489
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
that would be crazy I mean this is

490
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
it was probably like 10 years ago at this point

491
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
but he did say it and to

492
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
to cap off my praising

493
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Ben's artwork you know

494
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
just like two nights ago me

495
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
and Ben and DeVue did like a little

496
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
drawings jam where we just like for

497
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
10 minutes I gave us a topic and we'd

498
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
all draw a picture and like I would

499
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
spend like 10 minutes just

500
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
trying to make a comprehensible

501
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
face like just that I want

502
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
you to understand that this is a human

503
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
is all I was worried about and

504
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
you know DeVue was drawing these like weird

505
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
esoteric things and then Ben

506
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
would show us like a page with like four

507
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
different illustrations on it you know all

508
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
these different characters doing all this different stuff

509
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
that's also on his twitter did you I

510
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
I want to mention that I've never

511
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
been I've never been sadder

512
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
that you're not a better artist because the

513
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
picture the vapors fan art you tried to

514
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
draw was like yeah the bet it was

515
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
beautiful I loved it so much but then

516
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
you looking at it it's like I couldn't

517
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
even tell what it was

518
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
no yeah it was it was great

519
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
concept no execution at all

520
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
it was amazing though it was Vincent lying

521
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
in bed vaping and he was vaping up a cloud

522
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
that was taking the form of like a

523
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
beautiful girl yeah yeah he was like

524
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
vaping he was he was like vaping

525
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
his ideal girl yeah

526
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
it was supposed to be a qt 3.14

527
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,320
as it says in the clouds

528
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
I might totally say I like that so much

529
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
I might go and make it myself because it's

530
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
really I hope so you can actually

531
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
why was God awful

532
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
like the image you have in your mind is

533
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
so much better than what you would look

534
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
at if I showed it to you

535
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
especially because I drew Vincent like

536
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
totally wrong um

537
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
but yeah and other than that I'll also praise

538
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
the fact that Ben Cannon will eat

539
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
anything

540
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Ben has this might not be

541
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
considered a lot of people might think

542
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
you know they might think Ben

543
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
he doesn't shower very often

544
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
so bad

545
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
because I never leave the house okay

546
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
has no scruples about anything

547
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
some people might see that as a bad thing

548
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
but personally I really

549
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I legitimately admire the fact

550
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
that Ben will eat

551
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
absolutely anything

552
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I don't like it because it's there

553
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I just want to put on the record

554
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
we've been saying this shit to Ben for years

555
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
and he never believed us we've got outside

556
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
proof now we've got testimony

557
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
it's not just us

558
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I know

559
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
I have terrible hygiene it's because I never leave

560
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
my room that's the reason

561
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
by the way Ben

562
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
speaking of your art

563
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
here's a little inside scoop folks

564
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
for people who like the vapors

565
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I remember when you were finishing it

566
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
you would finish basically the whole thing

567
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
if I recall correctly the very last thing

568
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
you were working on was just one panel

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
in the middle that was like a shot

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
of the apartment building after Vincent

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
I think came back home

572
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
with a shot of the building from outside

573
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
of the dorm room yeah

574
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
that is by far

575
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
well it's the most

576
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
attractive looking picture

577
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
frankly

578
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
it's kind of my favorite thing you've ever drawn

579
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
just that picture of the building

580
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
just that picture of that building

581
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
like the way the clouds

582
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
the spooky way the clouds are coming out of some windows

583
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
and the lights

584
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I do really like that

585
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
it was a great picture

586
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
it's a bit like my banner on Topastic

587
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
or something because I really liked it

588
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
appropriate

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Ben put your dick away

590
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
who are we sucking next

591
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Patreon.com

592
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
there's never been a better time

593
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,320
there's never been a better time

594
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm just imagining

595
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Ben

596
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
literally holding his dick

597
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
about to put it away and then he goes wait

598
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
and then he shakes it and says like

599
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Patreon.com

600
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
gross

601
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
alright well next on the list here

602
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
thank you everyone for all those kind words

603
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
and even for the less kind ones

604
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
our next I guess is Digi

605
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
since he's number two on our list here

606
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
just skip me

607
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
why do you get to fucking

608
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
opted to skip

609
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Digi

610
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm very impressed all the time

611
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
that what you do

612
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
with your life is exactly and only

613
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
what you want to do and no more and no less

614
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
and you are

615
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
you have

616
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I don't know you've just got like a drive

617
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
you've got a drive to exhaustively

618
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
catalog your thoughts on this one

619
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
thing and you've

620
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
formed your whole life around

621
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
doing that

622
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
and it's pretty amazing actually

623
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
thank you

624
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm very jealous of the fact that

625
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
you have been writing

626
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
for so long that you're so good at it

627
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
that you can do all the stuff

628
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
you do really quick

629
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
just crank it out

630
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
such a good talent to have

631
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
or skill to have

632
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
to be able to do what you do for a living

633
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
I was at that speed

634
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I was trying to write a script for my Lisa

635
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
thing and I was like this is not coming

636
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
out good and I thought you know if

637
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Digi could bang out like ten pages on this

638
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
like if he were the one who loved Lisa

639
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
and wanted to make a video on it the video would be done

640
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
in a day honestly at this point

641
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,320
I wouldn't even have to script it

642
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
exactly

643
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
this is the problem with praising me

644
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
is that I'm just going to double down on all of it

645
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm sure you will

646
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
let's not beat around the bush here

647
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
because Digi is obviously leading the charge

648
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
for all of us

649
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
into being successful at all of this kind of

650
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
shit

651
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
which one of you is sucking off a vacuum cleaner

652
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
stop it

653
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm vaping hard

654
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
dude you're vaping I'm vaping dude

655
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,320
guys

656
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
good work Kieran that cancer

657
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
we're the vapors

658
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
thank you

659
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Digi

660
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
the professionalism that you bring

661
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
to doing all this shit

662
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
is

663
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
it'd be an understatement to think that I use it

664
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
as

665
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
the path that I am hoping to follow

666
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
it's pretty much

667
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
try to copy what you're doing

668
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
and frankly there's no higher praise

669
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
that I can give than I am willing to follow

670
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,320
all the same path as what you're doing

671
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
and it's not like we make the exact same content

672
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
or anything but

673
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
you always talk about how

674
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
you're trying to blend your boogie and your pop

675
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
your wish

676
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
to make your content that you like

677
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
but then possibly even equally important

678
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
is to make it digestible to people

679
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
make it popular and get it out there

680
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
so people can appreciate it

681
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
that is a very valuable lesson

682
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
that someone like me

683
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
I think would really resist

684
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
because I'm kind of a foolish

685
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
naive idealist about these things

686
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
that I'm trying to shake off

687
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
but seeing that you've just done it and it's worked out

688
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
so great, relatively speaking

689
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
I think it's been

690
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
extremely helpful to me

691
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
and I'm just, I'm really glad to know you

692
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
and to

693
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
sort of be able to be involved in this kind of stuff

694
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
super gay

695
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
full gay on this

696
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
I don't know, I'm being honest

697
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
you're not holding anything back

698
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
somebody has to

699
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
get the gay going

700
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
yeah, somebody has to get the gays out

701
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
what have I been reduced to that I'm leading the gay charge

702
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
oh god

703
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
I apologize

704
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
I respect that Digi does not

705
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
let himself get bogged down in perfectionism

706
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
at all

707
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
like for example

708
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
yeah, his stuff totally sucks and it's great

709
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
he's basically garbage

710
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
like when I was over there

711
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
and we were putting the finishing touches

712
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
on the bedroom bedrock album

713
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
and I gave him the verses that I had recorded

714
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
before I came over

715
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I was listening to Get Action, I was listening to my verse

716
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
and I was like, I feel like I could do this part

717
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
a little bit better here

718
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
but Digi's like, what I just posted it and I'm like, okay

719
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I remember that

720
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
if it had been up to me, I would have just recorded

721
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
my verse a thousand million times

722
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
and the album would have never ever come out

723
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
well it's funny, Jesse

724
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
because you're the one who's always saying

725
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
if you really love someone

726
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
you'd love them warts and all

727
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,320
like you'd love all the imperfections

728
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
about it

729
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
but I hate myself

730
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
so I must have no warts

731
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
I release stuff that's like

732
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
I release stuff that I have big

733
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
problems with but then over time

734
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
I gradually just kind of take that as

735
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
like, oh well that's just part of it

736
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
it's just a flawed thing

737
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
and that's just

738
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
a part of the product

739
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
an excuse to not have to keep working on it

740
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
mostly but

741
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
it's kind of an art form in itself

742
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
to recognize that your standards

743
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
that you're bringing as the creator of the artwork

744
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
whatever it may be are not what people

745
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
are going to be viewing it as

746
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
and I think guys like me and Jesse

747
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
I would say it's a huge weakness

748
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
I definitely have a problem with that

749
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Nate, you introduced me

750
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
to a quote

751
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
it was like, in this moment

752
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I'm euphoric

753
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
no no, it wasn't that one

754
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
it was

755
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
art is never finished only abandoned

756
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
I don't know who said that

757
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
but you told me one time and I was like

758
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
wow that's so true and you know it's

759
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
part of art, part of being an artist

760
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
is learning the ideal moment to abandon it

761
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
when continuing to work

762
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
is going to no longer yield

763
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,320
worthwhile results

764
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
that is a very difficult balance

765
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,320
to find

766
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm still working on it

767
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
that's one of the advantages that Digi has

768
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
it was given to him

769
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
it's just that he's produced more stuff

770
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
than any of us and as a result

771
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
he's gotten just more experience

772
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
at what is appropriate, when to stop

773
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
when to keep going and I think it's served him

774
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
quite well

775
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
there's another thing

776
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I want to talk about

777
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
that you're not embarrassed at all

778
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
to wear your influences on your sleeve

779
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
and just copy things that you think would be cool

780
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
because I've always had a problem

781
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
with like

782
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
every time Jesse does something interesting

783
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Digi says oh I want to do that and then you do it

784
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
and it's like

785
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
if I were to

786
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
feel like I wanted

787
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
to copy somebody

788
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I would feel apprehensive

789
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I would feel like it's wrong

790
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
or cheap

791
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
in some way but

792
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
I never feel like there's anything to be ashamed of

793
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
when you do it

794
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
recently you did

795
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
the podcast

796
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
by yourself where you talked about the thumbnails

797
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
and I'm like

798
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I kind of agree but I don't want to copy him

799
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I got over that

800
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
and I just changed them all and it is better

801
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
that video created a storm

802
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
where like everyone's out there changing their fucking thumbnails

803
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
yeah

804
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
this isn't about Digi exactly

805
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
but I remember in one of

806
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
in one of Mumki's nuzzlocks

807
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
he says like hey guys if you like my videos

808
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
and you want to do nuzzlocks like this

809
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
don't feel like

810
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
go ahead and copy me

811
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
because I've copied this from everyone else

812
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
so it's like

813
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
just do it

814
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Mumki is even more than me

815
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
very willing to wear influences on his sleeve

816
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
and Jesse as well

817
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Jesse I mean directly

818
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
quotes wrestlers constantly and stuff

819
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
and the way I see it

820
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
and the reason I do it that way is that

821
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
for one thing I don't think there's such thing as original ideas

822
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
like you are the product

823
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
of

824
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
what you've experienced before

825
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
no one learns how to write

826
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
who's never read a book before

827
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
the fact that you even have the idea

828
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
of a book is because you've read a book

829
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
and

830
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
your ability to write is going to be the summation

831
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
of all those other people's books

832
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
combined with yourself

833
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
and then also whatever you take from someone else

834
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
you're going to inherently make it different

835
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
by not being them

836
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
even if I just outright steal a Jesse line

837
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
and deliver it the way he can

838
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
so it's going to be different

839
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
it's going to have a different meaning when it comes out of my mouth

840
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
so that's sort of my philosophy about that

841
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
you know going off of Gibbs Point

842
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
a little bit ago

843
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
where he said it's made him more open and stuff

844
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
about influences

845
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
and that led into what you're talking about now

846
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
it's funny to me to think back

847
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
because you know how keg standard

848
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
one of the things about the character

849
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
was that he

850
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
loved anime but was embarrassed about it

851
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
it was like ashamed of that

852
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
for anyone who isn't aware that's

853
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
our old pony OC

854
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,320
right, right

855
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
that was very much a real thing for me

856
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
when I was in high school I wore a lot of anime shirts

857
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
and I just didn't care

858
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
because I was a silly little boy

859
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,320
but in college I sort of developed

860
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
thanks to the friends I hung out with a little bit

861
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
who didn't appreciate the stuff that I did

862
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I definitely kind of repressed that stuff a little bit

863
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
you were rubbing them talking about it

864
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
that's right

865
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
wow that didn't admit to like an anime

866
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
well I think it was

867
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
I think it's a bad thing

868
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
to not be honest about the things that you like

869
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,320
and I've just noticed over the last couple of years

870
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
since meeting guys like you Digi

871
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
and Jesse too

872
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
and just kind of getting immersed in this stuff

873
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
that side of me is like the best guy ever

874
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
Persona who just like has all these wifey's

875
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
around him like I feel like that's

876
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
more true to the guy that I've always wanted to be

877
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
and I think it's through the influence of guys like you

878
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
that I kind of was able to

879
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
you know realize that about myself

880
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
let me say I may have said this to you

881
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
before Digi but

882
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
back in the day when I discovered you

883
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
when it was pony time you know

884
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
which it always is

885
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
not that that ever stopped

886
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
it's pony time

887
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
you know what they say even a broken clock

888
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
is pony time twice a day

889
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
so I remember like I watched a couple of your videos

890
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
and I was like this guy and I remember that

891
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
my impression was like this guy is wicked

892
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
uncool and he's wicked lame

893
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
but he's so like

894
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
he's so enthusiastic

895
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
about the things

896
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
that aren't cool about him

897
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
that it kind of circles around to being cool again

898
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
that's kind of exactly how Jesse

899
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
said he got into me

900
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
that it was obvious that you were

901
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
doing this lame stuff

902
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
you were doing this lame stuff but delivering

903
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
with so much confidence that it didn't feel that lame

904
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
yeah the confidence

905
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
is great

906
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
the fact that you're just

907
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
you never second guess yourself

908
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
or at least never in a video

909
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
you would never say

910
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
well maybe or maybe not

911
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,320
unless I legitimately am not sure

912
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
if the information I'm saying is true

913
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
if it's like an opinion thing

914
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
you've made your decision and then you say it

915
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
and it's like that's me

916
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
until you change your mind

917
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
the thing about there being no

918
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
guilty pleasures

919
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
I've taken into myself

920
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
and I've made it part of my life philosophy as well

921
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
it's an excellent point I think

922
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
um

923
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
well thanks for all the

924
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
and that's why on every digi video

925
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
go smash that motherfucking like button

926
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
thanks

927
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
thanks for all the gay praise everybody

928
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
but I want to say for our audience

929
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
because I was kind of

930
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
was going to have you all skip me

931
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
because I feel like the point of this is to

932
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
to pump people up who aren't as watched

933
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
and obviously everybody

934
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
but uh like what I want to say

935
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
about this is that every single one of the things

936
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
you guys have praised me for

937
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
is something that was

938
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
something I had to learn

939
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
and was all something that I you know

940
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
have taken on over the years

941
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
you know I started writing

942
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
my anime blog in 2007

943
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
and none of the praise you guys are

944
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
lavishing on me would have been true

945
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
back then except for the fact that I write

946
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
fast and that was always true

947
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
and I was a lot less consistent

948
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
but I did write fast

949
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
and try to get ideas out there as fast as possible

950
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
and I think that

951
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
that had a huge

952
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
did a lot to make all the rest of it follow

953
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
and um I've quoted this before

954
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
from shirobako there's this part

955
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
where this old guy says like you know

956
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
you have to get fast when you're young

957
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
because as you get older you lose endurance

958
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
but you you will keep gaining

959
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
skill you just won't have the endurance

960
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
to just do a whole lot of things really

961
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
fast and I really think that because

962
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
I was just young and so full of energy

963
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
I just made so much bullshit

964
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
just an endless sea of

965
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
bullshit and if you go read my blog

966
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
it's all there it's all shit

967
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
go read anything I wrote before 2011

968
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
you'll be like holy fuck

969
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
I can't believe that I listen to this guy

970
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
ever you know but

971
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
uh but that's what it took

972
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
you know it took just getting out all

973
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
that stuff and I I'm

974
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
glad that everyone because

975
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
I have all that experience and I'm so good at analyzing it

976
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
and explaining it that I can tell

977
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
that to other people and they can skip a lot

978
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
of the steps that I had to go through you know

979
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
like that speed is

980
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
kind of like the core strength there's the seed

981
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
that allowed you know it's other shit to

982
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
come for seed

983
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
which we'll be

984
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
coming out of your dick once we can finish

985
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
when you were on give and take making your

997
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
shit there and you were

998
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
there was something you know actually what was great

999
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
about uh the way me and Ben first

1000
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
noticed you was that you

1001
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320

1002
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
um compilations of like what other

1003
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
guys were doing like there was all the people

1004
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
doing just reacting to the current

1005
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
pony episode but you went

1006
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
way further than other people and did this

1007
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
whole big animated thing of like

1008
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
all the analysis dudes and me and

1009
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Ben lost our fucking mind this was the

1010
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
first time we thought anyone gave a shit about us

1011
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
when among the other people you animated the two of

1012
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
us just made these little dolls of us

1013
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
put us in there we were losing

1014
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
our shit we were over the fucking

1015
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
moon we were somebody cared about us it was

1016
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
the best the the thing about

1017
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
um hippo

1018
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
the thing or well since we're talking about back in the day

1019
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
yeah the thing about your your

1020
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
pony videos is just you just you just

1021
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
went way further than anyone else and you actually

1022
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
had jokes and you actually did

1023
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
like made original art and you had like

1024
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
original jokes and comedy

1025
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,320
and bits and stuff and you just were way more

1026
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
creative about it um than

1027
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
anyone else was and

1028
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
um to this day

1029
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I mean you've got you've got a sense

1030
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
of humor and a sense of comedic timing that

1031
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
is not like anyone else and is

1032
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,320
probably the best you're definitely I think I think

1033
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
you're the best at that stuff out of any

1034
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
of us I think that um

1035
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I've I've always thought that

1036
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
uh like because hippo always

1037
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
is is down on himself and his writing and

1038
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
stuff but I genuinely think that he has among

1039
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
the the funniest

1040
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
and best writing slash editing

1041
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
of anyone here or anyone and like

1042
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
like it's hard to

1043
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
put my finger on like specific

1044
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
things but I just really like his videos

1045
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
a lot and he's like

1046
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
totally a unique voice

1047
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
like yeah I've

1048
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
never heard or seen

1049
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
editing or delivery like

1050
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
his by anyone else ever he's a totally

1051
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
his own thing

1052
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
you know like I I'll never forget

1053
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I think this is when I really really

1054
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
started to like you stop it was I forget

1055
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
which which uh pony episode it was

1056
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320

1084
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320

like your twitter everyone needs to follow your twitter

1097
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
your twitter is a singular

1098
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
a singular experience

1099
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
twitter was made for you

1100
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
the site can't be like sold or destroyed

1101
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
because then I don't know where I'd get your puns

1102
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
and you could find him at the hippo crit

1103
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
right yeah the underscore

1104
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
hippo crit right or is it all one word

1105
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I think it's just the hippo crit

1106
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
yeah I think so remember just

1107
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
it's such a it's it's cool to

1108
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
see the things that you choose to make

1109
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
like the first thing that you did that got

1110
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
big was those like

1111
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
what was it like just the

1112
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,320
compilations like the pony compilations where you just take one

1113
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
fucking who would think to do this

1114
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
to take one word from like every

1115
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
episode of the show and every time it's

1116
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
and just link them back to back to back

1117
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
and like people love them it's

1118
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
I would just that's so

1119
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
not something I would ever think to do

1120
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
and it just I think it really shows

1121
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
that's kind of like my favorite thing about hippo

1122
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
is exactly that

1123
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
I feel like you are almost

1124
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,320
innately just like so

1125
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
creative that it

1126
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
like you always give yourself shit about like not

1127
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
not writing enough

1128
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
or not being a good enough writer but it's just

1129
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
the ideas that make it so

1130
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
unique that like you know I feel like

1131
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
with with Jesse or Nate

1132
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
everything's Jesse does have

1133
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
some videos that are that are more just like

1134
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
I turned on the camera and some weird shit came out

1135
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
but like with Jesse and Nate everything

1136
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
has to be this very formulated perfected

1137
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
production and with you it's just like the first

1138
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
thing that came to your mind was already a good

1139
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
idea you know and

1140
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,320
there's so many like give and take videos

1141
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
that I enjoy just as much as the hypocrite

1142
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
videos where it's just like

1143
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
you went outside with a camera

1144
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
with your brother and like

1145
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
filmed you like running around in the grass

1146
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
and then like did three layers

1147
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
of green screen of like weird shit happening

1148
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
and in every single one of them

1149
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
I'm just like this is this is great

1150
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
this is all they want this is this is all

1151
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320

1156
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
bizarre guy who just decided

1158
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
it's gonna be he's gonna talk about some anime

1167
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
he might go pretty in-depth it might

1168
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
approach y'all at some point

1169
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
when fuckin when when Nate post a video

1172
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
yeah yeah so but but then

1173
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
when I see like a new hypocrite video

1174
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm like I don't know what the fuck

1175
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
kind of weird ass shit's gonna be

1176
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
like like your your your recent

1177
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Mario RPG

1178
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
video your fucking head was just sticking

1179
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,320
out of the ether

1180
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
for no fucking reason

1181
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,320
it's like most people would like stand

1182
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
in front of a green screen or like have

1183
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,320
it off the side and your fucking head is

1184
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
just like coming out of like a green screen

1185
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
fucking vagina in the middle of the screen

1186
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
like how you going and then you didn't even

1187
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
mention it you didn't even like draw

1188
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
it wasn't addressed the whole video was

1189
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
like that I love that too

1190
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
because hippos the best at like creative

1191
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
solutions because

1192
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,320
I mean that is a great solution to the

1193
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,320
problem of the green creating solutions where

1194
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
no problem exists yeah the

1195
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
grpj

1196
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
well the grpj in the beginning

1197
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
I already thought it was a genius idea because

1198
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
all he did was just like lay a green

1199
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
screen over a couch just on a fucking

1200
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
pile yeah it's like a pile and just play

1201
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,320
video footage of it so it's like you would

1202
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
think when people think green screen

1203
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
they think you know it's it's a

1204
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
green it's in the background you're standing

1205
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
in front of it like a teleprompter you know

1206
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
you're pointing stuff out but no hippos just

1207
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
in his house on a couch

1208
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
and there just happens to be a green screen

1209
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
that's just playing the game it's

1210
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
not even like lit correctly

1211
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,320
or anything you know has like invented

1212
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
and mastered a new form of

1213
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
green screen martial arts

1214
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
and and but the the reason the new

1215
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,320
one happens is because like because

1216
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
my brother Victor was watching it he was complaining

1217
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
that hippos was sitting right

1218
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,320
in the middle of the green screen so you couldn't

1219
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
really make out a lot of the footage in the

1220
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Kingdom Hearts video and I brought this up

1221
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,320
and it was like I'll find a way to do it differently

1222
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
and so now he suddenly is

1223
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,320
like just a face in a morph suit

1224
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
he's the fucking Zordon

1225
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
yeah he's just Zordon

1226
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
yes that's it that's it

1227
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
he's like it's a genius solution

1228
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
it's not the same as talking about your animation work

1229
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
which is just as fantastic oh shit

1230
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
the spiders the fucking spiders

1231
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,320
and there's a fish oh my

1232
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
god a fish at my door

1233
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
they're both really

1234
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
great and it's a shame that

1235
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
I know they must be really time intensive to make

1236
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
because I wish

1237
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I could see more of those

1238
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
you know

1239
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
go ahead game

1240
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
what?

1241
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I thought you were gonna say something I was gonna say

1242
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I've noticed in both of the

1243
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
two big animation things you've done

1244
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
oh okay there was actually

1245
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
tallest man, fish at my door

1246
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
and spiders

1247
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I always really love your use of

1248
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
like I don't there's not much background

1249
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
noise but then the sound effects are really

1250
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
distinct I've loved your use of sound effects

1251
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
in your animations

1252
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
are they all fully

1253
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
effects like did you just record them yourself

1254
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
there's there's a quite

1255
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
a few that I recorded myself

1256
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
cool I got most of them from

1257
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
freesound.org

1258
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
yeah but um

1259
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320

1260
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
I'm gonna give you a freesound.org

1261
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320

1262
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320

1265
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
appreciated this is highly specific

1266
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
but there's one shot that really impressed

1267
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
me in it's called spiders are people

1268
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
too is that what it's called yeah yeah

1269
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
in spiders are people too there's a shot

1270
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
from the ground looking up a power

1271
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
line and the power the power pole

1272
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
line just like like

1273
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
bends and sways

1274
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
before like the power lines get pulled

1275
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
taught and then snap and the

1276
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
perspective and the motion on that

1277
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
pole looked fantastic

1278
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
there's a lot of great

1279
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
the overhead shot of the spider

1280
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
going into the house and the one where

1281
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
it like when it strings itself up and it

1282
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,320
just kind of starts turning and turning

1283
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,320
back because it can't really control its momentum

1284
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
there's a lot of adorable shit in

1285
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,320
that and

1286
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
just in everything hippo does

1287
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
it's all about timing it's all about

1288
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
perfect comedic timing and just hitting

1289
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,320
you with the most left field

1290
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,320
thing and and the fact

1291
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
that I think more

1292
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,320
so than anybody else hippo is

1293
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,320
willing to completely sacrifice

1294
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
everything for a joke where

1295
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
where hippo will have a video where he's like

1296
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
explaining a point and then just

1297
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320
gets bored of explaining a point

1298
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,320
and would rather make a joke instead

1299
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
and just that point is just gone it's just

1300
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
if you think about it that kind of explains

1301
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
his life in general he sacrificed

1302
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,320
everything to be a fucking

1303
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
joke

1304
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,320
it's just I mean it's

1305
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
so it's such a like subversive way

1306
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
of doing it where if you watch like

1307
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
a John Tron video you know like

1308
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
obviously hippo comes from that camp

1309
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,320
of like video makers where you talk about a game

1310
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,320
and there's jokes but those people there's

1311
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
always this very clear sense of like

1312
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
there's the intro joke you talk about the game

1313
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,320
little you make a joke you show a little scene

1314
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
that's funny haha whoa that scene's funny

1315
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
you make a joke you say a little analytical

1316
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,320
point you make a joke hippo will like

1317
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,320
just wind his way through all of

1318
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
those he doesn't feel the need to talk about

1319
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
every aspect of the game sometimes

1320
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
he makes a real

1321
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
analytical point you know which is something

1322
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,320
John Tron never did you know he just

1323
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,320
goofy funny man about video games but

1324
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
even or like a you know AVGN

1325
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
it's very much like joke analysis

1326
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,320
joke analysis hippo will just

1327
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
say something really interesting

1328
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
some point he obviously wanted to make

1329
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,320
that's the most interesting thing about the game

1330
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
it's not encompassing the whole game because

1331
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,320
proving whether the game is good or not is

1332
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
not really what the video is about

1333
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
it's about just here's an excuse to talk about this

1334
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
game you know he it doesn't

1335
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
feel like I'm getting this comprehensive

1336
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Mathematosis review

1337
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
but it's also not just a joke it's like

1338
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
here's this game I love here's

1339
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,320
the thing I love about it and

1340
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
it's got graphics

1341
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
what's the line in a

1342
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,320
what's the line in the the coyote versus

1343
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
cheap dog one where you said like

1344
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
it's got visuals or something like

1345
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
that yeah something like that

1346
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,320
I forgot exactly but

1347
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,320
I just I just couldn't think of like

1348
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
like usually you say

1349
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
it's got this and that and this yeah I

1350
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
can think of it I laughed so hard at that because it's like

1351
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
anyone else would be like you know it's got

1352
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
this really unique visual style blah

1353
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
blah blah and I hate that because it's like

1354
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,320
there they think that because they're doing

1355
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
a review they have to at least touch

1356
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
on every point even though they have nothing actually

1357
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
to say about the visuals they just like

1358
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
and also it's got great visuals

1359
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
I'm like yeah I can see I don't care but you

1360
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
you're just like yeah I don't it's got

1361
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
a graphic you know

1362
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
whatever yeah

1363
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
yeah

1364
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
I for one am deeply invested

1365
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
in the character arc of hippo

1366
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
and want to see I want to see if he ever gets

1367
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
his goddamn YouTube channel up and running

1368
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,320
because I always assume that that's what he's working

1369
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
towards but they keep getting shut down by

1370
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
the hippo crit he's like no that's not good enough

1371
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
we gotta you know

1372
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
he's been like a you know the

1373
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
the lists he's been doing

1374
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
that's sort of his I'm allowing him to put

1375
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
them on my channel for now

1376
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
for like exposure

1377
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
he does want to have his own

1378
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
you're paying him an exposure

1379
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
oh no

1380
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
the hippo crit organization has been exposed

1381
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
he doesn't know what the fuck's going on

1382
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
he doesn't have a union

1383
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
that poor creature

1384
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
I do let him live with me though

1385
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
let's put a roof over his head

1386
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
I paid cult corona exposure in a backfire

1387
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,320
because everyone likes him more than me now

1388
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
yeah that's true that's for sure

1389
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,320
which I mean anyone got any closing things

1390
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,320
to say about hippo crit or shall we

1391
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
I think it's amazing that so many of us

1392
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
have like this other alter ego

1393
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,320
character that we let live with us

1394
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
you know there's hippos got the hippo

1395
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
Jesse's got cult corona, Nate's got action

1396
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,320
draft, I've got Ben and DeVue

1397
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
with him

1398
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,320
oh my god

1399
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
yeah it's true

1400
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,320
DeVue is kind of a fiction character

1401
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
he's not here right now

1402
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
I rest my case

1403
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
holy shit

1404
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,320
I was just digi in a green screen

1405
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
suit the whole time

1406
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,320
exactly

1407
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,320
alright give we love you buddy

1408
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
let's move on to Jess

1409
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Jess I don't like anything about

1410
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
let's talk about cult corona

1411
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
he's my favorite character on the internet

1412
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,320
he's the cutest and the strongest

1413
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,320
and I just hope

1414
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
that he counted that demon in the furnace room

1415
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,320
perfect

1416
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,320
I don't disagree with that at all either

1417
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
yeah right

1418
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
here's something serious about Jesse

1419
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
your work ethic

1420
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
is like a truck

1421
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
that I fuck

1422
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
it's real

1423
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
it's great

1424
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
just looking at the work that went into

1425
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,320
putting aside even all the videos before

1426
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
horseshoe finale

1427
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,320
that is the seminal work of Jesse's

1428
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,320
career thus far

1429
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
a year of fucking work

1430
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,320
not to mention the fucking years that went into sculpting

1431
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
the narrative for the payoff

1432
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
it's incredible

1433
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,320
you can't even describe it to people who haven't seen it

1434
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
it was all for nothing

1435
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
because it can't be described to people

1436
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,320
yeah that's the worst thing about it

1437
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,320
you'll see that

1438
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
that's the thing in Jesse this is something that I

1439
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
think that you and I share

1440
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,320
is that we are both completely retarded

1441
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
and we make the things that we like

1442
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
and we don't think

1443
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,320
nearly enough about things that will

1444
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
be popular

1445
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
or whatever I mean maybe I'm selling you short

1446
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
but I certainly feel that way

1447
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
I do think about what will be popular but it just makes me angry

1448
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
it makes me want to progress back into what I want

1449
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,320
well Jesse

1450
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,320
it might be true that the horseshoe finale

1451
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,320
is a niche work that will never

1452
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,320
find a mainstream audience

1453
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
but to the people that it

1454
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
was relevant to

1455
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
it was deeply meaningful and impactful

1456
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
and I admire

1457
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
that a lot

1458
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
these people that are along

1459
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
for the ride with me

1460
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
I'm going to show them something

1461
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
yeah right well Jesse I think that

1462
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
that whole plight of the artist's art

1463
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
about you Jesse is the fact that you've taken

1464
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
like this

1465
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,320
you're just like yourself

1466
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
like the way you interact with your fans

1467
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
and stuff like if anybody else tried

1468
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,320
to do it it would just blow up in their faces

1469
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,320
but you've like sculpted your personality

1470
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,320
and the way you present yourself

1471
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
that your fans love getting shit on by you

1472
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
essentially so you can do whatever the fuck you want

1473
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
they've been well trained

1474
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
yeah

1475
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
I admire that a lot because I always

1476
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
have to like try and think of how I'm

1477
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
going to appease the people who follow my stuff

1478
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
to a degree like I got to balance

1479
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
the entire comment section is reek

1480
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
and I'm fucking

1481
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
I'm Ramsay Bolton

1482
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
they know their place

1483
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
it really is great

1484
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
and that you know

1485
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
you can make the content you do and actually

1486
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
make pretty decent money

1487
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
yeah that's what I was going to say I was time

1488
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,320
even though you're a niche creator

1489
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,320
you make so much more money

1490
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
than me for example and that's why

1491
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,320
is because you deeply impact

1492
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
the people that are along for the ride with you

1493
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
you have something to say

1494
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
and create your own cult following

1495
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,320
and they're looking at it for all it's work

1496
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
and it's fantastic

1497
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
and I understand

1498
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,320
I completely understand why

1499
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
your audience is so deeply invested

1500
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,320
in you

1501
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
yeah

1502
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,320
I was going to say

1503
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
I'm very impressed that

1504
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
despite living in like a really dirty

1505
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,320
poopy spider

1506
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
spider infested basement

1507
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
you still managed to attract

1508
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
many winches from all over the place

1509
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
it's very sexy with you

1510
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
it's very cool

1511
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,320
at present Jesse is the most

1512
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,320
well laid of the whole PCP

1513
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,320
yeah that makes me mad

1514
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,320
I'm mad about that

1515
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,320
it's a bit of a burden I'll be honest

1516
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,320
I got plans baby

1517
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
I'm cooking up some shit

1518
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,320
I don't know what that means at all

1519
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
I've got a witch's brew brewing in the other room

1520
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
right now

1521
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
we pour it like a little potion

1522
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,320
and a woman's going to come out

1523
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,320
like what the fuck are you working on over there

1524
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,320
it's definitely true that

1525
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,320
it's going to vape

1526
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,320
is that what you guys are doing

1527
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
are you practicing your vape food until you can produce

1528
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
the white food out of the vape

1529
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
it's definitely true that

1530
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
like any time more than two days goes by

1531
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
without a video from me it's probably because

1532
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
I'm on some romantic sojourn

1533
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,320
yeah

1534
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,320
that's not an exaggeration

1535
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
but literally I'll be like

1536
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,320
how come I haven't heard from Jesse in like two days

1537
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
and it's always because there's some girl at his house

1538
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,320
you know

1539
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,320
I said this about

1540
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Digi but it's also very true of

1541
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Jesse in different ways

1542
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
and it's that I am

1543
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,320
I've always liked

1544
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
really

1545
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,320
forceful guys

1546
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,320
because I was a pretty timid guy growing up

1547
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,320
and I'm not really that way anymore

1548
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,320
but I really respect

1549
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,320
your approach to life

1550
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,320
even if we disagree on a lot of stuff

1551
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,320
how you'll just you know scream

1552
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,320
and cry and you know

1553
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
pee yourself

1554
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
about things that set you off even to the slightest degree

1555
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,320
it's just a lack of

1556
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
you know it's a double edged sort of like

1557
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,320
a lack of compromise comes with shit

1558
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,320
you know being tough a lot of the time

1559
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
but it's just so cool

1560
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Jesse's uncompromising nature

1561
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
is definitely remarkable

1562
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,320
and my

1563
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,320
uncompromising emotional instability

1564
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,320
is an inspiration to all

1565
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
like just

1566
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
really like the story about

1567
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
you just punching the shit out of that kid in the movie theater

1568
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
like that's like the coolest thing

1569
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
I've told everyone I know that story

1570
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
like it's

1571
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,320
and everyone comes away like with

1572
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
like yeah awesome what a cool guy

1573
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
I still haven't told

1574
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,320
the Halloween story from this here at

1575
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,320
Cody's butt chugger ball

1576
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
oh shit

1577
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
let's just say

1578
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
I turned it into a butt chugger brawl

1579
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
I know this one

1580
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,320
I won't reveal it just yet

1581
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
it was a ballroom blitz for sure

1582
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,320
I've been influenced a lot

1583
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
by your videos that you've made

1584
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,320
at first I didn't like the idea

1585
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,320
that you knew that you were influencing

1586
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
people

1587
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,320
it was an aversion to it

1588
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
like I don't want this guy to tell me the truth

1589
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,320
but

1590
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,320
it was true like you were really cool

1591
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,320
and I liked it and I tried doing stuff

1592
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
and

1593
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
I think my ultimate downfall

1594
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
no one wants to hear the truth

1595
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
yeah I feel like that's literally

1596
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
there's people like clicking on Jesse's videos

1597
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
and saying I don't want this guy to tell me the truth

1598
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,320
it's really how I think

1599
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,320
a lot of people feel but

1600
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I got over it because I'm cool

1601
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,320
it's tough for some people to swallow that red pill

1602
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,320
because

1603
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
even though you're very abrasive

1604
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,320
a lot of the time you're really correct

1605
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
on a lot of things

1606
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
even if you're not

1607
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
I just love your

1608
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,320
it's a combination

1609
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
of your confidence

1610
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
and

1611
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,320
your emotional connection

1612
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,320
to things like you embrace your emotional

1613
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
ness

1614
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320
but you're also

1615
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,320
I don't know

1616
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,320
you're genuine enthusiasm

1617
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
about things

1618
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
is an inspiration to me

1619
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
who struggles to feel anything at all

1620
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
I actually

1621
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,320
I feel exactly what Ben's saying

1622
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
I've been so

1623
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,320
inspired by that first time

1624
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,320
we all met at BronyCon

1625
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
I've told the story before that Jesse was

1626
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
saying how he cried on the plane

1627
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
thinking about Kermit the Frog

1628
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,320
because for me it was such a like

1629
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
man when was the last time I just

1630
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
cried about a thing

1631
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,320
being so good

1632
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
you know and so

1633
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
I've kind of taught myself more after hearing

1634
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
about that to

1635
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
when I see something that legitimately

1636
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,320
makes me feel something to try and embrace

1637
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,320
that feeling as much as possible

1638
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,320
and try to really feel it and

1639
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
convey that feeling

1640
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
I would consider myself

1641
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,320
a pretty lazy person

1642
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
my whole life

1643
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,320
up until a few years ago

1644
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,320
when I found something that I actually

1645
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,320
it's kind of a cheat

1646
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,320
because I just enjoy making videos

1647
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,320
so I didn't even really earn like the

1648
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,320
hard work that I'm willing to put into it

1649
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
but I mean the whole reason

1650
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
that I continued doing stuff was because

1651
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,320
of seeing I mean we saw that like

1652
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Digi, me and Ben saw that Digi was successful

1653
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,320
doing this stuff

1654
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,320
but even more so like the content I wanted

1655
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
to make was stuff like Jesse's content

1656
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,320
and it's been a big

1657
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
inspiration to the kind of stuff

1658
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
that I've been trying to make specifically

1659
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,320
the way that you are able to flip

1660
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,320
and like the best comedies

1661
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
can do this between hilarious

1662
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
and extremely heartfelt like the other guys

1663
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
were saying like the fucking

1664
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
like the Hulk Hogan nigger video

1665
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
just like ah fucking

1666
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
I said nigger you know what

1667
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
and then it just turns into this whole world

1668
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
fucking brother nigger

1669
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
it's just this whole thing

1670
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
but like the way that it all

1671
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
it's like a swirling mass of chaos

1672
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
and then it all spirals into one point

1673
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
and then you get this like focused thing

1674
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,320
that it was all leading up to

1675
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,320
like that's the sort of thing that I have always tried to emulate

1676
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,320
the delicate balance

1677
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
the delicate balance of comedy

1678
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
and pathos

1679
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
and is something that I value

1680
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,320
a lot in art

1681
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
I think that's important

1682
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,320
it's kind of my favorite thing

1683
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
and the musical stuff

1684
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,320
that you've put into your videos

1685
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,320
that's like my favorite thing to do

1686
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
let's talk about Jesse's raps

1687
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
Jesse

1688
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,320
I think your raps might be

1689
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,320
some of your my favorite content that you make

1690
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
and you know I like a lot of your stuff

1691
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
so that's really saying something

1692
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,320
your fucking lyrics

1693
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,320
are sometimes

1694
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
genius I'll just there

1695
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,320
I said it

1696
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
sometimes your lyrics are

1697
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
the dandy rap to this day

1698
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
is something that

1699
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
I find inspiring

1700
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,320
that a friend of mine could make

1701
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
and makes me think that maybe I could do something like that too

1702
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,320
I mean when I was making my keg standard

1703
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,320
rap thing or it was a big mac rap

1704
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,320
which turned out it wasn't great or anything

1705
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,320
but I was inspired by that

1706
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
because I thought it was so fucking good

1707
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
I want to make things like that

1708
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,320
he packs so many

1709
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
he packs so many bright ideas into his thought balloons

1710
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,320
that his metaphorical spark lights the room

1711
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,320
when he expresses himself

1712
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,320
he impresses you well then he don't need help

1713
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
so why the fuck should you

1714
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
is that a Jesse lyric

1715
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,320
that's get action

1716
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,320
um

1717
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
I don't even know where to start

1718
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,320
and I'm not gonna go into as much detail as I could

1719
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
because we'd be here all day

1720
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
Jesse

1721
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
is my I'm gonna say

1722
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,320
outright my favorite

1723
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,320
artist of all time

1724
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
and also

1725
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,320
probably my best friend

1726
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
so

1727
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,320
I'm coming from a place of extreme bias

1728
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
that there's

1729
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,320
nothing that I've ever connected

1730
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,320
with more than Jesse's stuff

1731
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
and I mean it's kind of the basis

1732
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,320
of all of this we formed as the horseshoe crew

1733
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
you know we formed around

1734
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
because he was the horseshoe king

1735
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,320
we were all like we kind of bonded over

1736
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,320
mutual respect for Jesse's

1737
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
work it's I mean me and Jesse were already friends

1738
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
and then we saw these other people and like to me

1739
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
it was like the mark of someone being cool

1740
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
was that they appreciated Jesse's stuff

1741
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
the mark of the horseshoe appeared on their body

1742
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
and they knew it was time

1743
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
it's like the brand of sacrifice in berserk

1744
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
you knew that you were fucked once that shit

1745
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,320
I was thinking more like the Tanak

1746
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
the Tanak and the ESD

1747
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
you know the we have like

1748
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
each of us has part of the horseshoe crew on our ass

1749
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,320
so isn't this just actually what cutie marks were

1750
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
isn't this the cutie mark chronicle

1751
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
oh yeah oh my god

1752
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320
um oh my

1753
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,320
yeah wait never mind I was going to say

1754
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,320
oh my god tenacious D was cutie marks

1755
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,320
and I remembered that that's been pointed out a thousand times

1756
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,320
back in the Brody days anyway

1757
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
um yeah like

1758
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
for me it was my sonic rain boom

1759
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
that gave everyone here their cutie marks

1760
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
oh my god

1761
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
like Jesse represents

1762
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
everything that I

1763
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
especially that I was trying to do

1764
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
before you know I'm like a more

1765
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
cleaned up presentable version

1766
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
you know like my stuff is very

1767
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
it's it's it's very

1768
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
like accessible and

1769
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,320
and digestible

1770
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,320
and Jesse's isn't but

1771
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
the stuff he expresses is all stuff

1772
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,320
that I'm like man if only

1773
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,320
I could do if I could do if I

1774
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,320
had his particular set of talents this is

1775
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,320
exactly what I'd want to say you know

1776
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,320
everything Jesse says is something that I'm like

1777
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
why didn't I say that why couldn't I be the one

1778
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,320
to do that video you know and

1779
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,320
there's so much I've taken

1780
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
from him in terms of like

1781
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
god everything everything to do with my

1782
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,320
vlogging is you know is

1783
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
because of Jesse essentially

1784
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,320
you know with few exceptions of like little

1785
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,320
things I've taken from other people

1786
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
my rapping

1787
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
heavily inspired by Jesse a lot of it is

1788
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
just seeing him as

1789
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
one of the only people I see is better than me

1790
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
you know in like a general sense

1791
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
like Nate's a better editor than me

1792
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Hippo's a better you know comedian

1793
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
and you know Ben's obviously a vastly better

1794
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
artist but like when I

1795
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
think of myself in terms of like

1796
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,320
my net

1797
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,320
quality like

1798
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
the only like Jesse's one of the only people

1799
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,320
who I'm like I can definitively

1800
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,320
say he has a better body of work

1801
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,320
than me you know like I get

1802
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,320
more value out of watching all of

1803
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,320
his content that I would out of watching all of my own

1804
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,320
content and so I

1805
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,320
see it as like I have to get

1806
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320
that good I have to one day

1807
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
be able to say I've made as many

1808
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,320
good videos as Jesse or I've made as many good

1809
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,320
raps as Jesse and that day will never

1810
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
come because he's still making shit

1811
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,320
you know he'd have to die for me to be able to

1812
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,320
pass him you know

1813
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,320
because I keep getting better but he also

1814
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,320
keeps getting better where you know

1815
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,320
and we have

1816
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
now we also we influence one

1817
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
another you know where a lot

1818
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,320
of the way that we will put raps

1819
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,320
together it kind of sequences into

1820
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,320
each other you know we make reference to each other

1821
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
we're

1822
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
I can't like you can't separate

1823
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
our artistic careers at this point

1824
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
I mean you could but like

1825
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
for the future but like if you looked at the

1826
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
individual work we're doing so much of it is

1827
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,320
connected I mean now we're doing like the plebe and

1828
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,320
the weave which is like you know this

1829
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
amalgam of things me and Jesse

1830
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,320
are interested in and how our chemistry

1831
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
works you know it's going to be interesting

1832
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,320
when all the people who who just know about

1833
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
you did you realize later on

1834
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
how much of an influence Jesse was and then

1835
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
go back and look at all his shit and are like oh

1836
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,320
my god this is madness

1837
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
yeah I mean in a good way obviously

1838
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,320
like all the positive influence

1839
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
you know I had it was a very

1840
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,320
gratifying experience at

1841
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,320
radcon because of the fact that you know

1842
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
we've all hung out twice before

1843
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,320
at brony con in the past you know we all

1844
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,320
met at the brony con in

1845
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,320
2014

1846
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
14 and 15 we all met

1847
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,320
and you know we got we all got the hang

1848
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
out and it was it was it was a very gratifying

1849
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
experience to realize yeah everyone's exactly

1850
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,320
as cool as I thought they were you know if not

1851
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:36,320
cool yeah and it was like wow

1852
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,320
these guys really are cool guys I really do want

1853
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,320
to hang out with them I really do want to be

1854
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,320
friends with this group of people and to make

1855
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
this whole you know everyone you know

1856
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,320
move into one place kind of thing happen

1857
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,320
but like it was at radcon where it was

1858
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,320
especially that we just

1859
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,320
got to actually hang out and me and Jesse

1860
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
had never really gotten to just hang out

1861
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,320
before after all these years of doing podcasts

1862
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,320
together and talking all the time and stuff

1863
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
and then like when me and Jesse

1864
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,320
hung out I was like yeah I'm

1865
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
exactly as good a friend with Jesse

1866
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,320
in person as I am online you know it there

1867
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,320
was no awkwardness about

1868
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,320
hanging out with Jesse you know

1869
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
when we when we were like

1870
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
going to cook out or something together

1871
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
and it's like this this feels like if we

1872
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
if we did live in the same place we'd

1873
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,320
hang out all the time and I was like

1874
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,320
I got to get Jesse down here god damn

1875
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,320
all my other friends all my offline friends

1876
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,320
are gone I don't they've all abandoned

1877
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,320
me so I need Jesse

1878
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,320
to be my best friend

1879
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,320
I'm just a left bro

1880
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,320
I've got Ben and he's pretty

1881
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,320
pretty good but I

1882
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
feel like I can step up one

1883
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,320
I know I'm an adequate digi

1884
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,320
it's fun

1885
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,320
uh yeah

1886
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,320
Ben is the rebound for digi

1887
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,320
no no

1888
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
I'm a lifting buddy

1889
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
we're lifting buddies

1890
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,320
yeah I mean we hang out

1891
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
a lot more than just to lift but

1892
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,320
I got a

1893
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,320
one quantifiable thing

1894
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,320
that I like about you Jesse

1895
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
is I really like your voice

1896
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,320
and I love how many

1897
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
cool voices you can do

1898
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
some of them sound kind of similar they're always

1899
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
they're always great

1900
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
what do you mean they all sound similar

1901
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
yeah we're totally different

1902
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
is that Raphael

1903
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
and oh no fuck is that Donny

1904
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,320
and Colt are going back and forth

1905
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,320
I can't even

1906
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
the more you bring up

1907
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
it's not that they sound too different

1908
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
similar it's just that

1909
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,320
you can go

1910
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,320
from one to the other really smoothly

1911
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,320
well I happen to like very much

1912
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
how Jesse's characters all kind

1913
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
of sound like the exact same guy

1914
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,320
I enjoy that

1915
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,320
well it's sort of like

1916
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
the voices like Colt Corona

1917
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
and Donatello exist on the same octave

1918
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,320
but there's like a little bit more

1919
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,320
of like an oscillation between them

1920
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,320
I don't know what the word oscillation means

1921
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,320
but I think

1922
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,320
you just throwing some rapey vibes

1923
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,320
for Donny and basically you got it

1924
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,320
I can't even like I'm scared

1925
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,320
to open the Pandora's box of saying

1926
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,320
like specific things because like

1927
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,320
there's so many little like just the fact

1928
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,320
that Jesse invents memes that I will

1929
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,320
then use forever until

1930
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,320
chicken and tea

1931
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,320
dude we all like walk around screaming

1932
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,320
that now like like me and DeVu

1933
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,320
like every time I go in the kitchen because DeVu only eats

1934
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,320
chicken like he just fries himself

1935
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,320
chicken every day and I come in he drinks tea as well

1936
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,320
yeah yeah he eats chicken and tea

1937
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,320
every day and I always come in and I go chicken

1938
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,320
and tea

1939
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,320
and I'm probably the guy who complains about

1940
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,320
memes the most in the world but I'm also

1941
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,320
a meme machine

1942
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,320
when you make your own memes

1943
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,320
it's a totally different thing

1944
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,320
it's not the same as regurgitating other memes

1945
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
which we all do from you

1946
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,320
we have inside jokes and we have Twitter accounts

1947
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,320
doesn't mean we're making memes

1948
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
Endless Jess is an inside joke

1949
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,320
the one group that matters

1950
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,320
a big one for me is the Baba Duke stuff

1951
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,320
where it's just like Jesse

1952
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,320
made this bleach review like

1953
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,320
two years ago where he just

1954
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,320
decided to call all of the

1955
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,320
all of the bad guys

1956
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,320
Baba Dukes like anything that's like a

1957
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,320
there's Baba Dukes and Skelly Man and Spooky Dukes

1958
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,320
and then he just kept saying it

1959
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,320
and eventually now in my mind

1960
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,320
scary things are just called

1961
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
Baba Dukes like that's just how it is

1962
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,320
that's the world I lived in

1963
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,320
that was a fascinating thing for me

1964
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,320
I gotta come clean I had no fucking idea

1965
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,320
what a Baba Duke was for like a year and a half

1966
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,320
and I pretended that I did

1967
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,320
I pretended that I understood what the fuck

1968
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,320
everyone was talking about

1969
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,320
it took me until like Jesse talked

1970
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,320
he watched like the um

1971
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,320
fuck what was it?

1972
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,320
I thought it was Crampus

1973
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,320
Crampus

1974
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
I think Jesse like described what a Baba Duke was

1975
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,320
like he talked about it at some point

1976
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
and then I was like oh okay I can now pretend

1977
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,320
that I always knew what this was

1978
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,320
I don't understand the confusion

1979
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,320
there's a movie called Baba Duke

1980
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,320
and it's about a scary ghost

1981
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,320
I didn't know that

1982
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,320
and I chose not to investigate

1983
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,320
I'm just saying like Jesse

1984
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,320
will do that thing where he brings up something

1985
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,320
obscure and you know

1986
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
a lot of the time it'll just

1987
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,320
seem like something he made up

1988
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,320
a lot and then to learn that it's

1989
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
you know it was based on something else

1990
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,320
ironically though in the movie Baba Duke

1991
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,320
the

1992
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
Baba Duke is really more of a dookie spook

1993
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,320
than a Baba Duke

1994
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,320
what do you know?

1995
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,320
Baba Duke's spook is one of my favorite Jesse characters

1996
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,320
incidentally

1997
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,320
yeah my brother really likes that

1998
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Baba Duke's

1999
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,320
Baba Duke's spook is

2000
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,320
he's like the lowest possible octave

2001
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,320
of the cold corona

2002
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,320
he's my favorite guy

2003
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,320
and in my head

2004
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,320
he also lives

2005
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,320
Jesse's always saying how all the characters

2006
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,320
exist and have their own lives inside his head

2007
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,320
I feel like I somehow

2008
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,320
I adopted Baba Duke's spook from Jesse

2009
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,320
and he is a part of me now

2010
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,320
he lives

2011
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,320
Baba Duke lives today

2012
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,320
I'm sure if Davoo were here

2013
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
he'd talk about how the

2014
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,320
environment of your basement is such a rich character

2015
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
in of itself

2016
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
it's filled with all these kooky characters

2017
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,320
and all these things that have taken place there

2018
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
and that is one pretty

2019
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,320
awesome consequence of doing all your

2020
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,320
filming in a space like that

2021
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,320
I will just also say that Jesse

2022
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,320
is prolific as shit

2023
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
and if you follow all his channels

2024
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,320
new Jesse content is coming out all the

2025
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,320
fucking time

2026
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,320
it is insane

2027
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,320
and you know what

2028
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,320
here's one last thing I have to say about it

2029
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,320
I remember when Ben got me into

2030
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,320
in like 2013 I didn't believe him that it was good

2031
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
I watched it and found that I

2032
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
did enjoy it very much and then

2033
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
he also was the one who showed me all of you guys

2034
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,320
which consequently is kind of what got me into

2035
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
YouTube in the first place Ben just like

2036
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,320
talking about like these pony review guys

2037
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,320
that's when I really got into it

2038
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
and I remember so

2039
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,320
clearly Ben saying like dude

2040
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,320
you've got to check out this fucking like crystal empire

2041
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,320
review by this guy

2042
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,320
like the footwear man it's fucking

2043
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
insane you won't know what the fuck is happening

2044
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
go watch it and I did

2045
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,320
and I remember I remember

2046
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,320
it was fucking yesterday

2047
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,320
crawling out of that fucking rarity fun house

2048
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
like the fucking nightmare from my darkest dreams

2049
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,320
and like

2050
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,320
I think

2051
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,320
that was the moment I realized like holy shit

2052
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,320
these videos don't have to be a bunch of

2053
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
bullshit like this guy didgy bros doing

2054
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
fuck that guy

2055
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,320
this guy knows what's up

2056
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,320
it was a paradigm shift

2057
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,320
I really liked that video I did discover it

2058
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,320
before I really got into the whole footwear

2059
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
and horseshoes

2060
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,320
I think that was my entry point to the footwear universe

2061
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,320
yeah I want to throw in

2062
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,320
I found it isolated I want to throw in one more

2063
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
specific thing just because this is something that Jesse

2064
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
also says it's his favorite thing about himself

2065
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,320
and I also really appreciate it it's the

2066
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,320
physicality of the videos

2067
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
because in that

2068
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
in that cold corona video and this is another one

2069
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
that like I took as an influence and I've like trained

2070
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,320
myself because I was afraid to do this before

2071
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
that

2072
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
Jesse comes out of that tent

2073
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
downs a whole bottle of corona

2074
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
in one go

2075
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,320
he drinks an entire bottle of corona and then

2076
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,320
just smashes it on the floor

2077
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,320
he in real life did that

2078
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
it's not a sound effect he threw the bottle on the ground

2079
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,320
and it smashes the fucking pieces

2080
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,320
I've sampled it in a song before

2081
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,320
and like

2082
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
that level of just willingness

2083
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,320
to break shit and like make a mess

2084
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,320
and you know and make videos

2085
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,320
that you have to clean up after yourself afterwards

2086
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,320
you know Jesse throws himself

2087
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,320
through a table in one video

2088
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,320
he you know just breaks a table

2089
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
by jumping on it

2090
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,320
you know several times actually

2091
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,320
I think in the

2092
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,320
cool cat one there's a part where you like

2093
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,320
fall through something

2094
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,320
he would knock bottles of beer all over the place

2095
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
you know constantly dropping and breaking stuff

2096
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,320
and like I was always

2097
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
afraid to do something like that to like damage

2098
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,320
something and then

2099
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
like the plebe in the weeb finale

2100
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
of episode 3 would not have happened

2101
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
if not for that influence you know

2102
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,320
the willingness to like say

2103
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
let's fucking destroy the set

2104
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
and that's all my stuff

2105
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,320
that's getting thrown around there

2106
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,320
and I wanted to go so much farther with that

2107
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,320
but I was stopped

2108
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,320
it felt a little strange

2109
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,320
I wanted to put a sword through the fucking wall

2110
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
I wanted to knock those walls down

2111
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
I wanted to put like

2112
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,320
I wanted to jump through them

2113
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,320
have like an outline like a loony tube

2114
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,320
going through the wall

2115
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
the plan was that the most over the top thing

2116
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,320
would be lighting a poster on fire

2117
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
and that would have felt pretty extreme

2118
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
but the fucking thing wouldn't light

2119
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,320
but I like

2120
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,320
even then like I mean fucking wine

2121
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
got on everything and I was like

2122
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,320
this is like my actual collection

2123
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
that we've just soaked in all the shit

2124
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
and I was like but it was all worth it

2125
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
because having those things

2126
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
is not nearly worth as much

2127
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,320
as having made that video

2128
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,320
that was the last ending

2129
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,320
so yeah

2130
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
I really admire that willingness to go all out

2131
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
and just break something

2132
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,320
including yourself

2133
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,320
for the sake of a joke

2134
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,320
my upraising was very much

2135
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,320
to like never fuck up shit

2136
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,320
never break anything, never do anything bad

2137
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
and see guys like Jesse

2138
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,320
or like Red Letter Media

2139
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,320
who just like trash shit

2140
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
absolutely love it

2141
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,320
and that's why I would really love

2142
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,320
Jesse's life, I want to study

2143
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,320
what led him to be this man

2144
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:28,320
who would you know do this

2145
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
there's any element

2146
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,320
of Jesse's videos you don't understand

2147
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
watch like three wrestling promos

2148
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
and it all makes sense

2149
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,320
every single thing is

2150
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,320
kfabe until Jesse's videos

2151
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
and then I read the wiki article and started digging into him

2152
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
like I get so much more of Jesse's

2153
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,320
it's all just a combination

2154
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,320
of like professional wrestling

2155
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,320
deep-seated childhood

2156
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,320
trauma

2157
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,320
and a predilection towards

2158
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,320
violence

2159
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
those are the ingredients for the perfect little me

2160
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320
yeah

2161
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,320
another thing to give you credit for

2162
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
HIPPO's been trying to say something

2163
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,320
I was going to say that there's a difference between

2164
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,320
the Red Letter Media people

2165
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,320
and what Jesse does

2166
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,320
because Red Letter Media they make

2167
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
props that they can destroy

2168
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,320
and Jesse fucks up his actual living space

2169
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
and he doesn't always clean it up

2170
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
like if he smashes a bottle

2171
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,320
it's just there for like weeks

2172
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,320
and it's cool

2173
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
there's fucking glass and you walk around without my shoes

2174
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,320
and socks and a year later it goes way deep

2175
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,320
in your foot

2176
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,320
a huge part of the horse shoe finale

2177
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
behind the scenes was that Jesse

2178
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,320
he had ruined his whole room

2179
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,320
for the sake of it and he couldn't clean it up

2180
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,320
until it was done so for six months

2181
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,320
he lived in like just absolute

2182
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,320
squalor

2183
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,320
remember that shot from rarities in main hatton

2184
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,320
where he puts on the fedora, lies back in his trash

2185
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,320
and just basks in it

2186
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
and just loves the life he's living

2187
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,320
I love that shot

2188
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,320
I could never do stuff like that

2189
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,320
just the amount of stuff Jesse's gotten me into

2190
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,320
the panel cast

2191
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,320
I'm now reading comics

2192
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,320
wrestling podcasts

2193
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
I mean fucking broken mat

2194
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,320
you've all developed kind of an interest in wrestling now

2195
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
yeah broken mat

2196
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
I've never watched any wrestling my whole life

2197
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
until Jesse's stuff

2198
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,320
I opened when he started the wrestling podcast

2199
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
that like every little thing I hadn't understood

2200
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,320
about Jesse's videos all made sense

2201
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,320
as soon as I learned what wrestling was

2202
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,320
and how it works and how the people act

2203
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
and I was like oh

2204
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,320
that's why he does it that way

2205
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
you know and uh yeah

2206
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
and now wrestling is cool to me

2207
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
and broken mat saga

2208
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
it's like my favorite thing that's happened all year

2209
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,320
yeah

2210
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
I wonder if like

2211
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
if you do like another top 10

2212
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
videos of the year

2213
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,320
the whole broken mat saga would go on

2214
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
maybe

2215
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,320
the last one was particularly analysis videos

2216
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,320
but uh maybe

2217
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,320
uh yeah

2218
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
that's enough for Jesse

2219
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,320
well guys

2220
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
goofy

2221
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,320
get out of here

2222
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
that's all I got to say

2223
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,320
yeah that's tough

2224
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
alright well now it's your turn

2225
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,320
yeah next is me

2226
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,320
wait wait what are we doing

2227
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,320
I just came back what are we doing

2228
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
I'll say something about Nate

2229
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Nate

2230
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,320
of all of us

2231
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
you are the most not fat

2232
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
that's very true

2233
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,320
and that

2234
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,320
and it pains me to say because it's such

2235
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,320
an embittered

2236
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,320
jealousy an envy deep inside me

2237
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
you are a handsome boy

2238
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
but I do take a lot of

2239
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,320
inspiration in the fact that Nate actually

2240
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,320
truly takes care of himself

2241
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,320
and looks like a human

2242
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,320
I think it's actually

2243
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
a huge influence on the whole rest of the group

2244
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
because I don't think

2245
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,320
if we were a group of all

2246
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,320
fat, slubby guys none of us would try to

2247
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,320
change like we'd all see it as

2248
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,320
well everyone else in the crew is but because

2249
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,320
Nate is there said it like the first time

2250
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,320
I met him I was like fuck why am I not

2251
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,320
like you know

2252
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,320
think about it like I mean we all do the same job

2253
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,320
we're all YouTubers right

2254
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,320
so if Nate who by the way

2255
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,320
currently in school

2256
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
and holding a full time job

2257
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,320
and making videos

2258
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
is still able to find time

2259
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
to work out his body

2260
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
what'd you say

2261
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
it's elected president he's got it all figured out

2262
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,320
I'll write him the best guy ever

2263
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,320
for president fuck yeah

2264
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
he's like the Paul McCartney

2265
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,320
of the group oh yes that's my favorite guy

2266
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,320
yes the proactive one the one

2267
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,320
that tries to get all the others to be more

2268
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,320
and I'm the John Lennon who beats his wife

2269
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,320
yeah

2270
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,320
Nate I

2271
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
like I know we haven't even started

2272
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,320
talking about your actual creative output but like

2273
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
as a person I mean

2274
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,320
okay PCP is entirely Nate's idea

2275
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,320
and his child and he built it

2276
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,320
and Nate has the most like

2277
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Nate is the most adult

2278
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,320
person out of us he is the one

2279
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
who when all of us are fucking crying

2280
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
about I don't want to I don't know how to

2281
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
set up a hotel

2282
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
oh yeah

2283
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
like you know like Brody Cod's coming in

2284
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
Nate's like alright guys we gotta get a hotel

2285
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,320
we're like I don't know how to do that

2286
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,320
you fucking call them

2287
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
you pick up a phone and you dial seven buttons

2288
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,320
and you're done he sent the whole thing up didn't he

2289
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,320
he's done it every time

2290
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,320
every time anything happens we all just

2291
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,320
defer to Nate because he's allowed us

2292
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
to become even more infantilized

2293
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,320
because I like how we all

2294
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,320
have such a specialized role that

2295
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
if one of us were gone it would all fall

2296
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
apart immediately it's like

2297
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
it's like the community roles like one leaves

2298
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
and everything goes to shit you know

2299
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,320
it's a delicate balance yeah

2300
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
Nate organizes things keeps things in check

2301
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,320
he's the only one who actually gets people

2302
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,320
like on the fucking show every

2303
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
week you know sets the

2304
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,320
times gives a shit

2305
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,320
gets the video I mean I'm the one who edits

2306
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
all the fucking things and uploads them but

2307
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
Nate made the channel in the first place and cared

2308
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
enough when all of us were like yeah it's

2309
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,320
no one's gonna watch our podcast and Nate's

2310
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
like well I want to do a thing

2311
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
you know we've had the idea let's follow

2312
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
through yeah good follow through

2313
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
I mean who else would actually

2314
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
spend six months editing a video

2315
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
and not give up on it other than

2316
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,320
Jesse I guess yeah

2317
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
because for me

2318
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
if I work on one project for more than a month it's

2319
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,320
fucking dead it's not gonna be finished

2320
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
I don't know how you do it

2321
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,320
like there are a lot of things you do in your videos

2322
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,320
I don't even know how he does that in Vegas

2323
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
yeah there's this word that starts with an

2324
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,320
A coming to my mind I just don't know

2325
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,320
I can't read it I can't see it

2326
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
one thing that I

2327
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
that I like

2328
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
I'm particularly impressed

2329
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,320
with you by

2330
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
is that you've learned basically

2331
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,320
all of your stuff since you started

2332
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
the pony stuff like all of

2333
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
all of your skill has nothing to do with any

2334
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
training you just never touched

2335
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
never edited a video before

2336
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
T-Bab

2337
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
let's be perfectly clear

2338
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
everyone in our audience probably agrees

2339
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
that Nate has the flashiest editing

2340
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
out of all of us and

2341
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
Nate has been making

2342
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,320
and editing videos for the

2343
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,320
least time of everyone in this group

2344
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,320
and he taught himself all of that

2345
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,320
all of us are self-taught but Nate's doing

2346
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
the best editing and he's been doing it

2347
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
the least time keep that in mind everybody

2348
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
that's true that's true

2349
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,320
and he has like the most outside

2350
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,320
responsibility

2351
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,320
yeah while doing everything else in the world

2352
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,320
I watched

2353
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,320
the potty cast live

2354
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
when it starts off and you're like

2355
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
you read the chapter name and then the screen

2356
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
bulges out and explodes

2357
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,320
and it says live

2358
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
and I got so fucking hyped

2359
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,320
because I went how did you do that

2360
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
I don't know I don't know how to make the screen

2361
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,320
bulge and explode you know I could

2362
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
probably think of a thousand uses for that

2363
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
but I have no idea how you did it

2364
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,320
um

2365
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,320
researching effects

2366
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,320
just yelled so hard that it actually

2367
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,320
exploded

2368
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,320
I do yell a lot

2369
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,320
speaking of yelling

2370
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,320
I do like the fact that

2371
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
you have a very like

2372
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
powerful voice

2373
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
in that you can do all that sort of stuff

2374
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,320
you've got a great singing voice as well

2375
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
and your voice acting is very good

2376
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,320
I remember watching the Gurren Lagann video

2377
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
and just the way like some of the lines

2378
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,320
were delivered like which is

2379
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,320
perfectly done

2380
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
like um

2381
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,320
responsibility

2382
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,320
you don't love it enough

2383
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
like the reverb you put on it just like

2384
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,320
it's like perfectly punctuates that statement

2385
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,320
it makes it so much more powerful

2386
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,320
in all your videos

2387
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,320
in all your content

2388
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
you commit fully

2389
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,320
to every joke

2390
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,320
every line you deliver

2391
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,320
you just completely follow through

2392
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,320
with it as far as possible

2393
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
um

2394
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,320
I'm also alright

2395
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
so my greatest

2396
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,320
praise of you Nate is also going to be my greatest

2397
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,320
criticism

2398
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,320
the best thing

2399
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,320
the best things you've ever done

2400
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,320
are they have like what I was saying with Jesse

2401
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,320
that blend

2402
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
of comedy and pathos

2403
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,320
the character

2404
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
of best guy ever

2405
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,320
is so steeped in that

2406
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,320
deliciously

2407
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
but there hasn't been enough

2408
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
of it

2409
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
and I want

2410
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,320
to experience

2411
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,320
the full fucking best guy ever

2412
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,320
story because I know I have insider information

2413
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,320
about stuff

2414
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,320
and I want it realized so much

2415
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
just so you know folks

2416
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,320
Ben helped me film

2417
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,320
not one but two

2418
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,320
scenes that are for upcoming videos

2419
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,320
like over a year ago now

2420
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,320
like two years not just scenes

2421
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,320
like whole fucking

2422
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,320
things like we spent whole we spent

2423
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,320
like entire days filming

2424
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,320
yep

2425
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,320
and I want those videos

2426
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,320
it's coming

2427
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
I'm sorry I'm sorry

2428
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
Daveau would say that you are

2429
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,320
Daveau has repeatedly described you as the best

2430
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
hype man on YouTube

2431
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
that you are more capable of

2432
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,320
instantly and intensely

2433
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
generating hype for a thing

2434
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,320
I mean very true

2435
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,320
and then your face freezes and the whole universe

2436
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,320
shows up on screen

2437
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
I was like I'm in for a fucking trip

2438
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,320
that looked amazing

2439
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,320
because honestly when you started

2440
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,320
best guy ever

2441
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,320
I know Nate can talk really well

2442
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,320
I've watched all of the

2443
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,320
t-bap stuff but

2444
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,320
it's been Ben who's been doing a lot of the

2445
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,320
visuals so I had no idea

2446
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,320
how your videos were going to look

2447
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,320
I knew you were going to say a bunch of great shit

2448
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,320
but I had no idea how they were going to look

2449
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,320
and I was like oh my god

2450
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,320
what where has this been

2451
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,320
let's just say I had a monkey

2452
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,320
off my back at long last

2453
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
what fuck

2454
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,320
and once again that's a technique I

2455
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
don't know how to do I can kind of imagine

2456
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,320
how it would happen

2457
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,320
the level of effort that would go into

2458
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,320
what I'm thinking you had to do makes

2459
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,320
my stomach churn and makes me want to die

2460
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,320
I could probably like

2461
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,320
find like tutorials on how to do

2462
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,320
the sort of things you do I would just never

2463
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
I would always try to

2464
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,320
look for a shortcut first

2465
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,320
because I don't want to have to do all that work

2466
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,320
all the moving parts and transitions all happening

2467
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,320
together and at the same time

2468
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,320
in like an intricate web

2469
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
of stuff

2470
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,320
shit going on in the screen

2471
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
when his face I don't know how many different things are happening

2472
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,320
when you say it's going to log in time

2473
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,320
and your face goes ah and the

2474
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,320
title comes out and the galaxy is happening

2475
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,320
I freeze the frame

2476
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,320
so I pause the video I had to

2477
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,320
then mask out the eyes because

2478
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
two independently animated swirls appear

2479
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,320
behind each eye the universe has

2480
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,320
to fade in the words have to appear

2481
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
in time with the music in the background

2482
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
all these things are happening just for that one

2483
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,320
and it has to come out of your mouth

2484
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,320
and I had to animate it and mask it

2485
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,320
properly so it's coming out

2486
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
and then you have 20 more minutes

2487
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,320
to go after that

2488
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,320
let's make that line

2489
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,320
that word clear animated

2490
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,320
that is an animation that's

2491
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,320
happening there you know

2492
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
yeah in very impressive visual stuff

2493
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,320
I wish it came out twice as frequently

2494
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,320
or three times or four

2495
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
times as frequently

2496
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
and it's not even just that the editing is good

2497
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
is that you spent so long

2498
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,320
writing and researching and

2499
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,320
with your new with your ghost in the show video

2500
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,320
you've been researching so much to get it

2501
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,320
absolutely perfect it's true

2502
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
it's like you really go

2503
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,320
like

2504
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,320
you make it worth the time I think

2505
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,320
there's nothing's worth

2506
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
the amount of time it takes

2507
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,320
I mean it's a really good

2508
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,320
video like nobody could

2509
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,320
make a video that good

2510
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,320
I would challenge anyone

2511
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,320
in the world to make

2512
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,320
as about the topic

2513
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,320
that the Gurren Lagann one was about to do any

2514
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,320
better and nobody

2515
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,320
else had their life

2516
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,320
like defined by Gurren Lagann

2517
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,320
the way I mean actually there's a lot of guys

2518
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,320
out there and girls you know everybody

2519
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
who loved Gurren Lagann but

2520
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,320
you know it's a particular

2521
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,320
it's close to your heart

2522
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,320
plus like my particular love of like sci-fi stuff

2523
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,320
like that's like

2524
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,320
kind of the main thing it's like even more important

2525
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,320
like even the video I say like yeah like

2526
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,320
comment is like my favorite character ever

2527
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,320
and yet he's not even my favorite

2528
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,320
thing about Gurren Lagann you know it's like

2529
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,320
I mean I'm just gonna say I think

2530
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,320
Gurren Lagann part one

2531
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,320
is one of the greatest

2532
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,320
YouTube videos ever made

2533
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,320
both the concept

2534
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,320
and the execution of the concept

2535
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,320
are perfect

2536
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,320
it's the best possible idea

2537
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,320
because it's I mean

2538
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,320
I assume that on some level it's

2539
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,320
based on the meme

2540
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
of the four guys watching

2541
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,320
Gurren Lagann right like

2542
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,320
that's not a Gurren Lagann

2543
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
specific meme

2544
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,320
it was popularized partly with Gurren Lagann

2545
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,320
you know that probably

2546
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,320
was part of the thought process

2547
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,320
right it's something it's something that's

2548
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,320
kind of like you took something that's kind

2549
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,320
of tied to the series already but then

2550
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,320
totally made it your own and then

2551
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,320
executed it so fucking

2552
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,320
like because when I watched that I was like

2553
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,320
okay this had to be a bunch of individual

2554
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,320
shots on a green screen

2555
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,320
and there's so many photos

2556
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,320
and they're all taken perfectly

2557
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,320
like they're all good photos but your

2558
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,320
poses and your emotions

2559
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
like it's it's you know it's acting

2560
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320
you have to show those feelings I can't

2561
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,320
do that I would probably was taken

2562
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
more than once to get it

2563
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,320
yeah well here's a little insider info

2564
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,320
the way I did that was I actually

2565
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,320
I just filmed myself and then just did

2566
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,320
a bunch of poses and freeze frame

2567
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,320
on the appropriate probably

2568
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,320
I was easy to get a whole bunch yeah

2569
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,320
but like I mean I say easy but it

2570
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
took me like two fucking days yeah

2571
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
and I literally

2572
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
could not do

2573
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,320
that like because I can't emote that well

2574
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,320
I can't I can't act on screen

2575
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,320
and you it was hard I thought

2576
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,320
that my faces were like ridiculous

2577
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,320
looking but actually they were like more subdued

2578
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,320
than I expected them to look that's how acting

2579
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,320
is you have to like really over exert

2580
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,320
it because the human face doesn't actually

2581
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,320
go that crazy you know but

2582
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
like when I was

2583
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,320
watching it and the other thing is that

2584
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,320
it had to be you because

2585
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,320
you start this video off

2586
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,320
making yourself you did all this stuff

2587
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,320
like costuming to make yourself look shitty

2588
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,320
and then reveal yourself

2589
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,320
to be this like this

2590
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,320
awesome cool Adonis in this skin

2591
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,320
tight fucking

2592
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,320
girl in the gun shirt you know screaming and holding

2593
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,320
drills and wearing sunglasses and it's like this

2594
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,320
weird trick that you pull on the audience

2595
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
to make us think that you're some gross nerd

2596
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,320
you know I showed

2597
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,320
when that video first came out I showed it to my

2598
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,320
my friend ghost lightning and he was like

2599
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,320
you know I started this off I thought it was going to be

2600
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,320
a little shit and by the end it was the greatest

2601
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,320
thing ever you know and I was like that's exactly

2602
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,320
what he was going for like

2603
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,320
yeah it's perfectly

2604
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,320
done you really

2605
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,320
is the best guy

2606
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
yeah

2607
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,320
you did it you say that shit to me you're getting banned

2608
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
we're just letting you know

2609
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,320
that was to the commenters

2610
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,320
I think you were being completely serious

2611
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
no it was to you guys you're getting fucking banned

2612
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,320
from the mpcp

2613
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,320
anybody else want to suck Nate's dick more

2614
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,320
he really is the

2615
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,320
procrastinators podcast

2616
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,320
you know

2617
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,320
I feel that the procrastinators podcast

2618
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,320
is a fitting name for something that

2619
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,320
I mean that mage came up with actually

2620
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,320
did she?

2621
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,320
she was the one who changed the name of the other track

2622
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,320
when we were on Skype she changed it to the

2623
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,320
procrastinators like years ago

2624
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,320
what was that like two years ago

2625
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,320
we were I forgot that the reason we named it

2626
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,320
that is just that the chat was already called

2627
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,320
that

2628
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,320
I totally forgot about that

2629
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,320
we would change the name all the time

2630
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
I remember

2631
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,320
and then one time we changed it to the

2632
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,320
procrastinators and then later when we were

2633
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,320
deciding on like a nonpony

2634
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,320
group name we just decided on that

2635
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
because it was there but it feels particularly

2636
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,320
apt to me because I was very guilty

2637
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,320
of that it's funny

2638
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,320
it's entirely true that like all my video stuff

2639
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,320
started with the pony stuff

2640
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,320
just you know fucking doing whatever

2641
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,320
but um

2642
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,320
like up to that point I felt pretty

2643
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
down on myself as a person

2644
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
because I mean at this point in my life I'm like living at home

2645
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,320
had failed to get my degree

2646
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
while all my friends had

2647
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
and in fact I should be getting it

2648
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,320
next month is when I'll be finally

2649
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,320
finishing my fucking school it's done guys

2650
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,320
it's fucking gonna be done

2651
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,320
I can't believe it

2652
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
I'm so I'm proud of you Nate

2653
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
I'm very happy

2654
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
I'm glad but it's funny that this whole

2655
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
praising thing

2656
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,320
I hate all

2657
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,320
I hate myself and I see all my

2658
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
I see all the huge problems I did

2659
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,320
I'm just gonna pretend that you guys represented me

2660
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,320
accurately and fully

2661
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,320
oh fuck off we did

2662
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
eat a dick you bastard

2663
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
okay let's move on

2664
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,320
we could follow this up with the airing of grievance

2665
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,320
no let's record that

2666
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,320
and then never release it

2667
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,320
because we will all

2668
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,320
not be speaking to each other anymore

2669
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,320
the procrastinators will end

2670
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,320
it'll be the last episode

2671
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,320
the big last episode years from now

2672
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,320
when we all hate each other we're all sick

2673
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
we're like let's do it I'm done with PCP

2674
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
we're gonna end it with a big finale

2675
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,320
of everything we hate about each other

2676
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,320
the last thing ever released

2677
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,320
in life

2678
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,320
when I wasn't speaking to anyone

2679
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
for two months over the

2680
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
summer I came up with

2681
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
Jesse's like

2682
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,320
five way revenge

2683
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,320
and I haven't enacted it yet

2684
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
yet?

2685
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
but it is a real plan

2686
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
and I have sections

2687
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
for each of you within it

2688
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,320
and I just

2689
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,320
I had a change of heart and you were all spared

2690
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,320
from it at the last minute

2691
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,320
but it still exists in a vault somewhere

2692
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,320
and I don't want it to

2693
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,320
like Batman has his contingency plan for the Justice League

2694
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,320
exactly

2695
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,320
we ever step out of line

2696
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,320
I have no doubt that it actually is real

2697
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
I had the perfect

2698
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,320
contingency vengeance for each

2699
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,320
and every one of you

2700
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,320
I want to see it so bad

2701
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,320
I only pray Jesse that you had the foresight

2702
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,320
to prepare one for yourself

2703
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,320
that was the final part

2704
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,320
of the revenge

2705
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,320
I was like the guy in 7

2706
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,320
like the last part of it is

2707
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,320
okay let's move on

2708
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,320
to the count of Monte Cristo

2709
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,320
like you come back after 7 years

2710
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,320
after we let you take the fall for something we all did

2711
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,320
and then you have to get revenge on all of us

2712
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,320
and like fuck all our girlfriends

2713
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,320
and daughters and shit

2714
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,320
we can only hope

2715
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,320
for a future that bright

2716
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,320
okay let's move on to our final guy here

2717
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,320
Tom Oliver

2718
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,320
yeah

2719
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,320
Brony Curious my friend

2720
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,320
I haven't heard that name in years

2721
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,320
I haven't either

2722
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,320
so you started YouTube

2723
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,320
like at the same time as Digi

2724
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,320
is that correct or did you come later

2725
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
I'm just curious about that

2726
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,320
was he first? okay it was like paleo

2727
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,320
started and then you right

2728
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,320
it was around the same time

2729
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,320
it was around the beginning because I started

2730
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,320
because paleo basically told me to do it

2731
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,320
because I was talking his ear off about all this

2732
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
like gay horseshit

2733
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,320
and he was like you should just make video

2734
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,320
people would care about this more than me

2735
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,320
and I was like yeah but I don't make videos

2736
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,320
and then it kind of became a thing

2737
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,320
and I was like okay I guess I'm doing this now

2738
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,320
and that's just sorry

2739
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,320
I was gonna just ask

2740
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
so what were you doing right before that

2741
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,320
and this is just to where I want to start

2742
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,320
talking about you

2743
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
like if paleo started you to do that

2744
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,320
what was your role before that because I just don't know

2745
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,320
I was mostly focusing on drawing

2746
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,320
like that's kind of like what I went to school for

2747
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,320
and what I kind of envisioned myself doing

2748
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,320
I never really envisioned myself being a YouTuber

2749
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,320
it all kind of happened by accident

2750
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,320
and now that I've started I can't really let it go

2751
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,320
even though there are other things I want to do too

2752
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
so

2753
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,320
right now it's just like let's try and do

2754
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,320
all of the things

2755
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
and that's still a work in progress

2756
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
this is not the Tommy Oliver interview

2757
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
what I was just leading into

2758
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,320
was I was curious about that

2759
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,320
because I was thinking before

2760
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,320
about all the stuff that you've done

2761
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,320
and about

2762
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,320
how awesome it is even though

2763
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,320
it's just like I don't think about it that often

2764
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
like when I think back to it

2765
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
you made like a fucking Trixie comic

2766
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,320
like a children's book that you just made

2767
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,320
wait no that was

2768
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,320
it was Scootaloo

2769
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
I did a Trixie comic as well

2770
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,320
it was an issue one and I never did the rest of them

2771
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,320
they were supposed to be six and I did one of them

2772
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,320
yeah right right but like right now

2773
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,320
you run your fucking your tech channel

2774
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,320
and it also happened

2775
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,320
that you were a major collaborator

2776
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,320
on like possibly my favorite youtube video

2777
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,320
of all time which is Anthony C's

2778
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
a cancel out wedding review thing

2779
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,320
and it's just

2780
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,320
looking at your body of work it's fucking

2781
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,320
it's amazing that you did all this shit

2782
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,320
that like all these different things

2783
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,320
you know you pulled from the various

2784
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,320
things you've done over your life and

2785
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,320
I've always been wanting to know more about

2786
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
I wanted to read your children's book

2787
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,320
I never got around to it after this give me that shit

2788
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,320
I've read it yeah it's good

2789
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,320
it's extensive

2790
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
I wanna ask you a big fucking thing

2791
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,320
but let's do it later

2792
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,320
anyway I wanna say

2793
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,320
the Tommy Oliver interview will come

2794
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,320
the interview series will be concluded

2795
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,320
one day I've got something to say

2796
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,320
it needs to be stated

2797
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,320
that the branding and the thumbnails

2798
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,320
on Rebel Pixels are the greatest

2799
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
I've ever seen in any youtube channel

2800
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
in history they're beautiful and

2801
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
astounding and every time I look at them

2802
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
I get a big penis boner

2803
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
yeah they are pro level shit

2804
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,320
yeah the professional presentation

2805
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
is good is great

2806
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,320
and it's consistent on your

2807
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,320
especially on Rebel Pixels and also on Tommy Oliver TV

2808
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
yeah how about those fucking

2809
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
like slow movement

2810
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
camera shots in the Rebel Pixels video

2811
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,320
looking over the things yes like I know

2812
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,320
that's like a twenty dollar investment but like

2813
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,320
a lot of guys wouldn't think to do that

2814
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,320
and it just adds so much professionalism

2815
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
to a video like that

2816
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
the commitment is off the charts it's awesome

2817
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,320
I'm I wanna

2818
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
I was gonna say that I kind of

2819
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,320
I've always like admired your

2820
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
your like

2821
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,320
your ability to speak on podcasts

2822
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,320
and in front of cameras you never seem

2823
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,320
to have too much of an issue getting

2824
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,320
your point across like you've always been

2825
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,320
like a good talker even though

2826
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,320
you may not think it because you put

2827
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
yourself down a lot and I think you shouldn't

2828
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,320
because you're actually pretty great

2829
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,320
you and hippo you and hippo

2830
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
are the same in that way I suppose

2831
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,320
yeah both of you

2832
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
like dramatically

2833
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
undervalue yourself in comparison

2834
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
to what your talents are

2835
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
I mean what Jesse was just saying about the thumbnails

2836
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
like I think

2837
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,320
Tom you're like the most underpaid graphic designer

2838
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,320
in the world because

2839
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
you're doing what would be

2840
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,320
professional graphic design work

2841
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,320
and you could sell that to anybody

2842
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,320
and they'd buy it at a real price

2843
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,320
because it's real graphic design work

2844
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,320
on all your channels and your website

2845
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,320
you built a website from scratch with a type

2846
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,320
of technology I'd never quite seen before

2847
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,320
that it's like

2848
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,320
webm's or something what is the

2849
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,320
mechanic that your source was lost

2850
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,320
uses well so those are just

2851
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,320
they're just regular

2852
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,320
mp4 videos but I went into

2853
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,320
the auto player and they have them so they

2854
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
automatically play instead of and when they

2855
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,320
start playing as soon as they start playing they hide the controls

2856
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
so you can't get to them so

2857
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,320
they work like gifs but they're not

2858
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,320
huge because a gif that big

2859
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,320
would be like 15 meg would take forever

2860
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
to download but the video is only like 2 meg

2861
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,320
so they work just like gifs but

2862
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
they're actual videos and you just go in and code

2863
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,320
to hide all the UI and stuff

2864
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,320
I've literally never seen a website built

2865
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,320
that way before

2866
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,320
and I really like it

2867
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
like the motion comic

2868
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,320
because you've been working on it forever

2869
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,320
and like in each different iteration of it

2870
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,320
I'd seen it and never clicked for me until

2871
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,320
that website and like when

2872
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,320
because they're all the same size

2873
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
and they kind of play in this

2874
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,320
natural way where you click on each new page

2875
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,320
and it makes perfect sense to read it that way

2876
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,320
and I was like he finally did it

2877
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,320
he cracked the code he figured out how to make

2878
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
this make sense to me

2879
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
the way to make it work was to say fuck all of your sites

2880
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,320
I'm doing it myself

2881
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
perfect

2882
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,320
speaking of the motion comic

2883
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,320
it looked really good

2884
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,320
I never really thought of you as an animator

2885
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,320
but some of the animations

2886
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,320
in the comic

2887
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,320
were really swell like just

2888
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,320
off the top of my head there's a close up of the monster's foot

2889
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,320
like hitting the ground and then pushing off

2890
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,320
as it like chases them

2891
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,320
and you know it's

2892
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,320
multiple frames and it moves really smooth

2893
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,320
it looks good man

2894
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
it was a talent I didn't know you had

2895
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
until I saw it in action

2896
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,320
yeah a lot of the skills

2897
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,320
in that were just like because

2898
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,320
like I hadn't done them before

2899
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
it's like fuck I need to do this thing

2900
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
I guess I have to sit here and like

2901
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
make it work

2902
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,320
the website thing I didn't want to do the website

2903
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,320
but it's like well I have to because there's no other way to do this

2904
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,320
and then the webm thing was like I was originally going to do gifts

2905
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,320
I'm like they're too big so I guess I got to figure out

2906
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
how to get around that so it's a lot of like

2907
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,320
progress because of like necessity

2908
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,320
over it. Necessity is the mother of invention

2909
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,320
and that is very true on that entire website

2910
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,320
I mean I

2911
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,320
yeah go ahead

2912
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,320
I was going to say that you seem to like

2913
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
work really hard for like

2914
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
to make like ideas

2915
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
or like to

2916
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,320
find solutions to problems like

2917
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,320
you didn't want to draw backgrounds for your comics

2918
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
so you just learned how to do 3D

2919
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,320
oh yeah

2920
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
you were just making 3D things and it was like

2921
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
shit like that's a lot of work

2922
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
I've done 3D and it's fucking

2923
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,320
atrocious

2924
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,320
but you got quite good at it

2925
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,320
I learned quite a bit about how

2926
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,320
like comics are drawn and like how

2927
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,320
digital art works from watching you do it

2928
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
on streams like I never

2929
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
thought about what a 3D environment

2930
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
could be used for as the background

2931
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
of a scene until I saw you do

2932
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,320
it and I was like oh yeah

2933
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,320
that's yeah of course

2934
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,320
like of course you can do that but who would

2935
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
have thought to it who would have learned how to you know

2936
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,320
um and

2937
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,320
I definitely think you're the most multimedia out of

2938
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
all of us I mean you can you can code

2939
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,320
you can code a website

2940
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
you can uh you can do 3D

2941
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
you can do animations you can do

2942
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,320
hand-drawn artwork you can do digital

2943
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,320
uh I mean what's the word I just said

2944
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,320
about the fucking thumbnails a minute ago

2945
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,320
graphic design graphic design

2946
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,320
typography you understand

2947
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
um

2948
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,320
like all those every single one of those

2949
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,320
is like a different aesthetic skill and I think

2950
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,320
it's under undervalued people think

2951
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,320
of artists as like I can draw

2952
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,320
good you know but like when you're making

2953
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
the aesthetic of a whole channel

2954
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,320
more going on there yeah you seem to

2955
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,320
understand every single one of the component pieces

2956
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,320
that Sorceress Lost has a

2957
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,320
font it has a logo

2958
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
and they all make sense and they all flow

2959
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
into each other you know I mean I kind of

2960
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
know looking at your stuff that

2961
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,320
there's like a lot of multi-layered

2962
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,320
shit going on I mean I coded my website too

2963
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
it's not as fancy

2964
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,320
it's not as uh it's not as advanced

2965
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
as what you did with yours though but I

2966
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,320
appreciate it yeah

2967
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,320
actually like I used your website to help make

2968
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,320
mine though oh yeah

2969
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,320
cool I thought I told you but I was having

2970
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
a hell of a time with the resizing of the buttons

2971
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,320
as the screen got bigger and yours just did

2972
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
that and I was like Ben how did you do that I don't

2973
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,320
even I think the first time we talk about you like I don't

2974
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,320
even know how it happened so I had to like I'd

2975
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320
go into your code and look at it like

2976
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,320
or I'm gonna figure out how the fuck this worked

2977
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,320
and it was like you set some value to a percentage

2978
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,320
instead of an actual like number

2979
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
and that's how they were they were shrinking

2980
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
and stuff I scaled my divs man

2981
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,320
you gotta scale those divs

2982
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,320
fun fact I made a best guy ever

2983
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,320
website right when I started best guy ever

2984
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,320
and paid for a couple months to host the domain

2985
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,320
but it has gone away because I always

2986
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
thought I'd make it pro because the thing

2987
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
I had was a piece a shit it was garbage

2988
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
and I always plan to improve it but

2989
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,320
I could never get anything like Ben's

2990
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,320
probably because I just didn't commit enough time

2991
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,320
I could like it's a fucking time commitment

2992
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
yeah it is it's like

2993
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,320
it's probably like somewhere between three and four

2994
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,320
months to like make that whole thing

2995
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,320
half of it was just like bugs because I remember

2996
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,320
I spent like a week straight

2997
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,320
of just like

2998
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,320
the the footer

2999
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,320
would fuck up and like certain times

3000
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
it would like push past the bottom of the

3001
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
the screen at certain resolutions and I had no

3002
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,320
idea why for so for a week I was just like

3003
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,320
googling things and typing in random code

3004
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
trying to make that work and I was like a week of time

3005
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,320
just like getting the footer that no one will

3006
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
read to work right yeah

3007
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,320
I mean I think I actually started doing

3008
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,320
end cards in my videos after you did

3009
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,320
like I saw the way you

3010
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,320
laid out your end cards and I was like

3011
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,320
I'm gonna copy that and started

3012
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,320
doing it more that way because you had

3013
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,320
I think you were one of the first people I saw who had

3014
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,320
created an overlay graphic to

3015
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,320
to frame it all in and like had

3016
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
you know like the titles of videos under them

3017
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,320
and stuff and like you know put in all these fancy little

3018
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,320
things just and even beyond

3019
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,320
because I could talk about you as a you know visual

3020
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,320
designer but you also

3021
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
write actual fiction

3022
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
well which is something

3023
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,320
I think only you and Jesse

3024
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,320
can like do that out of

3025
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,320
this group like write fiction

3026
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
novel stuff

3027
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
you did this fanfic this

3028
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,320
like extensive novel length

3029
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
fanfic and I remember reading it

3030
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320
and being like Tom you can actually

3031
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
write why don't you do this

3032
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,320
and you were like I want to but I'm

3033
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,320
tethered to these five

3034
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,320
YouTube channels and all this other shit

3035
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,320
I'm actually writing I think I might do

3036
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
sorceress lost as the novel

3037
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
it's switch format so many times

3038
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
so what I'm thinking right now

3039
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
you're only five days late for nano-remo dog

3040
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
I know

3041
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,320
I wanted to start that but like I have

3042
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,320
some friends coming over for a week for my birthday

3043
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
so I'm like I can't nano-remo while they're here

3044
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,320
because that was the plan I was going to go from

3045
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
Inktober straight into that because I was like

3046
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
I have like ten old story ideas

3047
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,320
from high school and college that I've abandoned

3048
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,320
like that'd be cool if I just nano-remo'd

3049
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,320
like each one of those and just shit them out as like

3050
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,320
garbage like I finished this idea from

3051
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,320
like a decade and a half ago even though

3052
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
it's like total trash so that

3053
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,320
could be interesting but I'm thinking the

3054
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,320
motion comic just takes so much work and I

3055
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
really enjoy doing it but I hate

3056
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,320
the fact like I really enjoyed working

3057
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
on it up until I posted it

3058
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,320
and then it's like you have to update this like on a

3059
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,320
weekly basis or like now you're on a time limit

3060
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,320
and like time limit is stressing me out

3061
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,320
so I'm just like I want to like do those

3062
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,320
like kind of like in short bursts and just like

3063
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,320
have like a couple things like oh this is just like

3064
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
a little advertisement or a little like

3065
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,320
it's Overwatch totally influence me

3066
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,320
the way they're marketing Overwatch is brilliant

3067
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
because like their entire advertising campaign is

3068
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,320
not canon because it has nothing to do with the game

3069
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,320
at all I hate that

3070
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,320
it's more like the game isn't canon to the series

3071
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,320
like the game is just nothing related to the actual characters

3072
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
the game is like

3073
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
it's completely I

3074
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,320
enjoyed the videos they make for the game

3075
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,320
more than playing the game but like

3076
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,320
they made a super smash brothers and then just

3077
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
none of the characters are from anything else

3078
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,320
they're just like now they're fighting

3079
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,320
it's really weird because like none of it even makes any

3080
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
sense in the lore that they're like putting all this

3081
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,320
kind of effort into because like they have like

3082
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,320
these two groups of like you know the Overwatch guys

3083
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,320
and the Talon guys and then you can be them on the same team

3084
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,320
and be buddy buddy or just like

3085
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
inspired by the genius writers

3086
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,320
over at Riot Games to make League of Legends

3087
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,320
you know there used to be a reason why all the characters fight

3088
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,320
got retconned out now there's just

3089
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,320
no reason why they fight it's just they just

3090
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,320
are doing it what is that right what are you

3091
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,320
fucking doing I'm sorry

3092
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,320
they got a few schools

3093
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,320
that's all they care about but like

3094
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,320
there was a reason as they

3095
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,320
advertised something

3096
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
completely different from what you're buying but you got attached to the characters

3097
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,320
I was like what if I do a bunch of

3098
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,320
just focusing on these characters doing like short

3099
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,320
little endearing things

3100
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,320
and then if I was just writing a novel about like

3101
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,320
them like the actual story

3102
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,320
like now you like the characters so you'll

3103
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,320
read it you fucking hate reading because

3104
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,320
everybody under the age of 25 hates

3105
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,320
reading

3106
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,320
if you make it a light novel you could go to Japan

3107
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,320
well my whole thing is right now I'm starting like

3108
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
really small I'm like if I can write a better story

3109
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,320
than Reki Kawahara like I'm good like that'll be

3110
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,320
my that's my first stepping stone

3111
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,320
if I can do better than that

3112
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,320
whatever he gets a good artist and

3113
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
he's she gets popular for whatever reason

3114
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,320
Tom I was going to say that

3115
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
you know they were saying that I do

3116
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,320
you know adult sorts of things

3117
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,320
professional type of stuff but you

3118
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,320
continue to me impress me with your

3119
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,320
like the way that you reach out to the

3120
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,320
tablet companies and we talked about this before

3121
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,320
how you get them to send fucking

3122
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,320
free shit yeah that's the

3123
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,320
that's the best I don't know awesome I don't know how

3124
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,320
I would even go about doing that and it's great

3125
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,320
it's incredible I would just assume that

3126
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,320
they wouldn't it wouldn't try and hope they

3127
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,320
reply but you know the

3128
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
the the chutzpah it takes to

3129
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,320
reach out to do that I just I wouldn't have even thought

3130
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,320
that's the thing but I mean maybe you just

3131
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,320
had done research and know they would do it but nonetheless

3132
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,320
that is pro shit and I

3133
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,320
I seek to emulate it because it's good stuff

3134
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,320
it's pretty cool there's actually

3135
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,320
I found recently a website

3136
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,320
where you can go on

3137
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,320
there you sign up for an account and you have to like make

3138
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
your Amazon because it's all through Amazon make your Amazon

3139
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,320
account get nice and pretty and then you can

3140
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,320
get discounted things that vendors want

3141
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
you to review on Amazon through there and they'll

3142
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
just kind of like 50% or give you them for free

3143
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,320
50% that's not bad so I'm

3144
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,320
like looking through there now it's like not like super

3145
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
expensive I'm gonna be like here's a 4K TV

3146
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,320
for like 90% off but there's like smaller

3147
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,320
things so like I don't know and then I want to

maybe it was like your sister something but

3161
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,320
someone was filming you when you went to the

3162
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,320
store to test out the tablet

3163
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320

I brought the tripod and the

3167
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,320
slider and just set them up like in front of it

3168
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,320
and just like I just record over there for like

3169
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,320
and they're like yeah fine I was wondering

3170
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,320
what they said about that they were they were

3171
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
surprisingly chill I was like expecting to be

3172
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,320
like the fuck's wrong with you they were just like

3173
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,320
oh it's the hundredth youtuber is in to

3174
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
film our fucking shit yeah

3175
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,320
but yeah that was that was fun

3176
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,320
cool

3177
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,320
where's did you die looks

3178
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,320
he died he's dead

3179
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,320
he's dead well I think is

3180
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,320
Tom I'm just curious about so

3181
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,320
professionally where do you see your career

3182
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,320
going right now are you are you looking to pursue

3183
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,320
you know go hardcore with the tech

3184
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,320
stuff with rebel pixels or are you going to

3185
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,320
like split your time between that and doing

3186
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,320
sorceress loft stuff what's your what's your

3187
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,320
focus right now I

3188
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,320
my problem is I can't really focus on it

3189
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,320
that's why I'm saying like I really admire

3190
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,320
what Ben can do he's like I'm going to do

3191
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,320
the champion and then like that's all he did

3192
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,320
and like didn't I'm like one of those people

3193
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,320
that like I thrive off of feedback so I

3194
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,320
constantly have to be putting stuff out to like

3195
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,320
feel better about my like own existence

3196
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,320
so if I just sat there in a room

3197
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,320
for like five months and did nothing and I

3198
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,320
had no like I mean contact with

3199
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,320
humanity I just like my own like

3200
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,320
self doubt would be to wait me because I've been

3201
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,320
writing this first chapter

3202
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,320
and I've gotten way farther with it I

3203
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,320
ever did with the comic it's like

3204
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,320
everything that would have taken forever

3205
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,320
but like the whole time I've been writing it for like

3206
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,320
six months have been like this is garbage this is

3207
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,320
crap this is like not good I know

3208
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
the feeling but I really want you to

3209
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,320
work through it because I know I've heard you

3210
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,320
stream talk about like you know

3211
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,320
the characters in the story and the setting

3212
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,320
in the world and stuff and I know that there's a

3213
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,320
lot going on there

3214
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,320
and I just want you to get it out

3215
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,320
I want you to write it or

3216
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,320
you know put it out there by any means necessary

3217
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,320
well I'm hoping that

3218
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,320
as soon as this podcast is done

3219
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,320
I'm sitting down and I'm finishing the first

3220
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,320
draft because it's like 95%

3221
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,320
done it's like 12,000 words

3222
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,320
that's awesome so

3223
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,320
that will be done and I'm going to send

3224
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,320
it out to a couple people get some edits and then hopefully

3225
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,320
I'm hoping it'll be out

3226
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,320
by the beginning of next year I'd love to

3227
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,320
like start 2017 off with the banks like here we go

3228
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,320
yeah man pay attention

3229
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,320
it's cool you know it's funny

3230
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,320
to me that you brought up the like wanting

3231
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,320
to do things that are faster that was my exact

3232
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,320
reason for starting to do

3233
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,320
YouTube like seriously because

3234
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,320
in school I had done I was a programmer and done

3235
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
game design and realized that

3236
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,320
I hated it because it took like years

3237
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,320
to release anything to anyone that wasn't

3238
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,320
total garbage and was like polished to a reasonable

3239
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,320
level so I abandoned that shit

3240
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,320
and now I'm like the guy who takes 6

3241
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,320
months to finish a fucking video

3242
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,320
I hate it it's not

3243
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,320
what I signed up for but

3244
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
nonetheless nonetheless

3245
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,320
that's how you just do bestie boy vlogs

3246
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,320
yeah I gotta probably work with the next master piece

3247
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,320
I gotta talk

3248
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,320
I wanna talk about what uh

3249
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,320
I wanna talk about what is like

3250
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,320
the biggest influence that Tom

3251
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,320
had on me and in turn

3252
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,320
that I had on all of you

3253
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,320
that you might not even realize

3254
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,320
because

3255
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,320
Tom, Tom's the first

3256
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,320
person I met like as a

3257
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,320
video maker like the first friend I made

3258
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,320
as someone who made videos

3259
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,320
you know I hadn't like

3260
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,320
I was new to you talking about your history

3261
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,320
yeah well I was I was new to YouTube

3262
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,320
I started making videos he was doing the same kind

3263
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,320
of thing at the same time

3264
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,320
and we both became aware of each other like

3265
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,320
fairly early on

3266
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,320
and started collaborating and stuff

3267
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,320
and we became friends we started talking on Skype and shit

3268
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,320
and the

3269
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,320
the most important

3270
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,320
thing to happen to me and Tom

3271
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,320
in this early period was that we both

3272
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,320
were trying to become

3273
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,320
like professionals in this we wanted it to be

3274
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,320
a career but this is when Hasbro

3275
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,320
started like taking all you know started

3276
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
uh marking everyone's videos and shit

3277
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,320
so I had gotten

3278
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,320
um you know I had just

3279
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,320
I had left my job to do YouTube

3280
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,320
making like $600 a month through ad revenue

3281
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,320
the first couple of months which is crazy that I

3282
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,320
did that well those two months but like

3283
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,320
I don't even yeah lucky to make

3284
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,320
that much now well that's not true anymore but

3285
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,320
for a long time I'd be lucky to make that much

3286
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,320
but like I got monetization disabled

3287
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,320
completely and so me and Tom were like

3288
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,320
how are we going to make money

3289
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,320
from this you know like we started

3290
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,320
basically me and Tom were going to make

3291
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,320
something kind of like

3292
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,320
the horseshoe crew or the PCP where we were

3293
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,320
like gonna you know market ourselves

3294
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,320
as this team

3295
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,320
we were gonna build a website and try to make

3296
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,320
some kind of system where people could pay like

3297
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,320
on a monthly basis to access

3298
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,320
try to make a kick stuff we did we had a whole

3299
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,320
document right out there yeah kind of like exactly

3300
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,320
what happened we believed in the weed we were gonna do yeah

3301
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,320
it was almost exactly like that 2012

3302
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,320
2013 or something yeah and like the high

3303
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,320
like we had like this like crazy

3304
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,320
like our goals had like this huge

3305
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,320
escalation where a few if we got to the

3306
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,320
certain amount like $45,000

3307
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,320
and we would just move in together and make

3308
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,320
blogs every day and stuff like that

3309
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,320
so yeah

3310
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,320
but we had all these

3311
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,320
different plans to try to make money and

3312
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,320
then around this time

3313
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,320
when all this stuff was going on Tom

3314
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,320
found Patreon

3315
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,320
and if it

3316
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,320
weren't for Tom finding Patreon

3317
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,320
I wouldn't have a Patreon and none

3318
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,320
of you would have known about Patreon

3319
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,320
so that's true yeah like the whole

3320
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,320
idea of like let's try to

3321
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,320
find a way to get people to be able

3322
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
to pay for this was very much like Tom's idea

3323
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,320
it was like I remember this

3324
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,320
I was watching this is like when I first

3325
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,320
got into you guys when this this whole

3326
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
shit was going down I remember it very well

3327
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
I think the I think the t-bat Patreon

3328
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
was largely modeled on

3329
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
Tom's Patreon it was modeled on Tom's

3330
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,320
now you mentioned it was like totally

3331
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,320
I forgot about that but it's the truth

3332
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,320
because Tom Tom knew a lot more

3333
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,320
about like marketing and

3334
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,320
business kind of stuff than I did at the

3335
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,320
time not that either of us knew a lot

3336
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,320
but you know he was

3337
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,320
he also like Tom knew more about

3338
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,320
like trying to merchandise and stuff we tried

3339
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,320
to launch TV t-shirt stuff

3340
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,320
it didn't go very well but like

3341
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,320
what is it

3342
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,320
Alicorn Princess

3343
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,320
well Tom also had a whole t-shirt website

3344
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,320
that he was running at the time that like

3345
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,320
that's kind of amazing because Patreon is

3346
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,320
like the cosmic radiation

3347
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,320
that gave us all our fantastic four

3348
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,320
powers yeah

3349
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,320
yeah

3350
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,320
like it was it was all just like

3351
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,320
me going Tom like what do I do

3352
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,320
I can't make money and he him going

3353
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,320
me either bro let's figure it out

3354
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,320
you know and like we were we were gonna

3355
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,320
become this like this duo of

3356
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,320
of finding a way to make

3357
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,320
money but then Patreon showed up and Tom was like

3358
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,320
well this works and we were like oh okay

3359
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,320
I guess we'll use that

3360
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,320
and we've been using it ever since and all

3361
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,320
of our careers are based around it

3362
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,320
not to mention the meme of you guys

3363
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,320
being gay for each other

3364
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,320
that is a meme that has persisted

3365
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,320
and only grown

3366
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,320
that meme is expanded to contain all of us

3367
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,320
yeah it's so great that the

3368
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,320
PCP gives gays more representation

3369
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,320
in the media

3370
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,320
it's kind of shocking how little of that

3371
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,320
there is now because me and Tom had

3372
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,320
lots of gay stuff

3373
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,320
like made about us

3374
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,320
it was just a brownie thing

3375
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:50,320
totally a brownie thing

3376
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,320
and uh

3377
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,320
should we try to

3378
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,320
like us the artists in the audience

3379
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,320
to start doing more gay

3380
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,320
I don't necessarily want it

3381
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,320
I don't think we need to ask I think this podcast

3382
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,320
is already gonna jump start

3383
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,320
this is the circle saturation

3384
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,320
it is

3385
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,320
I'm sure we're gonna get a circle jerk illustration

3386
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,320
this is a strong image

3387
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,320
and by the way guys

3388
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,320
some strong bold images

3389
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,320
make sure to draw my dong the biggest

3390
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,320
I should have done this at the beginning

3391
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,320
the tradition I went to urban dictionary

3392
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,320
and looked up circle jerks so it will indulge me

3393
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,320
have a listen

3394
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,320
now this is a two part thing so be patient

3395
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,320
so number one when a group of males

3396
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,320
sit in a circle jerking each other off

3397
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,320
okay standard but part two

3398
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,320
clarifies not

3399
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,320
it stresses this is not what it is

3400
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,320
when a group of males stand in a circle to jerk off

3401
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,320
onto a cookie or anything of the sort

3402
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,320
that retarded frat game

3403
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,320
is in fact called limp biscuit

3404
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,320
which kind of imply which is why

3405
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,320
the namesake of the band is so horrible

3406
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,320
you know

3407
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,320
there you go

3408
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,320
we got something to do for retcon too

3409
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,320
we're gonna limp biscuit it up

3410
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,320
the limp biscuit podcast

3411
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,320
get down with the sickness you mother get up

3412
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320
come on get down with the sickness

3413
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,320
the limp biscuit podcast

3414
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,320
not about the band

3415
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,320
look forward to it

3416
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,320
alright well are we wrapped up

3417
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,320
cut my life

3418
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:20,320
into pieces

3419
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,320
this is my last resort

3420
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,320
I'd like to say

3421
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,320
in closing that you guys are

3422
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,320
probably the most

3423
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,320
important

3424
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,320
people who have affected me

3425
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:34,320
in my life up to this point

3426
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,320
and I'm really glad to know all of you

3427
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,320
and makes me happy

3428
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,320
that I can be involved in your lives

3429
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
in whatever way and we can do things like this together

3430
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,320
same for me I'm really happy

3431
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
and I feel lucky all the time

3432
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,320
to be a part of this

3433
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,320
gay little circle

3434
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,320
that even jerks

3435
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,320
like someone pointed out before

3436
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,320
I tend to choose my friends

3437
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
I seek out people who I feel

3438
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,320
are better than me at something

3439
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,320
none of you

3440
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,320
are as good as me at most things

3441
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,320
but at something

3442
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,320
most of you have one talent

3443
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,320
that is useful to me

3444
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,320
I choose my friends

3445
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,320
like I choose my women

3446
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,320
that I can beat them into submission

3447
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,320
everyone here is definitely better than me

3448
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,320
at least one thing I agree

3449
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,320
we're a robust little group

3450
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,320
it's true

3451
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,320
you're all my best friends

3452
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,320
you're all my best friends

3453
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,320
for me

3454
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,320
a huge part of what makes the PCP

3455
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,320
what it is and I've said this before

3456
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,320
is that we're all united

3457
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
we're all trying to do

3458
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,320
kind of the same thing

3459
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,320
we all want to be successful through creativity

3460
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,320
and the glue

3461
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,320
that holds it all together

3462
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,320
is that we actually like one another's shit

3463
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,320
that's the most important quality

3464
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,320
of the

3465
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,320
particularly of this core

3466
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,320
PCP

3467
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,320
is that we all really like one another's work

3468
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,320
I love Ben's comics

3469
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,320
I love Nate's videos, I love Hippo's videos

3470
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,320
I love Jesse's videos and I love Tom's

3471
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,320
things he actually puts out when they happen

3472
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,320

02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,320
supposed to

3511
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,320

I'm supposed to

3514
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,320
be creating

3515
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,320
funny

3516
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,320

3518
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,320

artistic genius

3520
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,320

3521
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,320

3522
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,320

hashtag repeating

3525
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,320

3526
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,320
heat and holes in the

3527
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,320

3529
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,320

3530
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,320
