1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nobody knows who I really am. I never felt this empty before. And if I ever need someone to come along, who's gonna comfort me and keep me strong.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. Today is a post-mortem episode of farewell to Swartz and hello to Scalymans.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the end of Bleach and we're here to say goodbye.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's also Scalymans who we won't see anymore. So it's me, the best boy, with Endless Jess, and Gibboshit.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's me.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It looks like a nightmare. I pray that Bleach is wiser and just lets sleeping dogs lie and let's it be buried in peace.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Knowing the nature of Shonen Jump, they probably won't. But we'll see.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Anyway, so why don't we just first touch on what we thought about the actual ending.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just like these summary chapters, and we can talk about the last arc, we can talk about the legacy and the continuing opinions we had of Bleach as it went on.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But to start, I was personally pretty okay with the way things ended. I thought there was pretty much nothing else they could do other than just show this person sexed.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This person, they had some kids. This is what, like 10 years later I think. They have some kids rolling around.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Karen has teats.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Karen's got some massive fucking honkers and it's awesome. She was always the sexiest one.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And, you know, we all share-

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why would they ruin a perfectly good lolly by having her age 10 years and giving her 10 years?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's really disgusting, honestly.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a good question.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It makes me sad.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm a little tired of the cliche of ending a series with 10 years later, you know, whatever is happening.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know. I don't really have a better solution. I just am annoyed that they all do that.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Harry Potter did it. Fucking Bleach did it. Just everything in the world does it all the time.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Avatar didn't do it.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's be creative people.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Avatar did not. Avatar was great. That's exactly how Avatar should have ended.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, it's because they spend like 700 chapters. They forget to like develop the characters throughout the story.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So at the very last moment they're like, oh shit, I guess we should do that all at once in the last chapter.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here's 20 years later they've all got kids.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But you know, nothing amazing happened. Ichigo has married Orihime and they have a son.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We all saw that coming a mile away.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Repulsive. Absolutely repulsive. She was always the worst girl.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What the hell happened to Tatsuki? Where is Tatsuki?

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She's here. She's finally back.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, she's not.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to bring to your attention the fact that, first of all, I like the fact that at the beginning,

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
when Ichigo was getting his powers, it was really cool.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then all his friends were getting powers and I was like, oh cool, they're going to get powers too.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And Tatsuki was the best girl.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Tatsuki and that long-haired dude got fucking shit.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They were supposed to have powers. I know it. And they just didn't get them.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because he ran out of time. They got screwed, man.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They got screwed.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I was like holding out hope that she was just going to be later.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And something was going to happen that she was finally getting to the mix.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because she had a really cool character design.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There was a whole arc where they just talk about the origins of Chad's and Orihime's powers as full-bringers.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They could have so easily just snuck Tatsuki and that dude in there.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And just said, oh, they got powers too. They're full-bringers.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But he just didn't.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Instead, we got a bunch of characters that nobody likes.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So Tatsuki got the fucking shaft. She's often a fucking dumpster somewhere shooting up crack.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Speaking of Tatsuki getting the shaft, is she sexing that dude?

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're together a lot and they're fighting, which is very Japanese-couple-y.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I think they're doing the dude.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I hope so. I hope she's sexing somebody. I hope she finds some degree of happiness in her now worthless, empty Ichigo-less wife.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hey, you know who wasn't in this ending chapter?

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Where's the red-haired girl who used to grab Orihime's tits? Where is she?

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
She probably got AIDS.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I liked her.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Lesbian AIDS.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She got it. Yeah, she got lesbian AIDS.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's true.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But yeah, Tatsuki, she's completely out of the comic and just not even there.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
She was going for like 200 chapters or something.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then right on this last chapter, she's in exactly two panels, but the thing that really annoys...

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Really?

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, only two panels and the thing that really annoys me is the second panel.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There's like a text balloon that's covering her face when there's plenty of room in the top left corner of that panel.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's watching TV.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The last insult, Kubo.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And she can't even fucking see her face.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm so angry.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, you know, okay, to be a little fair, at least she was in the color spread.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's a nice color spread.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm still angry.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And she's hidden by...

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, she's like, I'm yelling at my boyfriend over there, who I'm obviously in love with.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hey, that dude is there, that cool dude who used to have sex with all the girls.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That really short guy.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's cool, I guess.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I like that Uryu is just like hidden.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at Orihime and her fucking gross apron, like a fat old busted mom.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She's like 20 years old.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She's like she's 50.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
She's doing that like Asian woman aging thing where they go from 20 to 50 instantly.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I hate her.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She looks fine.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She looks fine.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She looks happy.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She's content.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ichigo became a doctor, dude.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's making that bank.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've always hated Orihime.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She's just tits.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She really is just tits.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Remember the whole arc with Ulkiyora and like, oh, I'm developing this like relationship

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
with Ulkiyora, my bodyguard.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's like a weird thing, but I didn't care.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I wandered dead the whole time.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's not cool.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tatsuki, I mean, okay, let's just get the elephant out of the room.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ichigo belongs to the Rukia.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That should have been, that should, like, okay, I understand.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Renji and Rukia are a good couple.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ichigo, Orihime's, I'm sure she sexes Ichigo plenty.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's fine.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But really the best, the 10 out of 10 relationship here should have been Ichigo and Rukia.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know, I don't know.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm in support of the Rukia and Renji thing because, I mean, Renji has just eaten shit

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
throughout the entire series.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, that's true.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It would have just been like one final insult.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They haven't get cucked by Ichigo at the very end.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm glad he got something.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's something about the way Renji is designed.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ichigo does not deserve Rukia, so you're right.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Renji and Rukia, they belong together, okay.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, but there's something about the way Renji was always designed that made him feel like

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
a surrogate main character, like he was almost the main character guy

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in terms of like just design and powers and coolness.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like he would have been the main character if Ichigo hadn't existed,

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
but because Ichigo does exist, Renji just jobs out to everyone constantly.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They're very similar.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Only Renji is cooler in every way.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, he's got cooler tats.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's got sweet glasses.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He's got a fucking snake sword.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
His fucking sword turns into a whip.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What more do you want?

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What happened to that baboon guy?

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It was a baboon that he turned his sword into a baboon.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It was Renji's sword, but remember, okay, remember how they started doing this thing?

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
God, please.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
In the anime, they had that whole filler arc where the swords turned on people.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They had to fight their own swords, but then his sword wasn't a baboon snake anymore.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What kind of a world is it where a man has to fight his own sword?

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What have we fallen to, Kubo?

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is this hell we're living in?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I thought you were going to say, what is this world?

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Existential nightmare after another.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait, what were you saying, Gib?

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I thought you were going to say, what does this world come to when a man has to fight his own baboon?

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Which I thought was a lot funny.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A baboon with a snake tail.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can't even trust your own baboon anymore.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's Planet of the Apes.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It all started with Rukia's, I mean, Renji's sword.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, you know what was great about Bleach?

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That Rukia got a bonkai, and it was the coolest bonkai ever.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
She was icy.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She was white.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
She was beautiful.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
She was pure.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just the fact that Kubo lasted long enough to make that happen makes Bleach worthwhile.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, and she became a captain.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank God.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She's accomplished something.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She's captain 13, man.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Her captain died that sad, but he was kind of an asshole anyway.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But she's picking up where he left off.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, it's great.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She's getting that fly white coat.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, God.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And she was blushing.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She was so proud, but she was looking forward to her future.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
She's got a bright-ass future ahead of her, and I can't wait to see it.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, wait, I won't.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's okay, though, because I can imagine it, and that's all I want for the end of the series.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, no, you can read the sequel series with their little snot-nosed punk kids.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wait, is the sequel to Bleach detergent?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ooh.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is that what it's going to be?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you do with Bleach?

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You put it in clothes to remove the stains.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, let's sell this right now.

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's sell this right now for the ages.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why is it called Bleach?

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Is it because of Ichigo's hair color?

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, that was a thing he said.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He named it after Nirvana, something or other.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, that's right.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Can you explain that in a little more detail?

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I forget.

185
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I heard it sometime.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why is it called Bleach?

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, Nirvana's first album was called Bleach.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, and he said he named it after Nirvana.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, that's it.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's named after Nirvana.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, we're done.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's never bring it up again.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
All right, one thing I want to talk about is how the last boss, Yohwach, or whatever

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
he's called.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yohwach.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No one in the world can pronounce that name.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yohwach.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, for coming up with that name that no one could ever pronounce.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's like Y-W-A-C-H-K.

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think it's supposed to be.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There was not even an anime at that point to tell us how to pronounce it, so no one

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
will ever know.

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, that's true.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why did the anime end already?

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Wait, wait, wait.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, the anime ended a long time ago.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I forgot that Japan is a superior culture that writes its words phonetically.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I'm going to look it up right now and we will know exactly how to pronounce it.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I still don't really even know why and how Ichigo won in the end.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, I have no idea what happened.

212
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I just showed up and said, I tricked you.

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then he was like, oh shit, that gets to trick me.

214
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then he died.

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That was it.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay, I'm reading it right now.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
His name is you.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh my god, this isn't even fucking legible.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh god.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay, it's you-ha-ba-ah.

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's what it says.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There's a B in there.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's a B.

224
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, it must be the W sound.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's like-

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You-fwa.

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is fucking ridiculous.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's silly.

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You-ha-ba-ah.

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think it's like some German name or something.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh wait, wait.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You-ha-ba-ah.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You-ha-ba-ah.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You-ha-ba-ah.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You-ha-ba-ah.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Whatever.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's Retire.

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's the worst name ever.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Also, by the way, so this guy was like the man Zangetsu inside Ichigo all along.

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's so stupid.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That makes me mad too.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fuck it.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That was retarded.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's like, yeah, everybody's got their own sword and the swords have people inside them

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and everyone's got, like, his is a fucking baboon and Ichigo's is like this cool guy

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
with sunglasses standing on a sideways building.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's the coolest shit ever.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And then you get like halfway through the series and it's like, no, actually that's not it.

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He's actually like a Quincy guy because Ichigo's also a Quincy and also-

250
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He's also the main bad guy and also, I guess there is no guy inside of his sword.

252
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like the hollow one was like his real power or something.

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is that?

255
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why isn't everyone's sword just another them?

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Are the Shinigami also hollow people?

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
To be honest, this is where I lost track of what the fuck was going on.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know, this is like the Heartless all over again.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The Heartless don't have hearts but the Nobodies don't have hearts but they do have bodies.

260
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay, no, that's just a matter of terminology.

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's very simple.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is actually incredibly complex and makes no sense.

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Heartless and Nobodies make sense and I'll explain it to the world one day.

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The promise day.

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't quite know.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The promise day.

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, I'll do a Kingdom Hearts series and one episode will be explaining what the fuck is going on with Heartless and Nobodies.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know what the confusion is yet but I haven't played the second in the series.

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh yeah, it's pretty clear in the first one.

270
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I mean the card Heartless-

271
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In the first one it's just like these are black guys.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Kill them.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Kill black guys.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It gets the story of Kingdom Hearts.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Kingdom Hearts 1 could not have been simpler and that was a big strength.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I know now.

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts is white.

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, so I was going to say that like, so one of the things about Bleach is that it had massive, like in game terminology you'd say feature creep.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Like they just kept adding like, you could call them, they're all like mini games.

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They're just like extra like little gameplay mechanics.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like we got the visards now.

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think it wasn't so much the different types of people but they're just the sheer amount of all the different types of people but they're just the sheer amount.

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Of all the different types of people that just kept being relevant.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I was going to say.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Like they were all the same amount of relevant which is like, ended up with nobody being interesting.

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Right, that's a big problem.

287
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, and it really is kind of like what Kingdom Hearts 2, I mean Kingdom Hearts 2 is the greatest game ever made.

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But Bleach does share similarities with it in that it absolutely increased complexity.

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like every time.

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like all these like weird new power sets that don't make any sense.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Like again, like at first it was-

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Fullbringers still make almost no sense.

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
They're so simple at first like they've got a sword and then the sword turns into another sword but then it can turn into a super sword.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There's three stages.

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And that's all, that's great.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bonkai's instantly in the world fell in love with Bonkai's and said, I want to see every character's bonkai.

298
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's all you needed.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Even by the end of the series still all anyone cared about on the forums and stuff was like, who's we got to see everyone's bonkai before it ends?

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's all anyone cares about.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's the only thing that kept me going.

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It is.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And like you were saying before, the fact, yeah.

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, they're like, but then all of a sudden it's like, oh but now Ichigo has a new power set and he's a new kind of person.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And he's a half breed cross Quincy Fullbringer fucking five time judo champion soul guy.

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And it's like what's happening?

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's got like a new sword.

308
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Now he's got like two swords that are different from his original sword.

309
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So now he's got a whole new set to learn, a whole new bonkai to learn that didn't end up doing anything anyways.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It did nothing.

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He went back to his original sword in the last fight.

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So what was the point of any of it?

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay, like to be fair, Bleach got canceled pretty recently.

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like he finally, the axe came out.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's like Kubo, let's wrap this shit up in like the next two chapters.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So like I feel for Kubo in that I think he was building to something a little bit more than just the like, oh I went back to my true sword.

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Like I think he had a little bit more in mind.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not his fault, but it also kind of is his fault for taking so long.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It is his fault for just making one, making Bleach take the path that it did, which was fucked up.

320
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And like you were saying, it really all to me comes back to like, everyone in the world agrees that the beginning of Bleach is the best part.

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And like you were saying, the fact that everyone has their own like Zanpakhto spirit.

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The fact that like Zang- fuck Zangetsu was like this weird old man on the sideways building was so interesting and compelling.

323
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And it like, it made everyone think like, what does this say about Ichigo?

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Especially when later you see that,

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and by the way, this is like the only other one we see in like the whole series.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So like fuck you Kubo for not exploring it more.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We see Renji's weird baboon snake thing and we're like, whoa, like they don't even have to be human.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Like there's so many possibilities you could do.

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There's so much shit you could do with that.

330
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And instead of going into the complexity,

331
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hang on, hang on.

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, instead of going into the complexity that he already built in by doing that,

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
he's just like, no, we just need, we need more different powers.

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We need full bringers.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We need visors.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We need hollows.

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We need all this shit.

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And it's like, it did the exact opposite of what he wanted to do.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Instead of making us care more about all the people's cause like,

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ichigo's got like 10 different kinds of powers.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It made us care so much less cause we couldn't keep track of it.

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And none of it felt important anymore.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know, it was a big mistake to go in that direction.

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He really should have just deep dived into one, one kind of thing.

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Just Zanpak toe powers, man.

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And like those fights could have been just as interesting forever,

347
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
just with that original set of powers.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, once they all have their fucking bonkais,

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
then it's just like who's gonna train and become the best swordsman

350
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
or the best at like the keto shit or how do the different abilities

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
like rock, paper, scissor with other opponents.

352
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like that's interesting, but instead it's just this fucking power creep.

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's this, ooh, I don't like it.

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
These skill trees.

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You can tell that he felt that he backed himself to a corner

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
by like giving Ichigo his bonkais so soon.

357
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And he keeps adding these caveats like,

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
oh Ichigo's bonkai wasn't it 100% cause he had just gotten it.

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Or like, you know, shit like that.

360
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And you know, those are, those are fun.

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I even like Vizards.

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I straight up like Vizards.

363
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think crossing over between Shinigami and Hollow,

364
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think that is cool.

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think that is interesting and makes sense

366
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
because Hollow and Shinigami powers are inherently linked.

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But it's, you know, after a certain point just gets to be too much.

368
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
All the other shit.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Quincy stuff.

370
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, Quincy's were kind of cool.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think it was only What's His Face, only Uryu.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That was interesting.

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And I'm even okay with bringing in a couple more.

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But like, I mean, okay, what even was this like end?

375
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There was just a Quincy world the whole time.

376
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't even know.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I completely lost track.

378
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I guess there's a Quincy world.

379
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And we just found out about it.

380
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I still don't even know what Quincy's what are.

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I thought they were humans that destroyed demons

382
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
instead of sending them along.

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Like, okay, Shinigami are dead people.

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They are the opposite coin of living people.

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What are Quincy's?

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I thought they were just a tribe of living people

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
who were spiritually could see fucking, you know, monsters

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and they killed them and stuff.

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And they shoot them with bows instead of swords.

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It was cool.

392
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But then they have swords too.

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But then at the end they're fighting the Quincy's

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and some of them like turn into monsters.

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's one of them is a giant bird chicken man.

396
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like what the fuck is going on?

397
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What are these creatures?

398
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know and I don't care to know.

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It was too much.

400
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I couldn't keep track of it.

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The best final boss was the giant hollow,

402
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the grand hollow, the really tall guy with a long nose.

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You know that guy.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, the Mano Scrande, I believe.

405
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, those were the...

406
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They were cool.

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They should have been fighting those all the time.

408
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I mean, ever since I saw those,

409
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I've been going to Taco Bell and be like,

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
hey, where's my Mano Scrande?

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Super size me dog.

412
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And they're like, get out of here.

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And some of the Bonkai reveals near the end.

414
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They just like petered out and were totally dumb.

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Like they introduced this character in the beginning,

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
this guy Kenpachi.

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And like, he doesn't even know how to use his sword,

418
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but he's so strong anyways.

419
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Gosh, can you imagine if he ever figured out

420
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
how to actually use a sword?

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What would happen?

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He'd be the strongest guy ever.

423
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, at the end of the series,

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
he figures it out and he fucking loses.

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And that's it.

426
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And that's the last you fucking see of him.

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, that's the last you see.

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What happened?

429
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
All right, dude.

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
All right, first of all, get this.

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay, so there was this whole thing

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
way back that people probably didn't fucking remember.

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Beaches wasn't going on for like 13 years or something.

434
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So at the beginning, when you first see Kenpachi,

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
after he fights each go and loses,

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
there's this whole thing about like,

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Kenpachi's Riyatsu is like, it's the biggest.

438
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like he's just the strongest dude.

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So his Riyatsu, they say at the time,

440
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
is so strong that his sword

441
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
is in a constantly released state.

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So the fact that later on,

443
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
like when we get to the end,

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
he just, oh no, that was wrong.

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He hasn't released it yet.

446
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Now we're going to.

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And like, so he does his like Shikai release later on.

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And so like, what that feels like to me

449
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
is that we were cheated and lied to

450
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
at the beginning of the series.

451
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
All that interesting drama about how like,

452
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Kenpachi's Zanpakuto had been unsealed

453
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
because he couldn't seal it,

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
because he's so strong.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Those were just lies that Kubo had told us

456
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to make us care about his character.

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Or really, he just, you know,

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
maybe he'd go that direction

459
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
or maybe he would like go back on it,

460
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
which is what he did.

461
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's false advertising.

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't even remember him using his bankai.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't remember anything.

464
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well, they did mention at the beginning

465
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that he just doesn't know its name

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and can't talk to it at all.

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right, but that was part of the drama, dude,

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that even though he didn't know its name,

469
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
even then, he was so strong,

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
he couldn't help but like have it be released

471
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because he was just that strong.

472
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It was a lie.

473
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And they finally reveal this bankai,

474
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and like, I don't even understand what it did.

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It just turned his skin red and made him scarier.

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He gets red and he's strong.

477
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then he got beat up.

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So what's the, and then, oh,

479
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and then they did that fucking thing

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
where, what's her name,

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
fucking Yachiru or whatever.

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Who are you?

483
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, Yano Unoha, Unoha or something.

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, not Hisaka, the little fucking...

485
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, Yachiru, Yachiru, yeah.

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's what I said.

487
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But yeah, they did the thing where like,

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
she disappeared, so it's like,

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
well, maybe she was the spirit of the Zanpakuto

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
all along, but they didn't follow up on it.

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But then, nope.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No, they did follow up on it.

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And nope, she's just somebody who's weird

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and she's got her own Zanpakuto.

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
She's just not.

496
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, then why does she disappear though?

497
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because Kuba's a fucking hack.

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's why.

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah.

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How does a fucking Zanpakuto have its own sword?

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Is that like...

502
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Such an asshole, like he's so strong

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that it turns out even his sword has a sword.

504
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I wish that were true,

505
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but that would have been awesome.

506
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I figured out Yachiru was the spirit of the Zanpakuto,

507
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
but she's just not.

508
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And so, fuck you, Kubo.

509
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That was a cool idea,

510
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and you just completely fucked over it.

511
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So what we have to assume, what we're left with,

512
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
based on that, all we can assume is that

513
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yachiru took her clothes off

514
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and ran off into the woods and was never seen again.

515
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
For no reason.

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
She came back, like, for a little bit

517
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
to do something, I don't remember.

518
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm gonna look it up right now.

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Go on, Gable, I look this up.

520
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
All right, I was just gonna say that

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
the idea of a guy being so powerful

522
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that his sword has a sword

523
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
is just a hilarious concept.

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That could have been the most

525
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
comedic character in the whole thing.

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I agree, and I wish that's what happened.

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You know what, we need to just come together

528
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
as animators and make Bleak,

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and we'll do it right this time.

530
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We'll do how the series should have been.

531
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We'll have real skeletons.

532
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We just...

533
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's when it was missing all along.

534
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It was missing the live action.

535
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Those Ray-Harry-Harry stop motions

536
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and bad skeletons.

537
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's what it needed.

538
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay, I don't know.

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

540
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like, it says that Yachiru appears

541
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
to Kenpachi in the fucking wiki.

542
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't know what the fuck is going on with this character.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Who cares? She's dead.

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Do you remember seeing that, like, that

545
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
image...

546
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
info-image thing that was, like,

547
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
trying to explain everything that's going on in Bleach,

548
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and it was, like, a huge thing,

549
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and it just kept scrolling and scrolling.

550
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I still don't get it.

551
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And I remember, there were these pretty cool

552
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
power charts that people had put together

553
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
that showed, like,

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you know, like the different abilities

555
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that individual characters have.

556
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It all funnels to eventually talk about,

557
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
like, Ichigo at his peak,

558
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
like, at the end of...

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You know when he turns, like, black,

560
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and he does, like, the I.M. Zangetsu,

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
or whatever, like, at that moment,

562
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
he had, like, ten different powers

563
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
from, like, ten different things all at once.

564
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Or maybe it wasn't that, it was later after he gets his full bringer.

565
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Whatever.

566
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The point is, it was...

567
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's, like, cool to think about

568
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
what, like, what abilities

569
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
are going on with the characters, but the problem is

570
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Kubo never does anything with any of them,

571
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
interesting, other than, like, this guy is

572
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
stronger than that guy, and it's obvious.

573
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And that's it.

574
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The only thing that happens with the abilities

575
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
is to show them off in a battle, and then the character

576
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
is just sitting around forever.

577
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's...

578
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's almost as bad as Fairy Tail,

579
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
but at least the art looks nice.

580
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
By the way,

581
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
uh, remember how Grimjaw

582
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
just showed up again?

583
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He's been gone for years. Remember that?

584
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I remember that. I'm never gonna forget that.

585
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
He's called Blue Hair. He's cool. I like it.

586
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Bring him back.

587
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He was cool, but didn't he fucking die?

588
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I mean, I thought he did.

589
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Also, wasn't he, like, a bad guy or something?

590
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Why did he, like, suddenly show up to help

591
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Urahara?

592
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Every shown in real...

593
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Everyone who gets beat up by the hero who doesn't die

594
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
becomes good. That's just what happens.

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah.

596
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It doesn't work outside of Dragon Ball Z most of the time.

597
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
They just don't know how to do it.

598
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Also, um, why was, uh...

599
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Why was Kurosuchi never executed

600
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
for his millions of crimes against humanity?

601
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Like, it kind of rubs me the wrong way that he's, like,

602
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
still allowed to be a Soul Reaper at the end of the series,

603
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
considering he, like, mass-tortured,

604
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
like, thousands upon thousands of innocent people.

605
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
He's, like, the biggest monster in the entire series.

606
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You're talking about...

607
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You're talking about 12 captains, Science Man.

608
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah.

609
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah.

610
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He's the worst killer in the whole series.

611
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Um, yeah.

612
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Kinda.

613
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But because, like, I guess, like, the Soul Society

614
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
is just so corrupt to the core, no one minds.

615
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Dude, I'll tell you what it is. I'll tell you what it is.

616
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's just that I just don't remember that he committed...

617
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like, I just don't remember what he did.

618
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And yet he's still around doing things,

619
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
so I guess it wasn't a big deal.

620
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Like, remember, like, early on, when Urri you fought him,

621
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and he's like, I promise you, I will kill you one day.

622
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But then again, I guess not.

623
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
See you later, guy.

624
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah. He's kind of flippin' about that shit.

625
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He doesn't really care.

626
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's just, like, I guess, like, people like him,

627
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
because he says cool things while he tortures people

628
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and kills them, so he's, you know...

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
He was kind of cool in that he fought people

630
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
with science knowledge instead of, uh,

631
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you know, Zan Park co-shits.

632
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
There was that one fight when he was fighting

633
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the Science Arankah guy in Geocomando.

634
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That was a great fight.

635
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
When he, like, trapped him in an infinite torment

636
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
of nightmare land, that was pretty dope.

637
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Like, super slow motion.

638
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But he probably, like, practiced that technique

639
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
on, like, orphans and shit.

640
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
That's so true.

641
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
He definitely did. He definitely did.

642
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Man, yeah. Good point.

643
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's a hell worse than death.

644
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
He bribes all the policemen with his fashion money.

645
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He makes them sexy zones.

646
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Nobody cares.

647
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I mean, he made that bitch that,

648
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
remember, at one point,

649
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
in fact, after that exact fight,

650
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
there's, like, his lieutenant,

651
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
like, the clearly, like,

652
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
she's like a flesh golem or whatever.

653
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Nemu or whatever.

654
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, whatever her name is.

655
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
His flesh golem number two.

656
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
She, like, comes over to him and does what is

657
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
clearly implied to be, has sex with him

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
right then and there, and then, like, he's suddenly healed.

659
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it's, like, awesome.

660
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That's not even a criticism.

661
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I just love it.

662
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's the coolest thing.

663
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He's the only character in the whole series who has sex.

664
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And he's, uh, worse than Hitler.

665
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That makes me mean every character should be having sex

666
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
constantly.

667
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Ranji and Rukia should be having sex all the time.

668
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

669
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Ranji should be sexing Rukia with his fucking snake baboon.

670
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Whoa.

671
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, okay. I thought you were going to say sword, but no.

672
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay, yeah. Just the baboon that's fine.

673
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
With his Bankai.

674
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
He puts on the snake baboon suit

675
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and goes to camp.

676
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
He does the mating dance.

677
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Oh, do you think Rukia is kind of a

678
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
frigid in bed?

679
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No way. I think she's, I think she's

680
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
less loose.

681
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
She's got an icy sword, but she's hot.

682
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
She melts. She melts.

683
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah, she melts in your mouth, but not in your hands.

684
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Uh, man, this is just shit on

685
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
bleach for an hour.

686
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The podcast.

687
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I was going to try to bring in some positive things.

688
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I also didn't make sense.

689
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah, what's that?

690
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Uh, fucking Kiriko's

691
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
genius plan to make Kanpachi

692
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
learn his shikai or whatever.

693
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's like, okay, turns out

694
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Unahana is like the strongest, most badass

695
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
person ever.

696
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
First of all, never bought it for a second.

697
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So Kanpachi, you kill her

698
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
in the vain hope that maybe you'll get stronger.

699
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah.

700
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Lock the two of you in a room and you're not allowed to come out until she's dead

701
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
because she's the strongest

702
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and I, um,

703
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
because that's my plan, because I'm the leader now.

704
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm a smart man.

705
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The thing was...

706
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah, give, please try to explain this.

707
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
There's one thing that I think...

708
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's where I started to lose it. That's where it began.

709
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Well, I don't know whether...

710
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I feel like that was planned because I've heard that

711
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
in interviews, he says he likes the idea.

712
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Kubo likes the idea of

713
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
bad guys

714
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
looking like good guys and good guys

715
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
looking like bad guys.

716
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So the idea that the sweet captain was actually

717
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
a fucking crazy person.

718
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Maybe.

719
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
She did that really weird hairstyle, which

720
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
did turn out to be sort of relevant.

721
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, that part of it was cool, but I just don't understand.

722
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Why couldn't she train him

723
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
without dying?

724
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I guess he just wanted to get rid of her

725
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
because she never did anything.

726
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He never did anything.

727
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
He just personally didn't like her.

728
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She fought him

729
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
when he was a kid

730
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and he was the only person ever to wound her

731
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
or something.

732
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
He had to kill her

733
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to realize...

734
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He had to get as strong as he was

735
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
when he was 9

736
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
by killing her,

737
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and that would do something somehow.

738
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It was terrible writing.

739
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Kubo's a fucking idiot. He doesn't know how to write a manga.

740
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He's a bad man.

741
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He's a very bad man.

742
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He just...

743
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Man, God, like...

744
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He touched my heart.

745
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He touched my heart.

746
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He really did.

747
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's always said, but

748
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I can't even fully describe

749
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
how hype I was

750
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
at the end of the Soul Reaper

751
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
arc,

752
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
when, you know,

753
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Eisen reveals, it was me, Austin!

754
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It was me all along!

755
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
God, that honestly,

756
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
when he sweeps his hair back

757
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and takes off his glasses,

758
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
that was like...

759
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It turns from a nerd into a cool.

760
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
That was like the coolest thing

761
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
that ever happened in any anime I had ever seen.

762
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Just that hair!

763
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And like, he had all these plans

764
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
he had done, and like, he's strong...

765
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He did like Kido99

766
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
or Hado99 or whatever. He's like stronger than everybody.

767
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It was the cool...

768
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then, up in the sky,

769
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we see the sky crack open and this giant

770
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
guy look out, and it's like,

771
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
holy shit, what is this guy planning?

772
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Where is this gonna go from here?

773
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Wait, what was that eye?

774
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a shitty monster we see a while later

775
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
who just fucking dies.

776
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It should have been like the king of the hollows.

777
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It was just some big hollow.

778
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sucked. It was gay.

779
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

780
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It was never. And Eisen

781
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
stayed cool, kind of.

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You know, he was never intended

783
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
to be the actual main villain.

784
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It was originally going to be

785
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
what's his face.

786
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The guy with the little

787
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
dingley thing on the end of his head bobber

788
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that killed his mom. Grandfisher.

789
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Grandfisher. Yeah.

790
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Whatever happened to that guy?

791
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He got killed by Ichigo's dad.

792
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But the dad wasn't mad.

793
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He was like, I understand you killed my wife.

794
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
NBD dog. NBD.

795
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah.

796
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Never really... I'd be mad.

797
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'd be mad.

798
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
There's something that's like,

799
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
so much happens.

800
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Like characters die and things,

801
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
but I can't remember any of it.

802
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I barely remembered that

803
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
something happened to Ichigo's dad

804
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and that's why he's not around.

805
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Did he die? Who did he die to? I forgot.

806
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
That was revealed a while later.

807
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
He gave his power to Ichigo's mom

808
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
because she was a Quincy

809
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and she got attacked by a hollow.

810
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
He was around at the beginning.

811
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Ichigo's dad was around and he died sometime.

812
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He didn't die. What are you talking about?

813
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
He died? What?

814
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I think he died to give

815
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Ichigo the power to defeat Aizen

816
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
the first time or something.

817
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Like when he went black hair.

818
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh, he didn't die. They were just training.

819
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Wait, did he really die?

820
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I gotta look this up.

821
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't think we saw him since.

822
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
He wasn't in the last chapter.

823
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm googling this shit.

824
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I thought it was weird that he wasn't in the last chapter.

825
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
If you fucking died, man, I miss that shit.

826
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah, but the fact that we're confused about it

827
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and I can't really remember properly

828
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
is indicative of how shitty it feels.

829
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's just like all this stuff

830
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that's supposed to be hard-hitting

831
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and it's like, I don't know.

832
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
All this promise and potential

833
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and it just peters out into this long,

834
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
goopy fucking soup

835
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
through a straw.

836
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's just like drinking a bleach.

837
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Bleach up my ass.

838
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
A little umbrella.

839
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes.

840
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You know what bothered me

841
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and was just one of the big signs.

842
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Honestly, this was really late

843
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
but it was just something that always annoyed me

844
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
was that it turned out

845
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
and this was never really explained

846
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
but there were kind of some implications

847
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
about what was going on.

848
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So when Ichigo first gets his powers from Rukia

849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
the sword just appears in his hand

850
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
kind of out of nowhere

851
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and maybe it was Rukia's sword.

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't know, he kind of just gets his own sword.

853
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That was really cool.

854
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And then later on it evolves into

855
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
his big sword

856
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
that's like his release or whatever

857
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and all that was cool.

858
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But then later in the series

859
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
we find out that

860
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
there's this one hip-hop dude

861
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
who makes those swords

862
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and he gives them to people

863
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and then they just kind of like

864
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
grow into them and they just kind of imprint themselves.

865
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What the fuck was that shit?

866
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I thought it was much cooler

867
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
because he just has a sword.

868
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
They built it up like

869
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
they manifested from inside the people

870
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
which is why they were based so heavily on

871
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
their personalities and shit

872
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
which is why they were interesting

873
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and then he just pulls this fucking hip-hop guy out of his ass

874
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and says hi made him.

875
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That whole area up in the fucking sky

876
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
there's like the heaven of heaven

877
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
or whatever.

878
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's such a weird...

879
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's weird how they're just mortal

880
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
like everyone else

881
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
by with a big powerful weapon.

882
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I actually, I do like that

883
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
because they're all, in fact, the fact that they were

884
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
like, what do they call it?

885
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Got a goatee zero or something

886
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because they were like, they had all been captains

887
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
who were just like too fucking good

888
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
so they had to go up above

889
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and you know...

890
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
They all died or something, something happened.

891
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They lost.

892
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You know who was cool among those though?

893
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The best one was that lady

894
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
who was captain of squad 12

895
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
or, oh god, I don't even remember

896
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Uki Takei, no.

897
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Urahara.

898
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So there was the captain of 12 who leaves

899
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and she was like science lady.

900
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
She was this weird moon

901
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
science lady who we finally meet

902
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and she was so cool

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and then she just does like nothing

904
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and that, you know, that's really the story of Bleach.

905
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
A million characters show up

906
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and then they all do nothing.

907
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And then Ichigo does it.

908
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And then Ichigo just does it.

909
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It feels so wrong.

910
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It just went so wrong at some point.

911
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I hate that they have kids.

912
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That was the dumbest thing

913
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
that made me roll my eyes.

914
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's only been 10 years.

915
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So what did they just like immediately start making?

916
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Who the fuck...

917
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why does Japan promote fucking teenagers

918
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
having kids?

919
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Dude, I'll tell you why.

920
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's because their population is going down the tubes.

921
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
They need to encourage fucking on a massive scale.

922
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
They want to...

923
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The last chapters of shounen

924
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
mangoes.

925
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's how they do it.

926
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If they sell you out, a happy ending is

927
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to get married and have kids.

928
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm just telling you, that's in sync with Japan's current policy.

929
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't care about Ichigo's brat.

930
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't care about Rukia's fuck trophy.

931
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Who gives a shit? And why the fuck?

932
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Why is Rukia's kid a soul reaper?

933
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That doesn't make any...

934
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You could just be a soul reaper.

935
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The fucking kid cannot be older than nine years old.

936
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Does anyone understand

937
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the rules?

938
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
When you die, Rukia didn't start off

939
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
as a soul reaper, right?

940
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
When you die, you either

941
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
become a hollow if you're an evil person

942
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
or if you got regrets or whatever,

943
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
or you go to soul society

944
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and when you're there,

945
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
because you all start out in the shit place,

946
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but if you're really good, if you have strong

947
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
spiritual pressure, you can move up

948
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and become a shinigami, which is what Rukia did.

949
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
There's a revolving door

950
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
of souls that just go back and forth,

951
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but how do you become a human again?

952
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
How does that happen? Do you have to die as a soul reaper?

953
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah, I thought it was explained once

954
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that when a soul reaper dies,

955
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
he just becomes a new human.

956
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
He gets reincarnated or something.

957
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I miss that day in class.

958
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Why are soul reaper people

959
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
even able to have children

960
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
if that's also where dead people go?

961
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Where's that soul coming from?

962
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
People are being born there and dead people are going there.

963
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Wouldn't it have a massive overpopulation problem?

964
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't fucking know.

965
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I find it hard to believe

966
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
that after all that stuff that happened,

967
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Rukia just immediately

968
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
fucking spread him and said,

969
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
put a baby in me.

970
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Now that the guy is dead,

971
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the bad guy is dead, I want to start

972
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
popping out kids.

973
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Dude, it's been 10 years.

974
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Even after one year,

975
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'd probably be fine.

976
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't really think that's that big of a deal.

977
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Like I was saying, and I remember

978
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the ending felt very much like Naruto's ending,

979
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
where they show all the new kids.

980
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Like we're the new...

981
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
No one should ever have kids ever.

982
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I hate children, they shouldn't exist.

983
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I just realized,

984
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
why is Ichigo's son

985
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
a shinigami already?

986
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And how?

987
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because you is talking about Rukia's kid.

988
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I hate them both.

989
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But Ichigo caught his powers

990
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
but he's dead.

991
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Hang on, hang on, we have to establish

992
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that what actually happened is,

993
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
those guys were born,

994
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
they went to visit hip hop man,

995
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
he gave them little baby swords

996
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
for them to imprint themselves onto.

997
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They then carried those swords with them

998
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
all the time, until they made an impression on them

999
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and developed their shinigami powers.

1000
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Because as we know now,

1001
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
as wise bleach readers,

1002
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that's how you actually get a shinigami now.

1003
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You have to visit hip hop man

1004
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to get yourself a magic sword.

1005
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It just seems like really annoying

1006
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
to have a kid and just say

1007
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you're a soul reaper now.

1008
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Even with the soul reapers who look like kids,

1009
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
like Yachiru or Toshiro,

1010
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
they look like kids,

1011
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
but at least you think,

1012
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
well they just look like kids,

1013
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
they're actually 100 years old.

1014
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But this kid is literally a fucking baby!

1015
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What are the standards?

1016
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The standards are

1017
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Naruto ended,

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
now there's Ninja babies.

1019
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Is this just cronyism?

1020
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
She can like skirt the rules

1021
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and deem her child a soul reaper?

1022
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's irresponsible parenting.

1023
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He's gonna get eaten by a fucking grandfisher

1024
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
because he's a baby, he doesn't know how to wield

1025
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
that fucking sword.

1026
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's too big for his arms.

1027
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Alright, I'm gonna tell you the harsh reality, Jesse.

1028
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
No!

1029
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
When Naruto ends, you get Ninja baby kids.

1030
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
When Bleach ends,

1031
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you get little

1032
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
shinigami kids.

1033
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And one piece, when it ends,

1034
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you get little rubber pirate kids.

1035
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's just how it works, it's going to happen.

1036
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We can't fight against the tide of fate.

1037
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They're born as pirates?

1038
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
They're all wearing...

1039
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
They've got the fucking hats on and the...

1040
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
God, I hate Japan!

1041
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I hate them!

1042
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Two nukes was too few.

1043
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
We gotta finish the job.

1044
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Um...

1045
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You know, like at the end of Avangelion,

1046
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
when they had all those Ava babies...

1047
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah!

1048
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
When Asuka started popping out robots...

1049
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh my God.

1050
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Rey...

1051
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't know.

1052
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Rey was naked.

1053
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That counts.

1054
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Rey, I don't know.

1055
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Nobody knows.

1056
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay, let's take a break

1057
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and let's now

1058
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
talk about the good things

1059
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
that came of or that we remember from Bleach.

1060
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I've got some.

1061
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I loved several of the opening

1062
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and ending songs from Bleach.

1063
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The first one's great.

1064
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That one, Hanabi is great.

1065
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I forget, but you sure.

1066
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's like...

1067
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah!

1068
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
At least I think that's the one.

1069
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Whatever, there's a bunch of good ones.

1070
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And I liked it.

1071
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Bleach was one of the first series that I watched

1072
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
when I got into anime.

1073
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Bleach in its heyday was so stylish,

1074
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it was like nothing else, man.

1075
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It was the coolest.

1076
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It was the coolest in the future

1077
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
as a fashion designer.

1078
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's going to be great.

1079
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Maybe he'll join Square Enix

1080
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and start working on Final Fantasy.

1081
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh no!

1082
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's the worst possible fate!

1083
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
This is the darkest timeline!

1084
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Kubo, you need to go back to Bleach!

1085
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Make a detergent.

1086
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Just keep pumping him out.

1087
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Wait, what's Nirvana's next album?

1088
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
He needs to make Smells Like Teen Spirit.

1089
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Nevermind.

1090
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Uh...

1091
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh, god.

1092
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Imagine the things that Kubo could produce

1093
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
with Tetsuya Nomura if they teamed up.

1094
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The kind of belts, the kind of zippers...

1095
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They could make an anime so bad

1096
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
it would destroy the world!

1097
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It would cleanse the earth in fire!

1098
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Cleanse it in Bleach!

1099
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We need it. We need that.

1100
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I do like Kubo's artwork.

1101
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And the fact that he managed to do...

1102
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
His colors are gorgeous, for sure.

1103
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He managed to do a different

1104
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
little version of the

1105
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
number of the chapter in each chapter.

1106
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Which I thought was neat.

1107
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Oh yeah!

1108
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I did like that.

1109
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's just a little...

1110
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He's a good artist.

1111
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm just sad about it.

1112
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That is definitely true.

1113
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's talk about that.

1114
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
How good his art is.

1115
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I think just as a consequence of that...

1116
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
He probably spent so much time on it.

1117
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
He, you know, infamously

1118
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
wasn't one to spend too much time

1119
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
focusing on backgrounds.

1120
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But his character designs

1121
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
really always looked great.

1122
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And were some of the best in all of Shonen Jump.

1123
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Incidentally...

1124
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm just thinking about the art.

1125
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And I always think of this one when I think about good art.

1126
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Especially Rukia.

1127
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In their little devil costume here

1128
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
for this Halloween spread.

1129
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh god, look at Toshiro spreading his legs

1130
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
like a fucking slut.

1131
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
He's like, he's a child Kubo.

1132
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
He's a child.

1133
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
He's fucked up.

1134
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Who's the person in the little orange thing

1135
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
at the top?

1136
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Or he may.

1137
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
As a little plumpkin.

1138
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I think.

1139
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I assume.

1140
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What else was good?

1141
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You know what was cool?

1142
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
He had ginger hair.

1143
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
That's unusual.

1144
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, that was crazy.

1145
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That was the beginning when he had to defend himself

1146
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
from bullies.

1147
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Because his hair was a weird color.

1148
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Just because his mom had weird hair color.

1149
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I remember this one point.

1150
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This one part where, yeah, that bit.

1151
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But like...

1152
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The thing he said, I think he was like

1153
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
he just got his phone out and he started calling an ambulance.

1154
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And he said, before he started fighting them

1155
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
he said he's counting how many people there were.

1156
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Oh yeah!

1157
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That was so cool!

1158
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That's such a badass thing to do.

1159
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
He did another cool thing like that again.

1160
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He lost the bad boy thing fast.

1161
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
He just became like a

1162
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
what's all this Shinigami stuff

1163
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and then he was a deer in the headlights

1164
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
for the rest of the whole series.

1165
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, there's not much to say about Ichigo's personality

1166
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
unfortunately.

1167
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
He was very...

1168
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I gotta do it!

1169
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I gotta do it!

1170
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That's what he said every chapter.

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Remember that time guys

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
when he stood around and watched

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
because like he

1174
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
was the only one not under Aizen's

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Shikai control.

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Remember that time when he stood around

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and watched them stab

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the Lieutenant of Squad 5

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
in the back because they thought it was Aizen.

1180
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Remember when that happened?

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I remember when that happened.

1182
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That was awesome to me to go.

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Like he's just standing there like

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
what are these guys doing as like

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I forget who teleported behind

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Hannah through her stomach.

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Man.

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That was brutal.

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What an asshole.

1190
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Say something goddammit and then afterward

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
he's like guys what do you do

1192
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and guys

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
fuck you Ichigo you piece of shit.

1194
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You stupid idiot. You're the worst guy of all.

1195
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You ruined it.

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You know what was cool though?

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Kubo's favorite character was always Rangiku

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
just because she was a big fat titted bitch

1199
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and I respect him immensely for that.

1200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You know what was great about Bleach?

1201
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The porn.

1202
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
There is great porn of Bleach out there.

1203
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Of Rukia.

1204
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There's some good flash made by Zone.

1205
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Rukia's got a lot of porn

1206
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
or Hime actually doesn't

1207
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
have a lot of porn out there I think about it.

1208
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But really it's Rangiku.

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh and Yorichiru.

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yorichiru?

1211
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
The black cat.

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
She is the sexiest girl in all of Bleach.

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh my god I forgot this amazing doge

1214
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
and I read when I was a kid

1215
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
a ball about her and she was naked and they were taking

1216
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
a bath in the hot springs. Oh my god it was so sexy

1217
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
it was amazing. It was the coolest thing

1218
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
that ever happened to me in my entire life. Thank you Kubo.

1219
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I thank you every single day for making Yachiru

1220
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
or whatever the fuck her name was.

1221
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yorichiru she's the coolest oh my god.

1222
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yorichiruichi.

1223
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
She was the best.

1224
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Whatever.

1225
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
You know I'm talking about.

1226
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm gonna google black chick.

1227
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
This is what Bleach really is.

1228
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,200
Bleach a series of like pretty images no one remembers the name of any of the

1229
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,560
characters yoruichi there it is yoruichi that's the one yoruichi was the

1230
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,600
best character and you know it was cool she would just show up not even she's

1231
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,000
a she's a shini guy but she doesn't even eat her sword she just gets like

1232
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,800
weapons from from urahara and just punches people and they fucking die all

1233
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,920
she needs to be naked beat people that's right she gave what if what if she was

1234
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,520
having in a porn and you just turn into a cat for some reason that's what I

1235
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,480
explained oh yeah go on what if she did that while somebody had a penis in her

1236
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:42,160
and then they would be fucking her pussy they'll say the line that everyone

1237
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,520
says about that a cat is fine too that's a meme that's a that's an a meme

1238
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,640
because there's there's a dojin about me there's a dojin about yeah there's a

1239
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,320
dojin about a dude like chasing some lolly or something and he's gonna fuck

1240
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,800
her and then she just turns into a cat and she's like hi I've got you now he's

1241
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:06,480
just like a cat is fine too dog I'm a raw dog in this shit whoa he's raw dog in

1242
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:20,920
this cat yes so okay so Bleach is done so we're dead for a while and I don't

1243
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,360
even count the new thing as Bleach as was Naruto because it sucks Bleach has

1244
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,280
kind of been out of the big three for a while has it I've always considered it

1245
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,120
still part of the big three I know we do but if you keep if you keep up on like

1246
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,680
the Shonen Jump scene like Ichigo does not show up in like the big like whenever

1247
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,520
they show like the main characters of Shonen Jump it's always Luffy and then

1248
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,680
Toriko a lot of the time and then like there's another spot is kind of just

1249
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,320
open for debate but it is it's not Ichigo like he doesn't make it into the top

1250
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,000
ranks anymore and it's it's cuz this thing was less popular obviously so like

1251
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,760
there's something about like the covers well I'm talking about the popularity of

1252
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,080
series you know of Shonen Jump because you know like there was this whole

1253
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,920
thing about Naruto Bleach and One Piece because they were by far the most

1254
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,720
popularly series at least in America but also in Japan they just sold the best

1255
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,720
and they lasted the longest and they were always in the cover of everything

1256
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,440
Bleach has faded away Naruto is done Naruto retired pretty much at the top

1257
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,760
but One Piece is actually the top and has been for a long time but I'm just I

1258
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,120
mean I'm interested to see if something will rise to take its place or if maybe

1259
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,360
they're not gonna do as long-running series anymore I mean Toriko is ending

1260
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,160
pretty soon so that'll be like only one piece will remain as like a big long

1261
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,640
running thing I mean I guess it was that's a different magazine I don't

1262
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,400
know what I'm talking about I'm just I'm just saying the legacy of Bleach is

1263
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,720
coming to an end and it just fills me with wonder about about what the future

1264
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,800
holds especially for Shonen Monk well it's hard to to think about what's gonna

1265
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,120
happen because when it first came out when Naruto and Bleach were big yeah

1266
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,440
coming out we were like teenagers we didn't know what the scene was like we

1267
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,440
didn't understand what had come before we didn't really know anything about all

1268
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,520
that shit true and now there's been going for so many years like there's

1269
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,160
not really where any way you can predict there's no reason that this should be the

1270
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,680
way it continues there's no reason it's always gonna be a big three it could

1271
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,880
just be that One Piece is the best forever and everyone loves it I think years

1272
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,960
to come well that is when that is when that ends there might not even be

1273
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,360
anything to come and take it up to take up the mantle of the best one you know

1274
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,120
yeah I've been thinking about this for a while and it's really dawned on me

1275
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,320
lately that like I mean One Piece is read mostly by like 40% of the One Piece

1276
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,520
readers are between like 18 and 25 or like 18 and 30 or something so that like

1277
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:00,000
most people read it but everything in Shonen Jump isn't made for like a 26

1278
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,680
year old man like me like I don't even fit in that category anymore I'm like

1279
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,120
older than that now and it just like they're they're appealing to kids with

1280
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,840
this shit and like when I think about like over the years I've gained a lot

1281
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,400
of knowledge about Shonen and like I'm able to recognize tropes and like I

1282
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,880
could read a series like Bleach from the start now and I would I pretty well

1283
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,000
Bleach took a lot of twists and turns but for the most part I'd be able to know

1284
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,440
like where it's generally going and so there's not a lot of mystery in it the

1285
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,920
mystery lies in like the specifics of like oh what's the bonkai gonna be like

1286
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,280
what are the in-universe like surprises and twists gonna be but like if you

1287
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,560
don't buy into that as much which I'm doing less and less I noticed it myself

1288
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:50,360
like less Shonen have that kind of like instant grab on me these days but but

1289
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:56,080
like I'm not the the people they're trying to get to buy the magazines in

1290
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,640
Japan to like you know fun Shonen Jump they're trying to get like 10 year old

1291
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,680
boys like 12 year old boys in Japan because Shonen Jump I don't even

1292
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,160
sold it I do think that like there's a lot of people in your similar situation

1293
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,080
like there yeah they grew up on on Shonen Manga and like we're like the first

1294
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,520
generation and then raised on this shit yeah I guess I'm not sure I'm talking

1295
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,600
about Shonen Manga well maybe not but like there's clearly gonna be like

1296
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:29,160
people making cool stuff for our demographic like not just for our

1297
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,480
demographic but people of our demographic can enjoy I mean Steven

1298
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,880
universe is a stretch but it's it's that sort of like that's really cool for the

1299
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,040
gay demographic though you know what I mean though it's like it's it's like a

1300
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,880
action show but it's also like got a lot of themes I mean or resonate with people

1301
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,680
of any age classic example is my little pony which you know is for little

1302
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:59,360
girls but not bad not bad not bad was I was gonna say something else forget well

1303
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:06,160
if it comes you can say it um yeah I don't know I just I'm interested in as

1304
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,320
I'm getting older I'm taking more and more notice that like there were things

1305
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,580
and it was gonna say okay go ahead go ahead I think that the things that we

1306
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:21,980
like in one piece that still are cool yeah it's like the the willingness to

1307
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,300
not take itself so seriously because like when we were younger we enjoy things

1308
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,860
that are like serious and like really emo and dark have you guys seen elfin

1309
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,900
lead it's the best anime I've ever yeah and when you get older you're like that's

1310
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,860
stupid yeah yeah but like if something is like deliberately stupid in that sort

1311
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:49,820
of cool way kind of show came up and it was like it was more literally just a

1312
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:53,540
bunch of skeletons and a guy with a cool sword and a bunch of guys with cool

1313
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,860
swords killing skeletons yeah and that was all it was then first of all be the

1314
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,860
best thing of all time yes exactly it's like it doesn't it doesn't care about

1315
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:07,180
being a serious thing yeah has all the cool fun action that we liked from stuff

1316
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,700
like bleach yeah that's that's that's cool I like stuff like that as long as I

1317
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:18,780
want to make stuff like that I agree I agree though I have I have slightly

1318
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,380
loftier ass well not not I don't want to say loftier but I want to use

1319
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:29,780
entertainment to educate people and to control the destiny of humanity to make

1320
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:34,780
it better and smarter and cooler that's those are my goals in life

1321
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:39,620
surprise that we got to a place where I could say that in this bleach podcast

1322
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:47,220
it's utterly shit but yeah I want to lick Rukias but I want to put my tongue

1323
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,180
right between her butt cheeks I want to lick her anus then I want to she's

1324
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:58,700
called inside all fist inside of her butt and then I want to raise my fist in

1325
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:14,380
the air and as you remove it and gaze at that permanently wide hole you'll say

1326
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:23,620
don't you forget about me Rukia and she won't she'll never be able to by the way

1327
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,580
I'm just I'm looking at this Halloween thing again and I'm just noticing that

1328
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:34,260
Kubo took the time to deliberately draw Rangiku's nipple sticking through her

1329
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,860
thing and you know that's really what I respect about Kubo at the end of the

1330
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,380
day the fact that he would take the effort to do that to clearly draw the

1331
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:47,580
nipple visible through her outfit ten out of ten ghosts have nipples anyway

1332
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,900
sheenie gammy aren't ghosts they're Japanese Samurai's of the dead wait

1333
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,780
actually I guess they are like literally death gods oh yeah death god it means

1334
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,260
death god but gods are like ghosts so you're right never mind why is the

1335
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:09,380
afterlife so weirdly based on like Japanese culture why you don't get it

1336
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,980
Irish the real world the real world is based off of the afterlife the

1337
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,700
Japanese are the ones that got it right yeah everyone else fucked it up okay I

1338
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,900
actually think that sort of makes sense and it's because sheenie gammy

1339
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,540
inherently are a Japanese concept so it makes sense for like their culture to

1340
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,860
be Japanese where all the Shinigami are from which are a very specific thing

1341
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,500
like these are Japanese death you know what would have been really cool was that

1342
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,580
I know it would have been like another new set of things but wouldn't it be cool

1343
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,420
if like there was more than just you know the Japanese death god is sheenie

1344
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,460
gammy area and then there's plenty guys who are like German but what I mean is

1345
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:57,020
like you go over to another realm and it's like oh it's the European like all

1346
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,860
that all that Viking stuff like the what's it called Valhalla you go there

1347
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:07,420
you see these big fat guys with beers and ale and you're like yeah and but they

1348
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,660
have source they're they don't have source they have axes with names I'd watch

1349
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,420
that and watch that show and then they could they'd be cool but then there'll

1350
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,580
be more characters and more things and I'll be like oh no that's too many well

1351
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,620
I mean if it was still just like the gimmick of Zanpak toes just you know

1352
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,380
you know I mean they could call it that or they could give it a different name

1353
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,340
but it's the same thing like that doesn't clutter things at all that's just

1354
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,220
the same shit he's just new powers you know that's no that's no worse I think

1355
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,740
that's see that's the sort of thing I'd prefer over like full bringers or just

1356
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:44,500
like whatever Quincy's new Quincy's with Magic Quincy like there's there's the

1357
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:57,100
new Quincy's right now I think we've tired of retired of this topic bleach

1358
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,860
sucks but it was kind of good once the end I think that pretty much sums it up

1359
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:12,020
I I think I'll miss bleach a little bit mostly because I found bleach at a time

1360
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,420
in my life when I was first really getting into anime like I might even

1361
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,540
have watched it like before I got into one piece in a big way but it was all

1362
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,620
around that time when I watched like every anime I could find in high school

1363
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:30,980
and it really really made a strong impression on me and so on that basis

1364
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:38,620
I'm glad it was around it introduced me it's it's you know it's kind of like a

1365
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,340
decent starter anime you just can't have too high expectations for what it's

1366
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,260
gonna do I would recommend the people who haven't read bleach go read the first

1367
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,900
like to the end of the first arc when you know when Ichigo wins he gets his

1368
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,420
Bunkine wins and then just make up your own ending you know like you just skip

1369
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,300
to the last two chapters because you're done don't even worry about it but I

1370
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,900
think that first part's worth reading if you're into shonen I like it rookie is

1371
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,220
cool each goes cool no each goes actually not cool only rookie is cool

1372
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,540
Renji was cool Renji and rookie had deserved their own series yeah yeah that's

1373
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:23,060
it what's that put my whole fist right up her bungle okay that's it we're done

1374
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:28,940
talking about bleach thanks for listening everybody goodbye
