1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
You're gonna go to the record store, you're gonna give them all your money.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,600
Radio plays what they want you to hear, so it's cool, I just don't believe it.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,480
Sell out with me, oh yeah, sell out with me tonight.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,000
The record company's only giving me lots of money and everything's gonna be alright.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,080
Everybody go crazy!

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Woohoo!

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Yay!

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Alright!

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,960
I love my arms when I come up with it.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
I like dig.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,080
The topic today is the most bestest one there has ever been, selling out everything, giving

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,400
it all away, and I'm gonna do the thing we haven't done in a million years, I'm gonna

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
read the Urban Dictionary definition, cause it's cool for this one.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,560
Alright, to compromise one's values and or artistic vision in order to gain fame and

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,600
or monetary profit, commonplace in today's musical society, it is rare to find a successful

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,400
musical artist who has not sold out, however this is not to say that they do not exist.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
And that's it.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
That was a bunch of unnecessary bullshit.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Was that the end?

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,200
But, I don't know, anyway, I'm just gonna state my opinion right now, selling out is

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,560
the only way to live your life.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,480
If you're not selling out, you're doing it wrong.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Do we not introduce everybody anymore?

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Artistic integrity is dead.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
It needs to be buried.

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
What?

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
What?

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Do we not introduce everybody anymore on the spot?

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Oh shit, I totally forgot.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Jesus Christ!

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Alright!

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,520
Alright, we got the Patreon.com slash Ben St.

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,920

The DeVoo Collective.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't make my own videos, I just do Digi videos.

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,080
So go to Patreon.com slash DigiBro instead.

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
The 21st century digital boy.

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
That's me.

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Patreon.com slash DigiBro.

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,400
It's not you hippo shit.

43
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
That's not me.

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Mother's Basements.

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Patreon.com slash Mother's Basement.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you very much.

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Is there an apostrophe in there?

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,600
No, it's just all Mother's Basement with no punctuation whatsoever.

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Alright, endless jessicles, Greek warrior.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,720
We're the pussy gangsters, give me some macaroni.

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,080
And me bestie boy, your favorite guy.

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,040
Okay, so you already heard what I have to say, who's got an opinion on selling out?

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,360
Jesse, what do you think about selling out?

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
I want to hear what you have to say.

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,800
I was going to say something, but I got confused because you fucking started introducing us.

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay, we'll say it now.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,760
So, yeah, it's, so selling out to me is just, yeah, when someone compromises their values

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,520
or their intent for greater success or marketability or whatever, but here's an interesting conundrum.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,360
What if your intent is to sell out?

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,840
What if your values are making money and that's all that you care about?

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Case in point, Man Child Incorporated.

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
Yes, yeah, yeah, that's right.

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,000
So Man Child Incorporated is essentially just a parody of selling out, but it's not a very

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,200
good parody because I'm incapable of not making good videos.

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,200
Yes, it's one flaw.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760
He can't sell out hard enough.

67
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Yeah, like the idea was, yeah, all the videos are going to be really bad and stupid, but

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,960
isn't possible.

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Everything I do is gold.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,880
Right, yeah, when was the last Man Child Incorporated video?

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Oh, so long.

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
So long.

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Like February.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh, no.

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
What was that, Ben?

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,120
You said that all dismissively, like I haven't made a good video since then, let me tell

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
you something.

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I think that's exactly what Ben would say.

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Listen, buddy!

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Listen, buddy!

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,200
You know, I may be a dick, Jesse, but I say that because I miss Colt Corona is what I

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
really miss.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,280
And I want to know what happens with that fucking scepter and crown.

84
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
He's still in the furnace room.

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
He won't come out.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,840
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, tell us about the light in the furnace room.

87
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh yeah, yeah, so there's this meme going around that Colt Corona is fictional.

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know where it came from, but people just don't believe in him, even though he's

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,600
clearly there on video all the time, or at least he used to be before he barricaded himself

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,640
in the furnace room and started calling a horse you haven't.

91
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,440
He's out of his fucking mind, but you know, sometimes just to prove it even more so, sometimes

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,920
I'll be walking around my room and that damn light will be on in there.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,360
I didn't turn that damn light on.

94
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,280
That light is just on sometimes.

95
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,840
And so there's your proof right there.

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I put that down.

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
There you go.

98
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,400
If you pause the video and you freeze-frame it at this one frame, you'll see a beam of

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
light that couldn't possibly be computer-generated.

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,920
And if you look in the background of the video...

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,480
And then Jeff made reference to something that one of Jesse's stupid-ass fans did that

102
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,360
we were trying to keep underwrapped so that nobody else would make the same mistake.

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Oh no, you motherfucker!

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
Stop!

105
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Everyone stop!

106
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Shut up right now!

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,480
Whoever the fuck is editing this, if you don't take that shit out, I will come down

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,760
on you with the fury of a thousand gods!

109
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Thank you, Jeff, for even saying that!

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I'm legitimately pissed off right now!

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
God damn it!

112
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
God damn it!

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
God damn it!

114
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
HIPPO, HIPPO, HIPPO!

115
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
You were saying something a while back.

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
What were you saying?

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, yeah, it's about the topic at hand, actually.

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Okay, okay, go on.

119
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,280
There's one thing that a lot of, like, YouTubers have done to sort of make selling out or like

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,960
selling stuff in general more palatable to people, which I'm kind of sick of.

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,760
It's making it into a joke every single time.

122
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Like, lol, look at me, I'mma sell out, whoa!

123
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Yeah, let's you have your fake eating too, it lets you sell out, but if you're kind of

124
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,760
self-aware about it, it's okay, it's funny.

125
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,760
I think that's stupid.

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I think being truly self-aware is understanding that selling out isn't a bad thing.

127
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
That's true, but it wasn't done yet.

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,280
It's not even really selling out though, they're just selling a product or promoting something

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,760
and they're just saying, whoa, I'm horrible and terrible, lol, buy it anyway, you know,

130
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
that just, I don't know.

131
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
I very much agree.

132
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I very much agree.

133
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,160
But you know, just like, there's this thing that tons of YouTubers are doing now where

134
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,000
at the end of their videos, they'll just do a little spiel about, you know, crunchy

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,160
roll or a fucking loot crate, any of that, and you know, those are annoying.

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,140
I usually just turn off the video, I don't like them, I think the video would be better

137
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,280
without them, but they don't really bother me.

138
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,680
But just the other day, fucking George Weidman of fucking bunny shits like put at the beginning

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,880
of this really cool video I wanted to watch about Dark Souls 3 or something, I can't remember.

140
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,920
Like he just inserts this like two minute long speech about, I think it was loot crate,

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,240
it was the most obnoxious fucking thing I've ever seen in my time, I just put it at the

142
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
end.

143
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
What?

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,560
I gotta say, I thought that was, like, I think he's way smarter for doing it the way

145
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,480
he did, and honestly, like, here's the thing, everyone puts them at the end, no one fucking

146
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
watches your ad at the end of your video.

147
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
Yeah, cause no one wants to see them.

148
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,220
Right, exactly.

149
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,760
Which means that they're not gonna make any fucking money, which means you shouldn't

150
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
put the ad in there in the first place, cause you're not making anything.

151
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,040
I didn't even watch the video, cause it was so bad, I had to do something else with my

152
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
time.

153
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Yeah, you did it, but everyone else did.

154
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I did.

155
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,760
I watched the whole video, because of course I wanted to watch it, it was a 30 minute video

156
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,920
about Dark Souls.

157
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
But did you buy a loot crate?

158
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,680
Well, I already know about loot crate, and I've had my own advertising for them before.

159
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Well, we're not really the best judge.

160
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,120
That's by far one of the biggest problems with ads on YouTube is there's so few sponsors

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,640
going around, Audible and Crunchyroll and Loot Crate and the toaster.

162
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,160
You see the same thing all the time.

163
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,080
T-Blocks.com where you can use promo code M-Basement 15 to get 15% off a t-shirt sent

164
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
straight to your door.

165
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Guys, we're just gonna have to start our own merchandise and make our own company so we

166
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
can advertise ourselves.

167
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Like, we're just, there's not enough.

168
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,080
You know, I've been kicking around an idea for a while of having a YouTuber Daki Makara

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
company.

170
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Just selling Daki Makara's.

171
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Oh my gosh.

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
That would make so much money.

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Jesus fucking Christ.

174
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,080
I'm so angry thinking about how much money that would make.

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
We gotta get on it, man.

176
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,080
Just get Digibro on a pillow, and obviously, Nate, the sexiest man on a pillow is my Digibro.

177
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,600
The problem with that is, though, is for half the YouTubers out there, you'd have to have

178
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
double XL wide pillows for that to be practical.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,600
If he's gonna make Movie Bob, just make a bedsheet like yours.

180
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
He'd be a couch.

181
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You just gotta sell a couch.

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I would honestly buy a Movie Bob Daki Makara.

183
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Movie Bob bedspread?

184
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
You mean a Movie Bob futon?

185
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Because that's what it would end up being.

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Yeah, that's right.

187
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Holy shit.

188
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I'd wake up every day and turn to him in my sleep and nuzzle his fat Daki Makara neck

189
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:44,600
and say, sorry for 9-11, and he would turn back to me in my dreams and say, me too.

190
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Ben, Ben, I wanted to ask you.

191
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
You seem to me to have something of a complex relationship with selling out, so on the one

192
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
hand, you seem to really hate everything that makes money for people that isn't, I don't

193
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
know, artistically whatever.

194
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I hate everything that makes people more money than I think they deserve.

195
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Yeah, okay, sure, sure.

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600
But on the other hand, you'd like to go advertise your shit around places, and I mean, not

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,600
that that's not really selling out, but it's marketing, I guess, which is similar, I guess.

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I try to promote myself.

199
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I post my shit around in places that I think it will be seen by people who it's relevant

200
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
to.

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I mean, I don't like that.

202
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I don't like doing it, but it's the only way to get seen, and I accept that.

203
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
It's a necessary evil.

204
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I don't think that's the same.

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I think we can all agree on that.

206
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I think that's part of, yeah, it's like what Jesse was saying.

207
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I mean, I agreed with the first half of what Jesse was saying and not the second.

208
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
It's only selling out if you compromise your artistic integrity.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah, but here's the thing.

210
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I don't think advertising yourself does that.

211
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
That's totally unrelated to the word.

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
A lot of times, your artistic integrity isn't all that interesting anyway.

213
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
You have to really decide if it's worth it.

214
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
One of my favorite movies is that thing you do.

215
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
It's a Tom Hanks movie from the 90s.

216
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,600
It's about this teenage band who gets really big, and it's just a fun, happy movie about

217
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,600
them getting big, and at no point does the movie go, oh man, this is such a bad deal

218
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
that they're conforming to exactly what the label wants them to do.

219
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
It's all shown as a pretty good idea.

220
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Tom Hanks plays this manager who shapes their image, and all of his ideas are good ideas,

221
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
even if they're artificial and they work, and then there's one character, one member of the band,

222
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
who's like, oh, why are we doing covers?

223
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Oh, why are we controlling our image?

224
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Why don't we just play our own songs, and this and this and that, and everyone hates him,

225
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
and he's a big penis butt jerk.

226
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,600
That's very interesting to view, and that's exactly what I wanted to talk about,

227
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,600
as opposed to like, because it's pretty obvious when you've got a dude who just sticks a big ad

228
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,600
in the middle of his video or whatever, but what's much less noticeable is the way that people

229
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,600
tailor their content, and not just by making top tens about whatever the popular thing is,

230
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,600
but by, like, Digi's gotten very good at this, about structuring his videos.

231
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah, the consumable chunks.

232
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
It always segues into talking about the pageant.

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
No, they segue, they segue.

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
No, no, no, no, if it's in a Digi video, it's a segue.

235
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Fucking animal!

236
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
You fucking animal!

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
It's a Digi video, alright?

238
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
It's a Digi video.

239
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
It's a Digi video specifically.

240
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Tell me about how much cooler Segyu sounds than Segway.

241
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Tell me about that.

242
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Yeah, Mother Segway makes you picture the thing.

243
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Anyway, with what DeVu was saying, for an example that the rest of us know, Bakumon,

244
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
we were talking about it.

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I was gonna say, that's the big one, that's the big one.

246
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,600
It's about the glory and the power and the wonderful thing that is

247
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
telling your content to the mass appeal.

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Somewhere in the middle of the story, you know, Ashiro Gimudo goes to Hattori,

249
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
the editor, and they're like, you know, what about, you know, does being popular

250
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
mean it's good?

251
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Like, isn't popularity independent from artistic integrity and Hattori just like,

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
look, I know a lot of people struggle with this, but I just really try not to think about it.

253
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
If something is popular, that means lots of people like it, which in a certain sense

254
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
means it's good.

255
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Yeah, and like, to all the people that like it, it is good.

256
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Therefore, popularity and goodness are kind of...

257
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
What an amazing speech that was.

258
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,600
That was like the most interesting thing to me in the entire series, but...

259
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
It was up there.

260
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, let's go on Davoo, go on.

261
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
A couple of years ago, when I was getting into doing YouTube full time, right,

262
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,600
and I was really inspired by the big analytical think pieces, there were things that were

263
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,600
really deep and complex, and that was what I was into developing my skills on,

264
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
is doing analysis, and at a certain point, I had made a video that I thought,

265
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,600
alright, there's a lot of great analysis in here, had another video that was like,

266
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
alright, this is a great story that I'm weaving about a guy,

267
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,600
and now I'm like, okay, I've gotten good at the baseline skills at making videos.

268
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,600
So, from then on, what's really been exciting me since then is finding something

269
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,600
that is also really good, but is also something that's mainstream.

270
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,600
It's looking at the Venn diagram of what is great and what is popular,

271
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,600
and searching for everything that's in between, and that's what excites me.

272
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
That's the skills I want to develop.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Yeah, to relate that just to Bakumon, because Bakumon, like the Ashurigamuto,

274
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
understands that what they're best at is that, what's the term they use for it?

275
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Serious humor.

276
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Serious humor, that's exactly the word I was looking for.

277
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,600
And so their big successful series later on is like Tonto, which is like this gag series,

278
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
that one never really gets off, it's all their other series that play more to their strengths

279
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,600
when they can find a way to capture what they're good at, and then tailor it to the mass audience.

280
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
That's what it's all about.

281
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I think that the way, I think that the only way to be successful and not selling,

282
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
like you can be successful and sell out, but there's such a thing as success without selling out.

283
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,600
And I think that happens when people, like you're making what you want to make,

284
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
but it also happens to be stuff that people want to see.

285
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Like you have to find something that is what you want to do,

286
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
but that other people also want you to do.

287
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
And you know, in my humble opinion, I think that those people are just plain lucky to be that kind of person.

288
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I mean, I'm not sure that it's really...

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,600
I mean, Ashiro Gimudo had to go through lots and lots of iterations before they found something that's all good.

290
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah, exactly. I wouldn't call them lucky at all.

291
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I wouldn't call them luck, that was hard work and perseverance.

292
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm just saying someone from the start who did that would be a lucky person.

293
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah, a lot of mangaka, they have like a bunch of unsuccessful series

294
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
before they find something that really speaks to people.

295
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Like Araki made Bao before he made Jojo.

296
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I forget his name, but the Master of All Manga made Magic Kaito before he made Detective Conan,

297
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,600
which is the most successful media franchise of all time or something like that.

298
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,600
It's not even close to that, but it is.

299
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,600
No, but I think it's the longest running anime of all time.

300
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Probably.

301
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Anime, maybe.

302
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
What about The Simpsons?

303
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Well, I mean, of course, Matt Groening, the phenomenal mangaka,

304
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
who made The Simpsons and then realized that he'd sold out too much

305
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
and went back and made the artistic masterpiece that is Futurama.

306
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Yeah.

307
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah, no, but like a lot of the time you do have to iterate on ideas

308
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,600
before you find something that speaks to people, unless you're a genius like me

309
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,600
and you make what's in an OP as your very first video and people just flock to you.

310
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Well, Jeff, we need you to talk to you.

311
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Because you're the master of selling out in this group.

312
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I am.

313
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Hang on.

314
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I want to ask Jeff, because I've been curious about this.

315
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Your content does seem very, you know, appropriate for this stuff.

316
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
And I want to ask, how much of being like a journalist helped you, like,

317
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
prepare you for your YouTube stuff?

318
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I assume it was massively.

319
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Oh, okay.

320
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,600
So the one thing that you guys who only ever concern yourselves with making good videos

321
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,600
that are well-edited and well-voiced acted, don't get, is that, like,

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
one of the most important things to YouTube video success is your description,

323
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
your tags, and your title.

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,600
And, like, not just in terms of clickbait, in terms of if you have keywords

325
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
that people are searching all the time in your description, your tags, and your title,

326
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,600
that will factor into how often you get searched.

327
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,600
So part of what has, that's something that gets drilled into your head

328
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,600
when you're a text journalist, is keywords, especially in the first two paragraphs of your article,

329
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,600
keywords, all the fuck over your title, and keywords in your tags.

330
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
And that means...

331
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Is this specifically for search stuff?

332
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Yeah, Google search stuff.

333
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
That in, like, collected stuff too.

334
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Like, okay, when I was an animator, because I learned this as well from my text blog,

335
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
where, what the hell, I heard a woman's voice.

336
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Jesse, are you in a Skype call at the same time or something?

337
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
He would be.

338
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
When I was doing text blogging, there was, like, a period where I was part of...

339
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
There's this website called Anime Something.

340
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I don't remember the fucking name of it, but it was, like, an aggregator of RSS feeds.

341
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,600
So, basically, it was a website you went to, and it would be a collection of the newest posts

342
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,600
from every anime blog that was a part of that site.

343
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,600
And so, there'd, you know, be, like, hundreds of anime blogs,

344
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
and every time you checked, there'd be new stuff, and it was kind of like...

345
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
There wasn't a huge reader base for it, but if you had a brand new blog,

346
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
this was how you got off the ground.

347
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Like, get your URL onto that site, and that way, you'll get at least, like, 30 readers, you know?

348
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
And then, from there, you've got a kind of word-of-mouth spread.

349
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
But, like, so I was on there, and at some point, I realized that, like,

350
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
a lot of my posts would just not get, like, any initial views,

351
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
and then someone messaged me, and they were like,

352
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,600
you realize that that aggregator will post the title and the first, like, paragraph of your post

353
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
is what it would share.

354
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
And with, they had, because they have advertisers,

355
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,600
you couldn't have any swear words in the title or first couple sentences.

356
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh.

357
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Oh.

358
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh.

359
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Interesting.

360
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Miss Jizzabelle.

361
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Hahaha.

362
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Okay.

363
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Wow.

364
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, my God, it's the promised secretary at long last.

365
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
This is her debut.

366
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Well, welcome.

367
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Welcome to the DeVoo Collective.

368
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
We're so happy to have you.

369
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
No.

370
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
No, she's always been here.

371
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,600
She's a representative of Endless Jess, and therefore...

372
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Yeah.

373
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
It's the fucking...

374
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
She's the one who leaves.

375
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
If you've ever had a comment on Manchild Incorporated...

376
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I thought she was the secretary of Manchild Inc.

377
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Yeah.

378
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
I thought so, too.

379
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Oh, yeah.

380
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Manchild Incorporated, not Endless Jess.

381
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm sorry, those are completely different brands,

382
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
from what I'm talking about.

383
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
This Jesson from Endless Jess.

384
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
You all suck.

385
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Hahaha.

386
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
That's a fair point.

387
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Holy shit.

388
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Okay.

389
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,600
So, back onto the subject of SEO.

390
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
That is very important.

391
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Wait, what's SEO?

392
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Search engine optimization.

393
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, okay.

394
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm such a noob.

395
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Alright, Jesson.

396
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
YouTube is...

397
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
They all suck.

398
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Go to hell.

399
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Fuck you, especially Jeff.

400
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Goodbye.

401
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Is he writing you a script over there?

402
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Is he like sending over like...

403
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
What is that?

404
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Using the fucking...

405
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
He's writing cue cards.

406
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
No, he's pushing the button on his...

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Like intercom thing, you know?

408
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
No, no.

409
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
What I'm imagining is, is Jesse sitting across the room

410
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
with a Morse code tapper, and she's sitting across the room

411
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
in front of the microphone, interpreting that,

412
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
writing it out, and interpreting the words,

413
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
and where are you getting into the mic?

414
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Okay, Jeff, go on.

415
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Search engine optimization.

416
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Search engine optimization.

417
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Because, like, what YouTube is, fundamentally,

418
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
is it's three things.

419
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
It's a video platform, obviously.

420
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
It's a landing page that recommends videos to you,

421
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
and then it's a search engine.

422
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
So, knowing how to game search engines

423
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
to get more relevant hits off of search terms

424
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
is super important for being successful on YouTube.

425
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
So can you give us the example of how you do that

426
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
with what's in an OP?

427
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Where's my secretary, Jesse?

428
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Hey!

429
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Jesse.

430
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Jezebel Jezemeen, what are you doing

431
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
conforming with these losers?

432
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
It's time for my goddamn butt massage.

433
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Get off that stupid fucking podcast

434
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
you're coming with me.

435
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
There's a whole fucking...

436
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Sorry, sir.

437
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
There's a whole...

438
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Shut up! You don't get to talk!

439
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
There's a man-child narrative going on right now.

440
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
There's a supply.

441
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
I need my butt massage!

442
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I need my penis massage!

443
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Yeah!

444
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
We're out of here!

445
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh, my God.

446
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Go on, Jeff.

447
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Try to force your way.

448
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah, so, functionally, the way that you do that

449
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
is you make sure to include the title

450
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
of whatever you're talking about

451
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
in either the first line of your description,

452
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
or your title, or ideally both.

453
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Then you want to tag companies,

454
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
creators, musicians,

455
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
and anything that people might search

456
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
related to your thing.

457
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
So, oh, I left my phone on

458
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
because I'm a sellout, too.

459
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
That's the sound of selling out.

460
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
That's the sound of money coming in, baby!

461
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
That's the sound of money coming in.

462
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Yep.

463
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
So...

464
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
It's a distinct Cha-ching cadence, too.

465
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah, that's right.

466
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Yeah, only Jeff would have a Cha-ching sound.

467
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I actually do, too.

468
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Now that's the sellout we can believe in.

469
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
My text sound effect is the Cha-ching

470
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
from Roller Coaster Tycoon.

471
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Of course.

472
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
That's a good sound effect.

473
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah, so...

474
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
So what you want to do,

475
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
like, what I do with What's in an OP

476
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
is I always make sure to put, you know,

477
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
the name of the song

478
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
that is the opening theme song,

479
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
the name of the director

480
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
or the mangaka who created the series,

481
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
the name of the company is responsible for making it,

482
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,600
the name of the series itself

483
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
and any possible abbreviations,

484
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
and usually,

485
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
if there's a commonly used abbreviation,

486
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I'll use the short form, like FMA in the title,

487
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
and then I'll type Full Metal Alchemist

488
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,600
in the description within the first line

489
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
because that, you know, that all helps

490
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
with search engine optimization.

491
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Yeah, Jeff, it's funny to hear you talking about this

492
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
because I do all of this

493
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
and I thought it was obvious,

494
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
but now I'm wondering if to everybody else,

495
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
this is news.

496
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Well, I don't do any of this.

497
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I don't do any of this shit.

498
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
On the subject of selling out,

499
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
I've been talking to people at MCNs lately,

500
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
and that's apparently the biggest thing

501
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
that they do to help people get their channels bigger.

502
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Oh my gosh, that's what you're paying for?

503
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Wow.

504
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Yeah, I shouldn't have known that.

505
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
That has to tell you how to use tags.

506
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Those really condescending copy and pasted messages

507
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
is like, hey, you know how,

508
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
how about we do half of it for you

509
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
and just give us all your money?

510
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Now, I also do the whole thing.

511
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Jeff's sold out hard enough to carry all of us.

512
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
That's true.

513
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I've also done the thing with tags.

514
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
And what I've found...

515
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Yeah, just one pro tip related to tags

516
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
that a lot of people don't think of,

517
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
put the name of your channel in every single...

518
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Yeah, I was about to say,

519
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I tag every single video I ever publish.

520
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I tag DigiBro.

521
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Isn't that like an inherent thing?

522
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
It's the name of the goddamn channel.

523
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Tags control what shows up in your sidebar.

524
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
And so if you tag everything with your name,

525
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
then if someone gets into your channel,

526
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
then suddenly they're locked into your channel.

527
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
That's what I want to talk about.

528
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I want to talk about sidebars,

529
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
because I've found that that's how I've gotten...

530
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
In the time that I've been doing like,

531
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
YouTube full time,

532
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
only two of my videos have taken off.

533
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
One about Roller Coaster Tycoon

534
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
and one about Undertale.

535
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
So this is the other way to sell out,

536
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
is to get in on the big trends,

537
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
the big fandoms.

538
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I mean, almost everyone,

539
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
all but two people in this chat right now

540
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
first started doing YouTube making money

541
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
through another big franchise.

542
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
And is it banned?

543
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
We're not allowed to talk about it anymore.

544
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Anyway, so...

545
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
None of my videos were ever really able to...

546
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
You did it, Davoo! You just did it!

547
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I know, I was conscious of it at that time.

548
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
I was conscious of how I transitioned

549
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
from one sentence to another sentence

550
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
by going...

551
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
So I found...

552
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Everybody post about how cute that is

553
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
when Davoo does that.

554
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Everybody complimented him.

555
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I was never able to find...

556
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I was never able to get much success

557
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
through getting searched

558
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
because I don't know,

559
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
nothing that I ever posted

560
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
was something that people search much about.

561
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Normally people seem to watch videos

562
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
by clicking on one

563
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
and then going on the sidebar

564
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
and they basically go sidebar surfing.

565
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
So people are going to sit down all day

566
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
watching Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 videos

567
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
if that's what they're doing, right?

568
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Now, that's why so many people

569
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
didn't like that video

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
because they're in the mindset

571
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,600
of liking Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.

572
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Whereas I'm posting the video

573
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
in the mindset of being a video game

574
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
commentator, right?

575
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I'm going in and the reason

576
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
that my Undertale video took off

577
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,600
so much is because it's a really weird

578
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
statement in the title

579
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
that really throws people off.

580
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
And it's...

581
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Yeah, Davoo, I wanted to say

582
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
it's interesting to me, very much so,

583
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,600
to compare our two different Undertale videos

584
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
because mine is a fucking 10 out of 10

585
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
masterpiece of artistic wonder.

586
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
And Davoo's on the other hand...

587
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
No, it's not even that.

588
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Davoo's was A, much more timely.

589
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
B, what had an interesting title to it.

590
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
And C, I don't know, maybe had a nicer

591
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
thumbnail, which definitely is simpler.

592
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
It had a hand-drawn thumbnail

593
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
that Davoo created, so it was art in one scene before.

594
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Oh, you made that, dude?

595
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Oh, I didn't know that.

596
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,600
If I made my Undertale videos

597
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
title anything but

598
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Mother's Basement Review Undertale,

599
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
it probably would have gotten a million hits.

600
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Now, don't forget one thing, though, guys.

601
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
If I'd made that video today,

602
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
if Undertale had came out today

603
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
and I'd done that video, it would have been much longer

604
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
because I would have done a much more expanded version

605
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
of the script that would have resonated

606
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
with more people.

607
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Nobody cares, Davoo.

608
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Well, I'm talking about, like, reaching people.

609
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
We're talking about selling out.

610
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I want to ask Jeff, because you were talking about before.

611
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Yeah.

612
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
All right, it's just,

613
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
the way that you title your videos,

614
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
what's in an OP?

615
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I see that you always consciously have chose

616
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
to brand yourself, you know, with, like, the name of the thing,

617
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
as opposed to someone like Digi, who doesn't do that ever.

618
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
And I'm just wondering, you know,

619
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
what's the reason for that choice?

620
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
You guys, I'm sure you have reasons for that.

621
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
You know, I think with Jeff,

622
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
he's got one of the few ways that it can work,

623
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
because I think that old YouTube,

624
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
like, the mentality people had about it

625
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
was very much that people were coming for you.

626
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Like, there was individual content creators.

627
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
They were looking for your series, your story.

628
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Yeah, YouTube pages used to be, like, MySpace pages and stuff.

629
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah.

630
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,600
And so, and, you know, people like that guy with the glasses

631
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
who have very well-defined series,

632
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
and those are, like, what people do before you.

633
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Angry Video Game Nerd, his name is in the titles.

634
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Those guys are institutions, though, so, yeah.

635
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
But now, like, 80% of all the views I get,

636
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
if not more, is from, like,

637
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,600
is from people being on YouTube browsing.

638
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
So it's almost all sidebar hits, recommended videos,

639
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
you know, people on their home page,

640
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
and it recommends them because they've clicked on anime videos,

641
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
so we suggest DigiBro videos.

642
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
And so, I tailor everything to be for those people,

643
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
because anyone who is already subscribed to me,

644
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
it doesn't matter.

645
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
They're gonna watch my videos no matter what.

646
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
So tailoring it for them is completely unnecessary.

647
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I'm tailoring it all for the people who aren't subscribed,

648
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
who don't know who I am.

649
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,600
And if it says, like, DigiBro review,

650
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
none of them know who I am.

651
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
They don't give a fuck who DigiBro is.

652
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
They don't care about his review.

653
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
What they want to know is, you know,

654
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
why Konosuba is genuinely hilarious.

655
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
And they're like, I like Konosuba,

656
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
and there's a big picture of the most popular character

657
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
from the show, who I don't even really talk about in the video,

658
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,600
but she's giving a thumbs up on the thumbnail.

659
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
It's adorable.

660
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
It's a memorable moment from the show,

661
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
and it's the most popular character.

662
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,600
So that video gets 250,000 hits,

663
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
which is what it has before it got...

664
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
It would have way more than that if it hadn't gotten taken down

665
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
for, like, three fucking weeks by Katakawa.

666
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
But...

667
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Those fuckers.

668
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
So for me, it's all about, like,

669
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,600
what's the catchiest possible title,

670
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
no connection to anything, flashiest thumbnail,

671
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
what's going to get people's attention,

672
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
but without stepping into the boundary of looking trashy,

673
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
you know, where it's, like, ten hottest tits in Konosuba, you know.

674
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Well, excuse me.

675
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Looking trashy is the best way to get hits.

676
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
No, it is.

677
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,600
I just objectively proved with ass in the thumbnail.

678
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
I mean, don't get me wrong.

679
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Well, not an irrelevant ass in the thumbnail.

680
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Yeah.

681
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
No, I have a lot of tits in thumbnails and stuff

682
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
with the Astroscore series,

683
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
but that's because they're also semi-ironic,

684
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
because, like, having tits in the thumbnail

685
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
fits in with the narrative of the videos

686
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
that I'm criticizing shows from tits.

687
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
All right, but let me, I mean, if you, like,

688
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
just, does any average viewer,

689
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
the people that you're marketing the videos to,

690
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
do they get that it's ironic?

691
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
No, no, no.

692
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm not attracting them on that basis.

693
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You see, that's an excuse that you're using,

694
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
and I agree with you, it's fine.

695
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm not making it as an excuse.

696
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I'm saying why it doesn't damage my brand.

697
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Because if I...

698
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
What it doesn't damage is your view of yourself.

699
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Nobody else cares.

700
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Nobody else is thinking about it.

701
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
No, no, people do care.

702
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
People want to subscribe to people who look smart.

703
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
You think so?

704
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Nobody wants to subscribe.

705
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah, I guess.

706
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Like, the biggest criticism, like,

707
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I think most people who hate Misty Kronexia

708
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
haven't watched any of his videos.

709
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
They've looked at his thumbnails and his subject matter,

710
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
and they click on a video and they see his posters,

711
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
and they think, this guy is a fucking sleaze, right?

712
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Like, his videos will be, like,

713
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
top 10 most fappable lollies,

714
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
and it'll be a picture of an ass on the cover.

715
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
And then you click on it,

716
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
and it's him in front of all these trashy,

717
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
sordid online posters talking about how much

718
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
he likes lolly ass, you know?

719
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Like, people subscribe to me because they think

720
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm intellectual.

721
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
They think I'm smart.

722
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
They want to be taught something, you know?

723
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You've tricked me out of success.

724
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
That's true, that's right.

725
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Yeah, if I put tits on the thumbnail,

726
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
and then you click on the video,

727
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
and it gives you the impression that it's a clever

728
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
subversion of it, then it still feels smart,

729
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
and it doesn't hurt my brand.

730
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
But if I was talking about a show,

731
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,600
like, you know, some show that is deeply

732
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
well-respected or something,

733
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
and I just put tits up there,

734
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
and then my video has nothing to do with tits,

735
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
and it's all heady and deep,

736
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
it would be really obvious that it was like

737
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
a clickbait thing, you know?

738
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
I just don't even know people are thinking about it that much.

739
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I just don't even know people are thinking about it that much.

740
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Well, it's deeply beloved.

741
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
But anyways, the reason that it works for Jeff, I think,

742
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
is that what's in an OP is a good title

743
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
every single time.

744
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Yeah.

745
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Because it's not a series title, really.

746
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Like, if you see...

747
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
It doesn't work for me,

748
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
because I don't know what an OP is.

749
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
I mean, I kind of know.

750
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
It's an opening video.

751
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
If you watched one video, you'd know.

752
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Any other anime fan would know that.

753
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
Yeah, I guess.

754
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
I mean, okay, I did know that that's what it was,

755
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
but when I see OP, I don't think that.

756
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I think one piece.

757
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I think all of Jeff's videos are about one piece.

758
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Are you telling me they're not?

759
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Ben, your total plan.

760
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
That unsubscribe.

761
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
That's double the reason to subscribe.

762
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
I thought he was a one-piece analyst this whole time.

763
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
God damn it.

764
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
What's been happening?

765
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
When I saw what's in an OP, Your Lion, April,

766
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
on the front page of Reddit,

767
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
I didn't think, oh, this is a series.

768
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I thought this is going to be an analysis

769
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
of the OP of Your Lion, April.

770
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
And then every single time I see it,

771
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
it's like, oh, that's going to be an analysis

772
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
of the OP of Bakano.

773
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Wait a minute.

774
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Was that a super clever April Fools title?

775
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Because it's Your Lion, April.

776
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Was it not even about that show?

777
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
No.

778
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Well, it was.

779
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Damn it.

780
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
That would have been so awesome.

781
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
That would be fun.

782
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
The April Fools video was Corey in the house.

783
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
For April Fools next year, I should just,

784
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I should make it, what's in an OP?

785
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Your Lion, April, second OP.

786
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,600
And then just make it about fucking, I don't know.

787
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Dick, something else.

788
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Yeah.

789
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Something else.

790
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Anything else.

791
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
The Bocano-Pico opening.

792
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I feel like we're off top.

793
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
I don't think what we're talking about is selling out.

794
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
We're talking about SEO optimization.

795
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
This is turned into a, like, a guide to selling out.

796
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I want to get to, all I care about is me.

797
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
So do you, what about my system?

798
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I definitely have the old school,

799
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
John Tron style of things where it's just my name

800
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
and branding.

801
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
You're telling me that it's a better idea to find

802
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
some sort of generic way of appearing individually.

803
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Well, I think yours works too.

804
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
The reason I never, like, told you to stop,

805
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,600
because I think best anime ever grew on the gun,

806
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
like every single time, again, like what's in an OP,

807
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
it's always a title for that video.

808
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
It's never just, here's the name of my series,

809
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
and then also a video title.

810
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Well, except that a lot of people,

811
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,600
a lot of people got really fucking angry at him

812
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
for saying the best game ever.

813
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Best game ever Undertale.

814
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,600
Yeah, because they heard that from the whole internet.

815
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay, that's a unique case in that one,

816
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
but I wonder if, I don't care if they get mad

817
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
as long as they come in and watch,

818
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
they can get as mad as they want.

819
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
That was what happened on our anime

820
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,600
is best anime ever, One Punch Man, got no attention.

821
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
It was like a severely downvote.

822
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Everyone hated that, yeah.

823
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Just because of the title.

824
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
No one watched the fucking video.

825
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
It was just they said,

826
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
One Punch Man's not the best anime ever, downvote.

827
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
It only works if it's either one

828
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
that people really feel is the best anime ever,

829
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
or one that people obviously know isn't

830
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
and they've realized it's a joke.

831
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
That's why I need to appeal to lesser known things

832
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
with that sort of stuff.

833
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
It only works once people know who you are.

834
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Wait a second, Nate.

835
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Wait a second, Nate.

836
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I just realized the whole subversion

837
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
is that no one cares about One Punch Man

838
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
because it's the best ever.

839
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
It called the best ever the same way

840
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
that Saitama himself is the most strong man in knowing.

841
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I thought there was some sort of meta going on here,

842
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
but not really.

843
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I'll find it later.

844
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
What were you saying?

845
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Wait, hang on.

846
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
I was saying the difference between

847
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Jeffson Nate's thing is that

848
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Nate is making a statement with his

849
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
if you put like a question mark

850
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
at the end of Best Anime Ever,

851
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
that might rectify the whole thing.

852
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
No, that would totally change everything.

853
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
No, I can't do that.

854
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
That's fucking gay as shit.

855
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Best anime ever?

856
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
No, I can't do it.

857
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I'll let him do it next time.

858
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Nate, next time you got to do that.

859
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
I wouldn't work with it.

860
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
I'll kill that for the ever.

861
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Oh my god, it would work.

862
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Maybe I could squeeze a tilled.

863
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
I can't do a question mark.

864
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
I can't live with myself.

865
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I don't know what the tilled is going to do.

866
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I don't know what to do anything.

867
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I think it worked out really well with the first two

868
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
because Gurren Lagann,

869
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
a lot of people legitimately feel that way.

870
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
And then Monster Musume, like you said,

871
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
it was so obviously not the best anime ever

872
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
that people got that it was a joke.

873
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
But with One Punch Man,

874
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
it's too relevant and too contested

875
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
where people really are out there on the internet

876
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
arguing about whether it's the best anime ever.

877
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,600
And it's the same deal with Undertale.

878
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,600
It's like, even though that is the best game ever,

879
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
some people don't think so.

880
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Some people think Uncharted is the best game ever

881
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
and are wrong.

882
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I was thinking about doing a separate section

883
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
for modern things.

884
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Maybe I'll give that some more thought.

885
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
But anyway, we're off topic.

886
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
We're talking about my shit.

887
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I'm trying to think about

888
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,600
whether I need a good name for mine.

889
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Because all I do is,

890
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,600
for my ones, I just say the name of the game first

891
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,600
and then hit the critical review afterwards.

892
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Yeah, I mean, you're definitely...

893
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
It's okay.

894
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
I mean, you do very John Trani videos like I do,

895
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
which is just like, we take the thing

896
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
and then we just say whatever we want about it.

897
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
And it's not like exploring a specific theme.

898
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
John Trani's very old YouTube, though, man.

899
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
I know.

900
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
And then to his formula, totally, like,

901
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
no one should try to take the John Tron path.

902
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Nobody should do it.

903
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
It's not viable.

904
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
The John Tron path is get lucky,

905
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
get successful on Reddit one time.

906
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Yeah, that's right.

907
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Not to say that it's not good,

908
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,600
but he definitely was one of the very few

909
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
to succeed in that way.

910
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
And I think it all really comes down

911
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
to him singing firework at the end of that video.

912
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
That's the entire reason that John Tron

913
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
is as big as he is now.

914
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
It was his hard-hitting analysis of DiCatana

915
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
that really propelled him into fame.

916
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
It was his Yonkers, man.

917
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
I don't know if you guys know about the...

918
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
It was Dino City?

919
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
No.

920
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Bro, like, that's the one.

921
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Yeah, it was Dino City.

922
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
No, that's what I'm saying.

923
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
I was saying it was his Yonkers.

924
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Yonkers is a song by Tyler the Creator

925
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
where he had a music video where he, like,

926
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
ate a live cockroach in the video

927
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
and it got, like, super viral.

928
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Yeah.

929
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
And that's why he's famous now.

930
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Oh, I gotcha.

931
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
So it's just like one random little thing he did,

932
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
like, completely sparked his whole career.

933
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Well, I'll just say, I've got a video cooking right now.

934
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I've got some big plans for it.

935
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
I think it might be the one.

936
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
We'll see in, like, six, seven, eight months.

937
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Let's talk...

938
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Let's shift gears for a minute.

939
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Yeah.

940
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Let's not talk about how we can sell out.

941
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Let's talk about other people who sell out.

942
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Hmm.

943
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I just...

944
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Before we move from us to other people,

945
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
I just want to say...

946
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Yeah.

947
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
The only time that I've ever been accused of selling out

948
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
was when I started putting annotations

949
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
at the end of my videos,

950
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,600
linking to other videos that are mine.

951
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,600
And then again when you joined this call.

952
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,600
And then again when I joined this call, obviously.

953
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Yeah.

954
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,600
It was like a Vietnam flashback at starting this call.

955
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
But, you know, I mean, that's a totally bullshit criticism.

956
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
There's nothing wrong with linking to more of your videos.

957
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
You have to assume people want to watch your content

958
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
if they're watching your content,

959
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
so you might as well make it easy for them.

960
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
So, fuck them.

961
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Backwinks are really important.

962
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
That's another thing that you learn from text journalism

963
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
and common sense.

964
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
So, you know, a thing about other people who are, you know,

965
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
big YouTubers who do things that are pretty shallow to get hits,

966
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,600
I think the reason that a lot of people don't like them

967
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
is that they don't respect their work ethic.

968
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Because I...

969
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Whenever my friend comes over

970
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
and puts on a normal boots or a hidden block video,

971
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I'm like,

972
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
man, why do these guys get out of video every two or three weeks?

973
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
And I told her one time, like,

974
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
dude, if I were doing videos like this,

975
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I would have a video out every other day.

976
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
You know, like, at some point...

977
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Alright, you know what?

978
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
You've got me devout.

979
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
You've got me by the hooks.

980
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I've got to give this rant.

981
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
This rant has been brewing inside me for a while.

982
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Okay, let's hear it.

983
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Alright.

984
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
It's called Fuck Movie Bob.

985
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
I've titled this one.

986
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Alright.

987
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
That's a good one.

988
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
So,

989
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Fuckin' Movie Bob, right?

990
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
This fucker.

991
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Right.

992
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
This dude,

993
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
he's been around for a long time, right?

994
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
He used to do the Game Over thinker series,

995
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
originally on Screw Attack.

996
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Originally on YouTube, and he got on Screw Attack, yeah.

997
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Which was terrible.

998
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Yeah, it's terrible,

999
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
and it went on forever.

1000
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I had this weird, stupid narrative.

1001
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
It was bad.

1002
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,600
But, he also made movie reviews and analysis on The Escapist, right?

1003
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
And it would be two videos a week.

1004
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
He had his Escape to the Movies reviews,

1005
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
which were just pretty much standard movie reviews,

1006
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600
and his The Big Picture videos,

1007
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,600
which were like these interesting looks into the history of film,

1008
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
talking about specific stuff,

1009
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
and they're really cool,

1010
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
because he has a lot of knowledge,

1011
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,600
and so it was like learning cool, interesting facts about film history, right?

1012
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Two videos a week.

1013
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
So, he gets fired from The Escapist,

1014
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
alongside a bunch of other people, right?

1015
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Too fat.

1016
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
And, yeah.

1017
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Couldn't fit in the damn door.

1018
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
So, he goes to YouTube,

1019
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
and he starts doing two different series.

1020
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
He's got one called Really That Good,

1021
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
and one that's just his normal reviews.

1022
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Yeah.

1023
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,600
His normal reviews are the most, like,

1024
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
click-baity, possible things in the universe.

1025
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
It'll be, he'll cover a new movie,

1026
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
the instant it comes out,

1027
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
and he'll just, like, if it's bad at all,

1028
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
he'll make it out like it's the worst movie of all time,

1029
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
rag on it incessantly, obnoxiously.

1030
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

1031
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Oh, my God.

1032
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Which is pretty cathartic,

1033
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
if you're, like, wanting...

1034
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Well, that's the problem.

1035
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,600
If you want pixels to fail,

1036
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
then that review is...

1037
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
But back when he was doing regular reviews,

1038
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
every week, talking about a new review,

1039
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
a new video, a new movie,

1040
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,600
every year, there would usually be one movie

1041
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
that came out where he was like,

1042
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
this movie's so bad, it's a big piece of shit

1043
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
with a cunt and a face and a fucker,

1044
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
and I hate it, and it's dead,

1045
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
and it's a big pile of duty shit pits,

1046
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
and that's, like, the whole video.

1047
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
And now he's doing it all the time.

1048
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
And now it's every single review he does

1049
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
is written like that.

1050
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Right.

1051
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
It'll be, like, because he did pixels,

1052
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
and it was just like,

1053
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
this is the shittiest cock bullshit.

1054
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,600
It's written, like, old AVGM from 2005.

1055
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Old AVGM ripoffs.

1056
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Very important distinction.

1057
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Right.

1058
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Like, the people who were just,

1059
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
who just slammed a bunch of swear words together

1060
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
and they think that makes sense.

1061
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
And I think he would put whatever...

1062
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
And I think he was even more inelegant

1063
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
than any of the ripoffs.

1064
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
It's, like, just stop interrupting my damn rant.

1065
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I just want to get past this.

1066
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I, he's, this...

1067
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
These reviews are shitty.

1068
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
These worse than Chris Bors is that one.

1069
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
I don't know who Chris fucking Bors is.

1070
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
I don't care.

1071
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Let me finish my rant.

1072
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I have to keep going.

1073
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
I have to keep my blood pressure high enough.

1074
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
God damn it.

1075
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
So he makes these shitty fucking reviews.

1076
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
He's got these, this pixels review.

1077
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
He's got his one for Fantastic Four.

1078
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
He's got the one for the fucking, the visit.

1079
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Is that what the M. Night Shyamalan one was?

1080
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
They're all the same review.

1081
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Copy paste.

1082
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
He just gets mad at a movie.

1083
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Oh, so clever.

1084
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
So, like, oh, we all get to hate this movie

1085
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
because it killed our family.

1086
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
He actually said at one point in the pixels review

1087
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,600
that it felt like Adam Sandler came into his house

1088
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
and pissed on his old toys or something.

1089
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Like, what the fuck?

1090
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
It's a movie you paid to see, you fucking idiot.

1091
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
So he goes and he writes these reviews

1092
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
and they're always, like, the week it comes out

1093
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
and they get really, they get a ton of views, right?

1094
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
But here's the thing.

1095
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
He's, even though, even though it's so easy,

1096
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
he's doing the easiest reviews possible, right?

1097
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
All he does is he writes a bunch of swear words.

1098
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
He comes home and he just loops trailer footage

1099
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
for six minutes while he just rambles.

1100
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
His audio is garbage.

1101
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
He fucking records into, like, a headset.

1102
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
He cuts himself off at the end of words constantly.

1103
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I don't understand how he does that.

1104
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Like, he takes a week to do something

1105
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
that I can literally do in 45 minutes.

1106
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
In 45 minutes when I come home from the movie.

1107
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
Like, pounding the render.

1108
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Yeah, and he'll come, he'll do these movies.

1109
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Like, if I did reviews like he does,

1110
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I could get them out literally five times a day.

1111
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
I could do that.

1112
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I could review, I could review,

1113
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
it would take me longer to watch the movies

1114
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
than it would do to make those reviews.

1115
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
They're just basic barebones shit.

1116
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
And yet, somehow, he only makes, like,

1117
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
one or two a month of those standard reviews.

1118
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,600
And then he's got the really that good series

1119
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
and these only come out, like, quarterly, right?

1120
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
And they're, like, 45 minutes long,

1121
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
they're heavily edited, you know,

1122
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
they're good analysis videos,

1123
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
but they're rambling.

1124
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,600
He repeats himself constantly.

1125
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
They're all 20 minutes longer than they need to be.

1126
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
All of them could be cut in half.

1127
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
He needs an editor.

1128
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
He needs a fucking editor bad.

1129
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
His audio is shit, so it's always like,

1130
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
when you're listening to it,

1131
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
it slowly grains on you, right?

1132
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Like, it slowly becomes tiring because it's so long.

1133
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
You have to understand, Digi,

1134
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
that if his microphone was better,

1135
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
it would just pick up the sound of all of his fat jiggling

1136
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
as he talks.

1137
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Yeah.

1138
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
As he tries to squeeze out syllable

1139
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
between the rolls and his fucking throat.

1140
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
Here's the thing.

1141
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
If MovieBob was just a channel

1142
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
that put out, like, one review every month

1143
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
and one really that good every quarter

1144
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
and they were exactly what they were,

1145
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
it wouldn't be a problem, right?

1146
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
If that was all it was, if it was just some guy,

1147
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,600
some YouTube guy doing that, right?

1148
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
But it's not.

1149
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
It's MovieBob.

1150
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,600
It's MovieBob who has a lot of Patreon money.

1151
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Yeah.

1152
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
A lot of Patreon money.

1153
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
He has financial incentives to do nothing.

1154
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
All he does is get 3,000 a month,

1155
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,600
regardless of what he does.

1156
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
Right.

1157
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,600
He doesn't even get, like, at minimum,

1158
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
he should have one,

1159
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,600
because he has a monthly cycle,

1160
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
so he's not getting paid by video.

1161
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
He's getting paid by month.

1162
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
So there are months that pass by

1163
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,600
where he'll put out one six-minute bullshit review

1164
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,600
that you could make in 45 minutes.

1165
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
And it's like, all month.

1166
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
And get paid thousands of dollars.

1167
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,600
He's living in a world of privilege.

1168
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I wonder what his creator goal is.

1169
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,600
I haven't even gotten to the biggest thing of all.

1170
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,600
The big cherry on top of this shit Sunday, right?

1171
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,600
So I'm already mad at him

1172
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
that he doesn't get really that good out once a month

1173
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
because he should be able to.

1174
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,600
There's no reason he can't.

1175
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
YMS puts more effort into his videos

1176
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,600
and he can get out one a month almost always.

1177
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,600
You know, I could easily get a really that good out

1178
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
every fucking week if I had the material

1179
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
and I wanted to do that, you know.

1180
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,600
Well, you have DeVoo to do your...

1181
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I don't even need DeVoo.

1182
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,600
I did 30 videos in a month

1183
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,600
last August to October.

1184
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,600
No one needs me to do movie Bob's level of editing.

1185
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Yes, true.

1186
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
And here's the thing.

1187
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
He put out this video.

1188
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,600
This video made me so mad.

1189
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,600
I almost shat a brick in my chair.

1190
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,600
This dude puts out a video

1191
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
where he literally says,

1192
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,600
the next really that good is on the way.

1193
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,600
It's a text video.

1194
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,600
It's like, you know, epic music and text coming onto the screen.

1195
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,600
It's like, but you know,

1196
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,600
these, you know, I really have to fund these things.

1197
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,600
So if you guys give me more on Patreon,

1198
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
maybe it'll come out sooner.

1199
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
Oh my God.

1200
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
He really legitimately did that.

1201
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
There's a whole video on his channel.

1202
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
This nigga, right after that, he called up Domino's

1203
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
because he's a pizza shit.

1204
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
He made a whole video.

1205
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Like you said, he used to get out two videos a week.

1206
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,600
I guess back when the escapist were constantly hounding him

1207
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,600
to get off his ass and start doing things.

1208
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Everything I know about the escapist business

1209
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
is that they're fairly cutthroat for internet standards.

1210
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
But now he's just on Patreon.

1211
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,600
What kind of work does he have?

1212
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
What are even his creator goals?

1213
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
$5,000 a month.

1214
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,600
I'll finally put in a channel banner.

1215
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
$7,000 a month.

1216
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,600
I'll have a new avatar that is in a shitty selfie of my fat face.

1217
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Does he really say that?

1218
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Wait, is that for real though?

1219
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
He doesn't have a channel banner.

1220
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
$3,000.

1221
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
No, but it doesn't actually say that on his Patreon.

1222
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
No, but it should.

1223
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
That's probably what he values.

1224
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
He really had to be going for a second there.

1225
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
You know, he probably got that.

1226
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,600
This goes back to what I said before.

1227
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,600
Davoo, I think it was, who said that, you know,

1228
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
I hate people, things that make people money.

1229
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
No, I only hate it when people make more money than they deserve.

1230
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
And this is a case of a guy who I actually like movie Bob kind of.

1231
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
I really like Really That Good.

1232
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,600
I think it's a good series.

1233
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,600
But I don't think he should be making $3,000 a month

1234
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,600
to put out like four in a year.

1235
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
It's outlandish.

1236
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
It's fucking ridiculous, especially because like I said,

1237
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I like Really That Good too.

1238
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,600
But again, I'm looking at it from the perspective of

1239
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
I'm also a content creator.

1240
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,600
And I can legitimately say I think I'm a better writer

1241
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
than movie Bob in terms of like revisions.

1242
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Well, that's not hard.

1243
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,600
I mean, I don't think he's bad.

1244
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
It's just that he repeats himself too much.

1245
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
Look, Digi, all we have to say is that you don't constantly

1246
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,600
inject 9-11 into your writing, which actually,

1247
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
that's actually the best thing I've ever done.

1248
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
That doesn't bother me.

1249
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
No, no, I think it's hilarious.

1250
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
I love it.

1251
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,600
Everyone should mention 9-11 for unrelated reasons.

1252
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,600
He does it in his book.

1253
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
He says, when I first saw Super Mario Brothers 3,

1254
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,600
I thought it was the most impactful moment of my generation,

1255
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
just like the shooting of JFK was for my parents,

1256
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,600
and then 9-11 was for the next generation.

1257
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
I thought it was amazing.

1258
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
What the fuck?

1259
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,600
I just can't believe that he has the gull to make a video

1260
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,600
saying like, give me more money so I can finish this video

1261
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,600
that's already a series I've already been doing.

1262
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,600
And like, and what does he need more money for?

1263
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,600
He's making $3,000 a month to do something.

1264
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Dude, I'll tell you exactly what it is.

1265
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
He's living a life.

1266
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
In his life, he needs some more money,

1267
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,600
so he's saying, okay, they'll give me more money.

1268
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Bob, stop eating so much and you'll be able to fucking

1269
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,600
afford your life!

1270
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,600
He said fuck!

1271
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,600
Even though like, this is why there are a lot of people

1272
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,600
who are pretty click-baity or don't make a whole lot of

1273
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,600
deep content, but we really respect like Anthony Fantano,

1274
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,600
who proves those people exactly wrong by getting out of

1275
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
video every day, right?

1276
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Yeah, and by the way guys, by the way,

1277
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
I'd like to suggest that for our selling out purposes,

1278
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,600
we should title this video The Movie Bob Rant.

1279
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,600
The Movie Bob Rant, yeah.

1280
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
I don't know if you don't want to start eating drama with

1281
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Movie Bob, but I imagine his fans would be terrible.

1282
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
No, no.

1283
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
But we do because that's the ultimate way to sell out drama.

1284
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Holy shit, let's talk about drama now.

1285
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
Let's talk about that.

1286
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
There is nothing more clickable.

1287
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Leafy is here.

1288
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Before we move on.

1289
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Yeah.

1290
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Go on, Ben, finish your fork.

1291
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Before we move on from Movie Bob, I just want to say that

1292
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,600
I am about 75% certain that I saw him at the South Station

1293
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,600
train station in Boston a couple weeks ago.

1294
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,600
I mean, I was at like this station restaurant.

1295
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,600
I saw him sitting there eating food at this train station

1296
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
restaurant, but you know, I can't be sure because it could

1297
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,600
have been any other big fat guy with a goatee.

1298
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I have food, big surprise there.

1299
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
It didn't look exactly like him.

1300
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
I am 100% sure.

1301
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
And he is a Bostonian.

1302
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
Yeah, right.

1303
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
He is a Bostonian, so it's not entirely inconceivable.

1304
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,600
But Ben, I am 100% sure that I saw Movie Bob on Google Earth

1305
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,600
while I was browsing over the city of Boston.

1306
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,600
What?

1307
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Were you zoomed out like eight times?

1308
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
This was not street view.

1309
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,600
He was just visible.

1310
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
This was not street view.

1311
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
No, I was looking at the topography of the entire

1312
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Massachusetts area.

1313
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
I was like, oh, hey, Movie Bob.

1314
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
By the way, if you're a viewer of this show and you're fatter

1315
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,600
than Movie Bob, we love you, and it's not a problem.

1316
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
It's only gross to be fat if you're also Movie Bob.

1317
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,600
Yeah, that's right.

1318
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,600
No, Movie Bob is gross because he's Movie Bob,

1319
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,600
and the fat is part of that.

1320
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,600
I don't know, Movie Bob's easy to make fun of,

1321
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
but I don't really mind him that much, except that I think

1322
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
he should make less money.

1323
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,600
No, don't get me wrong.

1324
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,600
I'm with you, Ben, because I've been a fan of Movie Bob

1325
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,600
for like five years, and I've seen all of his videos.

1326
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,600
I think I've watched every single big picture.

1327
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I've been a fan for like eight years now.

1328
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
I've watched all of his videos when he was on The Escapist.

1329
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,600
Oh my God, the funniest thing ever was when someone,

1330
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,600
he was doing like a Q&A video on Game Overthinker,

1331
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,600
and someone asked him, when will you stop putting

1332
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
in these terrible skits and just talk about games

1333
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,600
like a journalist, which is the only thing you're good at?

1334
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,600
And he answered like, yeah, maybe when I decide

1335
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,600
that I'm okay with putting out an inferior

1336
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
on total lack of self-awareness.

1337
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Okay, you know, that's really interesting.

1338
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,600
It's really interesting, because the way that people,

1339
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,600
there's such a weird dualality.

1340
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah, exactly, he doesn't understand,

1341
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
but you know, a lot of people are like that,

1342
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
that they do these things because they're,

1343
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
you know what, I don't want to shit on him,

1344
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
but Jesse is kind of this way,

1345
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,600
and just that he's so dead set in making his videos

1346
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,600
in a certain way, even when other people,

1347
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,600
even if he's good at it.

1348
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
He's good at it.

1349
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
I mean, it's not that he's bad at it.

1350
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
It's not that he's bad at it, but like,

1351
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
you look at him like the bloody dead man.

1352
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
Jesse's good at it.

1353
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
And I agree with that some of the time,

1354
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,600
maybe most of the time.

1355
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Where is Jesse, by the way?

1356
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
I don't know, he's out.

1357
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
He's fucking his secretary, probably.

1358
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,600
Movie Bob Skits are the greatest argument

1359
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,600
against him as a film critic, period.

1360
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Yeah.

1361
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
The fact that he can make that and think,

1362
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
yeah, that's a good argument.

1363
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
It's also the greatest argument against

1364
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
personal artistic integrity.

1365
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Yeah, that's true.

1366
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,600
Yeah.

1367
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
That's true.

1368
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
Some people need to sell out more.

1369
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
Some people need to sell out more to improve their art.

1370
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
All right, yeah.

1371
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
Let me get into that.

1372
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
I want to, rather than drama,

1373
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,600
because I don't even want to talk about that.

1374
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,600
That could be its own podcast.

1375
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,600
Yeah, fuck it.

1376
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,600
We all get it.

1377
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
We all do.

1378
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Like, so for me personally, like,

1379
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,600
I grew up with lots of like weird ideas I wanted to do.

1380
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Like, most of the stuff,

1381
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,600
a lot of the reason I never decided to work for a magazine

1382
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,600
is that to me, being able to do what I wanted to

1383
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
was the most important thing.

1384
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
And I didn't want to have any rules or limitations

1385
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
on what kind of stuff I was allowed to write or publish.

1386
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,600
So I would look at all these, you know, online magazines,

1387
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,600
and they all have like a very specific style,

1388
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
a very specific formula.

1389
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,600
I mean, Jeff, you had the nightmare experience

1390
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
of you had to change your scores

1391
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,600
to reflect what the site wanted you to give the score.

1392
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Oh, man.

1393
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Holy shit.

1394
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
Let me tell you a thing or two about Steve Hanley,

1395
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
that piece of fucking garbage.

1396
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
Yeah, I'm saying by name.

1397
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
That dude.

1398
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
That dude.

1399
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,600
Could we get his home address?

1400
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,600
His home address and phone number in the description.

1401
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Who is this we're talking about?

1402
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,600
This is the editor-in-chief of Hardcore Gamer,

1403
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,600
who, you know, I'm far enough out from that

1404
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,600
that I have no worries about him attempting

1405
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,600
to tank my career at this point.

1406
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
At this point, I get...

1407
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I get more views on an individual video

1408
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
than the entire site gets for a month.

1409
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
So...

1410
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
The best revenge is living well, as they say.

1411
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Yeah, and I mean, like...

1412
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Oh, God, there's so much wrong with that fucking website.

1413
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
And it's not even a question of selling out,

1414
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
because he didn't...

1415
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
He had this weird sense of integrity

1416
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
where he didn't understand what it meant.

1417
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Like, he wanted our reviews.

1418
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
He wanted our review system to stay pure,

1419
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
and by pure, I mean, ripping off IGN and Destructoid

1420
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
and everything else on the internet.

1421
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
Yeah, yeah.

1422
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
So, I tried to make interesting reviews

1423
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,600
that people would click on.

1424
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Like, when I reviewed one of the shittiest games on the planet,

1425
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
Magus, I...

1426
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,600
This is obviously ripping off something Jim Sterling did a long time ago

1427
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,600
with Deadly Premonition,

1428
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,600
where he gave that game a 5 out of 5 on Destructoid.

1429
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
But I wanted to give Magus a 5 out of 5,

1430
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,600
because that was a 5 out of 5 experience for me,

1431
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,600
where I turned into a little leprechaun using a magic spell

1432
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,600
and ran around like fucking Benny Hill,

1433
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,600
circle strafing the final boss until he died.

1434
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
That was fun times for me.

1435
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,600
And he's like, no, we gotta give it a 1 out of 10,

1436
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
because that's more true to what reviews are.

1437
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,600
And it's like, okay...

1438
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
Oh, yeah, let's just define our reviews

1439
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
by what all the reviews say about the game,

1440
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,600
instead of objectively abusing our own personal...

1441
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,600
There was a moment...

1442
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
What the fuck?

1443
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,600
There was a moment I reviewed Stixmaster of Shadows,

1444
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
which is the best stealth game to come out

1445
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
in the last generation, period,

1446
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,600
because all other stealth games are fucking garbage,

1447
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
except for New Hitman.

1448
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,600
Even Splinter Cell?

1449
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Yeah, even Splinter...

1450
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,600
Especially Splinter Cell.

1451
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Splinter Cell is responsible for stealth games.

1452
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,600
Don't get into a stealth rant.

1453
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,600
What happened with it?

1454
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,600
So I did a review of Stixmaster of Shadows.

1455
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,600
He said I could put it on the front page.

1456
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
I was the features editor at the time,

1457
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
so I had the privilege to click...

1458
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,600
Add this to the front page on my back-end thing.

1459
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I did that.

1460
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,600
He took it off because the score was too high,

1461
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,600
and he didn't want to make the site look bad.

1462
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
And he said we could only put it back on.

1463
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
I shit you not.

1464
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
He said we could only put it back on

1465
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,600
if another website gave the game a 4.5 out of 5.

1466
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,600
Brilliant.

1467
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
So just make your own website called Left Jew,

1468
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
and then make a review.

1469
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,600
He didn't understand remarkability at all as a concept.

1470
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,600
You have to do something different from other people

1471
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
in order to get people to click on your shit.

1472
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Because everybody writes game reviews.

1473
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Working for this guy didn't seem like it was a great time, was it?

1474
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,600
And now you're reaching more people independently.

1475
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
That's an interesting thing about selling out.

1476
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,600
This is a very recent update in the world of selling out.

1477
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Normally it's like you get a dang publisher,

1478
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,600
or label, or a manager, or an agent.

1479
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
That's your key to sell out because back then

1480
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,600
everything was made out of $1,000 analog equipment

1481
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,600
that you needed to rent out in order to even use it.

1482
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
And you didn't have the internet.

1483
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Today, working with other people

1484
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,600
unless they're the exact right kind of people,

1485
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,600
like all of us here, we're like so synergetic.

1486
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
We're all really great people.

1487
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Synergistic.

1488
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,600
We can work together and result in better and more product,

1489
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,600
like this podcast you're listening to right now.

1490
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,600
But by default, the idea of getting a manager

1491
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,600
or a dude to do some things behind the scenes isn't necessary.

1492
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
It increases the overhead.

1493
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,600
It makes profits less likely, bogs things down,

1494
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,600
makes things less interesting.

1495
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
And I actually, just a couple like a month ago,

1496
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:37,600
got an offer from a guy who runs a game publisher.

1497
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
And they've developed some games themselves.

1498
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
And he was like, hey, man, I like your videos.

1499
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,600
So you're looking for a job.

1500
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
And he wanted to offer me the position

1501
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,600
to be a video game consultant of design.

1502
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Like basically just do game analysis,

1503
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
but just tell them as it's being developed.

1504
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
Wow, I didn't know a job like that existed.

1505
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
And he also wanted to offer me...

1506
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
That's a very profitable job, actually.

1507
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
I have friends who do that.

1508
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Wow, I didn't even know it was a job until he told me.

1509
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,600
And he also offered me to be like a podcast host

1510
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,600
and also do game analysis for like their YouTube channel and stuff.

1511
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
I'm like, you know, and if it weren't for the fact

1512
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
that I was already doing the Digi Bro thing,

1513
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
I may have more seriously considered it.

1514
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,600
But then when I finally was able to put to finagle the conversation

1515
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,600
into him into asking him how much he was going to pay me,

1516
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,600
he asked me how much money I'm already getting paid.

1517
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,600
I should have lied and said three times more than it is,

1518
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,600
but I, you know, unfortunately told the truth.

1519
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Worst thing you want to do if you want to get big and sell out, by the way.

1520
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
Never tell the truth, but more anyway.

1521
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,600
So he's offered to basically pay me what I'm already getting paid,

1522
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
but what I'm already getting paid is going up.

1523
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,600
And so it's like Digi Bro's Patreon, which is indirectly paying me,

1524
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,600
is going up at like a higher rate than this company is getting big.

1525
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,600
And he even told me, this guy wasn't even like a great salesman.

1526
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,600
Like I was doing a better job managing my PR than he was.

1527
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,600
He was saying, yeah, we here at our company are pretty financially...

1528
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,600
are pretty strapped for cash financially.

1529
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,600
So not only are they strapped for cash, but financially so.

1530
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
And it's like that was what really made it sink in.

1531
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Game development, especially indie game development,

1532
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,600
is a giant death pit of money full of aides.

1533
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,600
Like it's just not a good idea.

1534
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,600
It's an over medium that's on the way out in terms of profitability

1535
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,600
because everyone knows how to develop a game now.

1536
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,600
You can't shake a stick without hitting an expert game designer

1537
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
or a game developer.

1538
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,600
Whereas YouTubers who really, really know what they're doing

1539
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,600
are pretty rare for now.

1540
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,600
And working all alone is actually a better system

1541
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,600
because all your managers, your bosses, your agents, that's YouTube.

1542
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,600
The YouTube algorithms are your managers.

1543
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,600
And you have to work with them.

1544
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
That's one thing.

1545
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Don't sell out by working with people unless they're the exact right kind of people.

1546
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,600
This is the hardest thing, I think, for older people to understand

1547
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,600
and why it's so hard for everyone who does this to explain to your dad

1548
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,600
what you're trying to do.

1549
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,600
We've had so many conversations with our dad trying to explain...

1550
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,600
Nate, you need to go out and network with people.

1551
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,600
He's always telling me to go to nearby colleges and find art students to connect with them.

1552
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,600
I don't understand it.

1553
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,600
I'm always asking them, why do you think that would help me?

1554
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,600
It's because that's what he did to be successful when he was a kid.

1555
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
And it's totally understandable, but...

1556
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,600
I went out to buy a shirt with my mom and she was talking to the shirt guy

1557
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
and she's like, hey, he does YouTube.

1558
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
He could sell your shirts like a local shirt store.

1559
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,600
Like they don't understand.

1560
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,600
Yeah, it's totally different.

1561
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
That happened to me at one time.

1562
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Well, parents will never get it.

1563
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,600
My parents were at a GNC and the guy behind the counter,

1564
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,600
he was a YouTuber who was trying to become a YouTuber.

1565
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,600
The guy was working there.

1566
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,600
And they were like, oh yeah, our son is a successful YouTuber.

1567
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,600
They basically gave me his card because he had a card and everything.

1568
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,600
This dude is not successful at all.

1569
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,600
He's like a couple hundred subs, maybe like a thousand.

1570
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,600
He's trying to do parkour and variety videos.

1571
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Oh yeah, you showed me this guy.

1572
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,600
All of his content was just kind of weird and not really stuff that would get big on YouTube.

1573
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,600
And this guy was in that mindset of like, I need to network.

1574
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,600
I need to know people. I need to get my name out there.

1575
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,600
He had the business cards.

1576
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,600
He was trying to contact me.

1577
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
He's taking the Mad Haas zone parkour pickup game.

1578
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,600
He was trying to contact me because I'm popular and he was trying to find a way to network with me.

1579
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,600
And I'm like, dude, I talked to him and I was like,

1580
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,600
I think the problem with your content is that it's confusing.

1581
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,600
People come here and they don't know what it is.

1582
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,600
You haven't made anything that's going to like, none of your work is tied into anything.

1583
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
There's no reason people would click on this stuff.

1584
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
There's no reason anyone would seek this out.

1585
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:58,600
And I was like, there's nothing me and you can do together because I do my work by myself.

1586
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
You are not involved with anime at all.

1587
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,600
Parkour is an urban colloquialism which is used for shortening.

1588
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,600
It really interests me how outside people will hear that like two people work on YouTube

1589
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,600
and assume that it's like at all similar.

1590
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,600
It's hilarious.

1591
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,600
You do the same job.

1592
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Hey man, I don't want you reviewing this movie.

1593
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,600
Oh, not you again.

1594
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,600
I don't want you reviewing this movie with me.

1595
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,600
Well, I mean, look at all of us.

1596
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:27,600
We barely collab and we're all best friends who do the same thing.

1597
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Like we all cover video games and anime and even we don't like leave it for the podcasts

1598
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,600
because it's not something you want to do.

1599
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
It doesn't make good content, you know?

1600
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,600
And like, the funniest thing for me is my dad has it in his head.

1601
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Like, because he's always been supportive of what I'm doing.

1602
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,600
He kind of gets it on some level.

1603
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,600
But he has it in his head that I'm eventually going to end up on TV.

1604
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Like, he really thinks for some reason that I'm...

1605
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,600
Oh, just like my hero, Jon Tron is going to do well.

1606
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,600
Yes.

1607
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Jon Tron was on TV.

1608
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Yeah.

1609
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
What?

1610
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
He was on a commercial once.

1611
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,600
No, but like, I think...

1612
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Okay, but the comparisons...

1613
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,600
No, my dad thinks I'm going to become a TV personality.

1614
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Like, my dad thinks I'm going to get hired by a news network at some point and be like a TV guy.

1615
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
And I'm just like...

1616
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,600
The local news anime review guy.

1617
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,600
That actually is a thing.

1618
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,600
That actually...

1619
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,600
There was one time, for a brief period,

1620
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,600
we had the Hampton Roads show, like the local area news,

1621
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,600
and they had like an anime block for like a short period of time.

1622
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
Late at night at like 3 a.m.

1623
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,600
I saw it once and I was like, what the fuck is happening?

1624
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
It was so weird.

1625
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,600
They were probably copying the Dolce and William or something, I guess.

1626
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,600
No, it wasn't shows.

1627
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,600
It was like talking about anime.

1628
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,600
Like, local area.

1629
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,600
Here's a way that maybe would work with some people's dads is explain this.

1630
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,600
About half the people who watch YouTube have ad block and therefore don't see the ads, right?

1631
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Right.

1632
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Whereas 100% of people who watch TV fast forward through the ads now.

1633
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,600
So there, there's the business discipline difference.

1634
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
Can they do that?

1635
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
And also no young people watch TV.

1636
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,600
Oh yeah, that too.

1637
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Yeah, that's true.

1638
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,600
So here's like a thing.

1639
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,600
It's pretty bad when your parents are like, oh, you're going to be a TV person someday.

1640
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,600
As a way of justifying to themselves what you do for a living.

1641
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:10,600
My parents are very accepting of what I do and they think that it's, it's really cool

1642
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,600
and they, they understand that I know better than them that there is actually a future in it.

1643
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
That's nice.

1644
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,600
That's nice.

1645
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,600
But the other thing that you get all the time when you're a YouTuber is people giving you suggestions for shows.

1646
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Oh yeah.

1647
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
Oh yeah.

1648
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,600
And they're all terrible.

1649
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,600
They're all bad.

1650
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,600
They're all bad.

1651
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,600
So you did like, what if you went to like restaurants and did reviews?

1652
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,600
I'm like, cause they're all in Virginia Beach and no one who watches me is in Virginia Beach.

1653
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
You know.

1654
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,600
What if, what if, what if you, you know, you're called mother's basement.

1655
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,600
What if you gave your mom a vlog show?

1656
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,600
I bet people would watch that.

1657
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Oh my God.

1658
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,600
Mom vlogs.

1659
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Mother's basement's mother.

1660
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,600
There was one time, one time I was babysitting my aunt's kids and she was telling me that

1661
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,600
she really wanted to start up a vlog channel where she just like ranted about stuff.

1662
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,600
And I was like, about what kind of stuff?

1663
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
And she's like, I don't know, just stuff.

1664
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,600
She doesn't have a TV, like a, like a presence for camera at all.

1665
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,600
She talks really slow.

1666
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,600
Well, hey, that's like a big fat old lady.

1667
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,600
Oh, you guys show her Angela at all.

1668
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,600
That's the only president I know for that on YouTube.

1669
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,600
I mean, there are, there are like older people who are on YouTube doing rants.

1670
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Like I wouldn't be surprised to see a 40 year old mother on there.

1671
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Just, she doesn't even watch YouTube.

1672
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,600
So like this whole idea is like, what do you think you're going to do?

1673
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,600
You don't know what the trends are.

1674
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
You don't know what you're trying to do.

1675
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Hey man, nothing's impossible.

1676
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,600
Go watch the new Storyteller.

1677
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
She didn't know what she was going to film it on.

1678
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,600
You know, anything.

1679
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Anyone could be a YouTuber.

1680
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
Yeah, the new Storyteller is so successful.

1681
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Yeah.

1682
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
Yeah.

1683
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,600
But like the procrastinators, that's a pretty big plug if I do say so myself.

1684
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
Yes, true.

1685
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,600
If that's the, if that's the highest that you've reached, then that's a very sad statement.

1686
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,600
But you know, it's, it's not even that my dad,

1687
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,600
Not that I don't love your new Storyteller.

1688
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,600
My dad thinks I'm going to end up on TV because that would be like, you know, like what he wants from me.

1689
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,600
It's just that he thinks of that as like the ultimate version of what I do.

1690
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Like TV is the, the final frontier, you know, and I'm like,

1691
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,600
As opposed to your dying competition.

1692
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Right.

1693
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,600
And like for me, I'm thinking like TV's on the way out.

1694
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
It's going to be done.

1695
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
It's not going to last much longer.

1696
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:15,600
And like, you know, you'd have to be like, think about how like you get a guy like a,

1697
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Who's the dude who hosts at midnight?

1698
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,600
Chris Hardwick is like the host of at midnight.

1699
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
He's the host of several other talk shows.

1700
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
He does the talking of the dead.

1701
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
He does all these shows.

1702
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:31,600
And I'm like, that's one guy occupying like over an hour of TV every night.

1703
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,600
Right.

1704
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,600
So that means that the talent pool is pretty small.

1705
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,600
If you're at the top, you're in all kinds of stuff, you know, because you're the best guy.

1706
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Everybody wants you.

1707
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,600
So there's only like a couple hundred people who are like TV hosts who are making real money.

1708
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,600
And everyone else is on a local news station and they're probably making less than I make now.

1709
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,600
You know, I'm making like over $40,000 a year this year.

1710
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,600
If I make the same amount I have been making so far.

1711
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,600
That's a damn good salary.

1712
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Yeah, I'm making fucking, you know, gotta think middle-class wages.

1713
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,600
I think PewDiePie has really helped to evolve everyone's understanding of YouTube, including other YouTubers.

1714
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Because so many people know him.

1715
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,600
Most people know he's a millionaire now.

1716
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:15,600
And also the fact that he's like a real guy who doesn't feel like a shill.

1717
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:23,600
And I think that's probably, I bet PewDiePie single-handedly has, or single-swededly progressed YouTube content so far.

1718
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,600
What?

1719
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:30,600
Because he's made, you can be like a real guy who's actually kind of charming and become the biggest guy.

1720
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:36,600
He does create sort of an inverse problem though where people are like, oh, you should have 100,000 subscribers.

1721
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,600
Well, you want people to think that, especially if it's like a girl and you're trying to like pick her up.

1722
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I guess if it's a girl, then yes.

1723
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
That's very true.

1724
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
You want to make that.

1725
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,600
No, I, yeah, it's, it is a problem that people think you're rich just for having like a certain amount of subs.

1726
01:05:53,600 --> 01:06:00,600
But like, and it's also really fascinating to see like what people, what kind of selling out people think will work and what kind doesn't.

1727
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Because like, I want you all to look up Daim Drops, D-A-Y-M Drops, and look at-

1728
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,600
I know about Daim.

1729
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,600
Have you seen his Patreon?

1730
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,600
It is the most hilariously depressing thing.

1731
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:24,600
Because Daim Drops is a guy, he's this big fat black guy who sits in his car and reviews fast food from outside of the point.

1732
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,600
Oh yeah, that guy.

1733
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
He jumped.

1734
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,600
That's a lot more.

1735
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,600
That's a lot more than he was making when he started it.

1736
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Like, here's the thing.

1737
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Daim Drops started, he got big because of the Daim, Daim, Daim, Shmo Yoho song, right?

1738
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,600
Shmo Yoho is huge.

1739
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Yeah, right.

1740
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
So he gets pretty big through that.

1741
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
He's got like over 100,000 subs, I think, right?

1742
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Where the heck is he?

1743
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
He's got like 18 fucking dollars?

1744
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
What the heck's going on?

1745
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,600
He makes-

1746
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Take his word for it.

1747
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
He has a pretty high subscriber count, right?

1748
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,600
And he's considered like a part of the YouTube club kind of thing.

1749
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:05,600
He's been out to the YouTube space, he's been invited to Taco Bell to do tastings of their new products for videos and stuff like that.

1750
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600
He's done endorsements and shit like that.

1751
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Guys, I think, and one of the factors that he doesn't seem to link his Patreon anywhere.

1752
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
I had to just-

1753
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,600
No, no, no, let me get to it.

1754
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,600
He has a Wikipedia page, guys.

1755
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Let me get to it.

1756
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,600
He's fairly well known as a YouTube personality, but here's the thing.

1757
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,600
His videos are like five minutes.

1758
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,600
The first 40 seconds is,

1759
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,600
What's up, YouTube?

1760
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,600
Facebook?

1761
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,600
Twitter?

1762
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,600
It's a main man, Dave Drost with another super official food review.

1763
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Can you take it, baby?

1764
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,600
I know you can.

1765
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,600
Hey, listen, man.

1766
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
That's his intro.

1767
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
Every video.

1768
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,600
I can't believe I could still do that.

1769
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Sounds like a Hodge Twin sort of thing.

1770
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,600
Yeah.

1771
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Well, he'll then, he'll get his food and he'll eat it and he'll talk about it and he'll give it a ranking out of five, right?

1772
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
It is-

1773
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
There's not a lot to it.

1774
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,600
It's something literally anybody could do.

1775
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
Like, yeah, he has-

1776
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,600
But he just delivers his opinion on said food with so much personality.

1777
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,600
Right, yeah.

1778
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,600
He has a lot of gusto to it, but like, every video is the same thing.

1779
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
If you watch one, you get it, you know?

1780
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
And it's fucking fast food reviews.

1781
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
And they're like three minutes long.

1782
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
And so he makes a Patreon at one point.

1783
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:12,600
And part of the problem here is, and I'm also giving this as advice to everybody,

1784
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,600
your Patreon rewards, no matter what they are,

1785
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:23,600
the numbers that you mark are like really psychologically controlling to your audience.

1786
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Yeah, yeah.

1787
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Because if you set, like, if you have it going, if you have a $1 tier,

1788
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,600
like on mine, I made one that just said, for the longest time, all it said was $1,

1789
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
and it said, I will love you forever.

1790
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,600
And just by having that $1 tier, it makes people realize that they can give you $1,

1791
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,600
and so they will, you know?

1792
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,600
Yeah.

1793
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,600
They have shit tons of $1 patrons because of that.

1794
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,600
Whereas Daimdrop started off, and his first tier was like $40.

1795
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Yeah.

1796
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,600
Because he was giving out like a lot of stuff,

1797
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,600
but it was like a $40 tier and like $100 tier.

1798
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,600
Oh man, you know what I saw?

1799
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,600
And so as a result, he gained zero patrons for a long time.

1800
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,600
A guy with over 100,000 subs had zero patrons.

1801
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,600
You know what I've seen is that there are some people,

1802
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
some patron pages where the first reward is like,

1803
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,600
I'll thank you and also like, I'll give you a sticker

1804
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,600
or I'll say hi on Twitter, and it's $2 as the first reward.

1805
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,600
And I don't know if Patreon is still like this,

1806
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,600
but at least earlier before the redesign,

1807
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,600
when you go over and click on the Become a Patron button,

1808
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
the number $1 is already in there,

1809
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,600
but if it starts out at $2 as the first reward,

1810
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
the default will be $2.

1811
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
You sneaky bastards.

1812
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,600
Me and Ben did that for our T-Bat patron

1813
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
because there were two of us.

1814
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,600
Was there justification?

1815
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,600
I mean, I didn't do it for any sneaky reason,

1816
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,600
but my first level is $5 just because.

1817
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,600
So my Patreon is, I think, pretty successful.

1818
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
I think it's the second most successful of ours

1819
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,600
out of after-digies.

1820
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
True.

1821
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,600
Well, I don't think you make as much as Jesse makes

1822
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
just because he patrons a lot more stuff.

1823
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
Yeah, probably.

1824
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,600
But because I'm on a monthly basis because I don't want to.

1825
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1826
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,600
I just want people to be like,

1827
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
I know how much money I'm paying each month.

1828
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
Right.

1829
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,600
But so I went to people I know

1830
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,600
who have successful Patreons at the very beginning

1831
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,600
before I even put it up, and I asked them for advice.

1832
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,600
So the extra credits, guys,

1833
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,600
and I think I asked you, Digi,

1834
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,600
for at least input on my reward tier.

1835
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,600
And I actually got put through to somebody at Patreon

1836
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,600
who gave me additional advice.

1837
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,600
And you were talking about the psychological priming

1838
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,600
of your reward tiers.

1839
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
Oh, yeah.

1840
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
Essential.

1841
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Yeah.

1842
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,600
So what you want to have is you want to have five reward tiers

1843
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,600
between $1 and $10.

1844
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Because that creates like...

1845
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
People at every level.

1846
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Yeah.

1847
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,600
So that creates like a breadcrumb trail effect, right?

1848
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,600
Where people will be like, oh, well, I mean,

1849
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,600
I'm pledging $1.

1850
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,600
I pledge two more dollars.

1851
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,600
Exactly.

1852
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,600
I get my name listed in a video at the end of the year.

1853
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
I pledge $2 more than that.

1854
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,600
I get to...

1855
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,600
I pledge $2 more than the monthly Q&A.

1856
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Suddenly I get to join you for an anime night

1857
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,600
where we hang out.

1858
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,600
And it's really fascinating to see like

1859
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,600
what people will pay for just because it's listed.

1860
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,600
If you have a $15 tier and it's got...

1861
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
And it's like limit 10 or something,

1862
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
it could be fucking anything.

1863
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Just the fact that it's there means certain people

1864
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
who have the money will pay that amount.

1865
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,600
I think very, very few people really are interested

1866
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,600
in the rewards most of the time.

1867
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
It's more about suggesting to them that...

1868
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
When people pledge to a patron, what they're really buying

1869
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
is like a place in the narrative of the person.

1870
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
But it's just funny because it's not

1871
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,600
that they're going for the higher rewards

1872
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,600
because I think there's a lot of people...

1873
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
If you have...

1874
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,600
If you're highest reward, mine goes $1, $3, $5.

1875
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,600
So there's not a lot of stuff.

1876
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,600
And most of the pledges I get are either $3 or $5.

1877
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Since implementing those ones, I mostly get stuff on that level.

1878
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,600
There's probably a lot of people who if I had a $10 reward,

1879
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,600
they would just raise it to $10 just because it exists.

1880
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,600
And they think, oh, there's a reason to be 10.

1881
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Even if the $10 reward was nothing all that special

1882
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,600
in relation to how much it costs.

1883
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,600
It's just that I don't want to offer anything.

1884
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,600
You only need the big rewards when you get to $80, $150

1885
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,600
somewhere around there, which I've got people

1886
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,600
who've bought into that from the beginning.

1887
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,600
And I'm really grateful for that because it's helpful.

1888
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Although it is a lot of work to get that stuff actually made.

1889
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,600
And big level patrons are scary because if they leave, you lose a lot.

1890
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,600
That's true.

1891
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,600
It's nicer to have a lot of $1 guys who can come and go.

1892
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,600
That's why it's smart to limit your big level patron tiers

1893
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,600
because then if they do leave for whatever reason,

1894
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,600
there's somebody else who wanted that for a while and will buy in there.

1895
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,600
I only have two levels of pledge rewards

1896
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,600
and neither one of them is really a reward.

1897
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,600
All you get is $5.

1898
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,600
There's no real benefit except I post my stuff there first.

1899
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,600
So in the long run, it doesn't matter.

1900
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
But I didn't design them as rewards.

1901
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,600
I just designed them as pledge this if you want to support me,

1902
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,600
pledge this much if you really want to support me.

1903
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,600
And that's it.

1904
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,600
And I think it's been pretty successful.

1905
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,600
I'm actually kind of surprised it's gotten as high as it has.

1906
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,600
Funnily enough, once again,

1907
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,600
we really haven't been talking about the concept of selling out so much

1908
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
as this is now a guide on how to sell out.

1909
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
I'm about to sell out.

1910
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,600
So I'm going to give a piece of advice for the mindset.

1911
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,600
So hang on.

1912
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Hang on.

1913
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,600
I remember.

1914
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,600
Just real quick, sell out mindset.

1915
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,600
So there's this band called Clipping.

1916
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,600
They have two songs that you need in your life.

1917
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,600
The first one is a song called Outro from their first album, Mid City.

1918
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,600
It's 10 minutes of a guy going,

1919
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,600
Get money, get money, get money, get money, get money, get money, get money.

1920
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,600
But it's two audio tracks that slowly desynchronize and over the course of it

1921
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,600
and then re-synchronize at the end.

1922
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,600
So it's just this chaotic train of get money.

1923
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,600
It's like a hypnotic drug.

1924
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
Play that when you go to bed.

1925
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,600
When you go to bed at night, listen to the outro and just leave it on repeat.

1926
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
And you'll easily pass out.

1927
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,600
It just sounds like my choice.

1928
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,600
Then here's the better part, though.

1929
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,600
They also have a song called, I believe it's Get Up, something like that.

1930
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,600
It's a song where it's the lead singer rapping over an alarm clock as the beat.

1931
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,600
The beat is just,

1932
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
And then he starts,

1933
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,600
So set this as your alarm because the first lines in the song are,

1934
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Game, don't wait, hold up, wait, eyes on the ground, motherfucker, can't be late.

1935
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,600
And so when you hear that, like, it wakes you up.

1936
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
And then the first thing you hear is like, game, don't wait.

1937
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,600
You're like, oh, shit.

1938
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
And I always just jump out of bed and I'm like, all right.

1939
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,600
It's time to fucking get money, get money, get money.

1940
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,600
Use these two songs to program yourself.

1941
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,600
Absolutely.

1942
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,600
I'm working on a video.

1943
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,600
I'm getting tired.

1944
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,600
I'm getting weird.

1945
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
I'm getting delirious.

1946
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,600
My eyes start to go down, but then deep for someone within me, I'm just like,

1947
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Get money, get money, get money.

1948
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,600
I come back up and I keep on going, get money, get money.

1949
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:32,600
So I think the reason that this has become like a how to sell out video is because all of us are in favor of it.

1950
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,600
Yeah, we all agree.

1951
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Except for maybe Jesse, but Jesse's style.

1952
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,600
Maybe he is.

1953
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,600
He just has the hardest time coming around to doing it.

1954
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,600
Yeah.

1955
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,600
Well, I don't think we're in favor of selling out.

1956
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,600
We're in favor of like...

1957
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,600
Monetizing our work, our fucking brutalized work we put thousands of hours into.

1958
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,600
Getting money for your work and trying to get money for your work is not the same thing as selling out.

1959
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,600
All right, listen to this.

1960
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Listen to this.

1961
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Let me break it down real quick.

1962
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
Because there is abs...

1963
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,600
If you want to spend your time, if you want to go to your nine to five and survive on that

1964
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,600
and then come home and be your pure artistic ivory tower guy who doesn't involve money,

1965
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
who doesn't corrupt your art with money, then that's fine.

1966
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,600
You can do that as much as you want.

1967
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,600
But if you want to be able to do that as your lifestyle, you have to monetize it.

1968
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,600
You have to be able to survive by doing it and you need to come up with strategies to do so.

1969
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:25,600
And that is why I want to say like when a while back, before Matthew Matosis made his Patreon,

1970
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,600
he was expressing, and several people do, was expressing concerns.

1971
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,600
I think Jeff was doing this too, about like, oh, if I make my Patreon, will people not like it?

1972
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,600
Will people think I'm a sellout?

1973
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,600
But to me, there is no case whatsoever to be made for something like a Patreon,

1974
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:47,600
because it is purely a voluntary thing that people, based on love for you and wanting your content.

1975
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,600
And that's why I really like the model of Patreon where you don't actually give them anything

1976
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,600
other than like Ben said, a place in the narrative, and they're solely there to support.

1977
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,600
To sincere thank you and like the right to call themselves like a true fan or whatever.

1978
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Exactly right, exactly right.

1979
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:11,600
And so, but the core issue here is that there is nothing at all to be ashamed of monetizing your hard-ass work.

1980
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,600
And I want that meme to die big time.

1981
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,600
My Patreon has a ton of perks, but all of them are nothing.

1982
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,600
They're just weird little words.

1983
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Well, I actually made some of my rewards.

1984
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,600
I've changed them a couple of times. I don't even remember what they are.

1985
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,600
But I remember specifically trying to make big level tiers that make it to where I am going to do things

1986
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
that I want to do anyway, but can never justify the time for it otherwise.

1987
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
That's a good reward.

1988
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,600
I'm gonna talk about something that I think Jesse would be in full support of if he was here.

1989
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Jesse, if you're here, we're talking to things relevant to you.

1990
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,600
Jesse's secretary, please get Jesse in.

1991
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Jesse's talked before about how like, for instance, when the whole where's the fair use thing came up,

1992
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:04,600
Jesse was like, none of this really affects me because if we lost, if we lost the fair use battle

1993
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,600
and I can't use footage of my videos anymore, I just have to become inventive and figure out how to make it work, right?

1994
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,600
And like that mindset is kind of how I feel about like all this monetization stuff

1995
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,600
is that to me, it's not about compromising my art and now I have to sell out.

1996
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Now it's a challenge. How can I uniquely work this into my narrative?

1997
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:32,600
And so like, I have a Crunchyroll link where if you go to crunchyroll.com slash digibro and sign up for an account,

1998
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,600
I get $5, right?

1999
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,600
So like, I already had a series that was five must see anime you can watch right now,

2000
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,600
where I talk about five shows that are available for free legal streaming.

2001
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,600
So like, it was totally obvious to make that into now a Crunchyroll ad basically, right?

2002
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,600
Because it's already what it was, is just, here's five cool shows I want you to watch.

2003
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,600
Now I have also, you can make me money by doing it.

2004
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,600
But that even was, that was like a little successful for making me Crunchyroll money.

2005
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Made like, you know, $75 or so.

2006
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,600
But then I made way more because of the asterisk where sucks videos,

2007
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,600
because I'm going on this epic tirade about how shitty this show is.

2008
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,600
And then I managed to work in, right?

2009
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Well, no, it's even better because there's a part in part two of the asterisk where sucks.

2010
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,600
This is when I first had gotten the Crunchyroll thing.

2011
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,600
I do this thing where I say, you know, if you're watching this show on Crunchyroll,

2012
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:29,600
you can easily click over and there's five other shows that have all the stuff this show has and are better.

2013
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Right, right.

2014
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,600
And I go to this whole thing and you don't know that it's a setup for anything.

2015
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,600
Like, I'm just talking about like, you know, even if I, I said like,

2016
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,600
even if I was only allowed to watch anime on Crunchyroll and I couldn't click on anything else,

2017
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,600
my browser was locked there.

2018
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,600
I still have six other shows I can watch.

2019
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,600
By the way, you can watch those shows using this Crunchyroll link that gets you to my account.

2020
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,600
It was one of the smartest things I've ever written.

2021
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,600
And people loved that.

2022
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,600
I made way more money for Crunchyroll subscriptions than I did for that

2023
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,600
than by an entire video just advertising Crunchyroll.

2024
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,600
People thought it was so, I actually had people commenting like,

2025
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,600
I signed up for Crunchyroll just because of how clever that ad was.

2026
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,600
Yeah.

2027
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,600
And you know, if you want to get like a master guide on how to always do a sponsor,

2028
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,600
but always make it seem natural without seeming awkward.

2029
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Biggest problem in the universe.

2030
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
Go vote it up.

2031
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,600
Go listen to them.

2032
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,600
Yeah.

2033
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,600
They always, they only have like, they only have Harry's, Razor's and Casper mattresses

2034
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,600
and sometimes Audible.

2035
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,600
That's all they ever do.

2036
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,600
It's been a hundred episodes, those same three ads of same three sponsors,

2037
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,600
but they always segue into it interestingly and funny.

2038
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
They always have like some funny thing to say about it.

2039
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,600
It always feels good.

2040
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,600
Right.

2041
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,600
That's cool.

2042
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,600
I'm a fan of how the two best friends guys do that on the super best friendcast.

2043
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:46,600
Like they're, they don't do the ads live while they're podcasting.

2044
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,600
They have them sort of pre-recorded, but they always have them like funny

2045
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,600
and they have them be conversations that they would have on the podcast

2046
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,600
that just happen to relate to Casper mattresses usually or flower ordering.

2047
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,600
Right.

2048
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,600
You know what we should do is we should monetize this video and put eight in video ads

2049
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,600
every like 15 minutes.

2050
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,600
Right.

2051
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,600
That's a great idea.

2052
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,600
Oh, that reminds me of.

2053
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:16,600
So I had an idea to effort how to sell out and get the procrastinators podcast

2054
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,600
to be the most successful podcast on the internet without, without any effort

2055
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,600
whatsoever on our part when it comes to editing.

2056
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,600
And that is, that is take our overlay with our faces on it.

2057
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Right.

2058
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:34,600
And then just put that over extended footage of somebody playing counter strike go race

2059
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,600
maps.

2060
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
Yeah.

2061
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
Just do that.

2062
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
Oh, oh, what a great idea.

2063
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,600
You know, I, I, I me and Davud did a commentary on this recently where there was a Pokemon

2064
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,600
video I made and it was 15 minutes long.

2065
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,600
And right in the middle of it, I did a who's that Pokemon.

2066
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,600
And then I put an in video ad there so that it would be a commercial break.

2067
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,600
And then after the video ad, it goes, it's onyx or whatever.

2068
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:02,600
And so I was like, you know, on the one hand, it's a clever joke, but it also makes me more

2069
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
money.

2070
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,600
Yeah.

2071
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,600
That's the best kind of joke of all.

2072
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,600
That's the best way to do it though.

2073
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,600
Like if you're looking at, if you're looking at the sell out stuff, you're like, uh, I

2074
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,800
just had to force these ads into my videos and it always looks like that you don't want

2075
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
to do it.

2076
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,800
That makes it doubly.

2077
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:16,800
I don't want to see it.

2078
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,100
Like, like, you know, uh, like at the end of a, like a Tommy Oliver video or something,

2079
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,200
if he's like talking about some service, he's clearly never used and doesn't care about.

2080
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,000
And I'm just like, well, you obviously don't even buy into this.

2081
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,440
You know, like for me personally, and the biggest problem in the universe is like this

2082
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,440
as well.

2083
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,520
They only endorse products that they use where they all got the Harry's razors and they all

2084
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,520
love them.

2085
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:41,200
Maddox has a Casper mattress, you know, and so, and I, I have both now as a result.

2086
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:45,040
I've actually bought both because I trusted Maddox's word on them.

2087
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,240
And you know, I know he's a guy who would want a high quality product.

2088
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,880
So mattress is really that good.

2089
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,880
They're pretty good.

2090
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,880
I would say it's better.

2091
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,000
Like, Earth, can I get these magical mattresses?

2092
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,880
Oh, if only we actually, if only we actually got a promo code.

2093
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,880
Right.

2094
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,880
That would be excellent.

2095
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,880
That would be getting paid for this shit.

2096
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,600
I actually, I've, I've been prepared, like I was going to, um, like make a video of me

2097
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,240
like whenever I shave, I'm going to do like a Harry's promo and just save it so that if

2098
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:17,200
I ever get a Harry's endorsement, I'll have a video of me shaving with the razors to use

2099
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,200
a promo.

2100
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,200
You should get a victim film that.

2101
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,200
I had that idea for ever.

2102
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,200
Right.

2103
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,200
Yeah.

2104
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,160
And it is that I have to do it shirtless and that's creepy.

2105
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:31,840
So, but, um, but anyways, like for me, the reason I waited until crunchy rolls, because

2106
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,880
I actually use crunchy rolls.

2107
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:37,160
So it's like, when I talk about it, I know everything about it.

2108
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,720
I can tell you what shows are on there and what's worth watching and what are the pros

2109
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,440
and cons of using it.

2110
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,680
And, uh, you know, I don't like taking up endorsements with shit that I don't, that

2111
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:47,680
I wouldn't use.

2112
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,920
And you'll see this in my fucking hilarious videos about like those random boxes where

2113
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,520
I had like two different, two different random box companies send me them.

2114
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,960
And I, I, I did the videos on my after dark channel, which I didn't tell them I was going

2115
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,040
to do, but like, you know, they offered me, I don't know.

2116
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:06,840
So they sent me a box and I sit on my after dark channel and I, my conclusion is always,

2117
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:10,960
well, I would never pay for this, but since I got it for free, it's kind of cool.

2118
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,600
Like if you actually think this is worth your money, here's a link, you know, because like

2119
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,160
I'm not going to lie about it.

2120
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:21,160
And I think people really like that and it, they might even be more likely to buy it if

2121
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,680
it is something that they think is interesting just because, you know, I'm not being like

2122
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:31,000
so like, like when fucking, uh, George Weidman did that Luke crate ad, like there was a little

2123
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,680
bit in there where you could tell that he was kind of like whatever, you know, like

2124
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:39,240
he, he, he pulls out this shirt and he's like, there was more than a little, he was like

2125
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,040
this, uh, labyrinth t-shirt cause, uh, David Bowie is cool, right?

2126
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:47,360
Like, you know, that's the worst, shut up, George, shut the fuck up.

2127
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,360
But I thought that was funny.

2128
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,280
It was, it was humoring to show like he didn't pretend that he loved it.

2129
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,120
You know, he didn't pretend like, oh, it's so worth it.

2130
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,520
I got all this great stuff, which like whenever those companies like ask you to do something

2131
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,800
for you, they send you other people, like other YouTubers videos who have done it and

2132
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,160
they're always so full of shit.

2133
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,560
It's always a guy who's like, oh wow, I got my new crate box.

2134
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,400
It's going to be so cool.

2135
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,160
I got an offer for this recently.

2136
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,160
David's job.

2137
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:16,160
I want to say a relevant thing first.

2138
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,160
The documentary thing, right?

2139
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,880
I got an offer from this, uh, the documentary company.

2140
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,880
They sent you the video where the chick has these giant tits.

2141
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,240
They sent me the one of the, the massive chick, the massive tits chick.

2142
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,240
And she's great.

2143
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,760
She really sold the shit out of that product, but, uh, I could never, I could never, I honestly

2144
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,760
think that all the views.

2145
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,760
I would die if I tried.

2146
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,480
That video, it's like this woman with giant tits and she's just like, it's just a straight

2147
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,000
up like six minute advertisement for this documentary company.

2148
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,880
But like, it's only got like 5,000 views.

2149
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:42,880
She's like a vlogger anyway.

2150
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,800
So I feel like all the views on it are from other people that they sent the video to.

2151
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,800
Yeah.

2152
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,800
But you know, that really works for her cause she's like a vlogger anyway, that I don't

2153
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,520
think people really care about anything other than her massive tits.

2154
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,400
I also, uh, have taken that endorsement from the documentary company.

2155
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,920
They are sending me a, they're sending me a pillow and a mouse pad and, uh, what?

2156
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,720
They said they wouldn't send me a fucking pillow.

2157
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,480
No, no, no, no, not the, not the inner pillow.

2158
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,480
They're sending me the case.

2159
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,640
Like, I want a fucking case.

2160
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,600
Give those guys, I offered to use one in a fucking video and they were like, well, maybe

2161
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
tell those guys about me.

2162
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Did you?

2163
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,600
I want a documentary.

2164
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,600
I'll do it.

2165
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,320
It was, you know, the thing is though, and here's how I'm going to do it though, because

2166
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,680
I'm like a hundred percent certain that that side is not legit at all.

2167
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,720
Like it's, none of those are official documentary.

2168
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,640
They're all for shows that don't have them.

2169
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,640
They're super racing.

2170
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,280
They're all way cheap.

2171
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:41,920
So like in my video, I'm going to be like, so is this legal product?

2172
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,920
Probably not.

2173
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,960
Do you want to pay $50 for a hot, uh, lolly on your bed?

2174
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,000
It's really up to you, man.

2175
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Yeah.

2176
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I, yeah.

2177
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
So here's my question for you, Digi.

2178
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Did you ever, uh, actually accept that polygamy website, uh, promotion?

2179
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh shit.

2180
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,600
And do, do a video about how to have your own harem.

2181
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,600
Yeah.

2182
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,880
I usually just forgot about that, but yeah, that would have been a great idea.

2183
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,760
I have had that on my mind forever because I wanted to see that fucking video.

2184
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,600
Dude, dude, work that into a review of like high school DXD or like something, I don't

2185
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,600
know, whatever.

2186
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,200
The problem is I get so many offers from stuff all the time that I, that I ignore that like

2187
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,360
I just really don't, because most of it's shit I would never want to advertise.

2188
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,800
Like there's this one dude who keeps fucking emailing me about like a, it's like some browser

2189
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,040
based, uh, game site where it's like one of those where you buy coins.

2190
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,080
It's like it's free to play games, but you buy like currency and they're, but they're

2191
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,280
like anime themed and they've all got like really nice looking, like cute girl, anime

2192
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:45,880
art, but they're all like these really shitty, weird tactics games, dude, the other day that

2193
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:50,360
just reminds me just yesterday, I was at work, like finishing up some shit and, uh, like

2194
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,080
all the, I get a pop up.

2195
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:57,640
That's just like literally honey pop only like re skinned and like with, with like, you

2196
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,840
have to like buy, like it's, it's like a Facebook game.

2197
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,000
So it's like you get energy and you use it up and you have to buy more to keep playing.

2198
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,280
Like, and it was just in a fucking pop up.

2199
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,440
The entirety of honey pop was there.

2200
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,440
Only someone in fucking stolen.

2201
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:13,000
And you see, I think this is why, um, there aren't that many big advertised, uh, sponsored

2202
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
people out there.

2203
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,760
It's just audible and a few others is because most YouTubers who are worth a damn, uh, have

2204
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,160
too much integrity like compared to anything else we've had before.

2205
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:27,520
Well, it's also, because like you can't have like any, like you're, you're so much more

2206
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,840
that, that's one of the great things about YouTube is that everybody is so much more

2207
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,280
accountable than they were back in the days of TV.

2208
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,960
If you were a big shield, you're going to have a lot of explaining about it.

2209
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,480
And I think that might be why they're social sponsors.

2210
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,080
You're kind of right and kind of wrong because a lot of these guys, a lot of these guys

2211
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:49,360
who, who approached me, they do get a lot of people, but they're all small YouTubers.

2212
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,960
And the reason is that they usually don't really offer you that much.

2213
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,240
Like all those, the reason I made those box videos on the after dark is because they didn't

2214
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,440
actually pay me.

2215
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,360
They just sent me free boxes.

2216
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,360
The box is worth 20 bucks.

2217
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:07,960
You know, like for me, a full video on my main channel, that's worth like, like, you

2218
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,600
know, now what, $800 almost, like for, for, for Patreon.

2219
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,480
So like with the, like the Campani girls, which is that, uh, browser game, they were

2220
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,720
like, if you advertise us, we'll give you like $350.

2221
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:22,960
And I'm like, that's not worth, like I make more than that.

2222
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,200
Like if the amount of time I would spend on your video, I could spend making my own

2223
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,440
video that would make more money for people trying to sponsor things are very strapped

2224
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,760
for cash financially.

2225
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,480
They're, yes, they're all very shady and strapped for cash.

2226
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:42,080
And like even the documentary guys, like they offered to send me a pillow and a mousepad.

2227
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:46,280
And that was like, I actually haggled with them because like initially they were like,

2228
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,160
we want to send you, uh, we want to send you a pillowcase and we'll send you the inner,

2229
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,960
or they said, we want to send you a pillowcase and you'll make a video about it.

2230
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,160
And they had like all these bullet points that want to be to address.

2231
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,000
And I said, how about I just work it into a regular video?

2232
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,320
Cause I already had this plan in mind that I'm going to get a pillowcase for a show

2233
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,480
that I plan to talk about in the near future.

2234
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:08,520
So I'll just bring it up in that video like I did with the crunchy roll thing.

2235
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,360
It'll be hilarious.

2236
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,480
And that'll sell way more.

2237
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,880
And they were like, well, if we throw in the inner pillow, will you make a video?

2238
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,640
And I was like, no, I've got an inner pillow.

2239
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:17,320
It'll be fine.

2240
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:17,560
Right.

2241
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,760
And then they were like, well, how about we throw in a mousepad?

2242
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:23,320
Then we're like, they just said, how about we throw in a mousepad?

2243
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:23,880
Okay.

2244
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,960
Why do they want a worse marketing?

2245
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,480
Why do they want worse marketing?

2246
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,080
Well, they don't want to chase.

2247
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,560
Why don't we throw it out about the fact that they're broke?

2248
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,880
Like you're not supposed to do that.

2249
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,360
Well, no, no, no.

2250
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,320
Then they said, how about we throw in the mousepad and they just want me to make

2251
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,920
like a full advertisement so they could show it around.

2252
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,920
You know, so like, so they're like, what if we throw in a mousepad?

2253
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,840
And I said, I'll tell you what, if you throw in the mousepad, I'll make a video

2254
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,240
on my after dark channel, which has 30,000 subscribers.

2255
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:52,400
And so they agreed to that.

2256
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,280
So I'm going to do like a regular ad video for them on after dark.

2257
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,000
And then I can just promote it my own way.

2258
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,880
Now they are giving me a discount code.

2259
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:03,400
I actually don't know if they plan to pay me based on that code.

2260
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,200
Like if I'm going to make any money from them having this discount code.

2261
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:07,320
Yeah.

2262
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,600
Well, what else would the point be?

2263
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,960
Well, they said that they were going to like track the metrics and they would

2264
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,520
keep sit like basically they'll keep sending you more shit if you if you're

2265
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,680
successful, like if you drive more traffic, which for me is like, all right,

2266
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,120
I'd rather have money, but I will never spend money on these

2267
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,760
anime pillowcases, but I would love to have them.

2268
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,640
So like this is a it's a fun way for me to get a bunch of cool pillowcases,

2269
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,520
you know, like that I wouldn't pay for because they're not even legal fucking,

2270
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,040
you know, like they're not making any money for the people who made the shows.

2271
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,360
So like so it's it'll be fun for me.

2272
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,400
It's something I want.

2273
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,520
So I'm willing to accept it.

2274
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,040
But like, yeah, most of these advertisers, they make it out like

2275
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,760
they're going to give you something special.

2276
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,280
But they're really like for someone at my level, it's not even worth it.

2277
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,120
Whereas with like Crunchyroll and Audible, they give you like a lot of money

2278
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:59,160
for those refer like Crunchyroll gives me $5 for everyone who signs up.

2279
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,760
You don't even have to make a paid account.

2280
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,680
You just sign up at all using my link.

2281
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:07,720
I really need to get on the people I know at Crunchyroll to get the fucking

2282
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,520
crunchy code. No.

2283
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,280
And the problem is that everyone's doing it though.

2284
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,360
H3H3 has it.

2285
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,600
John Tron has it, you know, same with Audible.

2286
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,840
But the reason people keep still using Audible is that I'm pretty sure they

2287
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,960
pay even more because it costs like a they give you a free month.

2288
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,640
But as I found out the hard way, it doesn't.

2289
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,760
It's one of those that auto refreshes at the end of the month.

2290
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,200
So if you don't unsubscribe from it like I didn't, you end up paying

2291
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:36,040
$15 a month for eight months and then you have to make a large

2292
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,600
splurging day on audiobooks, which you had already realized a long time ago

2293
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,640
were not your thing.

2294
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,360
So now I have eight audiobooks I haven't listened to and like a hundred

2295
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,880
dollars that I accidentally spent on Audible.

2296
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,600
But those things are really successful.

2297
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,840
And that's like, I realized how much they must make when it was

2298
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,280
because I watch Bro Science and he's always had an audible thing.

2299
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,080
And at the end, there was one video where he said,

2300
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,560
use my audible link.

2301
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,320
It makes us a frankly unfair amount of money.

2302
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,840
And I was like, oh, like, yeah, if he's

2303
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,720
subscribing to unfair, it's got to be he's got to be making like a thousand

2304
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,280
dollars a month or something off of it.

2305
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,600
You know, he's like a million subscriber channel, I want to say.

2306
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,840
So yeah, yeah, it's got to be a lot of money.

2307
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,440
That's dope as fuck.

2308
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:23,960
Well, I don't know.

2309
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,960
We exhausted a shit.

2310
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,520
I have been.

2311
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:30,000
It was like, I have to say about this conversation for quite a while now.

2312
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,720
It's great. Everyone should do it. I don't know.

2313
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,800
Oh, you know, I do.

2314
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,680
I do have one more point I want to make about it.

2315
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,160
And it's just that and it's pretty much just a summation of what we've

2316
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,200
been saying up to this point.

2317
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:46,040
It's just you shouldn't view people like tailoring their content

2318
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:51,560
to to attract larger audiences as like inherently a selling out sort of thing

2319
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,560
because no, like you're there's always going to be an artistic process

2320
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,720
involved when you're making something.

2321
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,520
And there is a line that you can cross, which John Tron class long ago.

2322
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,080
I just want if you don't cross that line, then you're all good.

2323
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,040
You should be. It's all great.

2324
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:07,120
My my go ahead.

2325
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:12,720
Yeah, my opinion on like tailoring content to what will get seen.

2326
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:18,040
As far as I'm concerned, my videos don't actually exist until somebody watches them.

2327
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,600
You know, sure. Yeah, like that that is when they actually start to matter.

2328
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,880
So to me, the idea of, you know,

2329
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,560
making stuff in a way that will try to get people to see it

2330
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:36,120
is inherently part of the process of actually making the video.

2331
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,040
Yeah, because like if I just make a video and I put it out and like 100 people see it,

2332
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:46,400
like, yeah, it it's it's cool and that's good.

2333
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,960
And I applaud people who do that.

2334
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:53,840
But to me, part of the reason that I do it in the first place

2335
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,680
is because I I I'm one of those crazy people who actually likes to hear

2336
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,920
what people have to say about what I've had to say.

2337
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:04,200
So I read comments, which is not a terrible idea.

2338
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:09,240
I accept compliments, but I don't give a shit what people actually think about it.

2339
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:14,200
Yeah, well, to an extent, I mean, I I'm already right all the time.

2340
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,840
So what do these people have to offer to the conversation?

2341
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,680
I was just checking through my YouTube messages to see examples of spam I've gotten from companies.

2342
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,480
And somebody, yeah, somebody.

2343
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,000
That's all the messaging system is used for, really.

2344
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,560
Like somebody like the occasionally like occasionally some fan

2345
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,400
who's telling you that you're the greatest thing in their entire life.

2346
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,080
And then like nothing but like MCM spam and MCM spam.

2347
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,840
Like I've got a lot of that.

2348
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,240
But yeah, no, I found a thing where somebody made a video reply to one

2349
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:53,000
of my sort of online video, which I will take a look at.

2350
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:59,280
But yeah, like I do like seeing people who have different opinions to me.

2351
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
And I like getting more comments.

2352
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,640
And that's a big part of why I went to YouTube from text blogging,

2353
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:09,040
because I get no fucking comments on any of the game reviews that I wrote

2354
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:10,680
because nobody reads anymore.

2355
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:11,800
Readings for fags.

2356
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,000
Yeah, nobody reads.

2357
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,840
Yeah, yeah, it's essentially the trajectory I had.

2358
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,960
I think I was I feel like I started talking about this earlier and I got sidetracked somehow.

2359
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,720
But like, you know, and I made this video called Invitational Art.

2360
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:28,360
It's a vlog on my Digibro of the Dark channel that talks a lot about this,

2361
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,440
how there's there's sort of like boogie art and pop art,

2362
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:34,480
where pop art is something that's trying to appeal to everybody.

2363
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,160
And boogie art is just trying to appeal to yourself,

2364
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,600
just stuff you made just basically for you without too much concern.

2365
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,000
And boogie pop is what like bridges the medium.

2366
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,400
That's what the ideal.

2367
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,480
That's what the concept was of the boogie pop novels,

2368
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:51,120
was that it was the author trying to after years of not getting published

2369
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:52,560
because everything he wrote was too weird.

2370
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,160
He tried to make something that was weird, but had just enough pop appeal

2371
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,800
to succeed and it did.

2372
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,000
And like that, for me, has always been like a great thing

2373
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,200
because to put it simply, if you don't,

2374
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,440
if you think that selling out is a problem,

2375
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,400
don't post your fucking shit anywhere because there's no reason to.

2376
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,440
If you just want to make stuff that's just for you, that's fine.

2377
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:18,120
You could probably make a fucking masterpiece that no one will ever understand.

2378
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,400
But the second you put it out there,

2379
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,880
you're saying that you care what other people think.

2380
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,680
You care that other people see it.

2381
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,720
And if you want other people to care about it,

2382
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,400
then you have to, on some level, make a compromise and invite them in, you know?

2383
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,600
So like you're it's a it's a give and take.

2384
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,880
Now, you you don't have to compromise all the way.

2385
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,520
You can be like Jesse, who makes videos that are primarily for himself

2386
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,880
and mostly for himself, but he likes it when people do get it.

2387
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,960
And, you know, and he is actually able to make a living

2388
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,240
off of the few people who get it because they get it so hard

2389
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,240
that they really want to support it.

2390
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:56,840
Whereas, like for me, a big part of the appeal of making videos

2391
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,560
is like, how big can I get?

2392
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:02,080
How how can I how much can I

2393
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:07,000
Coto to what the masses want without making something I wouldn't want to make?

2394
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,960
You know, I'm sorry.

2395
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:11,440
How did you pronounce Coutou just now? Coutou, you know what I mean?

2396
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,480
Jesus Christ. OK.

2397
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,200
But like there's there's there's channels out there.

2398
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,320
Let's say you get to a discussion.

2399
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,800
There's channels out there like this, you know, barely speaks fucking English.

2400
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,080
I've said it before.

2401
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:27,080
What makes you think I want to speak English?

2402
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,840
Yeah, yeah, fuck you about you fucker.

2403
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,800
We got to get a boot.

2404
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,240
Anyways, that's Scottish.

2405
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:38,720
You know, as Canada, Christ, I say about about.

2406
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,040
That's not a boot.

2407
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,240
If anything, it sounds like a boat.

2408
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,720
A boat is the fuck.

2409
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,240
Go back to the ground.

2410
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,080
I don't remember what I was saying anymore.

2411
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,600
Yeah, I just I couldn't.

2412
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:55,080
I could never do like, you know, Misty Kronexia level of like and and don't get me wrong.

2413
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,800
I don't think that guy is like just doing it for hits.

2414
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,680
I think he legitimately likes making that kind of video.

2415
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,400
And that's just the kind of guy he is.

2416
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,440
And it just happens to be as popular as maybe you couldn't make as much of that

2417
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,080
as he makes if you didn't enjoy.

2418
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:14,800
I will say, though, that glass reflections like and I just heard this here say second hand.

2419
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,960
But like I was saying how I once criticized him as his videos are like

2420
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,800
if you took every like mal review and Reddit comment and just like

2421
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,200
constructed them into a video of like whatever the most common opinions

2422
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,640
that people has are, you'd get his videos, right?

2423
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:34,720
Like it's like he he somehow manages to reflect the like the lowest

2424
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,840
common denominator opinion of a show.

2425
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:41,840
And I was told are you saying that I mean is wrong.

2426
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,480
Are you are you having a double standard here?

2427
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,760
Are you saying his opinion is wrong?

2428
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,720
Are you saying he's wrong?

2429
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:47,560
I don't know.

2430
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

2431
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,160
He's saying his opinions, not his opinion.

2432
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:51,760
Are you?

2433
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,520
Yeah, I'm saying that I I've been told that he's doing that on purpose,

2434
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:01,640
that he deliberately tries to have the most what he thinks people want to hear

2435
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:06,640
review. I don't know how true that is, but that's also how it feels.

2436
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,720
And whether he's doing it on purpose or not, that is what the what the result is.

2437
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:15,280
It's it's always the most like this is what you would expect everyone to say.

2438
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,040
And that's why he's so agreeable and why people why he's like the biggest guy

2439
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,080
because he writes the most agreeable videos.

2440
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,480
And I could never do that.

2441
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:27,440
I could never try to like meter out what I think people want to hear.

2442
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:31,320
And it's not a good idea to anyways, because appealing to one extreme

2443
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,240
or the other is is even more of a way to get attention.

2444
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:38,520
Like if I make that video about a race, like if I had just made a video

2445
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,920
that was like, here's what everyone thinks about a race.

2446
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,720
Yeah, that would get a lot of attention if I was a big channel,

2447
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:48,280
like, you know, Glass Reflections, but having an extreme opinion means

2448
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,440
that while one sector is really pissed off, the other sector thinks

2449
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:55,480
it's the best possible video about a race and they they worship it, you know.

2450
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,160
So like same with Sword Art Online, that's why that video.

2451
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:02,480
So those videos are so popular because the sect who hates it loves those

2452
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,960
really hate it. Yeah.

2453
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:08,520
Right. Like, I mean, I've got I've gotten the same benefit from Sword Art Online.

2454
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,600
I'm trying to see if I can get the same benefit out of hating Uncharted

2455
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,240
so far. We'll see. Going OK.

2456
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:19,880
It's my it's like my I think too many people love Uncharted.

2457
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,440
Well, yeah, but there's there's people who don't.

2458
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,440
A lot of people really loved Bioshock Infinite

2459
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:28,040
and a lot of people continue to really love Bioshock Infinite.

2460
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:31,840
But for some people, the Matthew Matosis video is the most cathartic thing

2461
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,920
in the world, right? And yeah, that's true.

2462
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,000
Yeah, this is my fastest hit getting

2463
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,720
video game video of all time.

2464
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,880
And I'm not sure how much of that is down to me having gained

2465
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:49,280
40,000 subscribers since I last made probably a little bit of a video about.

2466
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:51,720
Well, actually, no, I made my hitman video.

2467
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,720
I think after I started my big climate subs.

2468
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,680
Oh, no, I made it right.

2469
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,960
Yeah. Now, you know, I had gotten like

2470
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,320
not to hold on.

2471
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:02,800
There is one thing I definitely got to say about because we've talked all about

2472
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,280
talked about personal satisfaction with your work,

2473
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,560
monetary success with your work.

2474
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,680
But then there's also fame and acclaim.

2475
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,280
We haven't really talked about that yet.

2476
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,200
One thing you guys got to know is because I think a lot of people

2477
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:19,840
like there's a lot of great YouTube content creators who have over a million subs.

2478
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,400
But I don't think there's any.

2479
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:25,040
I don't know of any great YouTubers who have 10 million subs, right?

2480
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,160
I think that tier is.

2481
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,880
Oh, really? OK.

2482
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,280
Well, at least, it's very true.

2483
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:30,880
Who, who? Who, who, who, who, Gib?

2484
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,280
Oh, you know what? I agree.

2485
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,520
Yeah. Yeah. He's the one exception.

2486
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,680
He's the one guy.

2487
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:38,360
There's only like 10 shadows with more than 10 million.

2488
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,440
But still, the thing is, well, here's the thing, though.

2489
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:44,080
Right? Are you are you saying that Taylor Swift Vivo is

2490
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,640
not a killer?

2491
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,080
Is going to play play, play, play, play.

2492
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,640
Because in regard to the subject.

2493
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,360
OK, I heard that in a story.

2494
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:53,800
In regard to the subject.

2495
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,720
It's on fucking rules.

2496
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,000
Everybody doesn't agree that shake out was the greatest artistic masterpiece

2497
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
of all time is a fucking idiot

2498
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,760
Is that's another thing that about that you're gonna use to evaluate your decisions just keep in mind

2499
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,760
I just love party music 10 million

2500
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,920
Those though the ultimate biggest big big big big people

2501
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:17,200
My ex-man called his new girlfriend. He's like, oh my god devil shut the fuck up

2502
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:22,880
Can we wrap this thing up, please aren't going to be as famous in the future the people who are going to be

2503
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:29,800
Respected and remembered for decades into the future are people like cg3 or us or people like us or people who are

2504
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:35,240
Not quite at that highest level. They're gonna be the people who are seen as like the Star Wars of this era

2505
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:38,200
So if that's what you're going for remember, you don't gotta be the most famous now

2506
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,800
Star Wars was the most famous when it came I know

2507
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:51,040
It's not exactly one-to-one parallel, but it's going to be like Blade Runner or something like or the thing

2508
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,040
I could have said Van Gogh, yeah

2509
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,840
All right, that's it. Yeah

2510
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:02,360
All right now guys Jeff would say as Jeff would say thank you for watching this podcast about

2511
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,920
Selling out. It was a good podcast

2512
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,680
Why does your Canada spoof sound like the fucking anime snob?

2513
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,320
Give him like a

2514
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:16,560
Montréal voice or something. Like I thought I was going for Quebec. I don't I don't fucking

2515
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,560
All right, thanks for watching

2516
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
Everybody

2517
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,040
Money
