Last month's episode was Charlie Brown versus Inuyasha.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Charlie Brown is a popcorn nihilist. He's a loner with a heart of gold.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm gonna slap this book closed to show you how hefty it is.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, shit! That's what you're up against!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I thought this show was about race realism. How can the Black Tetsaiga be the ultimate flaw?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh my god!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
With the enhanced windscarability, let alone the Konogosha Diamond Tetsaiga with the adamant...

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Charlie Brown has the nuclear bomb and that's a very powerful weapon that ravishes Japanese people.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But do you really think?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In my heart of hearts, I think that Inuyasha could have kicked that football.

13

That's patreon.com slash The Pro Crastinators, giving you a boner every single time.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I am the one who's in charge.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am the one who says yes!

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No!

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators podcast.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm the best guy ever.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh yes, and I almost forgot. The PCP is a podcast with a bunch of internet creators, mostly me.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
These guys are also here for some reason.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But we all make stuff on the internet and here we are talking about our thoughts on stuff.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We've got Hippocrite here.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh gee, I sure hope I'm gonna do okay in this...

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh boy.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, come on, give.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Didn't you hear my confident opening there?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We've got Tom Oliver here.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can confidently say that Nate is not as good as me because I'm the real best guy.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There you go, classic baking until you make it, everybody.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There it is.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Excellent.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Fuck you, buddy.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And we've got Lethal Aurora Mage here.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm gonna bend this podcast over a table and nail it in the ass.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Whoa!

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Whoa, that is confident.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now that's the kind of hardcore MiG-Tau sentiment you'd expect from Lethal Aurora Mage.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, guys, today's...

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's so funny how like...

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
MiG-Tau Mage going her own way.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go on, give.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, I'm so unconfident.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What I said sounded like something I would have said at the beginning of this podcast if you go back.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's true.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That just is what I sounded like.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And now, it wasn't even a joke.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
People would probably be confused.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I guess he's still unconfident as we expect.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If they listened to episode one and then skipped straight to episode 86 or whatever this is now,

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
they'd be like, oh, that gib still shaking in his boots, quaking in his quaker pants.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, we all know that once you become a racist and start saying racial slurs all the time,

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you invariably get more confident.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sure we'll talk about that point at some moment.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You kind of have to.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You kind of have to survive the onslaught, you know?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to go out there and make race realism your thing,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you really got to have a strong personality to back that up these days.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I suppose you probably always did.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But there it is.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There it is.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And that is our topic, everybody.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It is confidence, confidence, confidence, confidence, which I'm sure our audience has in spades.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have no doubt about it.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Our wonderful teenage boy audience definitely is smash and puss on the reg.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, wait a minute.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Has there been an incident?

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Huh?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What?

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, sorry.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I heard it always and I thought I might have been cut off because I didn't hear you guys laughing uproariously

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to my hilarious jokes.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And that was a big problem.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I left in my head.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And joining us late.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, who could it be but Digi.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Digi Bro is here.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey, I got tons of confidence.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's what this is about, right?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's got the confidence to join in whenever the fuck he wants to be casually late for the podcast.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What do you have?

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What do you have?

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Impressive.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, so here we are, everybody.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Confidence is our topic and confidence is our attitude.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So let's head over to Urban Dictionary and find out what the fuck we're dealing with here.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So the top definition of confidence is absolute could care fucking less what everybody thinks.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That is, that's okay.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's it.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's another way to say that is what confidence is but okay.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The second one here is confidence.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The thing girls say that they want in a guy when they themselves usually don't have the confidence to make the first move.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Amig Tao wrote this definition and I love it.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, that's good.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's good.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Third definition of confidence.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which side of the fence is everyone on?

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who is a for and against confidence?

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm against it.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think it's a bad idea.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think it's dangerous.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think it's really dangerous.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm confidently against confidence.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's just a bad idea.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Wait, I just can't tell if you're fucking joking or not because I've never heard anyone state that they're against confidence.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just wanted to say I'm confidently against it like as a fucking joke.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Confidence is like charisma, right?

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They're basically the same thing.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Charismatic leaders have throughout history been responsible for some fucked up shit.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think there's lots of people who have tons of confidence in no charisma.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like that anime snob or something.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's got charisma.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, could you define charisma as you mean it here?

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You've only said the anime snob has charisma.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a dangerous thing to say.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He has a type of charisma for sure.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To be charismatic would basically mean that you have an attitude that makes people sort of want to follow you or to just take an interest in you as a charisma.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He has his legion of sycophants.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He has a charisma that's like cringy.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A cringe-ma, if you will.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, that's good.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I think there's lots of people who don't have any charisma but are so confident that they do.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And someone like him, yeah, he has enough charisma to have a follow.

131
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He has a type of charisma.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The amount he thinks he has is vastly greater than that.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know what it reminds me of?

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's like the mental equivalent of retard strength.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
One who is mentally deficient can have maximum confidence that what they're doing is correct.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Like a baby crying.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But then they're caught and no one's going to give a shit or want to do shit for them.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So okay, okay.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I see a distinction here.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know why that is, right?

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's because with normal people we only use 10% of our brains at a time.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But if you're not concentrating on which 10% you use, then you're just using your whole brain all the time.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So you can't think about any one thing, but you can do everything.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You know what I'm saying?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That sounds legit to me.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That sounds like science to me for sure.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I actually saw a video earlier about how the more confident you are,

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
like the people who are the most confident that they're good at their job are the ones who are the least effective at that job.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Like those people at the post office who give me shit every time I go in.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They're not that great and they also resent me for being there.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's socialism at work, everybody.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's socialism at work.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's what it does.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's my political point.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That stuff interests me like crazy.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And that's what is called the Dunning-Kruger effect.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, that's the one.

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Believing that you are vastly superior than what you actually are.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Just because it's like the less you know about how much better you could be.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Right, right.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's funny.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was just recording a huge vlog explaining a bunch of shit about myself

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and how I'm always accused of being super egotistical and stuff like that

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
because I think I'm better than most anime YouTubers, but I consider that a really low bar.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's a good point.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There's tons of people I look up to who I consider to be way better than me

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and I'm like, oh, there's tons of improvement.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Which is why I think I'm able to be successful and I see things that way.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I've definitely seen people who are like, you know, I'm already amazing.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't need to improve anything and then they wallow in obscurity

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and they don't understand why, you know?

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sure, yeah.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That sort of reminds me of how saying you're one of the better brony analysts

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
is like that doesn't mean much.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, no, it means nothing.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It kind of reminds me of like, so the world has changed, you know?

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And guys like, oh, I don't know.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Guys like Dr. Wolf are now exposed to a worldwide audience

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and they're able to garner some small following.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He has more subs than me so I'm not trying to say that he's a total shit or anything

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
so I respect the work that he's done.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But you can tell there's an internal limit within him

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
about what he's going to do, how high he's going to reach

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and you can see the walls that he's put up for himself

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
just based on the kind of stuff he's doing and where he's going to go

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and like the sort of people he's going to attract,

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
aka weirdo bronies, you know, who got no direction in life and whatnot

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and yet like if he was out in the world,

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
like the real world equivalent that is like a cult leader.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You got like a cult leader and that's what Dr. Wolf is to me.

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's like a weirdo cult leader.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's what he would be without the internet

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and I think he's like Mormon so that might actually be relatively accurate anyway.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But the point is like...

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We should probably name drop fewer people at this.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I feel like we started enough shit on this podcast lately.

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No one's going to object to talking about Dr. Wolf.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't even hate Dr. Wolf the way like Ben does.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just find him a curiosity.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I'm just saying that like people form these very small communities

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
where they're like worshiped like gods, you know,

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or that's exaggeration but like they're treated as like the king of their little pond

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and people are often satisfied with that.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But with the internet now, you can compare yourself to the entire world.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So like where you're saying that people give you shit

206
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
for saying you're like the best anime analyst.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, it's funny because they also accuse me of having that exact cult you're talking about

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and like I'm not satisfied with that.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Like I don't think that's good that I have like a cult of people who worship me.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course.

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And your commenters are formed from a lot of different people

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and they each have the luxury to like choose the attack vehicle they want to go with

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
against, you know, any person they disagree with online.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So, you know, they've got the luxury of doing that

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and not having to be logically consistent because they're an anonymous shit poster.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, that's cool.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But anyway, that's not particularly relevant to...

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was going to say how I think of my own level of confidence

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and I like to consider myself like low in confidence

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
because, you know, I do good things

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and then when people, you know, see that I'm like, oh, it's not that good.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And then they say, but you're, you know, your work's so great, way better than mine.

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I'm just like, hey, it's exactly what I want to see.

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Great, you know, like I don't know whether I actually think I have low confidence or not.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But it makes me feel good to make other people feel like they're comparing themselves to me

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and it's bad for them and it's like, yes, sick, you know.

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you like getting the feeling there of like, hey, if I really did it,

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
if I was like truly out there, I would like be so good.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know what I'm getting at with that?

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's like if you like lower your, you know what I mean?

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know.

232
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like, I'm, I, you know, I, like, I like to think that I'm not very confident

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
because of that reason, but I think I am actually not very confident.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know how to measure it.

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, like, it's too like, you have to be very introspective to know.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You know, I think people who, I think everybody has like a lack,

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
like nobody's perfectly confident, but people who are like particularly

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
confident think that other people are like just confident about everything.

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I think some people look at me and think I am confident about everything

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and that is not even, I'm like everything I do, there's like an element of,

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
oh God, am I doing the right thing?

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Like in the long term, you know, is this going to bite me in the ass,

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
whatever I'm doing, or like, or is this even good, you know?

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And like, I just have enough confidence to do it anyways.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And I think that's what the real power of confidence is.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not about like thinking everything you do is definitely going to be great.

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's just about thinking that there's enough of a chance people will like it

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that you should do it anyways, you know?

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, there's like, there's a couple different kinds.

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I think, I mean, I've learned in my experience

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that there's a couple different ways that like confidence is segmented.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There is, there is such a thing as like pure confidence.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And it's things that guys who are like, I learned about this when I like,

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
looked into like pickup artistry stuff.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Like you can, you can develop a sense of just raw confidence in yourself,

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
which is kind of like Zen.

257
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's kind of just like accepting oblivion of the world

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and like accepting that like consequences don't matter

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and like just learning to accept like the fatality of existence.

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like, and that'll allow you to do things like approach a girl,

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
like be rejected and not care and then just continue on your quest

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to, you know, keep doing that until you like smash puss or whatever.

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So that's the kind of like raw, separate confidence.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But then there's the kind that in a way is much easier to obtain

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but also is kind of much harder.

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And so what I'm talking about is like confidence developed

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
through acquiring skill and through acquiring mastery like of a specific thing.

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Like for example, and I think this is really the kind that I have obtained over the years

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
because I have just done so many vlogs, so many videos,

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
so many, I don't know, like songs and stuff.

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I guess I haven't done as many of those.

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So actually much less confident like my singing ability than other stuff.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But like you just by doing this, like if someone asked me like to be on a podcast,

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm like, I'm ready. I got everything ready to go.

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm prepared immediately. I will have no problem doing this.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And I know I can talk for a fucking hour if I need to.

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think a lot of that comes just from normalizing it for yourself.

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Like, I don't even know if I'm better at podcasting.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I've just done so fucking much of it that like how could I not be better?

280
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Or how can I not do it?

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know, like you just get to a point where it's not a matter of can I or can't I.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's I know I will.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And that's like when a lot of people bring up confidence.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A lot of it is like, I mean, I always picture like a nerdy guy who's like,

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm unconfident. What do I do?

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And the question is like, what do you want to do?

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What is your goal?

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If the goal is to like get a girlfriend, then like immediately begin.

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Like it's not hard.

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You just like to start doing the things that will help you get your goal.

291
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you think you're unattractive, work on your appearance.

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And I think a lot of people stop themselves when they hear what the things they have to do are.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They say, I can't do that.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's like everybody can do that.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And the thing that really pisses me off.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How willing you are to just fucking go through with it, you know.

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Absolutely.

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And the worst argument you can ever make to yourself or hear when people say this thing is like,

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No, I can't do that because that would be me being inauthentic to myself.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When they when like that kind of stuff comes up.

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Now that pisses me off.

302
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That reminds me of this this thing I heard at this like talk.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Where it was like talking about creativity and like stuff and like, you know, your projects and you know,

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are they going to go anywhere?

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And she she said this thing which like stuck with me because of how like alternative it is to the usual like motivational speech.

306
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's like, not everybody deserves, you know, to be successful.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And, you know, maybe you don't maybe you don't deserve to be successful.

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's great.

309
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I wasn't empowering thought though.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, because it's like, you don't deserve it until you have, you know,

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Until you put the work in to be good enough to be a person who does deserve it.

312
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
People feel like they're entitled to a lot in the world.

313
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I think it really a lot of good comes from recognizing that the universe owes you nothing.

314
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And it's completely does not give a shit about you completely indifferent to your existence.

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And once you recognize that and you cast away all that foo foo bullshit about karma and whatnot.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And you just recognize I need to where I need to write this shit might write this ship myself.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm going to get where I want to go.

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then they can start to make steps towards it.

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, you know, something you said earlier, Nate about people saying it would be untrue to themselves to do a thing.

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
My response to that would be like you are not you are nothing like there is no you.

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's what you do.

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, that is you like you are just whatever you are performing at the time.

323
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's no like solid like like your personality or whatever is not like an object in your brain that informs all your actions.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's like I feel like a lot of it comes from this idea of a soul, I think a lot of it steps from that.

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, like, oh, I've got my soul is like this.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's like, no, you are just whatever you are performing, you know, like whatever you're doing, that is who you are.

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And if you do the same thing for long enough, you'll forget that you were ever anything different.

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You know, like look at me.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I was born.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I was born.

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was born.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm just a meme now.

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We were all born with Brony souls, but we chose to change them.

336
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We chose to sculpt them for good.

337
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think some people really say it like that.

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think some do for sure.

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
People who left the Brony community and people view it as like you changed.

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's like, yeah, I was never a solid thing.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like I was.

342
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Everybody fucking changes.

343
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

344
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Like that's just natural.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If you don't like endeavor to change, like if you if you think every moment that you have an opinion on everything like that is your opinion.

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And if you, you know, nobody likes the idea of, I don't know, like making a review and then having a different idea about it later and making another review.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like nobody likes that idea for some reason.

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you think putting things on the Internet is like, oh, that's the snapshot.

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That is this person.

350
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This person has talked about this thing.

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And now that is what they think forever.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Right.

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But you can change your mind.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You should be changing your mind constantly.

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Guys, I want to say, I want to say I slightly disagree.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Like for what give has said, like I agree with that.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But with the whole not doing things like you thinking you can't do a thing because that's not the thing.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Like personally, I have changed over the years as a person's, you know, so I'm not the same person.

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I was like 10 years ago or whatever.

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So like progress happens, people change, people do become different.

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
However, I feel like a lot of people can sometimes like don't change at the core.

362
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
For instance, like there's still things I know that like 100% I'm never going to do in my life because that's not the kind of person I am.

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And not the kind of person I would be able to become.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm just not capable of it.

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Right.

366
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There are limits, of course.

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm never going to be the party girl that goes out every night and drinks a lot and the clubs.

368
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you even want to be that though?

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's the question.

370
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I would like to be more outgoing and not scared of people.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean, I think that I think there's a there's a big difference between like, you know, like you can change things about yourself.

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But like if you don't want to be like if you don't even want to be that person, then no, you're never going to be that person.

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But like if you were telling me like, I want to be a party girl who goes out every night, I'd be like, well, follow this 10 step program and you can be that person.

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You know, but like,

375
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, I think it's not something you can even envision yourself as.

376
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The difficulty of stuff like that is like, oh, I don't really want to be an outgoing party person, but in order to meet people and get a girlfriend.

377
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I think that's a misconception though.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, like that's the way people see a lot of problems like that.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They have to do something they don't want to do to get something that they do.

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah, that's right.

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Like I actually have had this sort of experience back in high school in an attempt to sort of fit in with my fellow classmates and just like make some proper friends.

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I did actually go out and whenever they would do meetups and like drink alcohol and party and stuff, I did actually go out my way and go out and try to mingle and see what it's about and just sort of blend in and it didn't work out.

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I did it like several times and it's just it didn't happen.

384
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Would you say that the problem was sort of realizing that fitting in wasn't something you really wanted if that's what it meant?

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think it's a matter of degrees.

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Like that's the whole thing.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not like wanting something isn't like a binary thing.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's not like I wanted or I don't want it.

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There's tons of things that like I want it, but I don't want it enough to go through this like process.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I mean, that's sure.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sure.

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like I want to be good at drawing, but like the amount of work I have to do to like really get super good at it.

393
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'd rather do 3d instead because I have more fun doing that.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I want both of them, but you only have so much time.

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You have so much effort and I'd rather dedicate my time here.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That doesn't mean I don't want that.

397
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's just that I don't want it as much.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So we have to make decisions that way.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like you could want to go out and party, but if you want that less than like hanging out at home and like reading a book or something, then you want things on those on different levels.

400
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You know, the coolest example of all this is I was watching a David Bowie documentary and there was this part where he said, I don't really want to be famous or a rock star or anything, but I'm doing it right now so that I have the resources at my disposal when I need them to do what I actually want to do.

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There you go.

402
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Great attitude.

403
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like he became a superstar so that he could do whatever he wanted.

404
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He became a superstar so that his Minecraft let's place would get so many views when they came out.

405
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Totally the exact approach I have like at all.

406
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Me too.

407
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I fucking hate being famous and I hate it more every day, but like, you know, I can't make the kind of money I do without having some fame and like I like being able to eat out every day.

408
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So like, yeah, I'm not interested in being a famous YouTuber.

409
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't eat out every day, boy.

410
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm not interested in being a famous YouTuber, but I am interested in eating out every day and like one facilitates eating out every day, boy.

411
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

412
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There's number two.

413
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But yeah, with regards to what Tom said, that was my approach to romance for like the last few years was like.

414
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Romance?

415
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Eating out every day, boy.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah.

417
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There it is.

418
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can confidently say I'm ashamed of all of you right now.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That was my approach to like after I had broke up with my ex-girlfriend like three fucking years ago, I think, over three and a half years ago.

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like for a long time it was like, well, I have discovered I like sex a lot and I'd like to do more of it, but what will that require?

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Like what will I have to do to meet women and like be attractive and like flirt?

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's like probably gonna have to lose weight a little bit or like just change my appearance and stuff, which I don't even really need to do.

423
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I just need to be more confident in myself, but like I definitely have to go out.

424
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like there's no way I can meet women without going out and like putting myself out there.

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I was like, man, I don't want to have to do that.

426
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Like I want to sit around and make videos all day.

427
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Like that's where my passion is.

428
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And like until I've changed some things about my life, I don't want to rush into that.

429
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I think that's kind of what Tom was talking about.

430
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Like that feeling of you will have to make sacrifices sometimes to get what you want.

431
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But like maybe you don't want to make those particular sacrifices, right?

432
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I mean, yeah.

433
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And it's about working smart, not working hard when it comes to all things, including this.

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And like just as you were saying before, like, yeah, like we approach these things in different ways.

435
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Like my whole goal, the reason that I've started doing any shit was because I wanted to be a meme on 4chan.

436
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That is my long-term end game goal to be a posted meme on 4chan.

437
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's what this has all been for.

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Everything else is just filler until that happens.

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I think it's working.

440
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's slowly getting there.

441
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
There's a couple threads.

442
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I've seen the images of worst guy ever pop up and whatnot.

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And it's good.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I like how that's your end goal.

445
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I did that without even wanting to or trying to.

446
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
How'd you do?

447
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, that's right.

448
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Because you were like the...

449
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I was Mexican Christian Bale.Jpeg.

450
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's right.

451
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's right.

452
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And wasn't your picture used for like some like fake thing?

453
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What was that?

454
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What was that?

455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes.

456
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It was like the brony dating profile or something?

457
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Or like the nerd loser profile?

458
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Something like that.

459
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Oh, man.

460
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Dude, something incredible.

461
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's really good.

462
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's good to know that I'm living your dream.

463
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But I can tell you, someone on the other side, not all it's cracked up to be.

464
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I understand.

465
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I understand.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But I don't know...

467
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't know if dreams be memes.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I've also lived that dream.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's not been great for me either.

470
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But it's for like, I am one of them, you know?

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And that attitude comes forth in my thing.

472
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So like, I mean, the goal is to not be there as like a loser that everyone hates.

473
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The goal would be as just like either a funny meme man or someone who's generally liked.

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Like the way they post them.

475
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't know.

476
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't know.

477
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Anywhere.

478
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Like slash our guy if they actually let them post E-Celib stuff there.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, it's quite possible.

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah.

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Honestly, like V is more open to discussing E-Celibs even though everyone says they hate it.

482
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But you will get popular on V before A, even though you will talk about it.

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I agree.

484
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
V is closet A anyway, as we all know.

485
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That's true.

486
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That is very true.

487
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But what I wanted to say, just changing topics slightly, is that like this idea of like defining ourselves.

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Like an adage comes to mind with this whole conversation that I don't know if it's an exact quote from someone,

489
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but it's like you are what you do often, at least to other people and to a large part to yourself as well.

490
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So like if you, and confidence has so much to do with self-identity and like who we think we are, what we think we're capable of.

491
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So like if you, just like Digi and I, you know, and I was saying before, like because we do this thing all the time,

492
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
like make podcasts or whatever, it is basically an effortless thing to do.

493
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And it could be enjoyable and whatnot.

494
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's so effortless and we're so confident that we drown out everyone else on the podcast.

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, unfortunately.

496
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, it's not effortless for me.

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's mostly because there isn't like a very clear format structure for this.

498
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like are we talking about our experiences with confidence?

499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We're just sort of saying things.

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Whatever.

501
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If anybody wants to break in with anything, you go right ahead.

502
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Like do you realize that your earliest convenience, if you have an interesting thought on confidence,

503
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
just be very confident that your idea will be funnier than ours.

504
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Well, it's interesting because my confidence level is basically zero.

505
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm like the anti-confidence and I mean, I'm sure all of you guys are pretty well aware of that at this point.

506
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm depressed and I want to kill myself.

507
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Like that's me.

508
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's my confidence level, like negative seven.

509
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But why, Tom?

510
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Where does that stem from?

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You know, I don't know.

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I wish I knew.

513
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I think about it constantly.

514
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And the reason I wanted to be on this episode, because I wanted to get enlightened by your brilliant knowledge of how to not be me.

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I mean, here's the interesting thing about that.

516
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I always growing up thought I was a pretty uncharismatic person and a pretty, pretty shy guy.

517
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And the time when I really mixed that up was after like I broke up with my college girlfriend,

518
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
as I've talked about it at great length before, and then I went to Japan and it was just a great time

519
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and I had a lot of fun and like I forcefully broke myself out of my shell.

520
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And during that time and afterward, like I did a lot of research about like the pickup community,

521
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
which is just how I like channeled my energy and like learned about, I don't know, I learned about a life.

522
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I learned a lot about life, a lot about socialization, just a lot of things,

523
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
just through this vehicle that forced me to like go out and explore things,

524
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
because the only way to do this shit is to actually leave your house and fucking mix it up and see what happens.

525
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And like, and that is like, when I stopped doing that, when I was just like home,

526
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
a couple years later after I finished my schooling, more or less,

527
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and was just like at home, had no money, couldn't go out, couldn't like do anything,

528
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that all diminished, that all diminished greatly.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But what it finally has taken the turn around the corner, and I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel here,

530
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
of this whole journey, is like becoming, I guess, an independent content creator at this point,

531
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and just like finding something that I really enjoy doing that seems like it's going to work out long term probably.

532
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And just the sense of joy that gives me every day, knowing that I'm on a path that will emancipate me

533
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
from my corporate slavehood and slavery, I guess is the correct noun there, for you grammar folks out there.

534
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And yeah, like I...

535
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Enough.

536
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
My confidence, I feel like the majority of my confidence comes from...

537
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Wait, I'm finishing my point, I'm finishing my last point.

538
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay, last sentence.

539
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It was a funny...

540
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Last sentence.

541
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay, okay, make your funny joke, okay.

542
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, no, whatever.

543
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I didn't realize you were cutting in for a goof.

544
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I was cutting in to say my bit, but if you really have to finish then...

545
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
No, finish, go, please.

546
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Do it.

547
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Well, I was going to start a story.

548
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I was going to start my little confidence story.

549
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Your story is more interesting than Nate.

550
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Just have the confidence to tell Nate to shut the fuck up and hit just a railroad.

551
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
One of us has to, let's be real.

552
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, fine.

553
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay, yes, hippo.

554
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Go ahead with yours, I don't feel anymore.

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I have, like, confidence for me has always been like a problem.

556
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Like, I was a little shy boy, I never really could talk to anyone.

557
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But I've had, like, small victories here and there in kind of pointless things that

558
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
don't really match to everyone or anyone, but are, like, relatable.

559
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And one of those was, like, I always used to look at my feet when I walked home from

560
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
school, and then I heard or realized that only losers do that.

561
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You got to look up, because everyone else is always looking up when I look up from my,

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
looking at my shoes.

563
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I'm walking home and then I decide, okay, I don't want to look at people.

564
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So I'm just going to do the opposite.

565
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm going to look up at the clouds.

566
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And I really like that.

567
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's very strange and, like, people like, why is that guy looking up?

568
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But it's really nice and much nicer to look at than, you know, even looking to.

569
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I fucking do that too, and it also gives me confidence.

570
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And for me it was because, sorry.

571
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I usually look at the ground when I walk and identify money.

572
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So there we go.

573
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey, there you go.

574
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I actually do that because fucking the Megatocchio comic, the web comic Megatocchio, there was

575
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
a part, there was some real edgy dialogue at one point where there's this one, like,

576
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
goth girl character, and she was, like, walking on telephone wires.

577
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And she was saying, like, someone was, like, aren't you afraid somebody's going to see

578
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
you?

579
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And she was, like, oh, most people don't have the courage to look up or something like

580
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that.

581
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And, like, I was, like, whoa, deep.

582
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So I started, like, always looking up, because I had always looked at the ground when I

583
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
walked.

584
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So I started looking up and, like, somehow just, like, seeing more of the world.

585
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And, like, it gives you more confidence specifically because the main reason I do look down is that

586
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm always worried I'm going to fucking trip over myself and eat shit.

587
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So I'm always kind of, like, watching where I walk.

588
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But when you're, like, deliberately not watching where you're walking, you're, like, yeah,

589
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm fucking incapable of walking, dude.

590
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm a fucking badass, like.

591
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Huge comment.

592
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, that was, like, phase one of, like, my learning to walk cool.

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And then later I decided, you know what, I am going to look forward like a normal person

594
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and I'm not going to look away first.

595
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So whenever anybody glances at me, they always look away.

596
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And I was, like, I was doing that for a very long time.

597
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I was, like, yeah, yeah, I own this sight line, this horizon.

598
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
This is mine.

599
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Get out, you know.

600
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You really figured out how to walk from the ground up, which inspired the legendary

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Foo Fighters song, Walk, based on Hippocrates' legendary walk performance.

602
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I like that song.

603
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I like it, too.

604
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay.

605
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
There we go.

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
How confident of you.

607
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah.

608
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I just wanted to sort of quickly address what Tom said about, like, the confidence in

609
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
not figuring out, like, he lacks confidence.

610
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Like, I feel like I lack confidence, too, most of the time, though.

611
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Sometimes I feel like I have just enough of it just to function.

612
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But, like, what I figured out, these are just my musings.

613
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They're probably not the truths of the world.

614
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That should be the tagline of this podcast, by the way.

615
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, that's true.

616
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And a lot of our comment wars that happened just clarified that at the start of each episode.

617
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah, it's just like, when you see other people be successful and do things, like, you only

618
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
see what, you know, they want you to see, because most of the people usually just share

619
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
what they're good at, what they're confident about, how they succeed in life.

620
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But when you're with you, you spend most of the time with yourself.

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You get to see all your flaws, all your struggles, all your down times, all your down moments.

622
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Imagine spending exact amount of time with another person.

623
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Wouldn't you start hating that person, just like seeing them in their worst as well as

624
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
their best?

625
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They're always there.

626
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I totally agree.

627
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Are you saying something about the person you live with, Mage, here?

628
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Is this a universal human constant?

629
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, no, no, I love him.

630
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm with you, Mage.

631
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm totally with you on this.

632
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He's a great cash potato.

633
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I love him.

634
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This is why after Radcon, I hate all of you, because we spent too much time together.

635
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I mean, kind of.

636
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Distance makes the heart grow fond of my dude.

637
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
There's no doubt about it.

638
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah, and it's just like, you live with yourself and you end up, like, hating yourself as just

639
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
something you kind of need to get over or just acknowledge.

640
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Well, I mean...

641
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Also, just quickly, because you strive for success, a lot of people do strive for success,

642
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
and they feel like, you know, they're not doing enough, they're not getting enough, and

643
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
something I've decided to think about, like, just accepted, like, not everyone is meant

644
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
to have their name in the books, you know?

645
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Like, a lot of thousands of hundreds, millions, billions of people die, and no one will ever

646
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
remember them.

647
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Even the people who fought in the wars and stuff, they're just statistic at best.

648
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And maybe I'm not meant to make the books, you know, and that's fine.

649
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You know, I'm just going to make the most of what I can with my little life that I have,

650
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and then when it's done, it's done.

651
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You see, it's interesting that you bring that up, because I think about that all the time.

652
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And this kind of back and forth I have mentally is that, is that, is that, because there's

653
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
people who vouch for either side, like some people say that you have to make these big

654
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
goals and never stop growing, that's the most important thing.

655
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Then there are other people who say, like, carve out your niche that you're comfortable

656
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
with and, like, you know, do small things every time.

657
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And I'm always like, which is correct?

658
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, like, as our...

659
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Okay, here's my objective utilitarian standard.

660
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The one that's correct.

661
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'll be coming.

662
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The one that's correct is the one that maximizes human development.

663
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Like, we need to calculate that and find it out, which generally works.

664
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We know that everything is, like, that's fine as your opinion, but it's not objectively

665
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
better because, as we all know, this universe is going to die one day and none of it matters.

666
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Well, yeah.

667
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So, like, from that perspective, like, human growth is nice.

668
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We don't need myelism and utilitarianism in the same podcast.

669
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Wait, but what...

670
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I did want to make a point just about Tom's sentiment.

671
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Like, I just wanted to...

672
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The reason I was, like, telling my story was because, like, there was a time in my life

673
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
when I, like, really tried to gain that kind of, like, raw confidence that I described before.

674
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And then, like, I kind of, like, gave up on that for a while due to circumstances, but whatever.

675
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And, like, and the stuff that I have now is, like, the second type, just based on, like, skill

676
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and just doing repetitive actions that, like, like, when I'm hanging out with Digi,

677
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
like, who's the one who calls the pizza man, because the other's too much of a coward,

678
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to speak to another man on the phone?

679
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Definitely, Nate.

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's me.

681
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You know?

682
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Like, this is the skill of the choir.

683
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I am willing to call pizza guy, but if anyone else will do it, then they can do it.

684
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Right.

685
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And also, there's the internet.

686
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Why aren't either of you picking up the phone when the internet is at this point?

687
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What is the value of both of you?

688
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
We've had circumstances where we had to, but, like...

689
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
What a nightmare.

690
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What a nightmare.

691
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And then, like, talking to people on phones is, like, the worst.

692
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I used to literally not be able to pick up my phone because it would just get me hard.

693
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Tell that to your dad, who fucking stormed Normandy on D-Day, and fucking...

694
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The funny thing about that is...

695
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, what a nightmare.

696
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Calling someone for order in a fucking pizza.

697
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
You fucking millennials.

698
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You make me goddamn sick to my stomach.

699
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I gotta say, one of the things that's made me more confident over time is just, like,

700
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
growing older and more impatient, because, like...

701
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh, yeah, that's a thing.

702
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I hate talking on the phone a whole lot, but one day, I got so sick of me texting people

703
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and having to wait for their response that I was like,

704
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm just gonna call people every time, and now I do, and it just is so much fucking easier.

705
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Like, I don't care.

706
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Like, I kind of approach it with, like, an aggression.

707
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think that's another way to be confident, actually, is to approach things...

708
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Like, if you don't...

709
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If it's not something you feel confident in, just approach it like you're fighting.

710
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Dude, that rule of aggression is exactly what George Costanza uses.

711
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
He's like, when he's at his desk in Seinfeld, he's like,

712
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
if you look annoyed, people assume you're busy.

713
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's exactly the same law being applied here.

714
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I got used to talking to people on phone out of necessity,

715
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
because I had to make a lot of phone calls to the doctor and stuff, so...

716
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
See, that's the thing. Necessity.

717
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Like, it's just an action you had to do, and it probably increased, you know?

718
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well, yeah, I mean, a lot of the time, things like talking to people on the phone isn't necessary,

719
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and for things like pieces, it's kind of better to use the internet,

720
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because there's less chance that they can hear something wrong.

721
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It is a good skill to have.

722
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We live in a world where...

723
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It is definitely a good skill to have, and I can do it fine, you know?

724
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I just...

725
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
When a bank card, like, fucking fails, or something where it's hard to get in touch with them

726
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
via their stupid internet crap, I will go and call the phone.

727
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I was like, alright, you better be fucking...

728
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You're fucking better at that than I am, then,

729
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
because I still haven't called the IRS, and I've owed them $1,000 for like four months now.

730
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't know why, and I just need to call them, and there's too much of a pain,

731
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
but like, I have gotten a lot better at it just by taking the approach of like,

732
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
get as angry as possible that you have to do this,

733
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and that will be what, like, just do it in rage.

734
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You know?

735
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Like, if I have to call my mom because she won't fucking answer my texts,

736
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
then I'm just gonna be like, motherfucker, I'm calling!

737
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You know, like, I always take that approach, I'm calling!

738
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's funny you mentioned that, because I just finished watching the Netflix Punisher series,

739
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
and there's a line in there, he's just like...

740
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This guy, he's with, is like, afraid to go do this, like, fucking mission with him,

741
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and he says a line that pisses him off, then he gets all upset and marches out,

742
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and then he just is like, huh, pissed off, beats fear every time.

743
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, just like in Terminator 3, when I learned that.

744
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But it was interesting what you said, Digi, about how like, old people,

745
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
like, get more of this like, angry confidence you're saying,

746
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and I think it's because the older you get, the more time that you've spent alive on this planet,

747
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I think the more entitled you get to being alive,

748
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and you know, the more attached you get to this corporeal existence.

749
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You know what I mean?

750
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I kind of know what you mean, but I don't know if you're saying it the right way.

751
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Like, they're more entitled to the amount of knowledge that they've amassed over their long lifespan.

752
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's like, think about a baby.

753
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So people who need to learn things are just like more like, oh god, why didn't you know that already?

754
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
A baby is the ultimate popcorn nihilist, because it spends so little of its time alive,

755
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
as opposed to dead, you know what I'm talking about?

756
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Mate, I am not talking, I blame this entirely on patients.

757
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's a matter of how many times in my life am I going to wait all day?

758
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That's where it comes from for me.

759
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's like, how many times in my life am I going to wait on somebody to text me?

760
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
When that happens for the fifth time, I can't fucking take it anymore.

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Like, that's where the aggression comes from for me.

762
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It really sucks for me because I have really good patients.

763
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That does suck for you, that's true.

764
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
My patients get slimmer and slimmer like every day.

765
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And I mean, if I decide to be patient about something, I can be.

766
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Like, if I know my girlfriend's like, she works till five, right?

767
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And it's like, okay, she probably won't be home till six.

768
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I can very patiently like not go to eat until she gets home.

769
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like, that's fine.

770
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Because I know the schedule.

771
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I know when I'm expecting the person to be there.

772
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's different if it's like, I can't get a hold.

773
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Like, let's say you guys were trying to message me to come on the podcast today.

774
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Like, you'll notice that, Nate, you've probably seen me do this.

775
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Like, I'm always the first to say, just call that motherfucker.

776
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like, if Ben's late, I'll be like, call him.

777
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Because it just resolves it so much faster.

778
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Like, you can sit there and text him.

779
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Absolutely, absolutely.

780
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You can wait.

781
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You can be like, oh, I don't want to bother him.

782
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No, bother him.

783
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like, that'll get him on the fucking podcast, you know?

784
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So, like, I just, at some point in my life, I have to go like,

785
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
how many times am I going to wait for the guy to show up, you know?

786
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I couldn't agree more.

787
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
No more times than I have so far.

788
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I am, I have a kind of tangential, it's not really,

789
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it's just a different topic.

790
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Emails.

791
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have learned to say fuck it when it comes to emails,

792
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
especially, like, important ones.

793
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Because it's always like, for me, it was always like, oh,

794
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
they said hi, and then my name.

795
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Should I say hi as well, or should I mix it up and say hey?

796
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Or is that too informal?

797
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You know, you think about, like, all the wrong things,

798
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
like, you might, like, offend them.

799
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Because you don't really know people who you're emailing.

800
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
If they're on Skype, you know them a bit better,

801
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
if they're on Discord or whatever.

802
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If they're email, it's just sort of like a little bit more like,

803
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
oh, it's still kind of like letters.

804
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Like, I have to say all the best, or, you know,

805
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
best wishes at the end, like, I don't know what, fuck it.

806
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Just put it, I don't care what I say.

807
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Like, I don't have to look over it again, send.

808
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And then it's fine, it's always fine if you just send it

809
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
before doing any adjustments.

810
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That's true, that's true.

811
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
This podcast is really fascinating me because it's making me

812
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
realize the way I deal with so many different scenarios.

813
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because I get a sick, like, perverse joy out of sending,

814
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
like, really curt, informal e-mails.

815
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Like, manic style?

816
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Like, people send me, like, hi Conrad Collins or whatever,

817
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
then they, like, give, like, a three-paragraph thing

818
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and, like, a signature at the end and it's, like, formatted.

819
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And I'll respond with, like, yeah, that's cool.

820
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Send me the paperwork.

821
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Like, like, literally just one sentence,

822
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
like, no introduction or anything,

823
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm just like, yeah, sure.

824
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You know, I've literally responded to, like, ad offers

825
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
with, like, sure, sounds good.

826
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You know, and it's the funniest thing.

827
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Why not?

828
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Why not?

829
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Because I don't fucking care.

830
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Exactly.

831
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
They want you to advertise for them.

832
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They don't care how you respond to your fucking e-mail.

833
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Of course.

834
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Of course.

835
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It's really fun.

836
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I don't know.

837
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I guess they're just making the...

838
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I have no problem with, like, talking on the phone

839
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
or an e-mail or anything like that.

840
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Mine's always in person.

841
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Because in person, I'm like,

842
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
what do I do with this flesh pump that I'm in charge of?

843
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I've realized I'm much better on the internet

844
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
than I am as a human being.

845
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Most people are.

846
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That's the stereotype.

847
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
True.

848
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But, like, even in live things, like on podcasts

849
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and stuff where I'm, like, basically am a real person,

850
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it's... talking one-on-one is very difficult.

851
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, like, I still have trouble making eye contact

852
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
when I'm talking to people.

853
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I don't do that, like, ever.

854
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It feels really weird.

855
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I never make eye contact.

856
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I think it's weirder to make eye contact.

857
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Unless it's, like, a really intense conversation.

858
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Eye contact is how you stare right into their eyes.

859
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Exactly.

860
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Eye contact is how you establish dominance

861
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and you break their fucking will.

862
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But it needs your powerful gaze.

863
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I was always, like, a really shy boy,

864
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and I was always, like,

865
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I really got to learn how to do all this stuff,

866
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but I was really bad.

867
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I never really tried that hard.

868
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But every sort of thing where it's, like,

869
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you know, most people are like,

870
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
oh, yeah, why would you even try that?

871
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Why would you look in someone's eye?

872
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Like, this is just weird.

873
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I think of that as, like, gaining XP

874
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
by the longer I look into the eyes of the other person,

875
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it's like I'm gaining XP

876
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and eventually I'll level up

877
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and it won't be a big deal anymore,

878
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
even though it's kind of unnecessary.

879
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But it's just like, yeah,

880
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I see all those sort of things like that.

881
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And it's because staring in someone's eyes

882
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
was a biological sign of challenge between males,

883
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
biologically speaking.

884
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And it still retains

885
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
that instinct is biologically coded into us.

886
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
To look someone in the eye

887
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
indicates that you are, like,

888
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
saying that I am your equal.

889
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I am, you know, it expresses confidence

890
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
in a sort of challenging way.

891
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So to do that,

892
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you have to, like, sort of face the fire

893
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
of contacting this person's personality directly

894
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and saying I will not back down.

895
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And so it's kind of like sparring, you know,

896
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
social sparring.

897
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I was taught it's just rude to not make eye contact.

898
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So I tried to make a little bit of eye contact

899
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
every now and then, like, to indicate,

900
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
yes, I am listening to you, person.

901
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I am paying attention.

902
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That's the way to do it.

903
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Here's a little thing about me.

904
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm not sure if you guys have it.

905
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Does anyone has this?

906
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Because I have this, and it's really annoying.

907
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I look at people's mouths when they talk

908
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
because if I don't see them talking,

909
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I have trouble hearing them sometimes.

910
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That's really weird.

911
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I think I've experienced that.

912
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I hate, man, fucking watching, like,

913
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
videos I do where it's me and some other person,

914
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
watching myself as a fucking nightmare

915
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
because I never look at them.

916
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm always, like, kind of half-glancing at them

917
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and then looking away or looking into space.

918
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You can see on my face that I'm, like,

919
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
just preparing to say my next thing

920
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and not solely paying attention to what they're saying.

921
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I fucking hate watching myself on those.

922
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I hate listening to myself.

923
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I've gotten so used to listening to myself

924
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I could never hate that.

925
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
No doubt.

926
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I wanted to talk about how I gained confidence,

927
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
which it's interesting because how I gained confidence

928
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is something that also happened to Tom,

929
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
so it's interesting that I gained it and he didn't,

930
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
which was becoming brony famous.

931
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And also, oh, I forgot how it was skipped over.

932
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I actually think I can probably, you can tell, sorry,

933
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
but I think I already have an answer

934
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
of why it worked for you and not for me.

935
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And I also skipped over this thing

936
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I was going to respond to, something Hippo said,

937
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
about being easier to talk to people,

938
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
or harder to talk to people offline.

939
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
For me, it all depends on if I have an in.

940
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's very easy for me to talk to people

941
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
if there's any one thing that connects us

942
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and if there's not, it's impossible.

943
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
If it's just someone in a store or someone around,

944
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
even if I really want to say something to them,

945
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I cannot unless they give me an in.

946
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's why I'm really social at cons,

947
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because I know those people know who I am.

948
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So it's really easy for me to have in-depth conversations

949
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
with random people at conventions

950
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
as long as there's that in.

951
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But BronyCon 2013 was a huge coming-out-of-the-shell moment

952
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
for me, because I'd been someone

953
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
who struggled with conversation my whole life

954
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and never really had many friends throughout all the school.

955
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I never really talked to anybody unless they talked to me first.

956
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But going to that convention

957
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and having literally 70 people come up to me

958
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
and ask for an autograph,

959
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
and then speaking in front of a room of people

960
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
totally unscripted, unplanned.

961
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
We were up all night.

962
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We'd been kicked out of our hotel.

963
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We were dying, and we get a fucking...

964
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We get standing room only,

965
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
with those thunderous applause.

966
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
People telling us we did a great job,

967
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and I'm just like, this is as raw as it gets.

968
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
If you enjoyed me in my purest unfiltered form,

969
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
then I know I can do it.

970
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I know that I can be confident in myself

971
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
because I know that even at my lowest level

972
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
of being able to put on a panel,

973
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
people still had fun at it,

974
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
and people still enjoyed my presence.

975
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
For the sake of our viewers there

976
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and people looking into the subject,

977
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
would you say that it was more of an intellectual understanding

978
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
that led you to that,

979
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
or was it the visceral experience of having that happen?

980
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The visceral experience, for sure.

981
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Intellectually, I've always known that confidence is...

982
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I know about the pickup artist stuff,

983
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
where they just go up to women and talk to them,

984
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and it's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

985
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The cold approach is one of the most challenging things

986
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
for any human being to do.

987
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I've never been someone who can walk into other people

988
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and start a conversation,

989
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
but so many people walked up to me

990
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and started a conversation at that convention,

991
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and nobody seemed to come away upset.

992
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Nobody talked to me and was like,

993
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
that guy's a piece of shit or something.

994
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I definitely have had tons of awkward interactions

995
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
at conventions, especially at my first few,

996
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
where I was even more awkward,

997
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and people would come up to me and say hi on day three,

998
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
and I'm dead tired,

999
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and I have nothing to say,

1000
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and they're like, hey Digi, I really like your content,

1001
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and I'm like, thanks.

1002
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And then they kind of like linger,

1003
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and I'm like, okay, bye.

1004
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Now I've gotten into where I fucking stormed

1005
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
through a convention,

1006
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
all this was me at Crunchy Relaxed Boat,

1007
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
drunk the whole time,

1008
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
storming through the halls,

1009
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
people come up, dude, you're Digi Bro,

1010
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
and I'm like, yeah, bro,

1011
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
give him a high five, and I just keep going.

1012
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You rock, thanks for subscribing.

1013
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You just gotta have that swagger about it.

1014
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
That's pure confidence right there,

1015
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
just feeling like people are enjoying my presence,

1016
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and I only know that because I'm at this convention,

1017
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
people are confirming it.

1018
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
When I'm out and about,

1019
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I feel like everyone is disgusted with me,

1020
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
and I don't belong anywhere I am,

1021
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
but through going to so many conventions,

1022
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I have learned to really get over that a lot.

1023
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It used to be a huge problem.

1024
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'd go to Barnes & Noble

1025
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
in my fucking pajama pants and my fucking robe,

1026
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and I would feel like everyone here

1027
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
is looking at me, and they all hate me,

1028
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and they're all disgusted.

1029
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I used to always worry when I was on the Manga Isle

1030
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
that if any anime fans saw me there,

1031
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
they would think, oh, great,

1032
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
of course I'd find this guy in the Manga Isle.

1033
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
This is what represents us anime fans,

1034
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and now I go in there and I'm like,

1035
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
yeah, this is what represents you anime fans.

1036
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You're a bunch of fucking losers,

1037
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
just like me, you fucking assholes.

1038
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I belong here.

1039
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This is what you should all look like.

1040
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So I've had that kind of reversal,

1041
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and it's helped a lot, man.

1042
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That's why I go out so much.

1043
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That's why I go out to eat all the time now.

1044
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's really helped me to get out

1045
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and enjoy life a lot more,

1046
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to not constantly feel like I'm fucking

1047
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
don't belong anywhere I am,

1048
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
which I used to constantly feel.

1049
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I think you...

1050
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's weird, because I guess it was because

1051
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I wasn't hosting my own panel

1052
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
at BronyCon when I went,

1053
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
but every interaction I had was awkward,

1054
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and I felt less confident,

1055
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
because I performed badly in the podcast.

1056
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I remember swearing accidentally,

1057
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and I was like, oh, shit.

1058
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Oh, that was funny.

1059
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
We all like that.

1060
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I guess it was funny,

1061
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
but I don't remember saying much of stuff.

1062
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And then afterwards, people came up to everyone.

1063
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I was like, a few people came up to me

1064
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and said, cool.

1065
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I would say it was very different

1066
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
between those, because the BronyCon 2013 experience,

1067
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
no one had known who I was before that.

1068
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I was brand new.

1069
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I had just taken off.

1070
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I had never thought that I would be big.

1071
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
None of the other famous people knew who I was.

1072
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I was just hanging out with Tom,

1073
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and he knew a lot of Brony famous people,

1074
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
so I was following him around

1075
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and meeting all these people.

1076
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
None of them knew who I was.

1077
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
For me, it was that very individual experience.

1078
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It wasn't...

1079
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Nobody was coming up to me

1080
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
because they saw the horseshoe crew.

1081
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They were coming up to me because they saw me.

1082
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And I think for you, by the time it was BronyCon number three,

1083
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and you're just kind of in with the pack,

1084
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and there's less of that personal expedition

1085
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that would make it like that,

1086
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
which is unfortunate in a way.

1087
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I think you could have had that

1088
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
if you had been walking around on your own more.

1089
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Maybe more people would have come up to just you

1090
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and wanted to just be like, oh, you're my favorite guy.

1091
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's just a numbers game.

1092
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I feel like if I had been at BronyCon by myself,

1093
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
it would have forced me...

1094
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Because I didn't want to walk around by myself

1095
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
because all of you were there,

1096
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and I was like, I don't know anything about anything,

1097
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
and I'm going to die.

1098
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
First time in America.

1099
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
First time in America as well.

1100
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I wanted to stay tethered

1101
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
to at least one person from the group.

1102
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But of course, if I'm with someone else,

1103
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
there's a reason for me to not go out on my own,

1104
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
and if I was on my own and somebody talked to me,

1105
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
it might have been good.

1106
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
I don't know. It's difficult.

1107
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That also contributed.

1108
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That was far from my first convention,

1109
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and all the cons I'd gone to before,

1110
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I went with my older cousin,

1111
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and usually hung out with him the whole time,

1112
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
or hung out with Victor.

1113
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That was the first con where Victor and Shade were there,

1114
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
but they were just kind of tag alongs to me,

1115
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and it was really my...

1116
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I was the guy leading the pack,

1117
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and it's definitely a different feeling

1118
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
when you're the one making all the decisions.

1119
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You're the one saying, hey, let's go to this restaurant.

1120
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Hey, let's go here.

1121
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That builds the confidence as well,

1122
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and if you're always putting yourself...

1123
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's basically alpha.

1124
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
If you're putting yourself in an alpha position,

1125
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
it gives you more confidence,

1126
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
because you kind of see yourself doing it.

1127
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You see yourself having made a plan

1128
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and executed it, and you go, I can do that.

1129
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't need to follow my cousin,

1130
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
who's older than me.

1131
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I can do it myself.

1132
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So much of this just comes from performing the actions.

1133
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Like you said, you perform it,

1134
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
you recognize in yourself you identify

1135
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
as someone who can do these things,

1136
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and then when a situation comes up in a similar way later on,

1137
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
you just look back at your experience and say,

1138
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I have done this. Maybe you've done it many times.

1139
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It all builds up, and you just feel empowered.

1140
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There have been times when I've been able

1141
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to just walk around in a city by myself

1142
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and look at stuff.

1143
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That was the first time in college

1144
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
we had a trip to Florence in Italy,

1145
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and it was like we were supposed to go around

1146
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and draw stuff in the fucking art galleries and shit.

1147
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And in between the sessions...

1148
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Please draw on the Mona Lisa.

1149
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That would be excellent. Please, thank you.

1150
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's not even fucking there, you idiot.

1151
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Oh, no.

1152
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
But in between, it was like the first time

1153
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
where it's like a school trip,

1154
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
but you don't have to stay with the pack

1155
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
in between stuff like lunchtime.

1156
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You can just go, meet here, back here at this time.

1157
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I was like, oh, yeah, I can just go.

1158
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And I didn't really have any friends in that class

1159
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
that I wanted to stick around with,

1160
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
so I just ended up wandering the city streets

1161
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and looking at stuff, and I bought a vinyl record,

1162
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and it was cool.

1163
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And I went into a restaurant

1164
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and ordered pasta and sat by myself and ate it,

1165
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
and I left, and I didn't leave a tip

1166
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
because fuck that shit.

1167
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Hippo, I think you and I view this stuff

1168
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
in a very similar way, like with the EXP meter kind of thing.

1169
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It very much is like, yeah, you're just working

1170
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
until you level up, and it's less of a problem.

1171
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And I definitely try to put myself in situations

1172
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
where I will have to be confident to succeed.

1173
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And the biggest one for me was this fucking year

1174
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
taking a trip around the country,

1175
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and that was a huge leap,

1176
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
because I was a guy who was afraid to drive.

1177
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I would never drive on the interstate for years.

1178
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I was so afraid of getting into accidents.

1179
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I had no confidence in myself as a driver.

1180
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I hated long-distance trips,

1181
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and it was only because I was literally forced

1182
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
to take the drive to Atlanta when me and Ben and Davoo went,

1183
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
because Victor was supposed to do it,

1184
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
but he ended up having work.

1185
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And because I had to do it,

1186
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and I experienced it and realized it was not that bad.

1187
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It was a nine-hour drive, which sounds fucking insane,

1188
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
but I did it, and it was fine.

1189
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And I was like, oh, this has totally changed my perspective

1190
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
on road tripping, on traveling, and everything.

1191
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And so I was like, I could do this all the time.

1192
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And so I spent two months over the summer

1193
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
just driving to people's houses and hanging out,

1194
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and it really broadened my perspective on the world.

1195
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't feel constrained to any place anymore.

1196
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't feel like a guy who lives in a town.

1197
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, because you've done it.

1198
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's part of your world experience now.

1199
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I've been all over.

1200
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I want to share a story.

1201
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Okay, go for it, dude.

1202
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah, it's just a quick story about me being a social weenie.

1203
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
This was seven or so years ago,

1204
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
so I hope I'm better than that.

1205
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But yeah, so back when I was still in college,

1206
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
there used to be this shop that sell really cool game-related things,

1207
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
like cards and stuff, and tabletop games and stuff,

1208
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and they also sold plushies of whatever was popular.

1209
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And it just so happened, they were selling Pokémon plushies,

1210
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like Snivy, Tepega, and Oshawa, the fuck Oshawa.

1211
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Hey!

1212
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Do you say Auschwitz?

1213
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Auschwitz is that?

1214
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Oshawa.

1215
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, that's much more disappointing than that.

1216
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Oshawa is not the Auschwitz Pokémon.

1217
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It can't be Auschwitz, because that's the water type.

1218
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It can be a fire type.

1219
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Or a poison type.

1220
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Anyhoo, anyhoo.

1221
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So they were selling those plushies,

1222
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and I really wanted to get them.

1223
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
The problem was that the store was actually really, really small,

1224
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and there was a table in the very middle of the store,

1225
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and there were always people playing some sort of game there,

1226
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and me being the little scaredy-mage I was,

1227
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I didn't want to go in, because as soon as you go in,

1228
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
everyone's immediately going to look up at you,

1229
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and I didn't want people looking at me just trying to browse games and stuff.

1230
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
But I really wanted the plushies.

1231
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So I ended up circling that store like several days.

1232
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I think on Wednesday, they were always there playing the game,

1233
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and I was like, well, I need to go into the store,

1234
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
but there's always people there playing those darn games.

1235
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So I decided, okay, tomorrow, tomorrow, no matter what,

1236
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I'm going to go in and get those damn plushies,

1237
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
and never going to come back if I don't need to.

1238
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So I came back the next day, and just so you have it,

1239
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
he had some sort of meeting or convention,

1240
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
and the place was fucking packed.

1241
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
There were so many people.

1242
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It's usually like three or four people.

1243
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That's kind of good, though.

1244
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
You can get lost in the crowd that way.

1245
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Kind of.

1246
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I thought, okay, don't panic.

1247
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
No one's going to notice you.

1248
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Just slip in, get the plushies, pay for them, and slip out.

1249
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Nate, you're forgetting the crucial part here, though.

1250
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Mage is a girl in a game store.

1251
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, no!

1252
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
No, there were actually a few girls.

1253
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I think they were like wise.

1254
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Oh, thank God.

1255
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Decoys, you're safe.

1256
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
But yeah, so I walked into the store.

1257
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I got the plushies, and I go to the counter,

1258
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and lucky me, there's no one attending the counter.

1259
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So I had to wait.

1260
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I had to stand there and wait until someone goes up.

1261
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I don't know who the cashier was, so I had to wait for them.

1262
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And while I was waiting, someone noticed me,

1263
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
and they were like, hey, are you waiting to buy something?

1264
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And I'm like, yeah.

1265
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And then they yelled loudly, hey, whatever your face is,

1266
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
there's a customer.

1267
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And then everyone looked at me, every single one.

1268
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
That's the worst possible.

1269
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
That's right.

1270
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Come to sports, you can deal with these.

1271
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Right, right, okay.

1272
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Well, I got the plushies, though.

1273
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
That story is so prescient to me,

1274
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
because, and this is also a part of what I was saying before

1275
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about just getting impatient and fed up,

1276
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
because that exact scenario, aside from the twist ending,

1277
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
has happened to me so many times growing up,

1278
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
where there's so many things I wanted to buy and didn't,

1279
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
just because I felt uncomfortable in the place.

1280
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I didn't want to walk over to that side of the store,

1281
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
because there were too many people over there,

1282
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
oftentimes playing a game like you described,

1283
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
or just the shop owner seemed like they wouldn't want me there,

1284
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
or something like that.

1285
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
All kinds of shit.

1286
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
There's so many excuses I came up with like that.

1287
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And then at some point, I got so sick of never getting what I wanted.

1288
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I was like, I just have to,

1289
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I don't even care if they think I'm a fucking mongoloid.

1290
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I gotta get the shit I need to get,

1291
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
because how many times am I going to go through going to,

1292
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
because I go to stores all the time,

1293
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
and I feel uncomfortable all the time.

1294
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean, just like, yeah, that's totally a thing.

1295
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
When you hit the wall, honestly, this is kind of arbitrary,

1296
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
because I don't believe in free will and all this stuff.

1297
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I don't really think any of us make...

1298
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We're slaves to the machinery of our brains.

1299
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Who cares about what you're saying?

1300
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Here's the point I'm trying to get at.

1301
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm going to talk about this really cool moment that's happened.

1302
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Actually, no, I had a thing about shops.

1303
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Fuck this idea that you have to be nice to the shop cashier.

1304
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It's impossible, and I've never been able to do it.

1305
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I can't say, hello, how are you doing?

1306
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I can't say...

1307
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Something about me, I guess, they frown.

1308
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They just frown at me like I'm supposed to.

1309
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
They just hate their lives, dude.

1310
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I mean, it's not just that.

1311
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I've been a cashier, it's the worst.

1312
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The person who comes before me says, you know,

1313
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
they don't say anything, but then the person smiles and says,

1314
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
hello, how are you doing?

1315
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And they say, oh, it's great to see you.

1316
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm going to give you my life story.

1317
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Credit card beat.

1318
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And then I come up to them, and they just don't say anything.

1319
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm like, why don't you say hello to me?

1320
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Do I have to do you? Am I scary?

1321
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
What am I doing wrong?

1322
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Fuck you, and I killed them.

1323
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
The answer is yes.

1324
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
The same thing happens to me, and the answer is yes, you're scary.

1325
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I think that's what it is for me anyway,

1326
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
because I experienced that, and I'm like,

1327
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I just look like I don't want to be here,

1328
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and I look like I want to kill them.

1329
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's funny you mention never talking to cashiers,

1330
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
because one of the things I do sometimes

1331
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
to try and build confidence is talk to cashiers,

1332
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
because we have this whole ritual of like,

1333
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
hey, how are you doing?

1334
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Fine, how are you? Good.

1335
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
That's just how the beginning of the interaction goes.

1336
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Sometimes when I'm trying to do something more confident,

1337
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I'll deviate from the script and see what happens.

1338
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Because I remember I went to the cashier,

1339
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and I just bought some drinks or something,

1340
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and they're like, hey, how are you doing?

1341
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And I'm like, I'm kind of tired.

1342
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And they told me what to do, and it turned into a conversation.

1343
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We just had a conversation for like five minutes

1344
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
as they checked me out, and I was like, alright, there you go.

1345
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I'm so glad you feel that way,

1346
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
and I feel the opposite of how most people do,

1347
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
because when a cashier asks me a follow-up question,

1348
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I get excited, because I'm like, oh, human interaction.

1349
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And like, most of the people I know complain.

1350
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Like, we'll leave the store, and they'll be like,

1351
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
why the fuck did they ask me so many questions?

1352
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And I'm like, no, man, I just want to know someone cares about me.

1353
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
They've literally been a substitute for a robot arm

1354
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
that entire day, because they're just grabbing your stuff

1355
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and running it across a scanner.

1356
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
They're just as desperate for an actual,

1357
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
genuine interaction as you are at that point.

1358
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
True.

1359
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
When I went to England, like, I was startled

1360
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
by how everyone was nice and polite.

1361
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Like, I walked into the store one.

1362
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
This is like the very first times I was with my mom

1363
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
when we were walking, and we walked into a store

1364
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and the cashier, like, we weren't even by the register yet.

1365
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
We were just browsing around in the cashier.

1366
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I was like, hi, hello, welcome to the store.

1367
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And I'm like, internally, like, holy shit.

1368
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
You know what I mean?

1369
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Meij, I'm just curious about this.

1370
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Was Lithuania part of the Eastern Bloc?

1371
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Was it part of the Soviet Union?

1372
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yes, it was.

1373
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So was it a communist state under that government,

1374
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
under that rule?

1375
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Do you know?

1376
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I'm just curious.

1377
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Because it seems to me that communism in general

1378
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
seems to make it so that every person working

1379
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
in a communist state isn't working for themselves.

1380
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So every customer becomes a burden and an annoyance

1381
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
as opposed to capitalism when a customer,

1382
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
that's where the customer's always right thing comes in,

1383
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and you have to be nice to them.

1384
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Or you want to, because they're the people

1385
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
who help you make your money.

1386
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Lithuanians are rude.

1387
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1388
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't know.

1389
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm just wondering if that had anything to do with that.

1390
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yeah, they were part of the USSR and stuff,

1391
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
but not anymore.

1392
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Perhaps that's relevant.

1393
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But I was going to say about the, oh god, I totally blanked.

1394
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
God, what the fuck was I going to say?

1395
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
This is slightly, this is less about confidence.

1396
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But do any of you guys sort of slowly start to view

1397
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
like store clerks and stuff as like characters in your,

1398
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
like people, or are you develop like some kind of weird connection,

1399
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
like unspoken connection to them?

1400
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Oh, okay, hold on.

1401
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm quickly sorry to cut you off.

1402
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
That reminds me quickly.

1403
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So like when I go shopping for food and stuff,

1404
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
actually me and my boyfriend, we use the self-checkout thing.

1405
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
However, it's like a female voice.

1406
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And like I named her Clara because like, you know,

1407
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
you clear the items, Clara.

1408
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Okay, okay.

1409
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And like when she, when she's like...

1410
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
This is the depressing version of what I was talking about.

1411
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Clara is great because she never judges me

1412
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
when I buy Doritos and marshmallows and shit.

1413
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
No, no, no, we have fun though.

1414
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Like me and my boyfriend, like when she says like,

1415
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
please pick up items, me and my boyfriend go like,

1416
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
no, shut up, Clara.

1417
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Everyone in this call, aside from Mage,

1418
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
will have been to the Wawa by my house.

1419
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Yes.

1420
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I went there like every day, often several times a day.

1421
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So like I knew, like I don't know any of them,

1422
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
but I know everyone who works there.

1423
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Like I know who, like I've seen them enough times.

1424
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Right.

1425
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And like because I would usually go at like four in the morning,

1426
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
there's this one, this sweet little old black lady

1427
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
who worked there every fucking morning.

1428
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Like she worked the graveyard.

1429
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
She was like the night shift manager, I think.

1430
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And like, so when I went to check out, it was always her.

1431
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And like she obviously recognizes me, you know,

1432
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
like we don't have many interactions,

1433
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
but like if I suddenly trim my whole fucking beard off

1434
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
after a year of growing it, she might be like,

1435
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
oh, you lost the beard.

1436
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And I'll be like, yeah, you know, and I, I don't know.

1437
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Even though our interactions were that limited,

1438
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I felt like really connected to her to the point

1439
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
that I was like really sad to leave that Wawa.

1440
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Like that was the one thing I felt like I was going to miss.

1441
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
In Virginia Beach is like, man, all these Wawa guys

1442
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
are not going to know why.

1443
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I thought about saying something.

1444
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I thought about saying one of them like, hey,

1445
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'm going to be moving soon.

1446
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Like you won't see me anymore.

1447
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Just in case one of them wonders.

1448
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You should have done that.

1449
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That would have been like a total huge XP boost for that.

1450
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
It would have been like a whole other level.

1451
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I didn't have the confidence to think that they would know

1452
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
who I was enough to give a fuck.

1453
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That'd be so funny, dude.

1454
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Wouldn't that be hilarious if you went in there like,

1455
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I just want to let you know, like I'm moving.

1456
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
I've always loved you.

1457
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I've always loved you.

1458
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And they're going to be like, who the fuck are you?

1459
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Dearest beloved Wawa.

1460
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Because the way my mind works is that if,

1461
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
for instance, one of them had stopped showing up one day,

1462
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I would assume they were dead.

1463
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So I just don't want them to think I'm dead.

1464
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I don't blame you, dude.

1465
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I would probably like think the same things in your situation.

1466
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
To me, I can't really understand that.

1467
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Because I don't think I've seen, like I think of cashiers

1468
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
as like procedurally generated.

1469
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't think I've seen a cashier twice.

1470
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Like they just are.

1471
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, really?

1472
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Because I don't go into the same stores at any time.

1473
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I went into that Wawa literally every day for like six years.

1474
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So like that's why it took that much before I started recognizing them like consistently.

1475
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:55,000
So sometimes when the Clara's being a bitch, we have like...

1476
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Clara's being a bitch.

1477
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
She doesn't say that we need extra help.

1478
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And like this one time, I think three or four days in a row,

1479
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
she was being a bitch.

1480
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So we needed extra help.

1481
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And it was always the same lady.

1482
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And it was like in the dead of night.

1483
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Like, I don't know, 2 to 3 a.m.

1484
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
And it was, it's kind of fun though, like seeing her like come up.

1485
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And it's like, oh, hey, it's you guys again.

1486
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And like, yeah, we're having troubles.

1487
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Clara's being a bitch.

1488
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Dude, there's this girl at my Kroger and my local Kroger

1489
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
that we have kind of, me and my girlfriend have developed a kind of narrative about.

1490
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And it was fascinating.

1491
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Because one day, I've seen this girl a couple times.

1492
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
We were there checking out, just buying some food or whatever.

1493
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And like, we needed her to come over and scan something.

1494
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And like, she did it for us.

1495
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And I was like, oh, thanks.

1496
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
No response.

1497
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
She like does her like scanning thing.

1498
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And I'm like, yeah, sorry for that.

1499
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You know, make you do this.

1500
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
No response.

1501
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Not a word.

1502
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And like, she turns to face me.

1503
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
She does not make eye contact, of course.

1504
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And like, the unbelievable, exaggerated, cartoonish like frown upon her face.

1505
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
The biggest I've ever seen in my life.

1506
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Just making me imagine.

1507
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You know, like that Homestuck panel I linked to my Twitter earlier today?

1508
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Like the incredibly massive frowns.

1509
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It looked exactly like that.

1510
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I have never seen a frown of that magnitude.

1511
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And like, I was like, oh my God, what, what is her story?

1512
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
What brought her to this lowly point in her life?

1513
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
To be like, just so desperate and sad.

1514
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I mean, there's nothing wrong with her working at Kroger.

1515
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But like the sadness as she fucking performs her mundane tasks here at her job.

1516
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Just incredibly depressing.

1517
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But then, we happened to go back the other day and we saw her again.

1518
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And she helped us in that exact same way.

1519
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Only this time, she was like a thousand times more like Cheery.

1520
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And I'm like, did she maybe did her boyfriend break up with her on that day?

1521
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Like, what's the story here?

1522
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Did she get evicted on that day?

1523
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What is the narrative here?

1524
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm really dying to know.

1525
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
She has binary emotions.

1526
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yeah, happy and sad.

1527
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
By the way though, I did want to share another little anecdote here.

1528
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And it's just that people think that I'm really confident.

1529
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
But I really want to stick to this thing that people are confident at what they do a lot.

1530
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And like I argue and yell about stuff on the internet a lot.

1531
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So I'm pretty good at that.

1532
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
But at my job, at my much discussed programming job, when I'm walking up to the coffee maker,

1533
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
and I see people standing around there who I don't know specifically.

1534
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And even if I do know them, it is quite common to me do a 360 degree turn and walk the fuck away.

1535
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Just turn back right to face them again, you moron.

1536
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
That's the joke, you fool.

1537
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I anticipated that and I've outsmarted you again.

1538
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Yeah, like I will literally do an about face and just like walk and pretend that I never wanted that coffee anyway.

1539
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And no thank you, sir.

1540
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I've got other things to do.

1541
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Oh, I've been there.

1542
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Just to avoid like having to make conversation with these people that I have no interest in.

1543
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And also, I'm always worried at my job that I'm like not doing good enough, that I'm not meeting the expectation.

1544
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Which is completely different from like my YouTube style work.

1545
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Where I know I'm on top of things, I care, I give a shit, I'm interested in doing it.

1546
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
As opposed to that job where I don't give a fuck and want to get away ideally with as little work as possible.

1547
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And you know, make everybody happy and whatnot, but I just want to do my work and get the fuck out of there.

1548
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So I can come home and do this shit, you know?

1549
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I have a thing that I'm not sure whether people also feel this way.

1550
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So I'll be interested to know if you guys have felt this way.

1551
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I, especially like in school when it's like, you know, encouragement to get involved.

1552
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I hate it when I'm shy and I'm trying to think, okay, I've got to, I've got to psych myself up to do this thing.

1553
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Or maybe I should put my hand up or maybe I should do this thing.

1554
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And then somebody notices or assumes that I'm having trouble and they sort of slyly like create an opportunity for me.

1555
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And then I suddenly don't want to do it because they've just sort of like, you know, so what about you?

1556
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,000
What do you think? And I'm like, I was, I was, I was thinking like that 10 minutes of how I should, like I want to do it.

1557
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I want to be the guy who does the, the confident thing. I don't need your help.

1558
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And now I don't, I don't know, sort of like a, like a nagging mother thing sort of like now that you've told me to do something.

1559
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I'm not going to know exactly how you feel.

1560
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yep.

1561
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I appreciate it, especially like on this podcast when it used to happen.

1562
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But a lot of the time it's just sort of like, you know, it gets me flustered because I wasn't thinking, I wasn't expecting that.

1563
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I was trying to think when to come in.

1564
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's just like when they assume that you have something to say and you don't actually.

1565
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And then they, you know, pause and draw attention to you.

1566
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And I'm like, no.

1567
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
That's when you can meme though. That's when your meme potential is at its peak.

1568
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
You got to be ready to spring a choice meme that you've been cultivating.

1569
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
You got to, you got to work on that.

1570
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That's what it's counting on you for.

1571
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Atom, were you making a point there?

1572
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Were you trying to say something?

1573
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I've been trying to like sneak in a point for some time.

1574
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So I guess I got, I got two things.

1575
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
First, I wanted to go back and say like, why I think did you was able to cultivate his confidence?

1576
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Oh, yes.

1577
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I think, I think it goes back to what you were saying a little bit too Nate about how.

1578
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Was it the fact that in your ship, he was the top and you were the bottom?

1579
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Was that the issue for you?

1580
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm just wondering.

1581
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
No, I think I was always the bottom.

1582
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
He was bottom.

1583
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I think that's actually true.

1584
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I think that's actually true.

1585
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
He was always bottom for some reason.

1586
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Maybe it was a cognitive dissonance for you of not identifying as a top.

1587
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I guess so.

1588
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It shattered yourself perception.

1589
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Okay, I'm sorry, please.

1590
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:47,000
No, I think the reason that that didn't give me the confidence that it gave Digi is because it goes back to what you were saying earlier about how you,

1591
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
gain confidence by becoming financially and like critically successful at something you wanted to do.

1592
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And Digi did too.

1593
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I never wanted to do YouTube.

1594
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's something I just fell into.

1595
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Oh, right.

1596
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That's right.

1597
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I was succeeding at a facade as opposed to something I actually wanted to do.

1598
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's how I feel about my job, like my corporate job.

1599
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I don't care and it doesn't give me any confidence to do that.

1600
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That always felt like a job to me and the thing that I've wanted to do all my life, I've never been able to do or succeed at.

1601
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I hear where you're coming from, dude.

1602
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That's a good point.

1603
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:28,000
It's interesting because I don't know how to segue into this nicely, but I'm just going to go for it is that being part of the PCP definitely hurts my confidence.

1604
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
What?

1605
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
How is that possible?

1606
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
We've talked about that a lot.

1607
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It gives you a measurable structure, like a social structure and I'm at the bottom of that.

1608
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I make the least amount of money.

1609
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I have the least amount of fans at this point in terms of people who actually care about my contributions.

1610
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So it gives you a measuring stick and it gives you a very concrete surrounding of people.

1611
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'm not making that much money.

1612
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
But you do have a lot of subs though, so that's something.

1613
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
That's nice.

1614
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
You've got the views, Mage.

1615
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You've got the views.

1616
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
That's a big channel too.

1617
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Mage technically is way less subs than Tom, right?

1618
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Tom has got like 56k or something.

1619
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Mage has like 55k or 56k or something.

1620
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's those animation things.

1621
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Well, that's interesting.

1622
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
That is definitely an interesting point.

1623
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I see where it comes from.

1624
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I think it's funny though.

1625
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
That's why our stickers are linked.

1626
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
We're both the bot.

1627
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You've got more...

1628
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well, I was going to say you've got more money in subs than Munchy, but he's like 16, so it's probably not a huge confidence boost.

1629
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
He's in a different category.

1630
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
He's in the kiddie PCP pool at the moment.

1631
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Munchy's the weenie hut juniors of the kids.

1632
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Exactly.

1633
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Exactly.

1634
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
He's got more subs than money than like DeVue and Hippo.

1635
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well, maybe not more money than Hippo, but I don't know.

1636
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Well, I don't know.

1637
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
We don't actually discuss like our finances really or anything.

1638
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I don't need to bring that out.

1639
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think it's interesting that you focus on those things as opposed to...

1640
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I mean, you also are the...

1641
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I think the real problem is that you are the unhappiest in the PCP, more so than the actual stats.

1642
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But why is he the...

1643
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
If Tom was making money and was able to do what he wanted, like he'd probably be happier.

1644
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
If he was able to do what he wanted and make money, I think the problem...

1645
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Because it wasn't always the case that Tom was making the least money and had the least subs.

1646
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Like that was not the case when the horseshoe crew was a thing, certainly.

1647
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Right.

1648
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
He was the second biggest of us, but it wasn't doing something he wanted to do, you know?

1649
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Right.

1650
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
That's the issue.

1651
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Yeah, it's more...

1652
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I think it's more a problem of like...

1653
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Like if I had all these subs and all this money and I was like, man, I fucking hate YouTube,

1654
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
then you probably wouldn't be as like, you know...

1655
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Like as readily going like, oh man, I wish I was like, had the confidence Digi has, like, you know...

1656
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Yeah.

1657
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I mean, you've got a guy, for example...

1658
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You've got a guy like Jesse, for example, who like has said many times his great frustrations with YouTube

1659
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and his hatred of the platform.

1660
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But like, he's a man who was already someone who would beat up like a 15-year-old in the movie theater.

1661
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So like, he's...

1662
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
He already had his shit, you know, worked out on this front.

1663
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And also with Jesse, it's just that I feel like all of us are kind of so in awe of his talent.

1664
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Like regardless of whether he's successful, we would still kind of look up to him, you know?

1665
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
In some ways, absolutely.

1666
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Like for me, despite the fact that I'm more successful than him,

1667
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
like I will always view him as a better content creator than me, because I just think he's better, you know?

1668
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Like, so, you know, even if I'm the person who seems like, oh, obviously he's the enviable one,

1669
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:29,000
he's got all the money and all the fans, like to me, I still like envy the talent that Jesse has.

1670
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Well, you know, like I...

1671
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In no way mean to like diminish your experience or your opinions on this at all, Tom.

1672
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But like, I very much felt like when I restarted Best Guy Ever,

1673
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I don't know if the PCP actually...

1674
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That happened like a little bit later, I think, that we made the PCP.

1675
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But like, doing that, obviously, was very difficult for me.

1676
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Like, I knew that I kind of needed to do it if I wanted to like go on and make content.

1677
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And like, I remember, I think about this sometimes, I was really keeping in mind Digi's phrase of like,

1678
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
man, when you've got 2,000 subs, you're doing something very right.

1679
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That stuck with me over the years, for some reason, I don't know why.

1680
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
But in any case, like, I...

1681
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Oh, just real quick.

1682
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
If you want to cut in, yeah.

1683
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yeah, to talk about like, why I got so much confidence so early doing this,

1684
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
is because I was failing at this for seven fucking years.

1685
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Right, right.

1686
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
You know, like, and that's the part I think a lot of people forget,

1687
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
because like, I didn't start as a YouTuber, I started as an anime blogger,

1688
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and my anime blogger was, my anime blog was never popular.

1689
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Like, not even among the standards of anime blogs, at a time when that was the thing you could succeed at.

1690
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You know, like, and a big part of that is because I was fucking, you know,

1691
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I started it when I was 15, like, I was young as fuck doing a lot of this.

1692
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I have matured greatly as a writer, but like, all that time I was taking it just seriously,

1693
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
like, I was still, like, the amount of failure that someone who's like 26 feels

1694
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
when they've been doing it for two years and they haven't had any success,

1695
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I still felt that way when I was 17 and not having any success.

1696
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Obviously there's a magnitude of difference if you're older and you see younger people doing it,

1697
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
that affects it as well, you know, that also can hurt your confidence even more.

1698
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But like, there was a seven-year period where I thought no one will ever read my shit

1699
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
because it's too weird.

1700
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Like, I don't write mainstream enough stuff, I don't approach things in a mainstream enough way

1701
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
that people will ever watch my content.

1702
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And so for me, and I've said this before, like, I literally got 200 views on my first Brony video

1703
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
and that was enough to make me like, this is the future.

1704
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like, 200 views was greater than I'd ever had on anything, you know?

1705
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, that's great.

1706
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So like, so me, 200 views was like this insane amount and now people look at that like it's literally nothing.

1707
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
People are like, oh, if you got less, but people look at like 1,000 views like it's nothing

1708
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and I'm like, nah dude, like 2,000 views is better than the whole first seven years of my writing career, you know?

1709
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
That's a fucking full gigantic auditorium or something, you know, if you think about it in those terms.

1710
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

1711
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It's a fucking lot of people and like, so for me, when I saw 200, I went like, oh, this is the future.

1712
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Like, imagine if I could get 1,000, oh my god.

1713
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Like, and I didn't realize how hard it was to actually like make money through ad revenue.

1714
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Like, I think that a lot of smaller channels who I thought were making money off of it weren't like,

1715
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
and then I later learned like, oh, you got to be a lot bigger than I thought to like for this to be profitable.

1716
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But luckily, I, you know, caught a windfall.

1717
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Like, right at the moment that it was a good idea to be on YouTube is when I got on YouTube.

1718
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So it's like very lucky, but, you know, for me, it was just such a huge confidence boost to have even a modicum of success after all the failure I'd had that also helped me.

1719
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
That's an interesting point.

1720
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:50,000
With regards to like comparing yourself to other members of the procrastinators, like, I understand, like, there's elements of every procrastinator that I envy, you know, like, I definitely...

1721
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Davoo's like mind brain, and then Munchy's like think brain.

1722
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
He's like, well, two completely different types of like weird brain that I wish I had like the ability to replicate.

1723
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I know exactly what you mean.

1724
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I envy Munchy's radicalism.

1725
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Like, his ability to just fucking go for it.

1726
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Like, I can't do that.

1727
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I can't just scream in public, and I wish I could because I had hired that, you know?

1728
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Yeah.

1729
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:33,000
So it's like, I know, it's weird because I have like struggled with like comparing myself to people who are better or younger and better or younger and the same in skill level and feeling like, oh, man, fuck.

1730
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But like, I think I've gotten over it at some point, and I don't know how, and I don't know why.

1731
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I mean, it's really important to be proportional and like keep perspective about these things because like, you know, it'd be considering we live in this world where we have contact with like literally every person on like Twitter.

1732
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Like, you can actually talk to like, I don't know, fucking Donald Trump, President of America, if you want to.

1733
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
You can message the man.

1734
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Like, you can compare yourself in terms of like a 15 year old kid, a 15 year old like 90 pound soaking wet baby weakling could like say like, oh, man, what the fuck am I doing?

1735
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Arnold's up there at like a 300 pound golden god.

1736
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
What the fuck am I doing down here when it's like, well, of course you're not that guy.

1737
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
You haven't put in like 20 years.

1738
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
There's only one of that guy in the fucking world, too.

1739
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah.

1740
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I lately I've been I've been getting over that in a big way like because I used to bother me back when I was like 23 that like a lot of the rappers I liked were like my age or younger and I was like, how can they be so much more talented than me.

1741
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And then like right now, I've gotten really into post Malone because he's got a couple of really great songs and he's also on the H3 podcast all the time because he's good friends with Ethan and I'm fucking obsessed with that podcast right now.

1742
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
But post Malone's 21.

1743
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
He's got like three mega hits now.

1744
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
He's 21 now.

1745
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Wow.

1746
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Currently 21.

1747
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Got three mega big hits.

1748
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
He's a, you know, he's a mainstream success.

1749
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I hear him on the fucking radio every day.

1750
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So because I listened to the radio for some reason.

1751
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:06,000
And I watch him on H3 podcast and I get really excited because he's like, he seems like a really interesting, smart dude.

1752
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And I can look at him and say, okay, the amount of shit he did by the time he was 21, like he just was doing better than me.

1753
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Like he was putting on, like he was part of a metal band that was doing shows back in, he was in high school.

1754
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
He was putting together internet videos.

1755
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
He had like people he worked with.

1756
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
He just put more effort into his craft than I did by the time he was 21.

1757
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And like he's the kind of guy who like, yeah, there's obviously a huge element of luck.

1758
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Like he just happened to get like a song retweeted by the right people and he had the right connections and he blew up on SoundCloud.

1759
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And like there's a lot of luck involved, but that dude was better at what he was doing by the time he's 21 because he was smarter at 21 than I was.

1760
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Like I listened to this dude talk and I go, I couldn't have said that when I was fucking 21.

1761
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Like I'm just not as good as, like, and that's, that's normal.

1762
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Like of course in this insanely vast world, there's going to be a hell of a lot of people who were better at 21 than you were.

1763
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Just be proud of how much better you were than most of the other 21.

1764
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
To make that like an obtainable or like a, like a useful maxim here.

1765
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It's like, I think it's important for anybody, once you start to reflect on how people are doing better than you, that's an important moment of self reflection.

1766
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And you can let that overwhelm you if you're a weak coward who's not willing to like face that reality down and accept it.

1767
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
But the thing to realize is that even if you're like a fucking 55 year old man and you're just realizing this shit now,

1768
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
you cannot change the past, but what you can do is take a real hard look at where you are in life right now

1769
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and start to make mature, rational decisions about how to get where you want to go using the tools at your disposal.

1770
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
It's pointless to get upset at people who are younger than you and who have done better and been more successful, whatever.

1771
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
All you can do is recognize that you have control over things happening right now.

1772
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And I know this is just an intellectual point that won't matter to a lot of people and it's useless.

1773
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I don't know whether it has to be like a rational decision.

1774
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
You can just say, fuck it, I'll just try something and see what happens.

1775
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
At that point...

1776
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Well, that's part of what I'm saying.

1777
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Either or. You can either like plan it out or you can go for it and at that age, you know...

1778
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Well, if your decision is just to try something instead of trying nothing, that's what I'm saying.

1779
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
That's what I'm saying, it's a much better use.

1780
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Obviously, starting stuff later is harder to get good and stuff.

1781
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
If you're a kid and you learn a skill, you'll be great at that skill by the age of 12 if you start at like 5.

1782
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Because that's when your baby muscles are growing and flexing and you're made of plasticine or whatever.

1783
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
It's like how I learned English.

1784
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Yeah.

1785
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So it is harder to do it.

1786
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But it's either that or give up, you know?

1787
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Try or give up, that's all you can do.

1788
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I don't like motivational quotes because I feel like they...

1789
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Do or do not.

1790
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Just like that one.

1791
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Well, yeah.

1792
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I'm trying not to sound like a motivational speaker when I'm saying, just do it, haha, Nike.

1793
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You don't want to sound like a motivational speaker while you're speaking about motivation.

1794
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
There's that phrase and then also like fake it.

1795
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It's mostly because like motivational speakers generally I feel like never actually say anything.

1796
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Like I made a video about this a while ago, a vlog, where it feels like it's like a temporary boost.

1797
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Where it makes people feel like they might be able to do something and then 10 minutes later they're like, I can't do it.

1798
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Because they didn't get any actual information on what to do.

1799
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And that's their responsibility.

1800
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Which is just like when you hit a boost in Mario Kart.

1801
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You get ahead for a little bit and you feel more confident, but then you get red-shelled and like there's no fucking point anymore.

1802
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Like you are dead.

1803
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah, but you just got to keep driving.

1804
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You got to keep trying to find an explanation.

1805
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Try to hit every boost.

1806
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Sometimes some people just need that bit of a push to reach the goal, you know?

1807
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Sometimes, not always.

1808
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I personally don't like general speeches like on Twitter or whatever people post.

1809
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Hey, remember, whoever you are, you're beautiful today inside and out or something like that.

1810
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I hate that shit so much.

1811
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It devalues the times when you actually are, you know?

1812
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Yeah, also I know that I'm not pretty today.

1813
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Like maybe I just woke up, I haven't called in here and I'm still like, you know, groggy and like I have bags under my eyes.

1814
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Well, actually I have dark circles under my eyes rather than bags when I'm tired.

1815
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Yeah, I feel gross and there's this like Twitter post just like, hey, remember, you're beautiful.

1816
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And I'm just like very like cynical, I think that's the word.

1817
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm just like, no, I'm not.

1818
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Fuck off.

1819
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I don't need this shit in the morning.

1820
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I understand why like some people, some people might need that because they never feel good about themselves.

1821
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:09,000
But like, if you're somebody who's capable of recognizing the difference, like, yeah, you shouldn't feel like, it makes it more powerful when you have put an effort to like shit on yourself when you have it.

1822
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Like there's a, I've known a lot of fat people who have like a really huge, Boogie is a good example of this.

1823
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
He talked about this in the HD podcast and he's very against the healthy at any size thing.

1824
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Boogie the YouTuber.

1825
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:29,000
He's about to get a gastric bypass so that he can finally like, yes, I believe he already did.

1826
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I think that podcast is pretty old.

1827
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So yeah, that's already happened.

1828
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I think if people talk to him, losing weight.

1829
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Well, in any case, he was talking about how like, you know, like if you are just confident in yourself while you're fat, then like how will you, you need to lose that weight.

1830
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You're literally not healthy at any size.

1831
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And like, once you have done it, like, you get to feel that confidence.

1832
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Like, if I look like shit when I wake up and I look at myself and I go, I'm beautiful, then like, I'm just going to look like shit all day, I guess.

1833
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,000
This is why, you know, this is actually putting in the effort to make myself look good will give me the confidence.

1834
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
This is why nobody can hate Boogie.

1835
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Boogie, everyone loves Boogie and it's for exactly these reasons.

1836
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But yes, please mage, go on.

1837
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Like, so I was having like a major health issues earlier in the year and a little bit before.

1838
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
During that time, I lost quite a bit of weight due to the health issues.

1839
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And honestly, like after after I recovered and had the surgery and whatever, like, I felt like, like I haven't felt in such a long time.

1840
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I haven't depressed.

1841
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I felt more confident.

1842
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I felt like getting up and doing things like, holy shit, I got so super like,

1843
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I got, I got shit done.

1844
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Great.

1845
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That's fantastic.

1846
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Do you feel more confident?

1847
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Yeah.

1848
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Having done all that?

1849
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Yeah.

1850
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Yeah, I definitely like, like now it's coming back because I think it's seasonal depression.

1851
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But like during the summer and early autumn and stuff and right, right.

1852
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And like late spring after the surgery, like I haven't felt that good in such a long time.

1853
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And honestly, I don't want to attribute it all to like losing the weight.

1854
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Something definitely changed.

1855
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Like, like noticeably so.

1856
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And I, I, I love it.

1857
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's worth taking note of.

1858
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It is not, it is not bullshit to say that like health matters to one state of mind, you know, and fitness in general.

1859
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah, I thought I was like just like, I was so surprised how much of a difference it made.

1860
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Like I always, you know, I was always told that, you know, you know, it's healthier.

1861
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And I'm like, yeah, you know, it's healthier.

1862
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And like I would like to do something about it.

1863
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And I try and whatever.

1864
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Like I never, never realized how much of an impact it actually does.

1865
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Just remember everybody, remember everybody, fat shaming saves lives.

1866
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Keep it up everybody.

1867
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We've got a duty to go up there.

1868
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Not even just being fat, but like fucking just being healthy is a huge confidence boost because you feel like you can fucking do things.

1869
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Like I am a shit eater.

1870
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Like I, I don't eat very big proportions, which is why I don't really gain weight.

1871
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
But the stuff I eat is not good for me.

1872
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And like, there's a lot, there's way too many days that I'm just sitting around bloated and I can't do anything.

1873
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Because I, I go out and I eat so, like I eat a pound of grease and then I just fucking, I sit on the couch and like I just like four hours of I don't really want to work my fucking stomach hurts.

1874
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Look at the fucking Ubermanch.

1875
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Casey Neistat is a, is a monster man of fitness and work.

1876
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Literally working fucking constantly cause all he drinks is fruit shakes and he runs four miles a day.

1877
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Yes, ma'am.

1878
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I was talking quickly about like confidence and feeling better and whatnot.

1879
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Like there's also like a, I noted a significant difference.

1880
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
A lot of people have noted like if your surroundings are less cluttered and organized and clean.

1881
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Oh yeah.

1882
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It has an effect on your mood.

1883
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Also sunshine, sunshine helps, which is why.

1884
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
You're right.

1885
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
This is all real.

1886
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Currently, me and my girlfriend have been experiencing the same like manic depression.

1887
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Like, like even though we're both incredibly happy with each other, like because we kind of let our house get messy at the same rate and it's, there's no fucking daylight anymore because we live in the north and it's, you know, winter.

1888
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So like the sun goes down at fucking four.

1889
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And like, we've both just been kind of like, like very like low energy kind of rut and like just smoking pot all the time to deal with it.

1890
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Cause like, yeah, it's, it's hard to keep up with your environment.

1891
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
It's hard when you don't have sun.

1892
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's hard to like want to go do things when you don't have that fuck.

1893
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Don't live here.

1894
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Don't live in the north.

1895
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Don't live where there's no sun because you will never want to go out because it's dark by the time you have time.

1896
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Move somewhere sunny.

1897
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
The sun is an okay substitution.

1898
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Like what I'm doing personally to deal with this.

1899
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Oh yeah, I don't sit in the car.

1900
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I never, I never fucking turn off the light bulb.

1901
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Even when it's daytime, it's always going to be like yellow in my room because of the light bulb.

1902
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I wish it was a brighter light bulb, honestly.

1903
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
But yeah, like I never turn it off because I need the brightness otherwise I'm going to be sad.

1904
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I mean, the human beings need like, like why does one gain muscle?

1905
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's a response to pressure.

1906
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Your body is coping with this issue.

1907
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
The body needs challenges to like maintain itself.

1908
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And we live, we are lucky enough to live in a time when so much of our lives are made incredibly easy.

1909
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And as a result, like our bodies fucking degenerate and fall by the wayside.

1910
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And we ignore them.

1911
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
We don't give a shit about them because like we're not, we haven't cut up to the lifestyle yet.

1912
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We're not fully adapted to deal with this shit yet.

1913
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So, you know, everybody, you got to take responsibility for your own shit.

1914
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Manage your body.

1915
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Manage your life.

1916
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You got to do this shit.

1917
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Wouldn't it be changing the name of this podcast to Bro Science the Podcast by the way?

1918
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
That's all this podcast is these days.

1919
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I swear to God.

1920
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
You're not wrong.

1921
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Incidentally team, we've been going for quite a while here.

1922
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And I got a bunch of questions lined up.

1923
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh, how good.

1924
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I trolled through the whole fucking discord fandom.

1925
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Incredible.

1926
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
But if you want to fucking get your questions read on the show, become a patron of like anything.

1927
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
You get access to the discord.

1928
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
They ask questions.

1929
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
We read mostly those occasionally a Twitter one.

1930
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
What's the Twitter thing Nate?

1931
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
What's the hashtag?

1932
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Oh, it is hashtag askpcp of course.

1933
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yeah.

1934
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
All right.

1935
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I got a couple of these are like burn throughs and a couple of them are real interesting.

1936
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
So first let's go to burner.

1937
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah, I want to know I feel like none of us might have something to say about this or maybe one will.

1938
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Me cool man asks how important is clothing slash fashion in your life?

1939
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Hmm.

1940
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Incredibly so.

1941
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Not at all.

1942
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Yeah.

1943
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Okay.

1944
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,000
If somebody is like you got to understand is that I stay at home or I go work in an abandoned

1945
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
building where no one's around.

1946
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
So like I have no reason to even try.

1947
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Like I shower very rarely.

1948
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I don't comb my hair.

1949
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I don't do shit because no one's there.

1950
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
No one's there to even know that I smell like a fucking like pile of shit.

1951
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So it's just like why if why even bother when I go.

1952
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
If the climate allowed it, I would wear just shorts and nothing else.

1953
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Shorts are comfy and easy to wear.

1954
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
But seriously, I love them.

1955
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
They're great.

1956
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
When I go outside of the house, I try to look presentable.

1957
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Like nothing people would stare at basically.

1958
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
You know, I don't want to be scared at what I'm holding.

1959
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
She had no thought, gentlemen.

1960
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:32,000
But when I'm inside, I just I just I just wrap myself in my Cheeto scented robe and just sit around in whatever.

1961
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Well, it's good in winter because like you can wear a coat and it doesn't really matter

1962
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
what you're wearing underneath.

1963
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah.

1964
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Okay.

1965
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But in summer, you're like, oh, what t-shirt do I wear?

1966
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
This is important.

1967
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Now people can see it.

1968
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
They can see my body.

1969
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I like t-shirts because they're comfortable, but I also don't like going outside in just

1970
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
a t-shirt because now people can see my arms.

1971
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Is that bad?

1972
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I don't like people.

1973
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It's it's just a it's just a weird thing.

1974
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Like once I once I, you know, do it like like I'm I used to never like not wearing socks

1975
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
like people would go out in summer to the park and they would have sandals on or something.

1976
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And I, you know, I wore socks with sandals because I didn't.

1977
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I didn't like the idea of not wearing that.

1978
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I didn't like the idea of not wearing socks.

1979
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And oh, yeah, here's the thing.

1980
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:34,000
For a long time, for a long time, I only had this one pair of brown shoes and brown shoes

1981
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
do not look good with shorts.

1982
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I wore these to BronyCon and they looked terrible and I looked like a fucking silly boy wearing

1983
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,000
my brown shoes with my shorts and get some get some trainers, please.

1984
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Everybody should get at least a pair of trainers so that they don't have brown shoes with shorts.

1985
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I wear socks with sandals all the time.

1986
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And I think it's anybody who says you shouldn't is just like full of shit.

1987
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
It's like the whole pineapple thing.

1988
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It's just a meme.

1989
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It's a meme.

1990
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Kind of.

1991
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
My metric for how successful what I'm dressed as is does my girlfriend think I'm hot because

1992
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
that's the only thing that matters.

1993
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't have to impress anybody else.

1994
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I hate to tell you, but she'll think you're hot no matter what you look like.

1995
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
That is absolutely true.

1996
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
That's not a good standard to use.

1997
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
That's why I just dressed in whatever I want.

1998
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Why else would I dress up?

1999
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Who am I trying to impress other than...

2000
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
First society.

2001
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
First society at large.

2002
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Who in society needs to be impressed with me?

2003
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
There's a real thing where people like to look nice because it just makes them feel good.

2004
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
They feel happy and confident.

2005
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
That's a thing.

2006
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I feel better.

2007
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I like to exert my dominance on the world.

2008
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I enjoy the feeling that when we go to a fancy restaurant, like a really nice one,

2009
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
when I'm in pajama pants, I feel like a god.

2010
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
The reason everyone else in there is dressed nice is that they had to dress nice to get

2011
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
that money.

2012
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
You had to probably work with it.

2013
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I guess.

2014
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's about simplification, I think.

2015
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The kind of job you would have to work to make a lot of money and be able to afford this

2016
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
food would probably require you to dress nice.

2017
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Most jobs that pay well, you have to dress nice.

2018
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I'm making the kind of money that lets me eat in this restaurant and I show up in fucking

2019
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
pajamas because I also made that money wearing fucking pajamas.

2020
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That makes me feel like a fucking god.

2021
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I get your point.

2022
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I like the idea of not caring about ... because I don't really care about what I wear when

2023
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I go out.

2024
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I've had history of caring a lot and I've just gotten rid of that slowly.

2025
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,000
If I like the way I feel when I go outside, then that's all I need.

2026
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I see myself as a slightly understated version of a SoundCloud rapper.

2027
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
When you see famous people, especially musicians, when they're out in public, they're always

2028
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
fucking ... they got face tattoos and weird dreads and all kinds of shit.

2029
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It's just because they're like, yeah, they made their money looking that way.

2030
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That's the culture they're representing and that's what people resonate with.

2031
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
That's what they're going to look like all the time.

2032
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I hear what you're saying.

2033
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You do, in your profession here, have the freedom to look like whatever you want.

2034
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You could dress and shoot and tie like our hero, Report of the Week, if you chose to.

2035
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I could, but I just wouldn't ... I don't think it would match my content, really.

2036
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
If you say so.

2037
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I think the style I have is very much about embracing this personal self-image.

2038
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm a guy who wears pajamas and sunglasses and doors and an anime shirt.

2039
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That's what I'm comfortable with and I think I look okay in it and I think it matches the

2040
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
style that I'm doing.

2041
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
If I was in a suit, it would be fucking weird.

2042
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Well, that's what they said about Report of the Week and then he became the greatest

2043
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
YouTuber of all time.

2044
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I don't know who that is.

2045
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Yeah, but he also has the slip-back hair and he's like ...

2046
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
No, I've never heard of him.

2047
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
He's the wholesome boy.

2048
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
He's the wholesome suit man.

2049
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Yeah, he's the fast food reviewer who wears the suit and tie and you know ...

2050
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You really don't know this guy?

2051
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
No.

2052
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I'm shocked.

2053
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
He did a review of a store-bought water.

2054
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
If H3 reviews him or has him on his show, then I'll know who he is.

2055
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Just look at this picture.

2056
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Let's just take a second here and look at this picture I'm looking at right now.

2057
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
There.

2058
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Okay.

2059
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
This guy doesn't look familiar at all to you?

2060
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
He's weird looking.

2061
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Yes, he is.

2062
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Yes, he is, but he's a legend.

2063
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
All right.

2064
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Well, whatever.

2065
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Okay, we don't need to dwell on this anymore.

2066
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
All right.

2067
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Next question.

2068
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I like this one from Giffy.

2069
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
He asks, do you think we should tell children that Santa is real or ripped the Band-Aid off

2070
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
early and follow-up from anti-matter tape?

2071
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Do you think we should tell Christians that God is real or ripped off the Band-Aid early?

2072
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Oh, that's good.

2073
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Those are both very similar.

2074
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
That's a very smart-

2075
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Red pill is both of them from Burris.

2076
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
They're both bullshitting.

2077
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
You think so?

2078
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I actually-

2079
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't think I can lie to my kids.

2080
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I feel differently.

2081
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Here's what I think.

2082
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I can definitely lie to my kids.

2083
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I think what I want to teach my kids is Santa's not real, but they should play along.

2084
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Yeah, that's definitely what you should do.

2085
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I want to teach them that they are smarter than all the other kids in their class and

2086
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
they should pretend to be dumb so they can fit in and so they can manipulate people.

2087
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I just think this is just a cycle of just horrible mental damage we do in the world

2088
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
as we treat kids with these special soft gloves.

2089
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
We pull our punches.

2090
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
We tell them the world's full of magic and great things and then you hit a certain age

2091
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and you're like, actually, no.

2092
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Everything sucks and now you're a part of it.

2093
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You're entirely right.

2094
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
There are a couple of interesting facts, too.

2095
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
The facts of the matter are children are not fully rational beings the way that adults are.

2096
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:48,000
They cannot be expected to behave as logical operators the way that we at least expect adults to.

2097
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Of course not.

2098
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:54,000
You need to teach the kids but you don't need to teach them the wrong things.

2099
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Keep in mind that kids consume a lot of media nowadays and when Christmas rolls around they're going to see a lot of Santa Clauses everywhere.

2100
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
So I'm gonna like

2101
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:11,280
Can I have a random side here for a second where they're not gonna believe you over the media?

2102
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:17,640
So I mean how many kids how many kids like believe in like I feel like you would learn

2103
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:24,620
It's not real really fucking young now with the internet, you know like maybe how many kids are out there who don't figure it out

2104
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:31,860
Immediately well, I mean this is a question of like intent should you lie to your kids is like the real right here's that my problem with that

2105
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,380
question, okay, is that I have no

2106
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:43,900
idea why anyone cares because I don't see the ramifications of like oh, no my world is fucking falling up

2107
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,140
No kid has ever done that. I that's I know kid has become depressed

2108
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:56,360
Unless they're actually autistic in which case you should just keep telling them that I quite clearly remember a moment where like my mom

2109
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:03,440
Accidentally dropped the bomb that the Easter Bunny wasn't real and then after that I extrapolate and realize like holy shit

2110
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:07,360
None of this shit's fucking what the fuck like I remember that happening to me

2111
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:13,080
But like looking back that happened in reverse for me because I remember my mom actually told me about this at one point when I was like

2112
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,600
Oh, yeah about the story of how I found out Santa wasn't real

2113
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,600
I asked her about it and I grilled her for a little bitch like you know what it's not real

2114
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,840
And I was just like okay

2115
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,800
And then the part that I remember that was funny is that she said she's like she distinctly remember

2116
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,080
I walked away a couple steps and I turned around and looked her again

2117
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:33,280
And I'm just like a bunny and she's like no, it's not really there

2118
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,600
That's good

2119
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,200
I I just can't like I don't see

2120
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:46,360
To me it's like I want my kids to know as much shit as possible as fast as possible and like I don't see the point

2121
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,360
Think that's important. I don't see the point. I do

2122
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:54,120
Information for four years and then being like oh by the way, I was lying about that and they just like oh, okay

2123
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,360
Why why'd you tell me it was real in the first place like I don't know

2124
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:02,880
I I I'd want my kids to know a lot of stuff, but Santa is like I like Christmas. It's a joy

2125
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:09,200
It's like it's like a it's it's a happy time and it's like it's cool

2126
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,640
Like I remember this one memory of of coming down

2127
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:18,240
To see the the presents under the tree and there was like fake snow and it wasn't there the day before and I was like

2128
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:24,000
Oh my god, it snowed indoors. I had no idea what I couldn't tell I was just like oh

2129
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:31,160
This this throws a wrench into my idea that maybe it's not real because this actual snow hit the thing about Santa that that

2130
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,320
Erks me I on its face

2131
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:39,480
I actually don't see a lot of problem with the idea of like telling kids about like a fake man who brings them presents

2132
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,640
I think that's a cute story and I generally like it

2133
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:46,360
But what I do not like is the way that it is a tool to control the behavior of children

2134
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:53,200
By telling them that only if they're good then they'll get presents and then we'll get cola that I do not like I really

2135
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,960
Dislike that just the idea of like I love Christmas, and I'm the biggest atheist you'll ever fucking meet

2136
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,920
I'm an anti-theist. I hate God. I will kill that man when I meet him like it's I love the Christmas tree

2137
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:07,640
I love the community spirit. I love being around my family

2138
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:14,520
I love just the warm vibes and cinnamon floating through the air and an apple cider and an eggnog and family holy shit

2139
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:21,320
It's I love my family a lot, but we're all very cynical about Christmas. Dude. We need to do a fucking Christmas PCP

2140
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:27,560
Oh, that's a great idea. That's a great idea. I do. I do. I'm signing up right now live on the podcast

2141
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,960
I don't mean on Christmas. I'm gonna do it next week. I'm gonna be at work on Christmas

2142
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:43,760
So really just like I was I work every holiday for no extra pay no extra, but what do you?

2143
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,360
Get away with no extra pay

2144
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,360
If you saw the conditions of the building that I worked in you'd be like, how is it

2145
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,160
I mean I thought you're supposed to get paid a half

2146
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,320
I mean don't you work under the table or something isn't that no no

2147
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,240
He just he'd the guy owns half the town

2148
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:09,200
So if I tried to do anything he would just like crush me so there's nothing I can do about it well Merry Christmas everyone

2149
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,840
I'm literally working for mr. Scrooge

2150
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,200
You'll be tiny Tim

2151
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,120
Wasting away

2152
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,520
Okay, let me just say a huge

2153
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:40,720
About the sand issue I have yet to fully grapple with the the moral implications of teaching my children about like

2154
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:47,080
The control over them that Santa has but I think that it's a very cute story about a man bringing presents to children all over the world

2155
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:49,840
And I love Christmas in general and the tree and all that shit

2156
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:59,720
I felt like it is why Chiaro asks a question from age. What are your art ambitions? What are you doing with the draw pencil and stuff?

2157
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:07,480
Like this is a really heavy question the question is what's what's your end-game page? What's your end game?

2158
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:20,080
A pencil one day, and I do it. Oh, there's like I like this and I continue okay

2159
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:27,720
That's that's great man. Why you because you can't fail. It's impossible to fail. Hmm. Whatever you do is just good

2160
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,920
That's the opposite of me. I just want to be like have a cult following

2161
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,280
I want to have tons of money and like be able to live by myself and not be fucked with all this like

2162
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:43,100
Employment shit, so there's there's a high. There's a high skill ceiling for that first high skilled floor. I should say

2163
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,400
Well, that's nice mage aren't you doing a comic at the moment

2164
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:01,160
Oh wait guys, I have a great question

2165
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:07,240
Are great a great pity question from our people on the on the on the Twitter here the ask PCP folks

2166
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:07,800
All right

2167
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:13,600
You're all gonna like this I think at XG upload asks would you kill someone if you could get away with it?

2168
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,740
And I think I know the answer everyone's going to yes, the answer is yes

2169
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,160
Without a doubt without a doubt. There are plenty of people

2170
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:26,800
Like I am not generally in favor of killing I don't think it's anything I could do under normal circumstances

2171
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,720
But there's like a couple of people who if I could kill them I didn't get away with it

2172
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:35,360
I'd fucking I I feel like I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for murdering

2173
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,960
So what about like a mass murder like if you got like a death note situation?

2174
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,000
And you know about like some mass murderer from like the African, you know rape gang or whatever

2175
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,320
I mean, it's a nice idea to think I wouldn't be affected by having killed

2176
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,240
But but I

2177
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:55,360
Likely would even if it was a mass murder, I'd be like, oh, I'm just as bad as him like it

2178
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,760
I'll head of personal spite

2179
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:08,840
I'm also imagining them doing it with a box cutter for some reason, okay, so that would be more traumatic. I

2180
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,440
Think I mean, yeah, I wouldn't

2181
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,440
Let them suffer through life like the rest

2182
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:24,720
Well, maybe you could kill like your best friend, you know as an act of mercy that that's a thing to do

2183
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:28,560
You know spare Tom from this cruel embrace of life, you know

2184
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:32,120
If I was gonna kill anybody I finally have the confidence to kill myself

2185
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,680
All right

2186
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:39,200
Anti-matter tape this is actually kind of a difficult question because I want to take it as an absolute

2187
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:43,520
Anti-matter tape asks what's the one thing you've always wanted to be able to do yet?

2188
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,560
You've never pursued playing piano drawing making good videos, etc

2189
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:53,280
And I want to emphasize never pursued like I can't say drawing because I've tried to draw

2190
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,200
My answer is building stuff

2191
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:01,640
Like I've always had like I always kind of look up to like people who are like

2192
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:06,520
Like carpenters and stuff like that like people who could just are good with their hands because I'm not at all

2193
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:10,560
And like in the rare instances where I have to like build a piece of furniture

2194
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:13,080
I feel like oh man, I'm doing like what I'm supposed to do

2195
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:18,120
It's like a man, you know like the hyper masculine idea that like we are here to build shit and like

2196
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:24,240
I'm generally not handy and I wish I was but I've never really pursued it because it takes time to learn

2197
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:27,680
I sort of feel this way about car stuff

2198
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:33,760
Like I like people I respect people a lot who like know about car stuff because it's knowledge

2199
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:40,240
That is very useful in our current modern lives like cars are like the biggest thing we depend on that are incredibly complicated

2200
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:47,160
Machines and if you just at least understand the fundamentals of how they work like what a radiator is how the engine works the various belts and stuff

2201
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:52,880
Then you can like not panic like I do when something goes wrong and you're like afraid to look into it

2202
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,880
And so you would put it off for months

2203
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:55,880
Yeah, that's me

2204
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:01,840
Real quick to follow up on what I said like what makes me the most jealous is fucking when Casey Neistat

2205
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,840
When he like wants to make some new prop or something and he just fucking builds it immediately

2206
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:13,960
Like all those tools and he's got all this equipment and he just he just knows how to build things and like his one of his mottos

2207
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,960
It's like there's two kinds of people

2208
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,400
In this world people who make things with their hands of people who don't and I'm like

2209
01:50:23,120 --> 01:50:26,480
Does editing videos count probably not probably not

2210
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,320
Okay, well anybody else. Well, I'm trying to think cuz like

2211
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:38,680
Never pursued is like I pursued like in some small way everything I want to get good at

2212
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,320
Like I've tried I've tried cooking before I've tried I've tried learning languages before I don't know

2213
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:50,440
Like I don't think of one thing. I have an answer for this. Okay, I don't I don't know if did she's gonna say it doesn't count

2214
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:56,120
But my my answer is getting good at math. I I love the idea of math

2215
01:50:56,120 --> 01:51:01,220
I think it's very like a useful skill, but I'm just so fucking retarded

2216
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:08,040
Like like I can't math math is a fucking math is a foreign language from a country

2217
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:13,580
I don't I've never heard the name of to me. It's you know, I just I would if I could I

2218
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:20,520
Just I want to I want to so bad because it's like the coolest shit ever. Yeah, but I just I'm too dumb too dumb

2219
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:27,120
Go to watch the number file. He's right. Okay, so like I'm not sure if it counts never pursuing

2220
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,520
Um

2221
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:34,720
But like singing like oh back in school when we were required to have like song lessons and stuff like that

2222
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:35,640
I I

2223
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:39,320
There was also like a little choir thingy that people could join

2224
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:43,280
like usually the teacher would pick and like I

2225
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:49,000
Asked if I could be on it and my teacher said my voice wasn't good enough and that's the end of that

2226
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,240
Well, got him

2227
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,400
Does that

2228
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,400
You know, mage, I actually feel quite similarly

2229
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:06,160
It's just the only difference. I think here is that like I mean I have done some saying but like I really want to like

2230
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:11,920
Become maybe sort of professional level at singing like I'd really like to spend some serious time

2231
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,320
Improving the way I say

2232
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:20,200
Like I'm living in this torment because like I sometimes have these really wonderful awesome vivid dreams

2233
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:27,160
Where I can actually sing and my son like and it's not just like I can't sing my voice is like so fucking beautiful that I

2234
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:32,200
Belt out like a melody and like I literally stop wars with my voice

2235
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:35,640
That's just me across

2236
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,080
Exactly, yeah

2237
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:39,640
What?

2238
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:45,000
Macross or Macross. It's like that's the plot is that a girl like stops alien wars with her singing

2239
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Oh, yeah, I would a badass

2240
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,400
It's great

2241
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:57,120
Dude imagine if that was Gabe with his guitar instead in Macross that would be Macross 7 where it's a guy with the guitar

2242
01:52:57,120 --> 01:52:59,120
Listen to my song

2243
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,040
21st century digital

2244
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:08,480
Song second side and I just I just want to sing like sometimes when I was younger

2245
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,760
I would just like sing to myself when no one knows that I'm doing a very quiet voice

2246
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,760
So no one would hear me sing

2247
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:20,560
I don't I don't have an ear for it. I'm not good at singing. It can be learned though. It can be learned with hard work generally

2248
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,400
Yeah, I just I'm actually quite inspired

2249
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:30,120
Recently my girlfriend was telling me that like Markiplier recently like spent some serious time

2250
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:36,040
Improving his voice to become a good singer and for what I hear he has dramatically improved and this gives me great confidence

2251
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:41,480
Well, you're already had a great he had a good he has a good speaking voice and his singing voice was good

2252
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:44,740
But he has certainly he has worked on and honed it into a great voice

2253
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:52,260
Like if you already have a great like speaking voice and you speak every day that you I mean Nate's getting good at singing is not gonna

2254
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:58,800
Nate has all of those things. So that's what he's exactly so I can have confidence. I can't improve in a serious way

2255
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,320
Like the name is already

2256
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,120
The best one of the better singers I even like you're better than me and I consider myself a competent singer

2257
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,760
I got a new song coming up here

2258
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:11,080
But I you can you can look forward to that definitely

2259
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:18,480
Because some people are like talented voice actors, but they can't sing for shit

2260
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:26,760
Yeah, Tara strong for example, you know what I mean? What I mean is the a lot of a lot of the singing is just being able to say

2261
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:31,480
Things really loud because that's what singing is and if you're not good at talking loud

2262
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,480
It's gonna be more difficult to sing

2263
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,400
I was more like thinking of like like I'm not even saying words

2264
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:42,500
I'm just like making melody with my voice. So I'm just like, you know, one

2265
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,120
One sound but I change it up to make a melody out of it

2266
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:50,440
Like being able to do that that would be like the best thing

2267
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,600
I it does anyone want to comment on this because there's actually someone posted a

2268
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,720
Question on the Twitter. That's kind of a just an update to the other

2269
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,480
I had I had one one of my

2270
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:04,560
A question to this question. No, no, this was to a previous one. So yeah, please finish your point

2271
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,640
And then I just want to add this. Well, I thought of what I wanted to do but never pursued is

2272
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
Start a band. Yeah

2273
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,920
Because playing guitar is fucking easy

2274
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:21,320
But the baton family band is renowned across the land. I mean, I mean for their breakout album Hilary

2275
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,560
Yeah, yeah, that was that was fun

2276
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:29,380
but like like starting a band is is is so much more like

2277
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:35,080
Social and you have to go out and play in clubs and what and you look at people and

2278
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,800
My president a bit of that go up and talk to people and say, hey, I'm gonna

2279
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,920
I'm you want to join my band like it's the sort of thing you can only really do in school

2280
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:50,280
It's like I missed the boat and then I try I didn't even think about trying to do it outside

2281
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,320
I was just like, I guess I'll just learn it's time. I I am so amazed that any band ever

2282
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,680
Like that they do he's cuz like yeah, yeah

2283
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,480
I you know

2284
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:08,760
I was a I was friends with a ton of musicians in high school and like which they had a fucking band like there was this band called

2285
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:11,400
The Friday ears and it was because they practiced on Friday

2286
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,480
It was my friend Marcus on bass Brandon Tolentino on guitar

2287
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,920
This guy named Arne on lead guitar and this dude named

2288
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,880
I don't remember the fucking drummers name

2289
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,680
I barely met him Herbert and like and they wanted me to sing for them

2290
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,040
I sang for them at one show

2291
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:30,200
But like even though they were all talented except for Marcus he couldn't play play bass for shit

2292
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:37,200
But like both the guitarists were really good and the drummer was as good as he needed to be and I am a competent singer

2293
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,960
And I had written like lyrics. I wrote songs for these guys

2294
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:46,120
They just wouldn't fucking practice or get organized at all like there was the breaker no

2295
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:51,440
Desire to organize themselves even though we like literally had songs that were good

2296
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,400
Like just from like coming up with like riffs and me being like that's a good riff

2297
01:56:55,440 --> 01:57:02,680
Play that one for eight bars this riff for eight bars and I'll sing this over it and that'll be a song and they just wouldn't like

2298
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,800
Do that and it's like this is impossible. I don't know how

2299
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:16,160
Cannot it's tragic to me that you cannot inspire in people like a will to drive or create or like you just you got to have that

2300
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:19,240
Taken like all the talent was there

2301
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:24,440
There all it would have taken is people sitting down for like two hours

2302
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,040
I I once met a man

2303
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:30,680
I once met a man named Ben saint and as much as I tried to tell he could be cool

2304
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:33,280
He could be cool if he just applied himself

2305
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:37,120
He just wouldn't listen and and here we are everybody

2306
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:45,880
Part of that is like I kind of want to to learn all the instruments myself, but recording is

2307
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,760
Recording it's tough man. It's tough

2308
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:55,200
Recording is the worst the the dump dump dump clack like what do you call the drums the percussion? Oh, oh, yeah

2309
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:00,280
Yeah, metronome like like even with having that and you know doing all the things

2310
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,400
I set it up like hundreds of times not hundreds of times

2311
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:07,920
But like I try over and over again and it never I can never play in time with recordings of myself

2312
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:13,560
And it always pisses me off and all I really need to do is just go to YouTube and type in drum beats

2313
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:17,920
So I that I have that sure, but I just I just don't care. Yeah, that's a thing

2314
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,840
I wanted I want drummers. I want a drummer to be there to do the thing

2315
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,640
All right, Nate. What was that follow up cuz I got a great question. I want to get to oh, yeah

2316
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:29,400
It's really just this is a follow-up to the would you kill someone if you could get away with it

2317
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:33,000
Someone else right before that asked the question turbo cow 420

2318
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:38,380
Smoking me for God, um, would you would you murder someone to get ahead in life? And the answer is?

2319
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:45,680
Probably it depends on the person. Yeah, I mean if it's a again the same guy who I'd kill if there were no consequences

2320
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:50,480
Yeah, also there were benefits the doubly watch out misty cronexia. He's coming for you

2321
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,720
Here's a great fucking question

2322
01:58:55,960 --> 01:59:03,000
From Cyprus should we poison children to calm them down or poison ourselves to not give a fuck

2323
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:08,920
But you mean like with drugs I assume things. Yeah, that's what I'm assuming which I thought this was okay

2324
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:13,760
As a question as someone who recently started taking Adderall recreationally

2325
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:21,100
I will say I will not give my kids Adderall unless they like need it like unless they are

2326
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:26,260
Unfunctional without it because and why why is it because it has a really fucking strong effect on you

2327
01:59:26,260 --> 01:59:32,140
Like you really changes the way you think and act and in a way that kids can't like make that decision

2328
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:39,700
Like they can't tell like if that's helpful for them or not like even for me like the amount of I don't know man

2329
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:43,200
It really changes the way you think and like and act and like

2330
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:49,060
If my kids just kind of being a brat like a little bit then I don't I think it's like way

2331
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:52,500
Overbored to like give them drugs like my feta beans

2332
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:57,020
You know, I hear what you're saying my buddy who I who I took some classes with I remember one time

2333
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:59,140
Like he just busted out like a couple pills of Adderall

2334
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:04,040
But like what he would do is he would just he would break them open and you see like the little tiny beads in the pills

2335
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:09,540
He would just take like like three of those of like the tiny ones and there's like a hundred within the pill

2336
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:09,860
I mean

2337
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:15,780
There's a lot of ways that it could be beneficial and like if if my kids seemed like they needed it like I would yeah

2338
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:18,020
Give it to him, but like I think that's a doctor's right

2339
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:24,860
And I know like some of my friends like are horribly depressed as adults because they feel like like

2340
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:29,580
Like Adderall like ruined their life like because they were like too good as kids

2341
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:34,860
And now they're like made them into like a different person like my friend Mike was like a total spaz as a kid

2342
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:38,220
So they put him on Adderall and like it made him extremely antisocial

2343
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:42,780
He like he never he just never really knew how to communicate with people and he was so docile

2344
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:47,700
And he felt like he wasn't true to himself and he feels like he wasted the last like ten years of his life

2345
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:53,300
Yeah, that sucks man like being someone else who he's not and like that's just a lot to fucking do to a kid

2346
02:00:53,620 --> 02:01:00,260
Flippantly like the way that our society does it and I'm like and again if I can just poison myself tonight give a fuck

2347
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:03,020
Then yeah, hell yeah, I'll take that route. I love poisoning myself

2348
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:09,580
I want to be like I want to be the picture of Dorian Gray for my kid like like he stays perfect

2349
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:14,980
I just get uglier, you know, like oh, I like that. That's cool. That's cool. What a cool thought

2350
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:21,220
My solution is just not be around kids cuz fuck them. Yeah, we need to send them all to a concentration camp

2351
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:23,340
Well, they can grow up to perfect automations

2352
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:28,380
I'm just realizing this is a question that only me and Nate have probably thought about because we're the only ones with like

2353
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,980
Plans to have kids in the oh, yeah

2354
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:36,860
Fucking insane, you know, I mean, I don't know. I like the idea of having kids

2355
02:01:37,820 --> 02:01:42,460
You're all crazy. I'm so Vincent and Charlotte are going to transform the world everybody. What are they gonna?

2356
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:45,700
They're going to be a twin president. It's gonna transform your world

2357
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:48,340
I don't know if you're planning to have

2358
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:54,580
Vincent and Charlotte with Michelle, but have you run those names by her and like gotten approval on I have got the contract

2359
02:01:54,580 --> 02:01:58,820
Signed in blood that these will be the names of our twins that are will be enforced

2360
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:01,680
That's like brought up on an early date like by the way

2361
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I want to have kids anytime soon, but it will be a deal breaker if I can't name them

2362
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:13,920
If you do not produce me twin god twins, it will be that'll be the end for you

2363
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:18,280
They have to literally be like Daenerys Targaryen and and Jamie Lannister exactly

2364
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:23,600
That's what we're going for and they better be blonde even though neither of us are blind Jamie Lannister even though I said

2365
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:30,000
They are oh Daenerys. Okay. Okay. I'm thinking of Cersei and Jamie. That's what came to mind for me

2366
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:33,640
That also works, but like I was thinking of Danny and her older brother, but like

2367
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,120
They're like an insanely beautiful dragonborn children. Okay. I'm with you on that

2368
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:44,360
We have we have discussed it briefly and I think we it was just a meme because it is a meme for the most part not entirely a meme

2369
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:49,040
But I mean, she doesn't care then. Yeah, I mean if they don't care then why not why not, you know

2370
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:49,960
I

2371
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:55,400
Here's one that I don't even know if anybody I have an answer to but maybe someone magically does one spar asks

2372
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,800
Are there any cool dead malls near any of you?

2373
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:03,920
There's a couple of cool live malls around me. Yeah, if you go down if you look down the chute

2374
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,920
There's a dead Darth Maul

2375
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:12,160
Because it was

2376
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:18,560
Are there any cool dead malls near you like places that used to have open stores and people going in and out eating dippin dots ice cream of

2377
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:23,840
The future in the yeah, but now they're just empty sad graveyards of corporate history had to bring that up because a

2378
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:28,800
Munchy was on a dippin dots tear like asking us a ton of questions about dippin dots and

2379
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:33,720
And everybody joined in on that and that was where I cut off the questions

2380
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:40,680
It's funny to mention that because at the creationist museum that is my favorite thing in the world

2381
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:44,120
That is near where I live in Cincinnati. It's in Kentucky across the border

2382
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:46,600
But there there were many like

2383
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:52,880
Abandoned like the the creations museum is still alive and kicking but the dip and dot stands are abandoned and decrepit

2384
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:56,560
Which is like I don't know is that like indicative like that's why the future

2385
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:57,520
No, listen to this

2386
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:02,640
Here's the metaphor the future has died at the creationist museum and only the ancient archaic past

2387
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:06,840
Knowledge lives on it's interesting that you say that because I went to Six Flags

2388
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:11,440
Like a couple months ago and all the dippin dots places today. We're all abandoned to oh my god

2389
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:15,240
I mean open and thriving our future is over. There is no future for us

2390
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:28,360
A few years ago, but like yeah, maybe me sister and her boyfriend at the time we were trying to go see a movie

2391
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,960
But we were late at this one mall. So we quickly went to this other mall

2392
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:39,080
That I haven't been to before and it was like partially dead because there's only like a few stores open

2393
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:43,240
Most of them were already closed even though it wasn't closing time. They seem like permanently closed

2394
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:48,460
No one else was around and we went to the like the movies and like oh shit

2395
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:53,900
We're late is the movie still going and they're like we can run the movie for you if you want

2396
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:58,980
Well, so you're like whoa weird. That's interesting though deep level dead

2397
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:03,460
Well, I have one spar another chance because we didn't have that much of an answer to that

2398
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:06,940
But this is our last question by the way, I think I've only got two more though

2399
02:05:06,940 --> 02:05:10,560
Okay, we'll do two more. We'll do one sparse the next question PCP

2400
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:15,520
If any of you were given the opportunity to go back in time and prevent your real identities from being revealed to the internet

2401
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:20,160
Essentially re-establishing your anonymity. Would you take it? That is fascinating?

2402
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:24,400
Yes, that's a fascinating question because I actually did that when I like made best guy ever

2403
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:30,200
Yeah, I'm in a sense. So I feel like yeah, but like now I'm like past it

2404
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:34,240
And it doesn't matter to me like like just how people will like bring up like oh look at Digi Brony

2405
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:38,000
MLP over here like no one can say like look at keg standard over here

2406
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,400
It's like who are you talking about what they can't I don't understand

2407
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,080
I'm lucky

2408
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:50,920
But that's your but that's your your your your corporate identity mage

2409
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:55,080
The lethal or mage brand is far-reaching and well-respected. I'm just saying like

2410
02:05:56,760 --> 02:06:00,400
Oh, I see what you mean. That's why I was laughing a little bit

2411
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:05,040
May just be all of us. I mean, it's true

2412
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:12,680
Tom you go I was gonna say I don't know if anyone I mean I guess some people know my identity

2413
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:15,800
But I don't like throw it out there or anything. So I'm not too worried about it

2414
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:21,120
Yeah, this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately because my identity is way too out there

2415
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,240
You share a lot of information. You know, we all do but you have too much

2416
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
it's gotten weird and

2417
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:35,720
But like I can't imagine like I can't just imagine preventing my identity from being revealed because that would just mean like changing the whole nature

2418
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:39,600
Like just yeah, who you are is to do this is to like reveal yourself

2419
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:43,960
I have I have given a lot of consideration to

2420
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:51,680
Disappearing and there are ways to do that and all you really got to do is ghost right or not

2421
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,440
You know like just all you got to do is kill you

2422
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:55,040
What was I mean?

2423
02:06:55,040 --> 02:07:00,680
I was just the idea for like the girl pony that he wanted to write for which is honestly like I have sheep over is that's like

2424
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:06,400
Which yeah, I mean, I love sheep over new video today everybody fuck. Yeah, I was good

2425
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:11,320
But it's it's it's not as hard as I think people would imagine and I've kind of done this before

2426
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:18,040
I've made like blogs under different names and just like run it to a different audience and not told anybody it was me

2427
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:24,400
Because I didn't want just because I didn't want my identity tied to it not even out of like any kind of fear

2428
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:29,760
I just wanted people to interpret the text differently. Like I didn't want them to think of it as something I wrote

2429
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,800
Yeah, remove the baggage. Yeah

2430
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:39,360
I think anonymity is is a I really appreciate the theory behind 4chan like that's why I love 4chan still

2431
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:44,840
Yeah, I'm fortunately like the theory doesn't like is in practice like not really that effective

2432
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:51,000
It draws out the like people are gonna cluster who want to say things that they cannot say in public

2433
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,160
So you get that too. I have come to realize in recent times that I don't really like being famous

2434
02:07:56,160 --> 02:08:01,680
I don't really like having my as much of myself out there as I do and I hope that in the future

2435
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:09,080
When my YouTube thing kind of dwindles that I can just go straight for other people and and and get rich behind the scenes

2436
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:12,200
That would be beautiful. I don't know how serious that's nice

2437
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:17,760
I crave attention like a dying thirsty man craves water

2438
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,280
And I will I think I'll continue to do this shit as long as I live now

2439
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:27,120
But perhaps when I get you know bigger I might decide that I don't like it and I don't like all the attention

2440
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:33,320
But for now I'm still going strong personally has has any but have any of you ever had like this weird thought of imagining like

2441
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:39,320
30 years in our future where we're gonna have all these like 60 and 70 year old vloggers. Yeah, I thought of that

2442
02:08:39,320 --> 02:08:42,960
I think people are gonna change media will be the same at all. I agree

2443
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,880
I don't think YouTube is gonna survive like five more years. We're gonna have some weird paradigm

2444
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:54,000
I feel like that's gonna be a thing that still exists in some weird way like yeah, man. That's gonna be fucking odd

2445
02:08:54,760 --> 02:09:01,320
All right one last easy question squid Miku asks. What's your favorite strawberry thing minus strawberry milk?

2446
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:06,800
I just had a delicious from P. F. Chang's. I got myself a

2447
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:10,840
It was like a what was it called like a Vietnamese volcano cake

2448
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:16,720
Which is just like a chocolate cake with some strawberries on top and other fruits and like came with vanilla ice cream

2449
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:21,360
And like what I love about strawberries the most is eating like other things

2450
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:26,120
Especially like a chocolate cake with a strawberry in it. Just like other fruit of the strawberry. It is

2451
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:34,000
Divinely delectable like that meme where you see like the kaon meme of like the girl stealing the strawberry from Mio's cake

2452
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:40,600
And she like breaks into tears. That's me if anyone takes my fucking strawberry. It is the most delicious part. It is fantastic

2453
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,600
So that that's my vote. That's my vote

2454
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:45,600
I like strawberry jam the most

2455
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:47,520
I

2456
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:53,080
Like in jam strawberry jam doughnuts and sometimes on toast. I don't know. I like strawberry

2457
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:54,560
I don't have strawberry stuff that much

2458
02:09:54,560 --> 02:10:00,920
I want to clarify that like strawberry looks like the only strawberry thing I like because I always grape and blueberry if there's an option

2459
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:06,840
Like but why does strawberry have to be just because it's not as delicious as a blueberry or grape?

2460
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:13,120
It could still be your favorite strawberry thing like I love strawberry frosted doughnuts as opposed to like those bullshit chocolate frosted

2461
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:19,800
Doughnuts strawberry every time. I love those. They're a niche product. If the blueberry is an option. I always blueberry

2462
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:23,040
Well, all right, Tom and me cheesecake mochi

2463
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:27,240
Hmm. Oh, that sounds good. Machi or mochi

2464
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:29,880
Mochi mochi interesting

2465
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:33,880
Mochi seems like American

2466
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,840
Like something Americans would say but I feel like you the proper pronunciate wait, what what is this thing?

2467
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,880
Please describe the characteristics of this delicious food. Wait mochi is a Japanese

2468
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:49,680
Yeah, that's what I'm asking it. Is it the round squishy like Japanese food thing. Oh, okay. Okay. I see

2469
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:53,720
It could also be like called a different word, which is like the sweeter version of it

2470
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,360
It starts with a D

2471
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:59,560
Dango dango. No, no, no not dango. I

2472
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:05,560
Don't remember right now. It doesn't matter. But yeah, it's like for the westerners

2473
02:11:05,560 --> 02:11:09,080
It's usually just called mochi in restaurants and stuff. Okay

2474
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:14,320
What about caramelized salted strawberries? That sounds delicious. I

2475
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:19,920
Want to make that and eat Tom. What's your favorite strawberry thing? I just like strawberry milkshakes

2476
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:26,080
Oh, we did we went to a sushi

2477
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:31,720
The sushi was made of Pokemon

2478
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:34,400
All right, oh my god. Yeah, we're done

2479
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:40,680
That's for that extra important question. Did you really ran it on a positive strong note there?

2480
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,080
Just I just want to talk about your strawberry milk

2481
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:48,360

I just want to say this like keep like pay attention to the stickers

2496
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:56,960
You'll see that some of them are facing in some directions and some of them are pointing to some directions

2497
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,080
I had this idea of buying all the stickers. I'm arranging them and like

2498
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:07,920
Making a line that like everyone's pointing or like facing at someone's and it's what are they pointing to?

2499
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,520
Where does it all lead? What's the narrative? What's the meta narrative behind these? Wow fascinating?

2500
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:19,480
Like like if oh if oh he placed a little Tom and Mage one to point to the power button on the on the PC

2501
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,480
I thought that was how helpful how helpful

2509
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:52,240
Listing this on Google player

2510
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:55,960
Which you can do by searching for it

2511
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:01,720
Procrastinators two words copyright and it's there all the episodes

2512
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:06,480
I'm so glad you're here to remind us about that time because I legitimately just don't remember because I don't think about it

2513
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:09,400
But it is I'm not trying to downplay I really have

2514
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:16,280
These ads in the middle of the episode as well like you know your right podcast does that's we should do it like

2515
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:19,480
We need some sponsorships

2516
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:26,240
than any podcast that I listen to what are we gonna be sponsored by Casper mattresses that's what I'm

2517
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:30,760
Literally have been using one for years. They need to sponsor us. I love

2518
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:36,560
And are you serious as I've been listening to biggest problem and I do keep mentioning them

2519
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,560
I literally

2520
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:49,760
Before we go I know this is like totally like not something we should even ask on the pause

2521
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:54,480
It's not but what was taking it out of the box as cool as they hyped it up on this problem

2522
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,120
It's just that the box is so small and

2523
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:04,920
Because you can't you literally could not get it back in there. It's like back right right so like it's uh

2524
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:09,800
It's not something that you can read you just like solve the one of the mysteries of my life for the past like

2525
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,800
Patrons I can send you that video

2526
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,760
I need to know

2527
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:21,760
I actually had a patreon goal of buying that I remember that

2528
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:41,480
Right now I'm supposed to be working right now

2529
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,920
I'm doing nothing

2530
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,200
Myself I'm sucking

2531
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:01,880
I've got a deadline don't want to

2532
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:07,000
