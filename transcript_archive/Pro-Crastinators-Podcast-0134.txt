00:00:00 Hello everybody and welcome to another amazing high-octane-action episode of the
00:00:29 Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:53 How's it going, it's me, he's on the podcast, Ray, it's me, Garfield, here to bring the
00:01:06 mood down for everybody.
00:01:08 Fantastic, I would expect nothing less.
00:01:13 We have the Paladin of Purple, Lethal Aurora Mage.
00:01:17 How am I a paladin if I'm a mage?
00:01:20 I don't know, you're multi-classing, like in Final Fantasy XI, the best game in the
00:01:26 series.
00:01:27 But I specialize in purple magic.
00:01:30 Yeah, purple magic is magic done for your deity, purple, so you're also a holy mage,
00:01:36 so you're a paladin.
00:01:37 It's fine.
00:01:38 Okay, acceptable, acceptable.
00:01:43 We have Nate, the Starfleet boy who's been through to some strange issues with the holodeck,
00:01:50 is now in this desolate wasteland with no resources and no idea what to do.
00:01:56 You can't tell, but I am dabbing.
00:02:01 I don't think that, I think it's against Starfleet regulation.
00:02:04 That's absolute.
00:02:06 We have the Energetic Scrapper, Ben St.
00:02:09 What?
00:02:10 Oh god, he's lucid.
00:02:11 You'll pull something together eventually, I'm sure.
00:02:16 What?
00:02:17 And we have the Desert Overlord himself, Munchy with Tiny Hats.
00:02:25 Listen, the channel isn't growing, PC pinny socks are on the low, they're down 6% since
00:02:30 we started this episode, everyone's going fucking crazy, they're all in a panic.
00:02:34 And I know what we have to do, we have to do a major rebranding project and we're going
00:02:38 to change ourselves from the ProCrastiners podcast to the Pimplecrushing podcast.
00:02:43 Listen, my mom signs into my YouTube account on fucking daily and watches Dr. PimplePopperMD,
00:02:52 some fucking Zitcrushing videos.
00:02:54 And I think if we can tap into that niche mom market who just love to see pus fly every
00:03:00 which way, then we can jack our subscriber number up and rake in that fucking superchats
00:03:05 as we do live Shekels for Heckles, except we've rebranded it, so now we pop each other's
00:03:10 pimples.
00:03:11 And I've got like 6 episodes worth right fucking here for you, so let's just get on with that.
00:03:16 Imagine our new idea, the PCP, the only YouTube channel by moms for moms, I think that's the
00:03:23 direction we need to head.
00:03:25 Munchy, would Shekels for Heckles be rebranded Pimpin' for Pimples?
00:03:29 Oh fuck, this shit rites itself, dude.
00:03:35 This pimple popping phenomenon, it's kind of like a, I wouldn't even call it, it's like
00:03:40 ASMR adjacent, it's like parallel in the sense that it's not like ASMR that like relaxes
00:03:46 you through like voices or whatever, but it similarly relaxes like Michelle, like Michelle
00:03:52 is into it and loves pimple popping videos, it makes me want to throw up.
00:03:57 Mom, can you have your own account?
00:04:00 Stop using my account, it's in my recommended videos, mom.
00:04:03 Do you guys not, do you guys not at least on some level understand the pathos, like
00:04:09 I get it, I do get it, not the pathos, what's the word for it, not the shot in Florida?
00:04:14 It's like getting the long piece in a Tetris thing, it's like you know, it's like setting
00:04:19 up a Tetris thing and then having like an L block or something at the perfect right moment
00:04:23 to get the Tetris.
00:04:24 Yeah, yeah, the catharsis of the pop, like I get it.
00:04:29 I understand it, but like, okay.
00:04:31 Forget about the pops.
00:04:32 They take it to like the extreme, well there's like, okay, there's videos that are like more
00:04:36 like more like deep level surgery, like where they slice up on the back of like a dude's
00:04:41 head.
00:04:42 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, not into those, not into those one bit.
00:04:49 The pimple popping videos, that's baby shit, I could do that, well I could do that if I
00:04:54 ever had a pimple in my life, but unfortunately I was cursed with perfect complexion.
00:05:00 But you know, anyone, anyone who's greasy and disgusting enough, I'm actually in diamond
00:05:06 form, it's an Emma Frost thing, it's actually, yeah, it's my second mutation, but you know
00:05:12 most people can pop pimples, but what I just want to see someone go into the doctor with
00:05:18 some fat abscess like hanging off their neck and someone's got a poke at it with a scalpel
00:05:23 and like they got to like take a syringe and like draw the shit out at first and they
00:05:28 just like, they like make an incision and it just like explodes like a volcano, that's
00:05:35 not a volcano that's erupting, a volcano that is like boiling over with like the hot chunky
00:05:40 fucking lava spilling out over the side, so, it feels like victory for me, I'm feeling
00:05:47 it like vicariously, that victory through that person, getting rid of that monstrous
00:05:52 abscess.
00:05:53 Guys, since we started talking about the rebranding, our picture is up $500, we have to keep going.
00:05:58 Oh no, we gotta keep going, we gotta keep going.
00:06:02 The thing about the cyst is that they don't even give good catharsis because like, they
00:06:07 cut open the skin, they go in with like you know a spade or a shovel or a trowel or something
00:06:14 and they like scoop the abscess out, but that's not the end because what then must happen
00:06:21 is they have to go in with tiny little scrapers and scissors and cut out like sort of the
00:06:28 sort of sac or skin or membrane that contained the cyst and that part is one, a bit gruesome
00:06:34 and two, it's just boring, so it's like the emotional arc of a cyst video is just, it
00:06:42 sort of slowly peaks early and then trails off to nothing and then stays down really
00:06:47 low until the very end, the cutting out of the sac is extremely unsatisfying.
00:06:51 I haven't had the pleasure of watching this on a live human, but I have had the pleasure
00:06:56 of watching it on a digital acclamation, like a 3D animation on YouTube of a transformation
00:07:06 from a penile to a vagin, and the process of going trans, it's like going ghost but
00:07:14 going trans, is the most like brutal thing that I can ever do.
00:07:21 I watched Ranma one half, sure, it's so terrible, it really just freaks me out.
00:07:29 Remember when Ranma would say, I'm going trans whenever water, time or that.
00:07:34 I like to think of the human body as like, I know this is wrong, but it's like good,
00:07:42 it's like good.
00:07:43 Oh, it's so wrong, it's fine, it's fine, but then with this pimple popping shit and general
00:07:49 all surgery and stuff, it's like, oh my god, just the human epidermis is so fucked up and
00:07:55 so disgusting and filled with pores and like, what even is a zit, what even is a zit and
00:08:02 how does it get so fucking big?
00:08:04 That was always my answer, when I was a kid, that was always my question to the adults
00:08:10 who tried to tell me that God exists and that we were created in God's image and even as
00:08:16 a child I was like, have you seen people, like we get like fucking like zits and like I've
00:08:24 had like ingrown toenails before, like what the fuck is that, you have to go to the doctor
00:08:28 and they have to like slice open your toe to fix it.
00:08:31 Because you just grew wrong by accident, sometimes like one day you wake up and like you're like
00:08:36 25 which is supposed to be like your prime, that's the sequel to grow up and grow home
00:08:39 is grow wrong, yeah, grow wrong, like you just wake up one day and like all of your bones
00:08:44 are just dust now and they don't feel good ever again once you're like 20, yeah, or I
00:08:50 mean they're just cancer in general, just like just grow right, stop growing wrong cells,
00:08:55 what the fuck, what even tell triggers them to grow wrong, I don't know, I have no idea,
00:09:00 I will, I will, I will, I will put too much of that dank weed man, I'll, I'll posit a
00:09:04 new theory though, I know what causes cancer, it's all that aspartame I'm drinking, Conrad
00:09:10 Collins aka Digi Bro, I can't wait for you to never hear this but if you did you'd freak
00:09:14 out because every time I say that it pisses you off and I find it hilarious, well you
00:09:17 know that's, you know that's the leading cause of aspartism, yeah, yeah, that's, why do you
00:09:23 think Digi drinks Diasoda all the time now, I mean I applaud him, I applaud him, it's better
00:09:28 than sugar in my totally uneducated opinion, I mean pick a poison, do you want to become
00:09:33 retarded or do you want to die of cancer, these are your two choices, it's, it's, it's
00:09:37 do you want to die of cancer or do you want to become fat, you either die of cancer or
00:09:42 live long enough to see yourself become the retard, hey, hang on, doesn't being fat cause
00:09:47 cancer, doesn't obesity lead to cancer as well, I think everything leads to cancer, it can,
00:09:52 it can, it even worse, it leads to death, right, true, sometimes by that mechanism,
00:09:58 that's a weird thing, I want to, I'm going to draw a Garfield comic where, where John
00:10:04 just leans in like Garfield's like in his little box bed and John leans in and says,
00:10:08 you know obesity can cause cancer Garfield and Garfield just looks like at the viewer
00:10:14 and is like Mondays, there's John, John leans in and whispers in Garfield's ear, you know,
00:10:24 even with seat belts on, people die in car crashes all the time, I just thought that
00:10:28 was interesting, there's a John, you know Garfield, you can have an aneurysm at any
00:10:34 time in your life, no matter how healthy you are, it can just happen and you'll die, there's
00:10:40 a giant, giant sign at my Starbucks and this is, this is not like a, like my local Starbucks,
00:10:46 this is just like every Starbucks in the area in California, there is like a, a piece of
00:10:51 legislator in, in the California law code, they have a piece of the local legislator
00:10:56 hanging, they have a local legislator's ear that they sliced off, they're holding it
00:10:59 ransom if they don't enforce coffee policies, it's, it's just this like copy and pasted
00:11:05 on like every restaurant they could think to go to, like every piece of fast food or
00:11:08 just normal sit down restaurant, it's all this little plaque near the door that just
00:11:12 says, this like, like food distributed here has been known to cause cancer by the state
00:11:17 of California, like have a nice day, so you can't eat anywhere, like seriously it's ranging
00:11:24 from Starbucks to like fucking Whole Foods to anywhere, you go and then it's just like,
00:11:29 oh this causes cancer by the way, I'm like, well I want a fucking green tea for appuccino,
00:11:34 so you know what, I'm getting cancer and I'm gonna love it, yeah.
00:11:38 I mean the odds are everyone in our generation is gonna die of cancer, we're just exposed
00:11:43 to so much carcinogens at this point.
00:11:45 Maybe the solution to cancer is mandatory death sentences at 35, so that you just don't
00:11:50 get old enough to.
00:11:51 That would definitely motivate me to start working even harder.
00:11:53 Yeah, right, there was a start to the episode about that, you get executed by the people
00:11:57 when you're like 65, cause they don't want to deal with old people, cause they're a
00:12:00 drag on society and I'm just saying it makes a lot of sense.
00:12:04 It's true.
00:12:05 My theory is that cancer was actually created in God's image and it was meant to be our
00:12:10 natural predator and we're not supposed to be here and cancer is the flood that's gonna
00:12:16 take us out.
00:12:18 Yeah, God I hope so.
00:12:20 I have a, speaking of obesity, speaking of obesity, speaking of obesity, I have a boring
00:12:27 announcement to make, are you excited, are you excited, gents?
00:12:33 I hope you have obesity, I hope you have obesity, I got the test results back, I'm positive
00:12:39 for obesity.
00:12:40 Woo!
00:12:41 Yeah.
00:12:42 No, I hit my record low weight the other day, I was 167.5, I couldn't believe it.
00:12:49 And all you had to do was chop off his head, the least useful part and then I lost.
00:12:54 Anyway, pretty stoked about that, I went, you're gonna say 175?
00:12:57 No, 167.5.
00:12:58 Oh, that's pretty damn low.
00:13:02 Pretty low, pretty low, still it's weird, everyone tells me, everyone tells me like
00:13:06 Ben, you don't look overweight at all, like you can stop that, and I'm like, well according
00:13:12 to BMI, I'm still like two or three pounds over the line to overweight, so I'm just gonna
00:13:17 keep going, thanks.
00:13:18 Right, I agree completely.
00:13:19 Well, muscle mass affects that as well.
00:13:20 Yeah, yeah, which I'm probably lacking in.
00:13:22 Anyone who tells you you're not fat wants you to be fatter than them, that's the truth.
00:13:26 Yeah, that's right.
00:13:27 Yeah, I agree.
00:13:28 A hundred percent agreed.
00:13:29 Definitely, definitely do not trust anyone who says anything nice about me, they definitely
00:13:35 have an angle, there's no question.
00:13:37 I have a very similar thing to say, this is my main thing I wanted to bring up, I've
00:13:40 instituted a policy, so I'm going to Hawaii for Christmas for Michelle's family and just
00:13:47 to be in the best place in the world again, I highly recommend it, and so I'm instituting
00:13:52 a policy because I hate how my fucking love handles are disgusting and fat and I want
00:13:58 them dead, so I've instituted a policy that I'll be doing in perpetuity at least until
00:14:03 I go there in like a month and a half, and I'm beginning another one of my famous wacky
00:14:07 acronyms, it's Redouet, Redouet, R-E-D-U-I-H, run every day until I'm hot, that's my plan,
00:14:15 I'm starting it today, and I'm not going to stop until I'm hot as hell, and that's it.
00:14:21 Literally, try keto, that's my recommendation, also, just incidentally, I went four days
00:14:27 without eating this week, almost by accident.
00:14:31 Like, ever since that fast, you don't need it anymore.
00:14:34 I, okay, it was on the day of the stream, you've been de-shackled from the ties of human
00:14:38 consumption.
00:14:39 On the day that we streamed, on Wednesday, on, you know, on Roddy Fricker's cop killers
00:14:43 on Twitch, I woke up kind of early, didn't eat, you know, I don't usually get hungry
00:14:48 in the mornings.
00:14:49 Well, like, I just, don't you love that fuck is censored, but cop killer is just fine.
00:14:53 Yeah, cop killing cops is fine, but the F word is not cool, it is not cool, guys.
00:14:57 Well, we gotta bash the fash, but let's go on.
00:15:00 Fash the fash.
00:15:01 Fucking left, left wingers on Twitch, ah, fucking millennials.
00:15:06 They, they, so yeah, so that day, you know, we woke up, stayed up for a while, you know,
00:15:11 stream happened, did that, it was night time, I just never got hungry, went to, didn't get
00:15:15 hungry at night time, went to sleep late, I'm not hungry, so I won't eat, woke up the
00:15:18 next day, the trend continued, by day four, I was just like, I might as well keep going.
00:15:23 But then, I, then I told someone, some people were like, just die, people were like, why
00:15:27 are you, why are you fat?
00:15:28 Like, there's no health, there's no real health benefits of going that long, like the benefits
00:15:32 of fasting don't continue for days and days, and I was like, yeah, fuck it, four days is
00:15:37 fine, I don't need to make a thing out of this, so I just ate some shit, I just ate some nuts
00:15:41 and cheese and whatever.
00:15:42 I mean, imagine, just, just for a second, Ben, and everybody, imagine if your hunger
00:15:47 mechanism stopped working correctly, and you just didn't get hungry, maybe through, that's
00:15:52 what was happening, I did not get hungry at all until day four.
00:15:55 But there you go, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're actually getting the right or
00:15:59 best nutrition, just because one doesn't experience it.
00:16:02 No, no, not necessarily.
00:16:04 Okay.
00:16:05 Like two, I was thinking I would just go another week at that point, because I was like more
00:16:09 than halfway there, but then I was like, well, it's, it would, like there's no actual point,
00:16:14 it would just be a numbers thing, it would just be an arbitrary, like, hit that number
00:16:17 goalpost, so whatever.
00:16:19 And you know, you know, to Ewan and Munchie's point as well, I am aware that like, running
00:16:25 every day is not enough to just be, to get skinny.
00:16:28 You die at that point.
00:16:29 My point, what did I say?
00:16:30 It's an important thing.
00:16:31 Oh, you know, maybe you might have just been, Ben, I'd just say, just go keto, which is
00:16:34 the perfect point.
00:16:35 All I said was try keto.
00:16:36 Okay, okay.
00:16:37 Well, fair enough, I should do that, and I intend to, but this is, it's so much easier
00:16:43 for me to institute, I've noticed this about myself in a huge way, I need binary switches,
00:16:50 on off choices, that if I do that, I can get things done.
00:16:53 And if I don't, I fuck it up every time.
00:16:55 You mean like, you mean like you have to go all or nothing?
00:16:58 Yes.
00:16:59 To have flipped the switch of I will now run every day is almost easy to do.
00:17:04 It's easy to do that.
00:17:05 It's easier than being like, I'll run three days of the week, any three days that I want
00:17:09 to.
00:17:10 Way easier, way easier than that.
00:17:11 I get that.
00:17:12 You have less wiggle than to fuck up.
00:17:13 Decide.
00:17:14 The wiggle room is how I find excuses to fuck up.
00:17:17 Exactly.
00:17:18 If I gave myself, if I gave myself, look, you know, one day a week, I can eat, you know,
00:17:22 one carb thing or something, then like that one thing would hang over me all the time.
00:17:28 And I would constantly be debating like, should this be the thing?
00:17:31 Should this be the thing?
00:17:32 Maybe I'll eat this and then I, you know, but if it's like, no, none, then it's not,
00:17:35 it's not hard because like, I'm just like, oh, I see, oh, that's, that pizza, I just
00:17:39 can't eat it.
00:17:40 Well, like it's out of, it's out of the question for me to eat that.
00:17:43 The idea of fixing my diet has long plagued me, because it's a far more complicated overall
00:17:49 thing than to be one easy switch.
00:17:51 I know I need to fix that.
00:17:52 I'll work on it.
00:17:53 Diets are so hard, there's so much conflicting information.
00:17:56 I get, I get, yeah, it's like, you can, you can read two different books on the subject
00:18:00 and come away with completely different answers to what is a healthy diet.
00:18:05 It's interesting we're talking about diet, because that was what I was going to bring
00:18:07 the table and say that I'm sorry, Ben, but I'm abandoning, I think I'm going to abandon
00:18:12 keto.
00:18:13 I think I'm pivoting into paleo.
00:18:16 I think I'm, I'm continuing my bio-happiness family.
00:18:18 I love paleo.
00:18:19 I don't even do anything.
00:18:20 Paleo is just about feeling better than other people.
00:18:23 Is that so?
00:18:24 But, but, but before we move on completely.
00:18:27 All diets about that though, really?
00:18:28 The best diet.
00:18:29 I mean, I like paleo in the sense that it discourages bulk grains, which I don't believe
00:18:33 in.
00:18:34 Absolutely.
00:18:35 I don't know if this will sound cruel or not, Nate, but I don't mean in such a way.
00:18:39 But I kind of forgot that you were like, yeah, you're like the fitness guy, I guess.
00:18:42 I forgot about that for a while.
00:18:44 That's fine.
00:18:45 For a while, that was like your characteristic is that you were the fit person who, you know,
00:18:50 did anime reviews, I guess, but I kind of forgot about the fitness part until just now.
00:18:55 Well, that's perfectly acceptable.
00:18:57 And I mean, I think what that really speaks to is not really that I've gotten much worse,
00:19:02 because I'm actually on an upswing currently.
00:19:04 But it's a, it's that everyone else is up to their game.
00:19:07 So I stand out less by comparison.
00:19:08 And while that's unfortunate for me, it is good overall.
00:19:11 Yeah.
00:19:12 But I'm switching.
00:19:14 I like Keto a lot.
00:19:15 I lost a ton of weight.
00:19:16 I'm down, I think 15 or 16 pounds in like five weeks, which is pretty good.
00:19:20 So why would you stop then?
00:19:22 Okay.
00:19:23 Because I feel sick constantly.
00:19:25 That makes sense.
00:19:26 Ever since I've started Keto, my stomach has felt an agony.
00:19:29 I've had like heart palpitations all the time.
00:19:31 Don't really want that anymore.
00:19:32 Well, that's just life, man.
00:19:33 Listen, Tom, listen, Tom, you're 30 now and that's, and happy birthday, by the way.
00:19:39 That's just, that's just the rest of your life.
00:19:42 I tried Keto for a while and it hasn't really worked for me, but I think it might be due
00:19:48 to the fact that I don't have a gallbladder.
00:19:51 So I can't really process the fat too well.
00:19:54 I read that, like, you know, you can't do Keto.
00:19:56 I don't know what gallbladder does.
00:19:57 I don't think so.
00:19:58 Well, and it produces the thing, it produces the thing that helps you digest fat, I think,
00:20:03 or something like that.
00:20:04 I don't know.
00:20:05 I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a biologist, but I read that you can do Keto without a
00:20:10 gallbladder, but it's kind of different.
00:20:12 I don't, I don't see why you wouldn't, although I guess you'd probably have to ask a doctor.
00:20:16 My understanding was that the gallbladder was, was a thing that helps to digest, like,
00:20:20 fibrous stuff and plant matter better, that is harder to digest in the body.
00:20:24 I, I could be wrong.
00:20:25 Wait, are you thinking of the appendix?
00:20:27 Oh, I'm thinking of the appendix, yep.
00:20:29 My bad, my bad.
00:20:30 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:31 Okay, okay.
00:20:32 The appendix is like, someone, I read that, like, the, what the appendix was for is back
00:20:37 in caveman times, when you would have a pile of berry, like loose berries on the ground
00:20:42 and you would scoop them up along with like dirt and rocks, and you would eat it all at
00:20:46 once.
00:20:47 Your appendix would secrete some kind of substance that would coat the rocks that you ate along
00:20:51 with these precious berries with some kind of goo that would prevent them from tearing
00:20:55 open your anus on the way out.
00:20:57 Or something.
00:20:58 It's funny, it's funny.
00:20:59 Yeah, but we don't need it anymore because we don't eat rocks anymore or something.
00:21:03 The last, like, 30 seconds, the call just cut out and started like nothing but gibberish
00:21:07 and then immediately cuts in and it's, and then you say anus on the way out, just anus.
00:21:11 I don't know what I missed.
00:21:13 Out of context, out of context.
00:21:14 Yeah, yeah.
00:21:15 This is like, silence, silence, signus, tear your anus open on the way out.
00:21:19 Yeah.
00:21:20 I was like, okay.
00:21:21 Yeah, this is a horrible nightmare.
00:21:23 If it sounds like we're interrupting each other, it's because everyone's speeding up
00:21:28 and slowing down and cutting out randomly at an unheard of time.
00:21:31 I am also getting that, yeah, it sucks.
00:21:33 Clean.
00:21:34 Hey.
00:21:35 If anyone's got a...
00:21:37 Wait, wait.
00:21:38 Nobody heard my Garfield-ism that I threw out there in the middle of that cacophony.
00:21:43 I said, the best diet is depression.
00:21:47 And then fucking Garfield stands up from his bed box and he's emaciated as fuck.
00:21:52 And then he looks forward at the viewer and says, Mondays.
00:21:59 That's how they all end.
00:22:00 They all end the same way.
00:22:01 So, Jesse, are you just going to make better Garfield comics now?
00:22:06 Is that like your new role?
00:22:08 Because you've already had like three good strip ideas just in the last 20 minutes.
00:22:12 Yeah.
00:22:13 Well, I'm imagining like they end on sort of a Ren and Stimpy-esque hyper-detailed
00:22:16 close-up of his face saying Mondays.
00:22:19 This is good.
00:22:20 I don't know.
00:22:21 Well, I just realized that I am Garfield and that's literally who I...
00:22:25 I mean, aren't we all Garfield on some level?
00:22:29 That's his appeal.
00:22:30 He speaks to all of us in a way.
00:22:32 Yeah.
00:22:33 All of our worst instincts.
00:22:34 We're all just trapped on the window of a moving car down the fucking highway to hell.
00:22:43 And it's Monday.
00:22:44 And it's Monday.
00:22:45 Fuck.
00:22:46 We're all trapped in these bodies that will eventually decay and die and get fat first.
00:22:51 What is that noise?
00:22:53 Whose fucking dog is janglin'?
00:22:55 Yeah, what's a jingle jangle?
00:22:57 Sorry, it's Odie again.
00:22:58 I'll just get him off the fucking table.
00:23:01 It could be my cat's bell.
00:23:04 I'm sorry.
00:23:05 He's hungry and I cannot go and feed him at the moment, so he's going to be a nuisance.
00:23:09 Oh, when he's hungry, he's just going to bring a bell.
00:23:11 Cats hunt for themselves.
00:23:12 No, he has a bell on his neck.
00:23:14 Oh, okay.
00:23:15 On the collar.
00:23:16 Is it like a choker?
00:23:17 Like an emo choker?
00:23:18 No.
00:23:19 He's got a thought collar.
00:23:20 Yeah.
00:23:21 You know, this has bothered me for years.
00:23:28 And I've never said it out loud, but I'm finally going to own up to it.
00:23:35 This might make me unpopular to posit this controversial thought.
00:23:41 It bothers me that Odie's retarded.
00:23:43 Well, here, I mean, the thing about that is all your people are being poorly represented.
00:23:49 No.
00:23:50 Oh, got him.
00:23:51 And this is me talking, not Garfield, even though I'm sure Garfield feels similarly.
00:23:56 Because there's other dogs in the Garfield universe and they're not stupid.
00:24:01 So why is Odie stupid?
00:24:03 I was going to say, is he retarded or does he just have different priorities than Garfield?
00:24:09 He's almost always depicted as extremely retarded, though not always.
00:24:12 He's a mute.
00:24:13 Like all the other animals at least can communicate with each other.
00:24:16 But Odie's just like-
00:24:17 My favorite piece of Garfield lore is that Odie is not John's dog.
00:24:23 He is Lyman's dog.
00:24:24 Oh, yeah.
00:24:25 Who's Lyman?
00:24:26 Lyman?
00:24:27 Okay.
00:24:28 It's like in like pretty early on in the comic, John's friend Lyman moves in with them for
00:24:33 a while and he is this mustached dude and he brings Odie with him and he just is there
00:24:38 for a while and then he eventually like goes off to join the Coast Guard of the Navy or
00:24:43 something and no one ever hears from him again, but he just leaves Odie and now Odie
00:24:48 lives with him.
00:24:49 But no.
00:24:50 Odie is Lyman's dog.
00:24:51 Look up Lyman.
00:24:52 You know, John coveted that dog so much.
00:24:55 He's so coveted, a companion for Garfield that one night he snuck into Lyman's room
00:25:03 while he was sleeping.
00:25:04 Yeah, yeah.
00:25:05 And like stabbed him to death and buried him under the floorboards and said, oh yeah,
00:25:09 he just, he went off to join the Navy.
00:25:11 Yeah.
00:25:12 Someone comes to ask about it and he's like, oh no, this is my dog.
00:25:16 I've had this dog forever.
00:25:17 This is my dog.
00:25:18 Yeah.
00:25:19 He's all-
00:25:20 Oh, yeah.
00:25:21 Odie's like, where's Lyman's John?
00:25:22 You know, you can see it in his eyes.
00:25:24 And like, you know, where am I going back home?
00:25:27 And John just looks at the camera and says, you've always been here, Odie, you've always
00:25:31 been here.
00:25:32 And then da-da-da-da.
00:25:33 Zoom in on a fly.
00:25:34 And then slow zoom in on John's face.
00:25:38 Slow zoom in on John's face.
00:25:40 You've always been here, Garfield, music sting.
00:25:42 Slow zoom in on Garfield, Mondays.
00:25:48 And so-
00:25:49 Cut to black.
00:25:50 Roll credits.
00:25:51 Better to make sure that Odie doesn't rat about what John did to Lyman.
00:25:56 John gives Odie a lobotomy, and that's why Odie became-
00:25:59 Oh my God, it's so stupid.
00:26:01 Yeah.
00:26:02 So the dog doesn't rat him out.
00:26:05 Yeah, you know, really, John was the one who was truly Odeous.
00:26:09 Oh.
00:26:10 Welcome, full circle.
00:26:11 Welcome, full circle.
00:26:12 Oh, and also he baked Lyman into a lasagna and he fed it to Garfield.
00:26:18 That's also a thing.
00:26:19 Oh, sure.
00:26:20 Hey, hey, you would get so many lasagnas out of the meat of an entire person.
00:26:28 That's all I'm saying.
00:26:29 That's true.
00:26:30 There's very little meat in the lasagna to begin with.
00:26:31 You would have to be- you'd have to be some meaty lasagnas, they're just going to take
00:26:34 you along.
00:26:35 You're going to have Lyman in the freezer for quite some time.
00:26:37 I think Garfield found like a finger bone or a toe, like halfway through the lasagna
00:26:42 and realized, but he just loves lasagnas so much and he just-
00:26:45 Yeah.
00:26:46 He already had that taste.
00:26:47 He's shoveling it in.
00:26:48 No, he loves lasagna.
00:26:49 He's like this, right?
00:26:50 John knew that Garfield loves lasagnas so much that he would find the finger, eat it
00:26:54 anyway, and then be so consumed by guilt that he would now feel complicit in the murder.
00:26:59 So he would never say anything.
00:27:00 Oh my God, John.
00:27:02 Makes sense.
00:27:03 He's smart.
00:27:04 If there's one thing I miss from being a brony, it's all of the shit, terrible, gore, creepy
00:27:11 posse to fan fiction that you could read, and there was just a whole library full.
00:27:16 There was just a whole fucking boatload.
00:27:19 There was a library of Alexander worth of pure knowledge that you could just unearth at any
00:27:24 moment.
00:27:25 Take you back to the rainbow factory, duckball.
00:27:26 Exactly.
00:27:27 Take me back to fucking Party of One, take me back to that shit.
00:27:31 Yeah, Party of One.
00:27:32 No, Party of None.
00:27:33 Sorry, Party of None.
00:27:34 Right, right.
00:27:35 So there's even less than one now.
00:27:37 At the end of the day, that was pretty much the thing about My Little Pony was just how
00:27:40 active and just how prolific the fan base was.
00:27:43 In fact, I would say, tell me if you agree with this, Munchie, that pound for pound,
00:27:49 per capita, the only fandom that is as prolific as My Little Pony might just be Endless War.
00:27:57 Well, okay, okay, we have to adjust for inflation and for how long they've been alive.
00:28:06 I would say you've got, okay, I'm talking per capita, like, like in terms of, in terms
00:28:13 of like, works, work, like fan work per person per second.
00:28:19 You know what?
00:28:20 Okay, I would agree with you.
00:28:21 The only rival there, and I think the true successor is Furries, though I feel legitimately
00:28:26 that Furries is Jean, because it's so decentralized.
00:28:30 It's not really a fandom of anything.
00:28:33 It's not like a, you're not a fan of anything, if you're afraid.
00:28:37 You're just a fan of being a freak, I guess.
00:28:40 That's your one calling, that's what you want to do.
00:28:42 The Furries thing is too much.
00:28:44 I'm calling for it to be over immediately, cease and desist.
00:28:48 I'm done with Furries.
00:28:49 I don't know, man.
00:28:50 That's got momentum.
00:28:52 That's got some like cultural momentum behind it.
00:28:55 The fact that it's like become a community and a subset of people, like a category of
00:28:59 human, upsets me.
00:29:03 Jew, Gentile, Furries.
00:29:04 Because now you can't joke anymore about like a cartoon animal character being attractive,
00:29:12 or else you're a furry.
00:29:13 Like it used to be, everybody made those jokes.
00:29:16 Everybody was fucking, oh yeah, fucking Lola in Space Jam is hot as fuck.
00:29:21 Everybody used to be into that.
00:29:22 Everyone believed it, but now everyone's afraid to admit it, because as soon as you say that
00:29:27 maybe Lola is fucking a hottie, well then, it opens the floodgates with the Furries come
00:29:34 out and they go, you're one of us now.
00:29:36 You're one of us.
00:29:37 And they fucking, they slap that big giant head on your head, and they push you down
00:29:43 a corridor, and they keep like adding parts of the furry costume as you're walking down
00:29:47 this corridor with no other way out, and they're whipping you with chains, and they're hurling
00:29:52 insults and throwing rocks at you.
00:29:54 Oh dude.
00:29:55 It's a gauntlet.
00:29:56 And it makes you one of them.
00:29:57 And it makes you one of them.
00:29:58 Remember the one where that like Marine is getting strapped into like his power armor
00:30:02 suit in preparation for Starcraft?
00:30:04 It's like that with a fur suit, and then it comes out, hell, it's about damn time.
00:30:08 Yeah, it's like a prune.
00:30:10 I want to go to Furry Convention just to see what it's like.
00:30:14 I want to know what it's like on average races, and you know what will happen?
00:30:18 I'll go there, I'll get all suited, I'll get all tatted up.
00:30:23 Oh, brief segment, I'm actually writing a 400 page fan fiction.
00:30:28 It's been an AU slash sequel to the How to Train Your Dragon series, and it's just exactly
00:30:35 the same.
00:30:36 It's like dragons are actually metaphor for tattoos, and it stars Hiccup who's been
00:30:40 renamed to Tatlis at the beginning of the movie, and he has to overcome the sphere by
00:30:45 Baguina tattoo.
00:30:46 Anyway.
00:30:47 That was the most zoomer sentence anyone's ever spoken.
00:30:51 You know what?
00:30:52 Anyway, enough of that.
00:30:53 That was all in parentheses just then.
00:30:55 I just figured out some men would hang out.
00:30:57 It's going to be the same as any other convention, it's just going to be like people just hanging
00:31:01 out, kind of being bored, being like, oh, what panel do you want to go to?
00:31:05 Nothing, I just kind of want to hang out, and then the other person's like, yeah, okay.
00:31:08 Furries, I don't think you're going to be that weird in person.
00:31:11 I want to go anyway, I want to see what it's like.
00:31:14 Only after, only behind closed doors.
00:31:17 Just now, while you were talking, I figured out the metric, the test of whether or not
00:31:22 someone is a furry.
00:31:25 So they made a Looney Tunes show a couple years ago.
00:31:30 It was like a sitcom update of the Looney Tunes.
00:31:33 Oh, god, yeah.
00:31:34 This is exciting.
00:31:35 Clines and Daffy are like-
00:31:36 No, what was it called?
00:31:37 I don't remember the name, but I know the one.
00:31:42 But Lola Bunny was in that show, but they had updated her to be more contemporary and
00:31:47 more fitting with today's feelings on what a cartoon sexy bunny should be.
00:31:54 So they made her less overtly sexualized and less busty and buxom.
00:32:02 Lola Bunny in Space Jam is a dystopian nightmare.
00:32:07 She's the pinnacle.
00:32:08 You can say she's a nightmare, but she's definitely sexualized.
00:32:10 Well, not herself.
00:32:11 I don't understand.
00:32:12 But the way that she is just this sexualized token female who is defined by being better
00:32:22 at everything than all men, and all men are immediately get heart eyes and swoon and fall
00:32:27 over at their boners because she is present.
00:32:30 It's regressive, but it does have merit because she is hot.
00:32:34 Sure.
00:32:35 So here's-
00:32:36 So granted.
00:32:37 So in this new contemporary Looney Tunes show, they toned down her sexuality.
00:32:43 They toned down how hot she is, but they made her more of a character with a zany personality
00:32:48 to match bugs and daffy and stuff.
00:32:51 So I think the test of whether you're a furry is if you're attracted to Space Jam Lola,
00:32:56 you're not a furry.
00:32:57 But if you're attracted to the new Lola for her personality, you're definitely a furry.
00:33:03 Wasn't New Lola, in that version, wasn't she like a sort of neurotic, obsessive stalker
00:33:09 girlfriend or something?
00:33:11 Yeah, I think so, yeah.
00:33:13 Okay, gross.
00:33:14 She was like the attached girlfriend meme.
00:33:17 So I guess I'm definitely not a furry.
00:33:19 Okay, cool.
00:33:20 Yeah, I don't know if this is allowed to be shown, if we can link this safely in the
00:33:24 show notes, but I really want this T-shirt.
00:33:27 It caps me walking down the street with this fucking T-shirt on.
00:33:32 This is awesome.
00:33:33 She's crying.
00:33:34 It's so huge, and it's the entire body is taken up with that image.
00:33:42 Why is it on a T-shirt?
00:33:43 It's just so inappropriate.
00:33:44 Munchy, you need to buy this shirt and wear it to the furry convention you go to.
00:33:48 Oh my god, yeah!
00:33:50 I want to wear it.
00:33:51 I mean, there's nothing technically showing.
00:33:53 I think her cheeks are covering up.
00:33:55 Is that not her little bunny pussy showing?
00:33:58 No, she's wearing it.
00:33:59 I don't want to zoom it in to find out.
00:34:01 Well panties are clinging to it in a way that tech...
00:34:04 You know, it's a little hard to say honestly.
00:34:06 The geometry is questionable.
00:34:08 I'm going to post a link to anyone who wants to buy this below.
00:34:11 I'm going to buy it.
00:34:12 I'm going to use our Amazon affiliate link to buy this T-shirt of Bugs Bunny Spanking
00:34:17 Lola.
00:34:18 Woo!
00:34:19 That's utterly expressed.
00:34:22 I guess to those who haven't clicked it, it's Bugs Spanking Lola sexually over his
00:34:26 knee.
00:34:27 I just said that on a T-shirt.
00:34:28 On a T-shirt.
00:34:29 That's a T-shirt that I would wear in a music video while having post Malone tattoos on
00:34:34 my face.
00:34:35 That's right.
00:34:36 Oh dude, there's another variant.
00:34:39 You'll see if you click that link where her ass is more red.
00:34:42 Like she's gotten more wax.
00:34:43 Oh, it's the sequel.
00:34:44 Yeah, it's the sequel.
00:34:45 It's like five different ones for each weekday.
00:34:50 It kills the question, we do a proper progression through the week.
00:34:53 You start with the first one of her just standing next to him, then the second one of her bent
00:34:57 over.
00:34:58 You pull down the panties, then getting redder and redder.
00:35:01 Progressively redder.
00:35:02 At some point, tears form under her eyes and it starts to be less hot, but it keeps going.
00:35:08 And then in the last one, she looks at the viewer and says, Mondays.
00:35:14 I'm like, where's the tat shop and get tatted up and they're going to be like, what kind
00:35:23 of tattoo do you want?
00:35:24 I'm just going to put on my sunglasses and not respond to them.
00:35:28 And just wait for me to wake up from my cocaine and do stupor and just wake up and then find
00:35:35 out how many tats I've got with this sick ass shirt because I guarantee they're going
00:35:38 to give me like five for free because they're so aroused.
00:35:41 I'm sure that's true.
00:35:44 Speaking of fandom in general, I just wanted to say that I played DeVoo's game, Autominus.
00:35:50 Oh, I want to stream that.
00:35:52 I want to stream that game myself playing it.
00:35:54 You should.
00:35:55 It would be good.
00:35:56 Yeah.
00:35:57 It'd be pretty good for that.
00:35:58 Yeah.
00:35:59 I just want to say, I honestly loved it and it was great.
00:36:01 So great job, DeVoo.
00:36:03 So here's my endorsement.
00:36:04 Everyone really should play it now that I have played it.
00:36:06 Took me like an hour and a half, maybe, or two hours or something.
00:36:08 I'm pretty intrigued.
00:36:09 I'm pretty intrigued by it.
00:36:10 I feel like I should.
00:36:12 I saw it and I meant to be like, jump on it.
00:36:14 I don't know.
00:36:15 But you know.
00:36:16 Life goes on.
00:36:17 The download link wasn't there when I first went.
00:36:19 But now it is.
00:36:20 So I played it.
00:36:21 I'm about halfway through it right now.
00:36:22 It's great.
00:36:23 I wanted to play it.
00:36:24 It was like, it looked cool and it's like, it's a DeVoo game.
00:36:27 So I'm like, I want to play a game about DeVoo.
00:36:29 He's my friend.
00:36:30 And so I got my stuff set up.
00:36:31 I was going to record it.
00:36:32 I was going to do like a let's play of it.
00:36:34 It's fucking, you know, ruin it for myself.
00:36:37 Like I do everything because you're fucking recording and you don't enjoy it as much.
00:36:40 But I was going to do that and I was fucking, I tried to download it and it wouldn't download
00:36:44 it.
00:36:45 Like set off my antivirus shit and I couldn't figure out how to do it.
00:36:48 Oh, wait.
00:36:49 I got the same thing.
00:36:50 Yeah.
00:36:51 Yeah.
00:36:52 Do you use AVG by any chance?
00:36:54 No, mine was a vast.
00:36:57 A vast antivirus.
00:36:58 Yeah.
00:36:59 I had to.
00:37:00 Yeah.
00:37:01 I remember I got that.
00:37:02 I had to like go into settings and create like a specific exception for like this file
00:37:06 path or something.
00:37:07 I gave up.
00:37:08 Totally.
00:37:09 I went back to bed.
00:37:11 Like my, like it's fucking Mondays, dude.
00:37:14 Yeah.
00:37:15 Like I can do, I can do anything no matter how complex it is as long as you warned me
00:37:19 beforehand.
00:37:20 But like if there's one unexpected step, I'm done.
00:37:24 I'm fucking out.
00:37:25 Like don't make me do one thing more than I thought I would do.
00:37:29 Get it.
00:37:30 I don't want to do it.
00:37:31 I'm going back to bed.
00:37:32 I'm getting back into my fucking anxiety blanket because that one extra step just fucking gave
00:37:37 me a mental breakdown.
00:37:38 Oh, wait.
00:37:39 No, you know what I did?
00:37:40 I just, I just disabled my antivirus.
00:37:42 That's what you got to do.
00:37:43 That's what I tried to do.
00:37:44 You just got to turn that shit off for a minute.
00:37:47 Which Davoo should probably, I don't know if there's a way around that, but like if
00:37:50 we both have that problem, I couldn't even find like where to disable it.
00:37:53 I found a thing that says like put it on passive and like that sounds kind of disabled, but
00:37:57 that didn't work.
00:37:58 It still wouldn't let me play it.
00:37:59 I might be able to, hmm, if I, if I, so it's an EXA, right?
00:38:02 If I put it in a zip file and put it online, you might be able just to download that, which
00:38:07 I wouldn't be for everybody, but like I could easily probably share that with you guys.
00:38:10 That might get you past that first thing and then just unzip it and then it might work.
00:38:15 I do that at work a lot.
00:38:16 Yeah, maybe.
00:38:17 I don't see how that, aren't you just downloading the EXA directly from itch?
00:38:21 Well, I mean, I mean, whatever, they're having a problem getting the EXA, but if they're
00:38:25 just given like a Google Drive link to a zip file that contains an EXA, your antivirus
00:38:30 will miss that and not, uh, generally.
00:38:32 I mean, that's, I do that sometimes.
00:38:34 All right.
00:38:35 You know, okay, but in the furries, back on the subject of furries, I have more to say
00:38:40 on this.
00:38:41 The point of this was, Davoo, I loved the game.
00:38:43 It was great.
00:38:44 I had one huge complaint with the game.
00:38:47 A gigantic problem.
00:38:48 Is it a spoiler?
00:38:49 Should I cover my ears?
00:38:50 This is not a spoiler.
00:38:51 No.
00:38:52 Okay.
00:38:53 In very slight indirect terms, it kind of is, but not really.
00:38:56 It's that, okay.
00:38:57 So the game is great.
00:38:58 Love it.
00:38:59 Get all the way to the end and the thing is, at no point in the game is there any kind
00:39:04 of fail state.
00:39:06 There is a save game mechanism that you can use to save and turn it off.
00:39:09 And this game is, you know, it's like an hour to two hour game.
00:39:12 It's easily done in one sitting.
00:39:13 Okay, so when I'm playing the game, I saved it at the beginning just to like try out saving,
00:39:18 just to like see how it works, already going above and beyond.
00:39:22 But then I didn't, there was no need to save at any point past that end of the game.
00:39:26 At the very end, when you've done everything, there is something like sort of kind of a
00:39:31 final boss type event.
00:39:33 And the thing is, it's the only time in the game where there is a fail state, which brings
00:39:38 you, there's no do-overs.
00:39:40 You just get like kicked back to the main menu after restart from your save file.
00:39:46 But here's the thing, I didn't save the fucking game since my test at the very beginning and
00:39:51 I was not conditioned by the game to be taught that saving was necessary because there was
00:39:56 no failure states.
00:39:57 It should give you like, it should give you like a, it should save.
00:39:59 So I literally lost 100% of my progress playing the game.
00:40:04 It should give you like a, there's no turning back from this point.
00:40:07 Do you want to save?
00:40:08 Something like that would have been good.
00:40:10 Or even if there was just some sort of continue state, like a do-over of that final thing,
00:40:14 that would have been fine as well.
00:40:15 But no, I just got fucked.
00:40:18 And I, like, I want to do it again, but I'm like, Jesus Christ, I really liked it.
00:40:21 But do I immediately want to use another hour to get through the game again?
00:40:25 I don't know.
00:40:26 Yeah.
00:40:27 Probably not.
00:40:28 So I went online and okay, one spar, one spar is the only man in the world who's made
00:40:32 a let's play so far, so I could just watch the final cutscene because I'm already too
00:40:36 good.
00:40:37 I spent more time doing this.
00:40:39 One spar hasn't uploaded the final part of the let's play.
00:40:42 Just do it one spar, release the fucking video.
00:40:45 Who was once known as Wolfspar.
00:40:48 That's right.
00:40:49 That's right.
00:40:50 Okay.
00:40:51 So Jesse, actually I would have really appreciated a let's play.
00:40:54 So I need this let's play to exist so I can see the end and figure it out.
00:40:58 You know, I also, I think, you know what, I think, I think I'm actually going to stream
00:41:01 that tonight because I am streaming tonight as I do on Sundays for the ending on Twitch,
00:41:07 twitch.tv slash stcomics.
00:41:09 Go follow me.
00:41:10 And I will, so by the time you're listening to this, dear viewer, I will have already
00:41:14 streamed it.
00:41:15 It will be on my videos page.
00:41:16 Thank God.
00:41:17 Yeah.
00:41:18 I don't know if this is better or worse than the spanking shirt, but this one is like a
00:41:26 bad fusion of Bugs and Lola.
00:41:32 A fusion, you say.
00:41:33 This is the same one.
00:41:34 No, it's not.
00:41:35 Okay.
00:41:36 It's not showing the one I linked or the one that I clicked on.
00:41:38 Oh, there's like other versions.
00:41:40 Yeah.
00:41:41 There's a bunch of different shirts in there.
00:41:42 One of them is just, wait, well, oh my God, wait, I will figure this.
00:41:48 This is important.
00:41:49 Yeah.
00:41:50 There's a whole, oh my God, this one, that's just her face on like an R&D shirt and her
00:41:57 face blends into it.
00:41:58 It is really weird.
00:41:59 There's a lot of weird ones here.
00:42:01 Oh my God, this like dark purple one with like sort of a pink gradient on it has like
00:42:07 a really badly drawn version of like Bugs giving her a piggyback ride.
00:42:11 Yeah.
00:42:12 Yeah.
00:42:13 Here we go.
00:42:14 I fucking, this is the one I was talking about.
00:42:18 Oh my God.
00:42:20 What the fuck is that?
00:42:22 What the fuck?
00:42:23 That's like more of what that's hot dude to me than the spanking shirt.
00:42:27 Like that is.
00:42:28 I put it on a t-shirt.
00:42:30 Unironically, that is somebody's fetish.
00:42:33 Like I would, no, and not, not a joke.
00:42:36 I would wear the spanking shirt because it's hilarious, but I can't, I can't conceive of
00:42:41 a reason I would wear this weird fusion shirt.
00:42:47 Not even fusion.
00:42:48 Like they're conjoined in this.
00:42:49 They're fucking.
00:42:50 Lola Bunny.
00:42:51 Lola Bunny is a weird anomaly of a character that just like popped up one day in Space Jam.
00:42:58 You know what it was?
00:42:59 It was like the Hollywood bigwigs who were making Space Jam were like, oh, we got to,
00:43:04 we got to get something for the, for the boys to watch.
00:43:06 We got to get a character that would be like what, but we got to make it a cartoon.
00:43:10 Okay.
00:43:11 Just, just make a fucking female Bugs Bunny.
00:43:13 But they didn't know the power they were dealing with.
00:43:15 They didn't know the, the power of the Chaos Emeralds they were toying with, they would
00:43:19 create this incredible sexual nexus of energy that was Lola Bunny that has been twisted
00:43:25 and perfected.
00:43:26 No, they knew.
00:43:28 I, I kind of, it seems like the next is Robin Hood, Robin Hood came first.
00:43:33 Okay.
00:43:34 I thought, I thought it was Nala from Lion King, but I guess that is the perfect way
00:43:38 to describe Lola Bunny, a nexus of sexual energy.
00:43:42 It's true.
00:43:43 It's true.
00:43:44 She's like a blood-borne creature where like when you look at her with zero insight, you're
00:43:48 like, oh yeah.
00:43:49 I mean, okay, cute bunny.
00:43:50 And then like, as you start to look at more furry shit, like you, you start to get more
00:43:54 concerned about what you're actually looking at.
00:43:56 All that raw sexual power coalescing at the center of the universe, like a black hole.
00:44:04 It's like an ultra dense apocalyptic event.
00:44:07 These t-shirts is illegal or something because like, they're just taking fan art and putting
00:44:12 it on.
00:44:13 But what method of curation are they making these?
00:44:16 Are these like, they feel randomly generated.
00:44:18 They don't feel like they're even like, these feel like they were made by anything.
00:44:22 Who's really going to go to court to protect their drawing of bugs?
00:44:26 The same, the same supercomputer that churned out Spider-Man carrying pregnant Elsa to the
00:44:32 hospital in a wheelbarrow is churning these out.
00:44:36 That's true.
00:44:37 I feel like at the, when you, at the end of spore, we were all disappointed, you know,
00:44:41 you build up your universe, you acquired new civilizations, you obtain enlightenment through
00:44:46 whatever means, and then boom, you finally make your way to the center of the universe.
00:44:50 And originally it was just going to be Lola Bunny, the center of all power and commerce
00:44:54 and culture.
00:44:56 But they were like, the people aren't ready for this, the people just aren't ready.
00:44:59 So then you just start over and you continue the quest eternally.
00:45:05 I have a game rant, I have an angry rant about a video game, since you were talking about
00:45:10 another one.
00:45:11 Fucking, so I downloaded the re-release of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on PS4.
00:45:18 Yeah.
00:45:20 And we all know that game.
00:45:21 Oh no, I know where you're going.
00:45:22 Okay, all right, all right.
00:45:23 So everybody knows the dialogue at the beginning of Symphony of the Night.
00:45:29 Die monster, you don't belong in this world.
00:45:33 It was not by my hand, it was who was that fucking did the thing, and you bitch.
00:45:39 Yeah.
00:45:40 Enough talk, have at you.
00:45:44 They fucking changed the dialogue in the re-release, they re-recorded it, they rewrote all of it.
00:45:49 What the fuck?
00:45:50 This idea that the old dialogue is hokey now, or is it good?
00:45:54 Oh, hey, I'll bet the game would be way better if we changed this classic dialogue that everyone
00:45:59 remembers, everyone would appreciate that.
00:46:01 The new dialogue isn't even better, it's just as hokey in its own way, so there was no point
00:46:06 in changing it, it didn't make it better.
00:46:08 What was the new dialogue?
00:46:10 It's totally, I mean it's not memorable at all.
00:46:13 Is the original Miserable Pile of Secrets?
00:46:17 They changed that.
00:46:18 They changed it to be less hokey and trying to make it sound more natural in English,
00:46:23 but it doesn't, it just sounds weird in a different way.
00:46:26 But Symphony of the Night is where what is a man, a Miserable Pile of Secrets comes
00:46:29 from, right?
00:46:30 Yeah, they just made it totally bland, they removed all the soul and all the fucking fun
00:46:36 from it, they sucked all the fun out of it to make it more fucking good, I guess.
00:46:40 This is a total example.
00:46:42 Feels like they would just re-record lines solely to get some voice actors a paycheck,
00:46:47 you know what I mean?
00:46:48 I was just thinking, literally what is the motivation to redo this literally iconic
00:46:55 scene in video games?
00:46:56 I think it might be a friend of the developer or whatever, like a voice actor guy wants
00:47:03 a paycheck, let's re-record the lines and get him one.
00:47:07 I think it's worse than that, they probably think, and worse than that, they probably
00:47:12 think rightly so, that if they didn't change it, some snarky reviewer on some website
00:47:17 somewhere would be like, well the dialogue clearly doesn't hold up and it's fucking
00:47:22 bad now and it's all hokey and queer and gay, but they wouldn't say queer because you can't
00:47:27 say queer now.
00:47:28 But they'd, you know, in so many words, they'd call it queer and gay.
00:47:31 Yeah, of course.
00:47:32 Well it is queer and gay and I like it that way.
00:47:35 Yeah, and I love it.
00:47:38 And it's fucking...
00:47:39 It's fucking...
00:47:40 I don't know.
00:47:41 It would be one thing if like, when they remade Resident Evil they changed the dialogue and
00:47:45 that to be less silly, but that's because, you know, that was a remake, it was a full
00:47:48 from the ground up.
00:47:49 The whole game was...
00:47:50 I have to go feed my cat because he's gonna make noise the whole podcast when you're back.
00:47:56 Like the point of a re-release is supposed to be to preserve these works of art for future
00:48:03 generations or for the current generation that wants the convenience of being able to
00:48:07 play it again.
00:48:08 I could go into the other room if I wanted, take out the disc, plug in my PlayStation
00:48:14 again and set it up, but I'm already in bed, man.
00:48:16 I want something on my PS4.
00:48:17 I want the convenience.
00:48:18 I want something that I remember preserved forever and then I put it in, I paid twenty
00:48:23 dollars for it and it's not like how I remember it and I don't like things that have changed.
00:48:31 That's it.
00:48:32 That's my being mad for today.
00:48:34 But Jesse, just don't worry about it though.
00:48:38 Like it's for new people, right?
00:48:39 You just need to shut the fuck up.
00:48:40 It's the new generation.
00:48:41 Yeah, you idiot boomer.
00:48:43 The new generation needs to experience these classics.
00:48:45 It's not for new people.
00:48:46 Fuck the new generation.
00:48:47 It's for me.
00:48:48 It's all for me.
00:48:49 You know, okay, it's true.
00:48:51 That does extremely disturb me and make me want to kill myself.
00:48:54 But the good news is that I believe this repackage also comes with Rondo of Blood, which I want
00:48:59 to play so that I might do that.
00:49:02 Yeah, I played a little bit of Rondo of Blood and I'm like, it's too fucking hard.
00:49:06 I just want to play the game that I've played before a thousand times.
00:49:10 I mean, I love the, I mean, I'm a huge fan of all the MetroVanias.
00:49:13 I played literally all of them and love them.
00:49:16 Old Castlevania is fucking hard.
00:49:17 I mean, when I was making my Castlevania video, I was like, I feel guilty having never played
00:49:26 a single Simon Castlevania game making this video.
00:49:30 So I'm going to go do that.
00:49:31 And I did.
00:49:33 And it was really fucking hard.
00:49:34 And I could beat it.
00:49:36 Tom, Tom, when me and Munchy were over for for I Am Games and you guys were playing that
00:49:41 like, what was it?
00:49:42 It was like, the Castlevania kickstarter, but it was like the side project like like eight
00:49:47 like 16 bit.
00:49:48 Yeah, it looked.
00:49:50 Yeah, yeah, that game looked pretty fucking cool.
00:49:53 I mean, right.
00:49:54 Art looked really amazing.
00:49:56 I actually did almost beat that game for that game.
00:49:59 I actually did get to the final boss.
00:50:00 I've got it on switch.
00:50:02 I look, I meant to go back and beat it.
00:50:03 So in that way, I kind of have almost beaten like a classic Castlevania, even though it's
00:50:08 not a Castlevania.
00:50:09 It's a new fucking thing.
00:50:11 But that game is not a Castlevania.
00:50:13 No, it's it's by Iga or Igarashi, the guy who made Simply In The Night.
00:50:17 Oh, right, right, right.
00:50:18 He's a new boy.
00:50:19 He's a separate boy.
00:50:20 This talk of like re-releasing games, making them different and updating them has got me
00:50:25 thinking about Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, which released just like a couple of days
00:50:30 ago.
00:50:32 I've been seeing a friend play that lately.
00:50:34 What do you think, Lads?
00:50:35 Well, it's bad.
00:50:36 The fact that they think, I've said this a thousand times in its old hand, but they
00:50:42 think that for some reason, the new generation is just stupider.
00:50:48 The only thing they can think is that the new generation is stupider than what came before.
00:50:55 So this is a remake of Yellow, and everyone played Yellow as a kid, or all the millennials
00:50:59 did.
00:51:00 I thought it was just fun, and they got, and this is children who are doing this, children
00:51:04 who grew up with, you know, the anime.
00:51:06 They play Yellow, and it's a fucking fine time.
00:51:09 No one rides in streets.
00:51:10 No one's like, um, but how do I get past the search?
00:51:14 How do I find the batteries in the trash can?
00:51:17 I don't understand.
00:51:18 Because Pokemon is fucking too easy.
00:51:19 It's way too hard.
00:51:20 Even if you continually lose against a gym leader, you'll still gain experience if you
00:51:22 kill any of their Pokemon, and you'll just eventually overpower them and win.
00:51:26 But for some reason, they think, no, guys, Pokemon has to be for the kids now.
00:51:30 You millennials, you 20-year-olds, you've had your chance with Pokemon.
00:51:33 Now it's time for the children to play Pokemon.
00:51:36 We need to make this game baby game, because it's for the children, okay?
00:51:39 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
00:51:43 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
00:51:44 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
00:51:45 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
00:52:15 are you as cool in my head Jesus Christ?
00:52:17 No, you're trying to be yerde
00:52:19 No
00:52:20 your your bif behold
00:52:21 OK, go on
00:52:23 I want to hear it
00:52:24 what's fun about Pokemon Let's Go, is that it's the game that you know and
00:52:30 you can play it again and like they've re-done everything and like oh like wow I can see like this
00:52:34 modern 3ds graphics and this old like fucking location and it's just it's the
00:52:40 Pokemon catching is like Pokemon Go
00:52:43 but it's still fine, like you get experience
00:52:45 for catching them.
00:52:46 That doesn't sound like fine.
00:52:47 I'm being swayed back to the other guy's side now.
00:52:52 Well, I mean, it's, because like,
00:52:53 you get experience for how well you catch the Pokemon,
00:52:56 so like you get party experience and stuff.
00:52:58 It's a bad experience for catching Pokemon.
00:53:01 Everything, they changed.
00:53:02 Everything, they shit's different.
00:53:04 Okay, I know.
00:53:05 Everything that's different about Pokemon, let's go.
00:53:07 From mainline Pokemon, it makes it worse
00:53:10 and like takes away from what I like about the game.
00:53:11 The fact that you can like access your box at any time
00:53:14 is a great change.
00:53:15 It's a great improvement.
00:53:16 I, Tom, listen, no offense, but I hate you.
00:53:20 That's fine.
00:53:22 Your opinion sounds pretty shit to me right now too.
00:53:24 So like we're just on different wavelengths.
00:53:27 That's fine.
00:53:28 Okay, well, hang on, hang on.
00:53:29 I think there might be at least some disconnect here
00:53:31 because honestly, a lot of what I've seen in Pokemon,
00:53:34 let's go, seem like really good things
00:53:37 that we would want in a Pokemon game.
00:53:40 Like just the idea of being able to see the Pokemon
00:53:42 like on the map and then touch them.
00:53:45 Like that's cool.
00:53:46 It's okay, I guess.
00:53:47 I like that.
00:53:48 Yeah, first of all, I disagree with the idea
00:53:52 that the younger generation deserves Pokemon.
00:53:56 I don't think they do.
00:53:57 I don't think that kids deserve it.
00:53:59 They already have it.
00:54:00 They already have it anyway.
00:54:02 I'm upset.
00:54:03 I've been waiting my entire life
00:54:06 for a home console Pokemon game with like modern graphics
00:54:12 and you can sit on your couch,
00:54:14 you lay in your bed and play it on the TV screen.
00:54:16 Been waiting my whole life for that.
00:54:18 They finally make one and I look at it
00:54:20 and it's got like Pokemon ghost shit in it
00:54:22 and they did it wrong.
00:54:23 They finally did it and they did it wrong.
00:54:25 Just to spite me and just to give it to the...
00:54:27 Next year, what everybody wants is coming next year.
00:54:30 Ultra Sun and Moon are on the switch.
00:54:33 Ultra Sun and Moon are on the switch.
00:54:34 They announced Pokemon, let's go.
00:54:36 They said the mainline series is coming next
00:54:38 and that's gonna have all the regular mechanics.
00:54:41 This is not a replacement.
00:54:42 It's just a comfy co-op game where you can relive
00:54:46 your first Pokemon adventure.
00:54:48 This game is for some reason-
00:54:49 It's fucking kill me,
00:54:50 fucking kill me instead of that.
00:54:52 No, you're a fucking idiot
00:54:53 because you're playing this game for the wrong reason.
00:54:54 If you're saying like,
00:54:55 I wanna like fucking do a hardcore Nuzlocke run
00:54:58 in Pokemon, let's go.
00:54:59 Hey, I know.
00:55:00 Not why you play this.
00:55:00 Let's play a Pokemon game.
00:55:02 Let's play a Pokemon game where you go on an adventure
00:55:04 and catch monsters and become the very best
00:55:07 like no one ever was, only, only.
00:55:09 Let's make it so you don't have to fucking
00:55:10 think about it at all.
00:55:12 That sounds great.
00:55:13 It's not even that you don't have to think about it.
00:55:14 It's, I mean, we're not-
00:55:15 Yes, it fucking is.
00:55:16 I've seen it.
00:55:17 You can literally, you can literally double team.
00:55:19 You can two on one enemy trainers.
00:55:22 You can fight their one Pokemon with two of yours.
00:55:24 And you don't have to do it.
00:55:26 It's just like, if you would,
00:55:27 like me and Digi just sitting there playing I Am Games,
00:55:29 just shooting the shit and we're just like,
00:55:30 oh, Digi wants to jump in and just like play the battle
00:55:33 with me because we're just,
00:55:34 we're just enjoying and having a good time.
00:55:36 It's not, like it's not a hardcore game,
00:55:38 but it's not a bad game because it's not a hardcore game.
00:55:40 It's just a casual, fun, like nostalgic experience.
00:55:44 Like the newest ad for Pokemon Let's Go
00:55:46 is literally a shot-for-shot remake
00:55:48 of the original like Pokemon TV theme
00:55:52 just done with in-game graphics.
00:55:53 So like this isn't like for new people.
00:55:56 It's for people who have good memories of this game.
00:55:58 Just want to play it again and have a good time
00:56:00 and just chill out.
00:56:01 And it's fine.
00:56:02 If that doesn't sound fun to you,
00:56:04 then this isn't your kind of game,
00:56:05 but that doesn't mean it's a bad game.
00:56:07 It's not.
00:56:08 No, Tom, let me stop you right there.
00:56:11 The fact that it is not my kind of game
00:56:14 does mean it's a bad game.
00:56:15 To you.
00:56:16 Because being bad means nothing
00:56:17 other than that I don't like it.
00:56:19 And because I don't like it, it is bad by definition.
00:56:22 I made a video about this on my YouTube channel.
00:56:25 Well, I don't like it for tearing people apart,
00:56:27 making us fight.
00:56:28 I don't like it.
00:56:29 Yeah, it's making us all yell.
00:56:32 Yeah.
00:56:32 So much for comfy.
00:56:33 I like how the stupid of the topic.
00:56:36 Yeah, I have nostalgia for old Pokemon.
00:56:38 No, I don't want to play some baby version of it
00:56:41 to relive those memories.
00:56:43 The stupid of the topic, the more political
00:56:45 and fervent the discourse becomes.
00:56:48 It seems like.
00:56:49 Yeah, it is.
00:56:50 It's true.
00:56:51 Like, before it was all like the fucking Garfield,
00:56:54 Monday's shit, and that was pretty stupid.
00:56:56 Then it was like, oh yeah, well, furry is.
00:56:57 And that was a little bit more stupid,
00:56:59 getting a little bit more heated.
00:57:01 But then you start talking about whether the new Pokemon
00:57:04 game is too much for kids or not.
00:57:06 And then all of a sudden it's like, well, let
00:57:08 me stop you're right there.
00:57:09 So no, no, no, let me finish.
00:57:10 Let me finish.
00:57:11 Let me say what I want.
00:57:11 You were invested.
00:57:12 Yeah, I am invested.
00:57:15 I just can't think of someone.
00:57:17 Because the more frivolous the topic,
00:57:19 the less afraid I am to have a strong opinion about it.
00:57:22 Here's the thing.
00:57:23 Pokemon Go players who haven't played the main series games.
00:57:26 I would say the majority of people who play Pokemon Go
00:57:28 have played the main series games.
00:57:29 Let's examine the people who haven't.
00:57:32 I know someone.
00:57:33 It's Kazzy's dad.
00:57:35 Is Kazzy's dad this fucking portly Bostonite going to be
00:57:41 like, oh, you know what?
00:57:42 I really want to get into main series Pokemon.
00:57:46 It's almost like the reason I play Pokemon Go is because
00:57:48 it's a mobile game.
00:57:49 And I can play it on my phone.
00:57:51 It's not like you can trust me.
00:57:52 You know what?
00:57:53 I really, really care about Pokemon now.
00:57:55 So I'm going to go out.
00:57:56 I'm going to buy like a $200, $300 video game machine,
00:58:00 which I'm going to play exclusively Pokemon on.
00:58:03 And that's what I'm going to do with my time and money.
00:58:06 I have time for this.
00:58:07 I agree that those people are not going to buy it.
00:58:09 But by the same token, you just said the majority of people
00:58:11 who play Pokemon Go play the main series.
00:58:13 So if you're already playing Pokemon Go,
00:58:15 and this game works with it, and you can trade guys
00:58:17 between it and stuff, like it's another game.
00:58:20 They would already be doing it all the time.
00:58:22 If you already play the main line series
00:58:24 and you have a functioning brain,
00:58:26 no offense, Tom.
00:58:27 Love you, love you, buddy.
00:58:28 But then you shouldn't like this new fucking remake.
00:58:31 Look, it's just a different kind of game.
00:58:33 And it's still fun.
00:58:34 It's just not the same kind of game as a main line series.
00:58:37 It's why it's not replacing it.
00:58:39 I mean, it's fun.
00:58:41 It is good.
00:58:42 I don't hate remakes as long as they're good.
00:58:45 OK.
00:58:46 But OK, this is a remake of a different style.
00:58:49 It's a different interpretation.
00:58:50 There's a value clash here for sure.
00:58:52 I am definitely not the kind of game.
00:58:54 Just wait for I am Games video, which is coming out probably
00:58:56 today or tomorrow.
00:58:57 And yeah, it'll explain that more.
00:59:00 Based on what you said, Nate, were you saying, Nate?
00:59:02 Well, I was just saying, I can already
00:59:03 guess the content of that video, which is I'm not saying,
00:59:05 oh, I don't give a shit.
00:59:06 I'm just saying, I already know there's clearly
00:59:09 a distinction between, I mean, I'm really not
00:59:12 a comfy gamer guy.
00:59:13 I'm really not.
00:59:15 I'm a like to be challenged guy.
00:59:17 I'm not saying I'm better.
00:59:18 It literally, objectively, doesn't matter.
00:59:20 I'm saying it, Nate.
00:59:21 I'm saying we're a higher breed.
00:59:25 We have a better pedigree.
00:59:26 We come from a better fucking casual mood.
00:59:28 I mean, no, no, no, no.
00:59:29 It's not even about being casual or any of that shit.
00:59:32 My opinion with video games has always been they're a great
00:59:35 friend.
00:59:36 You're a fucking doom fag.
00:59:37 From doing things I actually care about.
00:59:39 So I'm not going to sit here and spend all my time
00:59:42 100% think some incredibly hard game,
00:59:45 because I have more important things to do than 100%
00:59:47 a game that when it's done just goes back into the fucking shelf.
00:59:51 I play it because I'm playing on the street.
00:59:53 There's another factor here.
00:59:54 There's another factor here.
00:59:55 And it is basically, it is what direction is the Pokemon
00:59:59 company going?
01:00:00 Because I want them to go in a different direction.
01:00:03 They're making a, OK, here's the thing
01:00:05 that I'm also happy with about Pokemon Let's Go.
01:00:07 And I'll tell you why.
01:00:08 If they have, because they said during E3 when this game was
01:00:11 announcing everything, that they're
01:00:13 going to do this two-prong approach going forward
01:00:15 and see how it works.
01:00:16 So if they dump all the casual stuff into the Let's Go series,
01:00:20 then that frees up the main series
01:00:22 to be more hardcore and not have all the baby shit in it.
01:00:25 I would like that very much, but I have no faith at all.
01:00:29 I have no faith at all that that will happen.
01:00:31 I think they are lying or mistaken,
01:00:33 because I don't think they will do that.
01:00:35 There's no way.
01:00:36 Look at Sun and Moon.
01:00:37 Look at Sun and Moon.
01:00:38 There's no way they're going to stop the baby if it can't
01:00:40 design a Pokemon Let's Go series.
01:00:41 I don't know.
01:00:42 Then it sounds like fourth one is just
01:00:44 a shitty series that you guys shouldn't play anymore.
01:00:46 That's correct.
01:00:47 That is correct.
01:00:48 I go back and forth on this.
01:00:49 I feel like maybe, like we had the switch to 3D
01:00:52 in Gen 6, and then there was Gen 7.
01:00:54 And I didn't play Gen 6, but Gen 7 was pretty good,
01:00:58 but I don't think it was quite there.
01:01:00 I feel like in Gen 8, I don't know.
01:01:02 I feel like they might really nail it.
01:01:05 They might nail the formula in Gen 8.
01:01:07 I am extremely anticipating to see what development choices
01:01:11 they make in the next game, because I
01:01:12 think that'll tell us a ton of information about where
01:01:15 they're actually going.
01:01:16 I mean, if I'm looking at the series history
01:01:18 and I'm having to guess, here's my prediction.
01:01:21 They add a bunch of frivolous bullshit
01:01:23 that nobody cares about.
01:01:24 Remove a lot of features for no real reason.
01:01:27 Yeah.
01:01:29 Like maybe they add a new version of contests.
01:01:32 Wouldn't that be cool?
01:01:33 It is not a cynical position at all
01:01:36 to think that a series has declined,
01:01:38 because it's not like never.
01:01:40 None of us are happy right now.
01:01:42 None of us are like, oh man, it's so good to hate Pokemon.
01:01:46 We get such catharsis out of making bad reviews of Pokemon
01:01:50 or something.
01:01:51 I am not happy that Pokemon, to me,
01:01:55 has gone downhill in a way.
01:01:58 It's not even a new thing.
01:02:00 It's not even like I thought this for years or something.
01:02:04 This is an extremely new development for me.
01:02:06 I'm still in like a shock, like denial stage,
01:02:10 where I just think, wow, why is this happening?
01:02:14 Stop it, please.
01:02:16 High points of the series for me
01:02:18 were Black, White, Two, and Sparkle Souls.
01:02:21 And that wasn't that long ago.
01:02:22 That was like what?
01:02:23 Like a couple years ago.
01:02:25 That wasn't very long.
01:02:26 Yeah, four, five, six years ago?
01:02:27 Man, I don't know.
01:02:28 I don't know if it's gone downhill
01:02:30 or if I've gone downhill.
01:02:32 I mean, I didn't play Ultra Sun and Moon,
01:02:35 but I heard that they weren't much better than Sun and Moon
01:02:38 were not as good as White, Two.
01:02:39 I can't really keep track of them.
01:02:41 I mean, to me, it's like all the gents are the same,
01:02:43 like all the Pokemon gents.
01:02:45 I mean, they're all police officers.
01:02:48 They all look the same.
01:02:50 You know?
01:02:51 All the Pokemon gents.
01:02:53 You know, the gents and Pokemon.
01:02:56 Oh.
01:02:57 You fucking pheasant.
01:02:59 No.
01:03:01 Oh, damn it.
01:03:02 I was rubed.
01:03:04 I mean, is rubed a word?
01:03:06 Can you be rubed?
01:03:07 Sure.
01:03:08 Why not?
01:03:08 There's a game.
01:03:09 I think I'm at Ruzed.
01:03:11 There's a game that I have in my Steam library
01:03:14 that I come back to fairly regularly to play with friends.
01:03:17 It is called Yet Another Zombie Defense,
01:03:19 and it is $0.99.
01:03:21 It's a shit shovelware, like Steam, green light,
01:03:25 push through the doors as possible to turn a quick buck.
01:03:28 When you open up the game, the file on your computer,
01:03:32 like on Task Manager, it says My Game, all caps,
01:03:35 and it has an Xbox controller logo.
01:03:38 And it just is you are spawn in this like Unity graphics,
01:03:42 like only default settings.
01:03:44 Like, they didn't actually make any of their own models.
01:03:46 It's just like default shit, and you just shoot zombies forever.
01:03:49 And that's literally all the game is.
01:03:52 And that game, I could recognize, is shit, but I love it.
01:03:56 First of all, for, because it's funny, because it's hilarious.
01:04:00 It's called Yet Another Zombie Defense.
01:04:02 Like, even the title is exasperated at what it is.
01:04:06 But not only that, just because it's such like an easy game
01:04:09 that I can just call up Ethan whenever I want,
01:04:12 and I can be like, oh, dude, you up for it.
01:04:14 You up for the Yet Another Zombie Defense session.
01:04:16 He'd be like, oh, hell, yeah, we get past our high score.
01:04:20 We gotta get past night 20.
01:04:22 And then we can do that, and it'll be a great time.
01:04:24 And I feel like that might be the sort of thing
01:04:26 that you do, Tom, with this video game, where I don't,
01:04:30 I mean, I think it's a difference between you
01:04:32 thanking the game is bad or not.
01:04:33 But it's more about the social aspect of it
01:04:35 rather than the game itself being good or bad.
01:04:39 I'm just sick of playing games being easy.
01:04:41 Like, I was already way sick of it.
01:04:44 And now, a way more easy Pokemon game comes out.
01:04:47 And I know that's just me.
01:04:48 I know that's just me.
01:04:49 All the Pokemon games have been easy since the first one.
01:04:52 Yeah.
01:04:52 Well, look, there's a huge fucking difference
01:04:54 between the ease of like, sun and moon versus like, diamond.
01:04:57 But like, the writing's been on the wall forever.
01:05:00 That doesn't mean it's good.
01:05:01 And that just means my points are correct.
01:05:03 But it just means that after like two decades,
01:05:05 you're going to have to be like, I guess
01:05:06 this is just a simple game.
01:05:08 I hate this argument.
01:05:08 I hate this argument that we should just give up on Pokemon.
01:05:11 I'm not saying you should give up.
01:05:12 I'm just saying like, go and expecting
01:05:14 that it's probably going to be a simplistic game.
01:05:16 Like, I don't think, I agree with you.
01:05:18 I would like the challenge of red and blue back.
01:05:20 Because like, Pokemon red and blue
01:05:22 wasn't so challenging that I would just like, stop playing it
01:05:25 because I have better things to do.
01:05:26 It's like, enough like, oh, like, I actually
01:05:28 have to like, think and try.
01:05:30 And like, when they released Fire Red and Leaf Green,
01:05:31 I was like, ah, they made this way simpler.
01:05:33 Like, that game was still fun.
01:05:35 I still enjoyed it.
01:05:35 Because I'm like, whoa, it's like, better graphics and stuff.
01:05:37 And like, this is like, a deeper realization of the world.
01:05:40 It's interesting to see.
01:05:41 Like, is it better than the original?
01:05:43 No, but it's still an interesting experience
01:05:45 to see this again with different hardware.
01:05:48 Like, that's a cool experience to me.
01:05:49 And Let's Go's doing the same thing.
01:05:51 It's like, it's a new experience.
01:05:52 Like, we were talking on the stream
01:05:53 how like, there's so much more detail that like,
01:05:55 I know where I'm going, but it almost doesn't even
01:05:58 feel that familiar.
01:05:59 Like, if it wasn't, because did you
01:06:01 was saying how like, the level design of Let's Go
01:06:04 is still kind of like, geometric and right
01:06:06 angley, like the original Game Boy gamers.
01:06:08 But there's so much detail in it,
01:06:10 that it almost like, the visuals,
01:06:12 like the actual technical details of the visuals
01:06:15 are way better than like, Sun and Moon, for example.
01:06:17 But Sun and Moon were designed from the ground up
01:06:20 as a 3D game.
01:06:21 So the geometry and stuff is more organic
01:06:23 and less right angley.
01:06:24 So the actual like, level layouts
01:06:27 are more in depth in Sun and Moon.
01:06:29 So these like, level designs feel more basic
01:06:31 because they're based on 1996 Game Boy games.
01:06:35 But visually they look great.
01:06:35 3D, 3D was a mistake.
01:06:37 The series never looked better than it did in Gen 5.
01:06:40 And it never will.
01:06:42 I want, we've talked about Pokemon a lot
01:06:44 and I feel it always does come down to one thing,
01:06:46 at least for me.
01:06:47 It's true.
01:06:48 I mean, even if I want Pokemon to be good,
01:06:51 the proof is in the pudding.
01:06:52 Maybe the next games will really be something
01:06:54 that shakes things up.
01:06:55 Now that there's been a divide between hardcore
01:06:58 and soft core players, to whatever extent we'll find out.
01:07:01 But the real answer is, go play Crystal Clear,
01:07:04 go play the ROM hacks, that's the shit.
01:07:07 We should just all go play Crystal Clear.
01:07:09 And apparently that's the good one,
01:07:10 that everyone says to play.
01:07:11 I don't want to seem like a doom bringer here.
01:07:14 I don't want to seem like someone who's saying
01:07:16 the apocalypse isn't anything.
01:07:17 I don't think Pokemon has degraded to such a point
01:07:20 where I don't like it anymore or something.
01:07:22 Yeah.
01:07:23 I don't know.
01:07:25 I'm allowed to be mad, aren't I?
01:07:26 I'm allowed to be like, oh man,
01:07:28 things were better like a couple years ago.
01:07:30 Do I not earn that?
01:07:32 Do I not have that?
01:07:33 Sun and Moon weren't terrible.
01:07:34 They were just like, you know,
01:07:36 they were no black, white too.
01:07:39 They were just exasperating.
01:07:40 They were no hard-goal, soul, silver.
01:07:43 And that's a shame, it's a shame that the sequels
01:07:47 are not improving.
01:07:48 Yes.
01:07:49 For a while they were, every generation,
01:07:51 every generation from one to five
01:07:53 was a straight improvement at fact, hashtag fact.
01:07:56 I don't know about four.
01:07:57 Well, why not four?
01:07:59 Why not four?
01:08:01 I'm so fucking mad at you stupid millennials.
01:08:04 You don't fucking get it.
01:08:06 Shut up.
01:08:07 Physical special split.
01:08:08 Shut the fuck up.
01:08:09 A hard-goal, soul, silver were,
01:08:11 but the main like diamond pearl were not.
01:08:13 Yeah.
01:08:14 I didn't like diamond pearl that much.
01:08:15 All of your problems with it.
01:08:17 Three was a huge step down from gen two.
01:08:20 Three?
01:08:21 I don't know about that because just gen,
01:08:23 I mean, I skipped gen three,
01:08:25 but it added the physical special split, right?
01:08:28 Gen three took out the day-night cycle,
01:08:29 which was so cool about gen two.
01:08:31 They reduced the amount, like you only had eight badges
01:08:34 again instead of 16.
01:08:35 So the game was half the size.
01:08:36 And then in order to get like the evolutions
01:08:38 they debuted last gen,
01:08:39 you had to buy GameCube games
01:08:41 just so you could port them in.
01:08:44 Okay.
01:08:44 I understand.
01:08:45 I understand.
01:08:46 And those trumpet sounds were fucking disgusting.
01:08:48 And to this day,
01:08:49 it sounds like nails on the chalkboard.
01:08:50 Halfing the game isn't good.
01:08:53 And they'd never been able to top that either.
01:08:55 But the immeasurable benefit of having like abilities
01:08:59 and natures and shit like that in battle,
01:09:01 completely revolutionized the battle.
01:09:03 Okay, here's the distinction.
01:09:05 In all of the best Pokemon games,
01:09:06 they kept adding more and more stuff
01:09:09 to the battling system,
01:09:10 because that's how you interact with the game.
01:09:13 Stop pretending that Pokemon isn't about battling.
01:09:16 Because that's literally all that you do in the game
01:09:18 is battle.
01:09:19 That's all you do.
01:09:20 Mechanically, the game has only improved
01:09:22 and I don't think it's ever slid back.
01:09:25 Oh, I wouldn't say, I think it has.
01:09:27 Man.
01:09:28 It's been bogged down.
01:09:29 I hate the natures and all the hidden stats.
01:09:31 It's just ruins the whole fucking experience.
01:09:34 No, those are, they add to the game
01:09:37 but you can ignore them if you want to.
01:09:38 No, they're like totally like, eh.
01:09:41 Nah, I don't like them.
01:09:43 Nah.
01:09:45 That's 10 out of 10.
01:09:47 I was gonna hate that more passionately,
01:09:49 but I fucking ran out.
01:09:52 I hate when people are like,
01:09:57 this comes a lot,
01:09:58 this comes a lot in smash community discussions
01:10:02 where it's like, why do you want the game to be competitive?
01:10:05 What, just fucking, it just turned your brain off.
01:10:09 It's just a party game.
01:10:10 I don't even, I don't want anyone else
01:10:13 to experience the game in any other way than my do.
01:10:15 A.K.A. I only ever want to play like four players
01:10:21 with Atom's on.
01:10:22 I fucked up the starting of this conversation so badly.
01:10:27 I'm not saying that you can't have parties
01:10:29 or anything like that.
01:10:30 I'm not saying anything remotely.
01:10:31 I'm just trying to say that it's fun
01:10:34 to play games competitively.
01:10:35 It's fun to try hard.
01:10:37 Devils advocate here, when you're at a party
01:10:39 and you're all playing Smash
01:10:41 and someone is really good, the party's ruined.
01:10:44 Well, just don't get that.
01:10:46 Okay, okay, first of all, nothing to do with the game.
01:10:48 Because I was Princess Peach and I killed Steve,
01:10:51 I killed all of Munchie's friends
01:10:53 and once with fucking in a display of power
01:10:57 yet unrivaled by man.
01:10:59 And we all had a great time
01:11:00 as I was destroying everyone
01:11:02 with my incredible Peach powers.
01:11:04 Having the game be balanced and be able to be competitive
01:11:08 does not detract from the party aspect in any way.
01:11:11 There's absolutely no reason to not have it
01:11:14 being competitively viable.
01:11:15 As a loyal Peach player, are you excited to play as Daisy?
01:11:18 Because I feel that strongly.
01:11:20 Didn't you see my video?
01:11:21 My E3 video, I was so excited, I sang from the heart.
01:11:25 Did I, maybe I missed it, but shit,
01:11:27 I don't know, I have to go watch it again if so.
01:11:29 Oh shit, yeah, I did a whole video about Daisy
01:11:31 and how cool it is and how excited I am and shit.
01:11:34 She's got like a weird side B.
01:11:36 I mean, what's the deal?
01:11:37 What is it?
01:11:38 Or it might be down, I forget which,
01:11:41 the one with its toad, it might be her neutral B.
01:11:44 She like swishes back and forth,
01:11:45 it's a really bizarre motion.
01:11:47 I am, honestly, Daisy is my number one character
01:11:50 I'm excited to play as.
01:11:51 I mean, I'm very excited to play as Daisy,
01:11:55 but I also feel a little bit of guilt
01:11:57 because Peach is like my best friend.
01:11:58 She's like the best girl.
01:11:59 She's like been there for me this whole time
01:12:02 and sometimes I'm gonna have to be a Daisy.
01:12:05 Sometimes, look, look, I can't be a one,
01:12:08 I can't be a one princess guy, okay?
01:12:11 I'm too cool for that.
01:12:12 I wonder, do you think, just quick aside,
01:12:15 do you think that the game or the fucking, the pro circuit,
01:12:20 now that like, smash ball charging stuff
01:12:23 is like a meter that gets charged,
01:12:25 is that gonna be like switched off for tournament play?
01:12:27 Or like, yeah, okay, well, all right.
01:12:29 I was gonna say, Daisy and Peach,
01:12:31 I think literally have the best one
01:12:33 because it both gets an instant kill
01:12:35 and they also can be fully healed,
01:12:37 which is just like the best combination of shit.
01:12:40 Yeah, there's no way they would ever allow
01:12:43 smash ball to turn into whatever.
01:12:45 In Eastergames, they switch to whatever.
01:12:47 Nothing more asinine and infuriating
01:12:50 and obnoxious in the world than being at a party
01:12:53 and everyone's playing Smash Brothers
01:12:55 and everyone's having a good time,
01:12:56 but there's that one guy who's like,
01:12:58 yeah, we gotta do a final destination, we know items.
01:13:01 Turn off the fucking items.
01:13:02 We gotta turn off the items.
01:13:03 It's not a real fight, it's not real competition,
01:13:07 it's not competitive.
01:13:08 First of all, I hate the items.
01:13:10 I hate them.
01:13:11 No, the items are, okay.
01:13:12 I vehemently disagree with the notion
01:13:15 that having items on is somehow less competitive
01:13:18 or less of a game of skill.
01:13:20 Yeah, I'm with you.
01:13:22 I'm with you, Jesse.
01:13:22 No, it's so much more random.
01:13:23 It's live, it's live.
01:13:24 Yeah, yeah, it's live.
01:13:25 It's random, but it's not.
01:13:26 It's random, it's fair.
01:13:28 Like, you still have to know how to capitalize on using it.
01:13:32 Yeah, I don't get it.
01:13:33 I don't get it.
01:13:33 I don't get the idea.
01:13:34 It's totally insane.
01:13:35 Mate, no, knowing how to use the items,
01:13:37 knowing it's a whole different skill set
01:13:39 that the final destination crew
01:13:41 just totally pretends doesn't exist.
01:13:43 I can't even take this armor seriously.
01:13:44 Yeah, like, yeah, you can get a lucky,
01:13:46 you can get a lucky drop, you, shut up.
01:13:48 You can get a lucky drop
01:13:49 and get a hammer and win because of it,
01:13:51 but I still think that the better player will win more.
01:13:53 Oh, wow, look, it's a Pokeball.
01:13:55 It spawned right in front of me.
01:13:56 I'll approve it, though it's Kyogre.
01:13:58 It helps the entire screen.
01:13:59 Oh, cool.
01:14:01 Like, you just get one Masterball spawn next to you.
01:14:04 You get it, and it's like, I don't know,
01:14:05 fucking instant win, Mewtwo, or whatever the fuck it is.
01:14:08 I don't know.
01:14:09 It's, that's silly.
01:14:10 Look, look.
01:14:11 Like, it's fine.
01:14:12 Here's the thing.
01:14:13 In a real combat. They're not bad.
01:14:14 In a real combat situation, you don't get to go,
01:14:17 okay, here are the rules and here's how I want them.
01:14:20 And if someone attacks you in a bar,
01:14:22 you're grabbing a bottle, you're grabbing a chair,
01:14:24 you're grabbing anything you fucking can
01:14:26 because that's competitive.
01:14:29 Bitch.
01:14:30 Yeah, okay.
01:14:31 Well, I mean, I actually practice what I preach,
01:14:33 AKA Bushido, and I believe in honorable duels.
01:14:37 So maybe look it up one of these fucking days.
01:14:39 I think the competition,
01:14:40 it's not like about a bar fight, it's a sport, you know?
01:14:43 He's right.
01:14:44 Yeah, it's a closed, sanitized environment.
01:14:47 The only sport that I believe in is professional wrestling,
01:14:50 where there are no rules
01:14:51 and anyone can do any stupid shit they want.
01:14:53 And that's the one true sport.
01:14:55 So somehow I've finagled my way into being right once again.
01:15:00 I'm a different breed, you see.
01:15:03 I'm a Zoomer.
01:15:04 I grew up with Smash completely different
01:15:05 than I see everyone describe it.
01:15:07 Here's how Smash Plane goes with me.
01:15:10 My friends come over.
01:15:11 We talk about the latest Smash tournament.
01:15:13 Then we go into 1v1s.
01:15:15 And it's a great time when we all laugh
01:15:16 and we all play like Friendly's 1v1.
01:15:19 Non-fountaination, we do a plethora of stages.
01:15:22 And it just is great because we're actually trying
01:15:24 and it's somewhat a competition.
01:15:26 And when we lose or win,
01:15:27 it feels good because we're with our friends.
01:15:29 There's no hard feelings or anything,
01:15:31 but we're still playing the game
01:15:33 like we're actually trying to.
01:15:34 And it's not just fucking easy, nothing matters.
01:15:37 That's how it was for me in college with my buddies.
01:15:40 There was always kind of in the back of our minds,
01:15:42 there was the idea that we're trying to get better
01:15:45 because we did participate in tournaments
01:15:46 every once in a while at college.
01:15:48 So there was that idea that we were grinding our skills
01:15:52 a little bit to try to up our game for that.
01:15:54 So yeah, I guess I was involved with the scene
01:15:57 at least a little bit.
01:15:58 So I was trying to play to that.
01:15:59 We turned off all the stages on the random selection
01:16:02 except for the ones that were tournament viable.
01:16:04 You know, shit like that.
01:16:05 Fuck yeah, dude.
01:16:06 Oh my God, it's gonna be so, okay, okay.
01:16:08 No more fucking, oh, Pokemon isn't good.
01:16:12 Listen, Smash Bros,
01:16:13 it's gonna be a little bit fucked up.
01:16:15 Listen, that's a short, but, but.
01:16:19 Oh my, I never in a thousand years
01:16:22 thought they would listen to this argument
01:16:24 because it wasn't like the most, you know,
01:16:26 and it's not like, oh, bring back wave dashes.
01:16:27 It's not the loudest things in the community.
01:16:31 But the fact that they have not fucking, you know,
01:16:33 final destination mode, not that they have bathroom mode,
01:16:35 but they have hazards off.
01:16:38 That you can turn off hazards and play on any map you want to
01:16:41 and have it not just like spawn weird boss battles at the time
01:16:45 or just change, like transform
01:16:46 into fucking bizarre awful versions of itself
01:16:49 over and over again.
01:16:50 Like you can just turn off hazards
01:16:51 on fucking WarioWare Incorporate.
01:16:54 You can go there and have the weird like pseudo battlefield,
01:16:58 you know, like it's like a block stage
01:17:00 with two extra platforms on the other side.
01:17:02 Oh, glorious.
01:17:04 I love that so much.
01:17:06 It's so good.
01:17:07 Me too.
01:17:08 Me too.
01:17:09 I'm so bored.
01:17:10 I'm so fucking bored, you guys.
01:17:12 What?
01:17:13 Hey, Mage, how are you doing?
01:17:14 How was your week?
01:17:15 You haven't said anything in like an hour.
01:17:17 I wanted to say that you guys were so passionate about things
01:17:20 I didn't want to butt in.
01:17:22 No, who cares?
01:17:24 I like Pokemon.
01:17:25 You doing anything interesting this week, Mage?
01:17:28 No, no, I've been dead.
01:17:30 And then I had a whole bunch of mobile apps
01:17:34 that consumed my life for like forever.
01:17:36 Yeah, Mage is becoming a digital crazy cat lady
01:17:39 to reestablish before the podcast.
01:17:40 I have like four apps that are all different cats.
01:17:43 You're playing that Neco at Sumay?
01:17:44 One of the things, yeah, I have like four different apps
01:17:47 with cats of them.
01:17:48 And one was Dragons.
01:17:50 Well, I played Neco at Sumay a couple of years ago.
01:17:53 I think I deleted it at some point.
01:17:55 It's so cute.
01:17:56 But I replaced it with Matt.
01:17:57 For a while, I was really into Magikarp Jump.
01:17:59 You guys ever play Magikarp Jump?
01:18:00 Oh, yeah, I played it for a little bit.
01:18:03 Magikarp Jump was actually pretty fun for a while.
01:18:06 I like to turn off items when I play Magikarp Jump
01:18:08 competitively.
01:18:09 I just think they really have to disperse.
01:18:10 They introduced too much randomness into the fun.
01:18:12 Exactly.
01:18:14 My worst nightmare.
01:18:15 It's no longer a game of skill.
01:18:16 My worst nightmare.
01:18:17 Guys, guys, guys, guys, my worst nightmare.
01:18:20 The thing I dreaded the most with Magikarp Jump
01:18:23 was like having my Magikarp get taken away by like a Pidgeot.
01:18:28 Is that a thing that can happen?
01:18:29 Yeah, there's a random chance.
01:18:31 You clearly did not play enough Magikarp Jump.
01:18:34 Yeah, you can fuck up and lose the game.
01:18:37 It can be stolen by a Pidgeotto.
01:18:40 It can be, there's one other thing.
01:18:42 It can evolve into a Gyarados.
01:18:43 And you can evolve it into a Gyarados, which
01:18:45 is the worst thing that can happen.
01:18:47 No, no, no, no.
01:18:49 Nate, you don't understand.
01:18:50 Gyarados are worthless because they can't jump.
01:18:53 They just fly.
01:18:54 Who the fuck cares?
01:18:57 This is a jumping competition.
01:18:59 Is this a thing where you have to avoid the rare candies
01:19:01 so you don't accidentally overlevel and become
01:19:03 a Magikarp Jump?
01:19:04 No, it's pretty hard to evolve them by accident.
01:19:08 But you sort of have to go out of your way to do it.
01:19:11 But if you do, you lose the game.
01:19:13 Or well, you don't lose the game.
01:19:14 You just have to start over with a new Magikarp.
01:19:16 That's a feature, though.
01:19:18 Yeah, there's some secret thing you got to do together.
01:19:21 Damn, I'm going to download Magikarp Jump right now.
01:19:24 I really like it.
01:19:26 I like how rooted and lore it is because there's one of the.
01:19:29 I have a deep lore of Magikarp Jump.
01:19:32 Well, it is, though, because one of the Pokedex entries
01:19:35 says that certain Magikarp that get old enough
01:19:39 can jump over mountains.
01:19:40 Does that happen?
01:19:42 Well, I mean, not in the game.
01:19:43 But the Pokedex does say that, yeah.
01:19:46 Well, I mean, but what's the lore relevance
01:19:48 if you don't actually jump over a mountain, then?
01:19:51 Well, I mean, the point is, what the fuck?
01:19:53 The point is that your Magikarp are jumping really high.
01:19:56 But you said the lore is that they jump over mountains,
01:19:58 but they don't do that.
01:19:59 So, man.
01:20:01 Are you fucking stupid?
01:20:03 The point is that they jump really high.
01:20:04 Jumping over a mountain is just an example
01:20:06 of how high and far they can fucking jump.
01:20:08 So the game is about jumping really high and far.
01:20:11 That's sad, though.
01:20:13 Why?
01:20:14 I mean, being an old Magikarp that never became a Gyarados,
01:20:18 it's like being an old virgin.
01:20:21 Yeah, I mean, that's true.
01:20:22 But the ones that become a Gyarados are like,
01:20:25 they're the exception.
01:20:26 I'm pretty sure that the way that the economy,
01:20:30 the ecology of Pokemon works,
01:20:32 like only like a very rare Magikarp,
01:20:36 actually becomes a Gyarados.
01:20:37 Maybe it's worse to be a Gyarados.
01:20:39 Maybe there's something that we're not privy to
01:20:41 in the life of a Gyarados,
01:20:42 because they've always got that twisted snarls.
01:20:44 They've got the mouth of it.
01:20:45 They've got dry mouth for days.
01:20:47 They've got a sore throat, dude.
01:20:48 They look so miserable.
01:20:49 They live under water, Munchie.
01:20:51 They can't jump.
01:20:53 They can't jump.
01:20:54 They can't compete in the Magikarp Jump League.
01:20:56 They can fly, though, right?
01:20:56 Like as a kid, I'm like, oh, Gyarados is cool,
01:20:59 because he looks scary and angry.
01:21:01 But now I'm like, oh, man, Gyarados is living
01:21:04 with a lot of anger,
01:21:05 and I don't know if that's healthy for poor Gyarados.
01:21:08 Maybe Gyarados just has a resting bitch face.
01:21:12 I think it's a mental health issue.
01:21:13 We have to.
01:21:16 You know, that's true.
01:21:18 Yeah, I could believe that, too.
01:21:22 So I got a text the other day.
01:21:24 I know what to find out.
01:21:26 That enraged me.
01:21:28 It was from someone I don't know.
01:21:31 Already on there.
01:21:32 I'll just, I'll read the exchange.
01:21:34 I'll read the exchange that we had.
01:21:37 I get a text that's like,
01:21:41 where is it, where is it, where is it?
01:21:43 It's like two down.
01:21:43 Here we go.
01:21:46 It's a link.
01:21:47 It's a link to a GoFundMe,
01:21:48 and then it would help a tremendous amount,
01:21:51 if you donated, to my GoFundMe page.
01:21:53 And yeah, yeah.
01:21:54 So I clicked the link just out of curiosity,
01:21:57 and it's the name of some girl that I don't know.
01:21:59 I don't recognize the name.
01:22:01 It's a picture of what I presume is her and her boyfriend,
01:22:04 and it's like, help me escape
01:22:07 from my abusive home or something.
01:22:09 Okay.
01:22:10 And then, I didn't read the whole article.
01:22:12 There was something about, you know,
01:22:14 my mother says that it would be better
01:22:16 if I killed myself or something like that.
01:22:19 Have you considered she's right?
01:22:21 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:22:22 So I kind of wish I'd read the whole thing now
01:22:24 so I could go into more detail, but I didn't, whatever.
01:22:27 So I text her back, who is this?
01:22:29 She says, who are you?
01:22:32 To which I respond, you're the one
01:22:33 that sent me a request to donate to your GoFundMe.
01:22:36 No thanks, BTDubs.
01:22:39 And I was very upset, and I'm still seething.
01:22:41 I'm still seething with rage
01:22:42 that anyone would intrude upon my personal space like this.
01:22:46 It's disgusting, and I hate them.
01:22:49 Yeah.
01:22:49 Did they respond to that at all?
01:22:51 No, they did not.
01:22:52 But that was just yesterday,
01:22:53 so they guessed there's still time.
01:22:55 That is very rude.
01:22:58 So I guess you just like mass send out
01:23:00 to like all our contacts or something?
01:23:01 Just like, please donate to me stuff, something?
01:23:06 Maybe there's like some lists you're a part of,
01:23:08 and every time someone wants to mass send a text,
01:23:11 your number's on there.
01:23:12 It's called the government no fly list.
01:23:14 Oh, shit, you're right.
01:23:16 Those people got a lot of extra money kicking around
01:23:19 from all the flights they're not taking,
01:23:20 so they're a perfect candidate.
01:23:22 They can't escape and get an international number.
01:23:25 I just felt like an addiction to GoFundMe lately.
01:23:30 What? How so?
01:23:31 What?
01:23:32 Well, because like, you know, you see them,
01:23:35 every once in a while, someone on your Facebook
01:23:37 has like, oh, here's my uncle.
01:23:39 He was in a car crash, or here's my friend.
01:23:41 He needs a wheelchair or something like that, you know?
01:23:43 Yeah.
01:23:44 You're always seeing them, and just like,
01:23:46 I see the GoFundMe as a people who are in bad situations,
01:23:49 and like, I get this feeling inside me.
01:23:53 That's like, I'm not trying to virtue signal,
01:23:54 because it's not altruistic at all.
01:23:56 It's a feeling of, I have to be better than everyone.
01:23:59 I have to be better than people, so I have to donate.
01:24:01 I have to donate $100 to all of these people,
01:24:04 and I do.
01:24:04 Oh my God.
01:24:05 I donate $100 to each worthy cause that I find.
01:24:08 Dude, I'm sorry, but fucking gag.
01:24:09 If someone was fucking burned in an accident, $100.
01:24:12 If somebody was fucking broke their ankle
01:24:15 by slipping on ice, $100.
01:24:17 You all get $100, because I have to be better.
01:24:19 I'm better than people.
01:24:20 Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jesse, I'm not a GoFundMe.
01:24:22 I guess if they're burned, I don't know.
01:24:24 GoFundMe's for you, they're all to me, for no reason.
01:24:27 Here's, I mean, okay, I guess, like this article
01:24:31 did not convince me that this person's situation
01:24:33 was actually dire.
01:24:34 I guess I could kind of get it if I was really convinced
01:24:37 that someone's situation was really dire.
01:24:39 But at the same time, no matter how dire
01:24:41 someone's circumstances are, it's not my responsibility.
01:24:44 It like, it's not my responsibility to help people
01:24:47 that have been burned, or crippled, or are dying, right?
01:24:50 Like, there's a million of them in the world,
01:24:52 and I can't help them all, so why should I help any of them?
01:24:54 Now is a perfect time to reflect on the teachings
01:24:57 of one iron rand, because what you're describing
01:25:00 is exactly the mentality of the,
01:25:04 I forget what they're called, of the parasites,
01:25:06 or of the people who are manipulated by the parasites.
01:25:09 One should keep in mind that it is a virtue
01:25:12 to build oneself up, because it is only when you build
01:25:15 yourself up, and see that you are the optimal human being
01:25:19 that you can be, that you can then provide
01:25:21 the most value to those other people,
01:25:24 not that they deserve it, or anything,
01:25:26 self-interest is the most important factor in the world.
01:25:29 But, you know, it'll be objectively more useful.
01:25:32 Well, Ayn Rand was a crazy monster.
01:25:35 The reason to help one of them is that there's one person
01:25:37 who's more happier than you left them,
01:25:40 like, you know, when you started out.
01:25:41 Thank you, thank you.
01:25:43 But you'll just end up spending all your money on this shit.
01:25:47 All of your money, you donate a little bit,
01:25:50 you know, like, you might as well just go fund me.
01:25:51 You're not gonna, I'm not saying to spend your 401k
01:25:54 on this fucking person out of nowhere.
01:25:57 No, listen, you see one person who has these
01:26:00 bad circumstances, you feel bad, you donate the money.
01:26:03 But guess what?
01:26:04 There's a thousand more in the exact same
01:26:06 or worse circumstances that you didn't give money to.
01:26:09 And I'll get to them all.
01:26:10 Why did you give money to this one human being?
01:26:11 I'll get to them all eventually.
01:26:12 One day when I'm ready, I'm gonna fix the world.
01:26:15 I'm gonna fix them all.
01:26:18 The thing is,
01:26:19 is for some reason you resonated with that person
01:26:21 to go fund me just a little bit more.
01:26:23 I think the idea is,
01:26:23 there's no shame in that.
01:26:24 It's not what you're gonna want.
01:26:25 Then the reason you're donating, you're not donating
01:26:27 because of anything that you're donating
01:26:28 because their marketing was better.
01:26:29 Hey guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
01:26:32 Yeah, what's, I don't understand what's wrong with that.
01:26:33 Stop rewarding failure.
01:26:34 Stop rewarding failure.
01:26:36 Yeah.
01:26:37 Guys, I'm sort of on Jess's side.
01:26:39 I would like to help people, but the thing is,
01:26:42 a lot of people take the goodwill of other people
01:26:45 and use them like, you know, scams.
01:26:47 And they could say like,
01:26:48 oh, hey, I need a new wheelchair or whatever,
01:26:50 but they actually don't.
01:26:52 And they just use the goodwill of people.
01:26:54 And I don't want to be one of those people they get used.
01:26:57 And I feel sad that people do that.
01:26:59 I've never done that before.
01:27:00 Like, sure, I've donated to things before
01:27:02 and it's been bullshit,
01:27:03 but like that's just the risk you take.
01:27:04 Like if I had the choice,
01:27:06 if there's a cause that I believe in,
01:27:08 and I would rather like give the couple bucks
01:27:11 and like find out I got fucked,
01:27:13 then not do it and feel shitty about it forever.
01:27:16 Look, I would never say that everybody who's in need
01:27:20 is a bad person or won't use it responsibly.
01:27:22 But like, I get approached by homeless people a lot
01:27:25 in Cincinnati.
01:27:26 There's a lot of them asking for money.
01:27:28 And this is a real, I was hyperbolic before.
01:27:31 I was exaggerating, but this is a real point.
01:27:33 I never give any of the money specifically
01:27:36 because I really just have no idea who this person is
01:27:41 or like, if my giving the money will actually help,
01:27:45 will like, I'm actually facilitating a bad lifestyle
01:27:49 if I continue to do this.
01:27:50 Yeah, but it's true.
01:27:51 I don't know if it's actually going to help them.
01:27:53 But I think what Jesse's talking about,
01:27:54 if he's seeing these GoFundMe's on Facebook,
01:27:55 I'm assuming there's like some,
01:27:57 like you know them or you know the people who know them.
01:28:00 I get it, like I've been approached by bums
01:28:03 and there are like grifters and people who are dishonest.
01:28:05 You know, it happened to me
01:28:06 when I was with you guys in Boston,
01:28:07 that lady, I gave her $10 and she's like,
01:28:10 give me more, so I had to give her $20
01:28:12 and she was still like, well,
01:28:13 can you give me a little bit more
01:28:14 because I do have like five kids.
01:28:15 I'm like, lady, enough, get away from me.
01:28:18 You've made me mad now and now I regret helping you.
01:28:21 And like, when you get sort of like grifted like that,
01:28:24 it does like make you not want to help anyone else.
01:28:27 It's like, people who are shitty
01:28:30 and like take advantage of your kindness,
01:28:32 they're just sucking the kindness out of the world
01:28:35 because they're preventing you
01:28:36 from wanting to help anybody else.
01:28:38 But with the GoFundMe thing,
01:28:40 the examples I gave were real examples.
01:28:42 It's like, there was a guy who was burned
01:28:44 and a guy who needed a wheel.
01:28:45 And these are like, these are friends
01:28:46 that I know on Facebook.
01:28:47 So I know they're not scamming me or grifting me.
01:28:49 I know they're real people.
01:28:50 Okay, that is different.
01:28:51 I don't understand your argument, Ben,
01:28:54 about if you can't help them all, then why help one?
01:28:57 Because you're helping one person.
01:28:58 What is not self-evident about that?
01:28:59 I think the idea is that it's not a double standard
01:29:02 or anything.
01:29:03 This person that you're helping
01:29:04 does not deserve help anymore
01:29:06 than hundreds or thousands
01:29:07 or millions of other people.
01:29:08 Right, but you're in contact with them.
01:29:10 You know, I think the idea is that if everybody...
01:29:11 So what?
01:29:12 That's an accident.
01:29:13 That's an accident of fate.
01:29:14 And you don't owe them anything.
01:29:15 Well, no, you don't owe them anything.
01:29:17 This is about owing.
01:29:18 This is about you wanting to help someone.
01:29:20 Right.
01:29:21 Why would you want to help someone?
01:29:22 End of sentence.
01:29:23 Even if it's a stranger,
01:29:25 if it's a stranger who is like tangentially related
01:29:27 to a friend of yours,
01:29:29 I know that that's making my friend feel better
01:29:31 or more, you know,
01:29:33 so that's one less degree of separation where I can go.
01:29:36 If it's, listen, okay, okay.
01:29:38 If it's someone you know,
01:29:40 if it's someone who is like in your life somehow,
01:29:43 who is in your sphere,
01:29:44 that makes sense.
01:29:45 If I was rich, right,
01:29:48 if I had more money than I knew what to do with,
01:29:50 which is not even that much,
01:29:52 maybe if I had twice as much as I do now,
01:29:54 I would have more than I knew what to do with,
01:29:56 then maybe, right?
01:29:59 If I had disposable income
01:30:00 that would not go to any other thing.
01:30:02 But I don't.
01:30:03 I mean, I'm a big believer that money does not actually,
01:30:07 like people who win the lottery,
01:30:09 how it's so common for them to lose it really quickly
01:30:12 because they haven't built up the, you know,
01:30:14 much management.
01:30:15 I catch myself saying stuff like that.
01:30:18 It's funny how we're bringing up the idea of like,
01:30:21 being against charity when like the vast majority of us,
01:30:24 like a good portion of our income is basically charity.
01:30:27 It's not charity.
01:30:28 It is not charity.
01:30:29 I'm disgusted that you would say that.
01:30:32 Yeah, I mean, I pretty strongly disagree with that one.
01:30:34 I was gonna say that, but.
01:30:37 That's totally not true.
01:30:38 That's totally not true.
01:30:39 That's totally not true.
01:30:40 A lot of it.
01:30:41 No, no, no, no, no.
01:30:42 Tom, Tom, Tom, I was sort of thinking that,
01:30:44 but at the same time,
01:30:45 we are providing something in return in a sense.
01:30:49 We are producing content.
01:30:51 You're producing something, but it's free.
01:30:53 Like nobody has to pay for it.
01:30:54 They pay because they want to.
01:30:55 Tom, it's a different goddamn payment model
01:30:58 than traditional exchange.
01:31:00 That doesn't make it charity.
01:31:01 It's just that it's divided amongst.
01:31:04 It's a not a direct exchange for goods and services.
01:31:06 It's like, I like what you're doing.
01:31:07 Therefore, charity should be a dirty word.
01:31:10 Okay, look, look.
01:31:11 If I give a homeless lady $5 and then she sucks my dick,
01:31:17 it's no longer charity.
01:31:18 It's a transaction.
01:31:19 I mean, that's true.
01:31:21 Or it's I'm being raped and mugged, in which cases.
01:31:25 But that's not what we're doing.
01:31:26 It's like we're going around
01:31:27 and sucking everyone's dick for free.
01:31:28 And if they like it,
01:31:29 they'll give us a dollar every now and then.
01:31:31 We're going up to people's cars
01:31:33 and watching their windows without asking them.
01:31:35 And then maybe they'll give us a dollar afterwards.
01:31:37 Not exactly the same thing.
01:31:38 That model is a little closer.
01:31:39 But it is closer.
01:31:42 Well, honestly, that's such a dumb point.
01:31:44 I feel silly even arguing this.
01:31:46 Okay, can we at least agree
01:31:49 that like our income is based
01:31:51 on the goodwill of people, basically?
01:31:53 It is.
01:31:54 That's my point.
01:31:55 It's based on goodwill.
01:31:56 And so it's charity.
01:31:57 I mean, I think most of you are probably in the same position.
01:32:00 As someone who does don't, I mean, not a lot,
01:32:03 but I do donate to a few Patreons.
01:32:05 And I do not feel like I am giving charity.
01:32:08 I feel like I am exchanging currency for a service.
01:32:13 I mean, but you're not.
01:32:15 That's my whole point.
01:32:16 As someone who gives Patreons to you,
01:32:17 I don't feel that way.
01:32:18 You don't feel like what, Munchie?
01:32:21 I don't feel like I'm getting like a service.
01:32:23 Like I'm getting your service in between.
01:32:25 I'm giving it to you because I just like your stuff.
01:32:27 Right, that's my point.
01:32:28 I don't know if I'm supporting it really in a way.
01:32:30 You, okay.
01:32:31 Hang on, hang on.
01:32:33 I feel like I'm supporting the people that do the things.
01:32:37 Right, but that's not the same
01:32:38 as buying something from them.
01:32:39 Well, that's my point.
01:32:40 I am sure there are people who consider their donations
01:32:44 on Patreon or whatever, like effectively charity.
01:32:47 I'm sure there's some people like that.
01:32:49 But that doesn't mean that like some people,
01:32:51 you must admit at the very least,
01:32:53 some people must have the mindset that,
01:32:55 oh, I want to fund this person's work.
01:32:58 Therefore, I will contribute to doing that
01:33:00 by giving them money.
01:33:01 And to me, that seems like that's the main reason to do it.
01:33:03 I agree that that's the main reason,
01:33:05 but my point is that that logic is based on goodwill.
01:33:09 It's not based on, because people who give to the PCP,
01:33:13 other than people who do bonus episodes,
01:33:15 but like in general on Patreon.
01:33:16 Which is the vast majority, by the way.
01:33:17 Sure, but people in general on Patreon,
01:33:19 like your personal Patreon,
01:33:21 I don't know what your rewards are or anything,
01:33:22 but like they watch your videos, which are for free.
01:33:27 They do not have to pay for them.
01:33:28 And if they like you as a person
01:33:30 or they like the content you make,
01:33:32 they decide to give you money as a gesture of goodwill.
01:33:35 They do not have to, because if nobody paid you,
01:33:38 like the videos would still be there to watch,
01:33:40 and assumedly you'd still be making more
01:33:42 if you made half the amount of money you have
01:33:43 because you're trying to build that career.
01:33:45 So the videos themselves have no financial like worth,
01:33:49 because they're not, the market value for them right now
01:33:52 is free.
01:33:53 That's why I think we hit an impasse,
01:33:54 because I do not agree with that.
01:33:56 Why? Who paid for your videos?
01:33:57 Literally nobody.
01:33:58 The patrons.
01:33:59 The patrons paid for them.
01:34:00 No, they didn't.
01:34:01 No, they didn't.
01:34:01 Look, my situation is a little bit different
01:34:04 because I-
01:34:05 Look, forget me, because I'm a little different
01:34:08 because I actually have a full-time job.
01:34:10 Let's take somebody like just for example, Digi.
01:34:12 Digi's lifestyle, his ability to make videos, et cetera,
01:34:15 is literally paid for by his patrons,
01:34:18 because that's how he lives and makes his money.
01:34:20 Like yes, he makes YouTube money as well,
01:34:22 but it is 100%, the vast majority of his income
01:34:26 is from his patrons.
01:34:27 So you can't just say that there's no relationship,
01:34:30 like that clearly-
01:34:31 No, Digi's lifestyle is funded
01:34:34 by the goodwill of his patrons,
01:34:36 but his videos on the market are worth $0
01:34:40 because they are not for sale.
01:34:41 We might get cut up in semantics here a little bit,
01:34:43 because I think we generally would agree on this stuff,
01:34:45 but I think there's a slight difference
01:34:47 in the terminology that we use.
01:34:48 All I'm saying is that Patreon is goodwill,
01:34:49 not a market transaction.
01:34:50 See, I agree that it is goodwill,
01:34:52 which is why I have never given money
01:34:54 to anyone on Patreon ever,
01:34:56 because I don't think that way.
01:34:59 And it's true,
01:34:59 because I have a distinct lack of goodwill in my heart.
01:35:04 So that's true, that's true.
01:35:07 I just think that it is certainly a factor,
01:35:10 and maybe you would argue
01:35:11 that it's less of a factor than I would,
01:35:12 but it is a factor that people feel
01:35:15 they are getting something.
01:35:16 And I mean, I hear this from my patrons,
01:35:18 but again, okay, let's consider that anecdotal, so whatever.
01:35:20 I would argue that I think a large percentage of people
01:35:23 are saying that they're getting something for it,
01:35:25 even if it's just the satisfaction,
01:35:27 which yes, is goodwill-centric,
01:35:30 but it is supporting an artist
01:35:32 so they can keep doing what they want.
01:35:33 It's supporting an artist.
01:35:34 You're supporting the creator.
01:35:36 You're not buying their products.
01:35:38 The products are free for the most part.
01:35:39 I think that is, yeah, I'm sure.
01:35:41 And that's the only tiny distinction I was trying to make.
01:35:44 I don't know.
01:35:45 I feel like they're-
01:35:46 And that is similar to charity
01:35:47 in the fact that you're just giving people stuff.
01:35:49 My patrons are purchasing the pieces of my soul
01:35:53 that I continually chip off of myself for their benefit
01:35:56 and the constant sacrifice and toil and blood, sweat,
01:35:59 pain, tears, and tragedy that I go through
01:36:02 to make these things.
01:36:03 That's what I'm selling.
01:36:05 I don't know.
01:36:06 In Jesse's case,
01:36:06 because a lot of Jesse's stuff is just for patrons,
01:36:09 so that is definitely-
01:36:10 That is true.
01:36:11 I release a lot of stuff exclusive to patrons
01:36:14 that no one else sees on patreon.com slash endless jest.
01:36:17 It's exclusive and no one else can see it.
01:36:19 You have to be a patron and it's hilarious and cool content.
01:36:24 So there you go, people.
01:36:27 So a lot of it depends on the model, right?
01:36:29 I mean, we-
01:36:30 I guess like charity to me implies that like
01:36:33 the person receiving the money
01:36:34 isn't giving anything of their own.
01:36:37 And I think in any of our case, in anyone's case,
01:36:40 most people who have a patron are giving something
01:36:43 unless it's like a total scam artist or something.
01:36:45 Yeah, yeah.
01:36:47 Even people, like for example,
01:36:48 like a lot of us do live streams.
01:36:49 When you're live streaming and you get a donation,
01:36:51 even that, I don't think it's charity
01:36:54 because you are getting something in return.
01:36:56 Right.
01:36:57 I mean, even if it's something that like-
01:36:58 Donation.
01:36:59 That takes no talent or no work,
01:37:00 like just a random live streamer,
01:37:03 even if it's something that doesn't necessarily
01:37:04 take a lot of skill or thought,
01:37:05 it's still you're giving people your time
01:37:07 that you could be spending with,
01:37:09 you love ones or spending on yourself.
01:37:10 But like, true.
01:37:11 I think the difference is that patron and donations,
01:37:14 you get them because the person wants to,
01:37:17 not because they need to.
01:37:18 Nobody has to pay money to get into your Twitch stream.
01:37:20 No one has to pay money to watch Best Guy Ever videos.
01:37:23 They do it because they want to do it.
01:37:26 But if I want to go to the theater
01:37:28 and watch a movie legally,
01:37:30 I have to give them money first.
01:37:32 I can't just walk into theater,
01:37:33 watch the New Avengers movie,
01:37:35 and be like, yeah, that was pretty cool.
01:37:36 I'll give Marvel five bucks.
01:37:37 It doesn't work like that.
01:37:38 Different models.
01:37:39 I concede that Goodwill is definitely an element here.
01:37:42 But like just for example, on my page,
01:37:44 I have at the very least,
01:37:45 like my patron discord that only patrons are in.
01:37:48 So just even adding something like that,
01:37:49 I think does change the equation.
01:37:51 They're getting a reward.
01:37:52 Right, at that point,
01:37:53 if to get into your discord is a product,
01:37:56 your discord does have a financial,
01:37:58 whatever that tier is,
01:37:58 because you have to pay that amount of money to get in there.
01:38:00 And it's a subscription service,
01:38:02 because as soon as you stop paying,
01:38:03 you're no longer in there.
01:38:04 I think charity is a product.
01:38:05 So that is cool, and I'm all for it.
01:38:07 Everyone should be charitable.
01:38:09 Yeah.
01:38:10 Well, okay, I think we agree.
01:38:13 I agree, patron.
01:38:14 Definitely Goodwill is a major element,
01:38:16 but I still think there's a large people are.
01:38:19 I wanna go back to something that Ben said earlier about,
01:38:23 like if I had all the money in the world,
01:38:26 then of course I would give more to charity and stuff like that.
01:38:29 Like I catch myself thinking that all the time.
01:38:31 I always think like, oh man,
01:38:34 if I ever have like a million dollars
01:38:36 or a billion trillion dollars,
01:38:37 I'm gonna give it to everybody.
01:38:40 Everyone's gonna have fun times.
01:38:42 I'm gonna make people's lives less shitty with my money.
01:38:46 If only I had that million dollars.
01:38:49 But then I catch myself saying that,
01:38:50 and I think to myself, well, wait a minute,
01:38:52 how much money is enough?
01:38:54 Like where's the bar for when I have enough money
01:38:56 that it's suddenly okay to be charitable?
01:38:58 And that kind of makes me go, well, fuck that.
01:39:01 I technically, I can be charitable now,
01:39:04 so why the hell aren't I being charitable now?
01:39:06 And that's what makes you wanna fucking do it.
01:39:09 You know, there was a Sam Harris podcast about this stuff,
01:39:12 and basically he was trying to find out like the most,
01:39:15 I think I've talked about this before,
01:39:16 but it was like, what can you get for your bang for the buck,
01:39:19 the most good done for like the least amount of money,
01:39:22 such that like everybody could do it?
01:39:24 And it was something like-
01:39:25 Is it like wells, like drinking freshwater wells in Africa?
01:39:28 I mean, similar.
01:39:29 It was actually insect nets for like South America
01:39:32 to prevent like mosquito-borne disease,
01:39:34 like what is it, malaria, I think.
01:39:37 Malaria?
01:39:39 And so like, that's something for like $30 a month
01:39:42 that most people can afford.
01:39:44 Like if you do that, you can really make
01:39:45 a serious positive difference in the world.
01:39:48 So like there are answers to these questions
01:39:50 for something like that.
01:39:51 Yeah, instead of giving it to,
01:39:54 well, I probably shouldn't say your whole name,
01:39:56 but you want me to read some of this GoFundMe?
01:40:01 Sure, yeah.
01:40:02 And I will read it free of judgment.
01:40:05 Okay.
01:40:06 And I will just let you-
01:40:07 The judgment already happened earlier, let's go.
01:40:09 Well, I mean, I made the judgment not to donate,
01:40:12 but I mean-
01:40:13 I guess the thing itself could be independent.
01:40:14 But as, I mean, as you've heard
01:40:16 from the things I've said on this subject,
01:40:18 like that there's not a high bar of badness
01:40:20 to make me not donate.
01:40:21 Yeah.
01:40:23 Here we go, here we go.
01:40:24 Here's the pitch.
01:40:26 What would your parents say to you
01:40:27 if you called them following a dangerous car accident?
01:40:30 My mom told me she was glad I got into one.
01:40:32 To me, this sort of thing is normal.
01:40:35 Though I've lived with this for too long,
01:40:37 Tristan and I are trying to move out of my mom's house.
01:40:40 Should I not say real names?
01:40:41 Does it matter?
01:40:42 I guess just from here on, yeah.
01:40:44 Okay, T and I are trying to move out of my mom's house
01:40:47 to get an apartment with two friends of ours to start-
01:40:49 Oh, this is good.
01:40:50 Oh yeah, to start our YouTube channel
01:40:53 and engage in our creative endeavors.
01:40:55 Yeah, that takes a lot of fun to just start a YouTube channel.
01:40:58 Okay, all right.
01:40:58 Oh yeah, we originally scheduled to move
01:41:01 in January due to saving,
01:41:02 but after yesterday, we want to get out as soon as possible.
01:41:05 For most three bedroom apartments, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:41:07 I want to raise money, blah, me and my friends.
01:41:10 So we don't have to be around this abuse anymore.
01:41:11 If we raise $2,000, we can leave immediately.
01:41:14 M, our close friend, is moving in a week.
01:41:16 Originally, he was gonna blah, blah, blah.
01:41:18 The more time we wait,
01:41:19 the longer I'm around my toxic mother.
01:41:21 T, M, and I all want to be in a supportive environment
01:41:24 where we all support each other all the time.
01:41:25 Wait, he said T, M, and I.
01:41:27 Who's the third person involved here?
01:41:29 Not, no, I as in the pronoun.
01:41:32 Oh, well, I thought the way you said it was-
01:41:33 There's a T, there's an M, and there's her.
01:41:36 Who she refers to as I, as one does.
01:41:40 But who's the, wait, who's the third person there?
01:41:42 Who's the M?
01:41:42 There's someone called M.
01:41:44 There's someone called M.
01:41:45 Well, okay, are this person in some sort of
01:41:47 three-way relationship?
01:41:48 Is that what's being implied here?
01:41:49 No, no, no, she said close friend.
01:41:51 Oh, okay, okay, all right.
01:41:52 So she's just like trying to do it.
01:41:53 Anyway, blah, blah, blah.
01:41:54 Here's the rub, here's the rub.
01:41:56 Picture of her and T.
01:41:57 T has a nirvana shirt and cherry red dyed hair,
01:42:00 and he's making a terrible fucking
01:42:03 Japanese V sign with his hand.
01:42:05 She, this girl J, I'll call her,
01:42:08 has a big ole nose ring and has like,
01:42:11 you know what, God, you'd have to see,
01:42:14 you would have to see this picture of her to understand.
01:42:17 But we won't share it with people.
01:42:19 Let me, in a minute I will post a picture,
01:42:21 but she has like, she has like, you know, like long,
01:42:25 it's gotta be like a silver wig,
01:42:27 and she's got like, like drawn on eyelashes
01:42:30 that like are, like go under her eye
01:42:32 to make it look like a big sparkly anime eye,
01:42:35 and she's got like, weird like blush face.
01:42:38 She's got a nose ring and she's like,
01:42:40 she's all pink and like spotty
01:42:41 and like looks like a fucking freak,
01:42:43 and like, and here's the rub, here's the rub.
01:42:45 There was another GoFundMe.
01:42:47 She's raised $439 on this campaign out of a goal of 2,000.
01:42:51 It took her two days to do.
01:42:53 It's not bad.
01:42:54 She, a year ago, she had another GoFundMe.
01:42:59 It was on a different account,
01:43:00 but I know because the picture of her
01:43:01 has her in the same kind of makeup.
01:43:03 And the GoFundMe was, help me cremate my cat.
01:43:08 And the goal was $200, and she raised 100 of it.
01:43:11 Damn it.
01:43:13 You don't like cremate half of it.
01:43:13 We didn't quite get it.
01:43:15 Had to bury Fluffy out in the backyard,
01:43:17 like a common, like a common beast.
01:43:20 Had to just eat her to make up that extra hundred dollars.
01:43:23 Here's why, here's why people of the world-
01:43:25 How to reinvest that cat meat
01:43:26 back into my personal economy.
01:43:28 This is why you don't want me donating these people.
01:43:32 Here's why, because in order for me to donate,
01:43:35 I'm gonna have to grill this person
01:43:38 and talk to the other side of the story,
01:43:40 AKA the mom, to find if this is really all stacking up.
01:43:43 Is there some bias here?
01:43:45 Like, I wanna know if this is actually
01:43:47 an injustice being done, or if it's just some like,
01:43:49 I mean, not to be judgy.
01:43:51 Maybe she's just a little emotional kind of a person.
01:43:54 Things have been taken a little bit out of control,
01:43:56 and the mom's not a legal monster.
01:43:57 You can never trust anything that a young person says ever.
01:44:01 Anyone under 25 is just a liar, period.
01:44:04 The word that stands out to me
01:44:06 in this description is yesterday.
01:44:10 She says that this exchange,
01:44:12 when she got into a car accident, called her mom,
01:44:14 and her mom said she was glad she got into a car accident,
01:44:17 happened yesterday.
01:44:18 That is such an outrageous claim, I just don't believe it.
01:44:22 I feel like maybe she was mad.
01:44:27 You know, I can see how you would say something
01:44:30 close enough to that that you could interpret.
01:44:33 If you were angrily, maybe she was angrily she crashed the car.
01:44:35 Maybe she said, well, you were being reckless or something,
01:44:38 or you're irresponsible, so you deserve to get in this car accident.
01:44:42 You brought this on yourself or something.
01:44:44 And she structured the way she makes this claim now
01:44:47 to make the worst possible interpretation possible.
01:44:50 She's phrasing it as like, my mom literally wants me to die,
01:44:55 which I don't believe.
01:44:56 I mean, maybe it's true, but I just don't,
01:44:58 I'm not going to take it away from you, but you know how I really...
01:45:00 I would find that much more shocking than if this person is just emotional
01:45:04 and got in a bad fight with her mom and then said,
01:45:06 oh, I'm going to go on, I'm going to make a go fund me,
01:45:08 and I'm going to move out with my boyfriend, T,
01:45:12 and we're going to move in with Mason, and I'm going to show you,
01:45:15 I'm going to show you that I can beg for money on the internet.
01:45:17 What just gets me is that there's so many people in the world
01:45:21 who love an excuse to like prop up people like this
01:45:26 without any kind of questions asked.
01:45:28 They see any kind of claims of victimhood,
01:45:30 and they're like, I am on board.
01:45:33 I'm on it. Here I go.
01:45:34 Wait, someone says that someone says they're in a bad situation,
01:45:37 someone says that a bad thing happened to them, I'm there.
01:45:40 I'm fucking there.
01:45:42 Comments, hope you guys are able...
01:45:45 Kiyoko says, hope you guys are able to get to a more healing environment soon.
01:45:49 Someone with a Japanese username says,
01:45:52 nice to help a local need or a smaller one.
01:45:54 I can relate with the one to get out of a situation like this.
01:45:57 Dawn says, no one should have to live through abuse.
01:46:00 Good luck, and I hope you heal quickly.
01:46:02 Harley says, I want you to feel safe and happy.
01:46:05 When I stream, I'll draw a picture of you
01:46:07 and tell my streamers to go donate to you.
01:46:09 Man, every since fucking Kavanaugh got into the Supreme Court.
01:46:12 It's been constant abuse, constant rapes of mother
01:46:15 against their children verbally and otherwise.
01:46:17 It's just a madhouse out here, guys.
01:46:19 Michi says, I am so glad that you're alive.
01:46:22 You're one of the best, sweetest people on Facebook and Deserve...
01:46:25 Okay, this person probably knows her in real life.
01:46:26 It sounds like it, yeah.
01:46:28 You know, so anyway, it's a bunch of bullshit.
01:46:30 What do you say, Jesse?
01:46:31 And the more I read of it, the less...
01:46:34 I went in there with an open mind and an open heart,
01:46:36 and the more of it I read, the closer it got.
01:46:38 So, you know, that's me.
01:46:40 That's me in a nutshell.
01:46:41 I think the...
01:46:43 Maybe this says more about me than it does about her.
01:46:46 The real way that I determine the limits of my charity
01:46:50 deep in the true dark pit of my hateful, vengeful soul
01:46:55 is just like, I won't give to anyone
01:47:00 whose story is less sad than my own.
01:47:03 That's a good move.
01:47:04 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:47:05 Absolutely.
01:47:06 If it's like I was paralyzed and I can't support my family,
01:47:09 well, okay, okay, I'll help this guy out,
01:47:11 because that sucks a lot.
01:47:13 But if it's just like someone like,
01:47:15 oh, my environment sucks and I'm trying to move away,
01:47:18 well, join the fucking club, you little brat, you know?
01:47:21 I've been trying to move away from my environment
01:47:22 for fucking 50 years.
01:47:28 You know what's interesting?
01:47:29 Not to make it overly political based on that,
01:47:31 but I think that that exact reasoning
01:47:33 is why a lot of people who are accused
01:47:35 of having white privilege have little sympathy for that
01:47:38 because they're like poor people and life sucks.
01:47:41 And they're just like, well,
01:47:43 while it is literally true that I have white privilege,
01:47:46 frankly, like I'd like to stop being, you know,
01:47:49 crushed under the boot heel of just life in general.
01:47:51 So yeah, well, you know what they say,
01:47:54 you can still lose on easy mode.
01:47:56 Indeed, indeed.
01:47:59 Yeah, that's always been my thoughts on it
01:48:01 or my feelings on it is because like,
01:48:04 you hear, you've got white privilege
01:48:07 because you're not black or you're not a woman
01:48:09 or you're not a minority.
01:48:10 But then when I sit down and think about it,
01:48:12 I think I've never met a black woman or minority in my life
01:48:16 whose life was worse than mine ever.
01:48:19 Sure.
01:48:20 I mean, my life has been harder
01:48:22 than any like black persons I've ever known.
01:48:24 So, fuck you.
01:48:25 Maybe I'm talking out my ass here.
01:48:28 What I will say about this is like, okay, like yeah,
01:48:31 if white privilege is a thing, I think,
01:48:33 but I would rather have, I think it seems to me
01:48:38 that like rich privilege is much better than white privilege.
01:48:41 And I would much rather, if I had to do that,
01:48:43 I would much rather.
01:48:44 It's a class thing.
01:48:45 I would much rather be rich than,
01:48:46 God damn it, let me finish my sentence.
01:48:48 I would much rather be rich than white.
01:48:50 I think that's a much bigger advantage.
01:48:52 As Mage said, it is, people point this out a lot,
01:48:55 but yeah, it's like the real division is class
01:48:58 as opposed to anything else.
01:48:59 It's like, I think it's big.
01:49:00 Don't you love it when you make a point so salient
01:49:02 that you are interrupted by fervent approval?
01:49:07 It's the time.
01:49:08 Fervent what?
01:49:09 Fervent approval.
01:49:10 Like everyone is just like jumping down your throat,
01:49:12 ah, shut up, you're absolutely right,
01:49:13 and I agree with you.
01:49:14 God damn, that's such a good point, yeah.
01:49:16 Why does this podcast always get so political?
01:49:18 Why do we always like to send into this?
01:49:21 I don't know.
01:49:22 Am I being political?
01:49:23 I just think it's-
01:49:24 I mean, slightly, I don't know.
01:49:25 I just think being rich is the greatest privilege of all.
01:49:28 I do believe white privilege is a thing.
01:49:30 I just, I don't think it's-
01:49:32 There's other privileges, some of which might trump it.
01:49:35 Some of which might trump it.
01:49:36 Except for rich and poor, like that's all it is.
01:49:38 That's the only real divide.
01:49:39 Oh shit, I said Trump.
01:49:39 I said Trump, it's political.
01:49:40 Don't ever say Trump.
01:49:42 No, I mean, it's all just a distraction
01:49:44 from the real privilege, which is wealth.
01:49:46 Wealth is the ultimate and only-
01:49:49 I, yeah, I would say that wealth
01:49:51 is probably the ultimate privilege, yeah.
01:49:53 Makes sense to me.
01:49:54 Wealth, it is-
01:49:55 Maybe a few centuries ago, it was nobility,
01:49:57 but we don't have that anymore.
01:49:58 The real privileges-
01:49:59 Nobody cares about that anymore.
01:50:00 That people take for granted are not like racial
01:50:03 or gender privileges or sex privileges.
01:50:06 The real privileges are like being born wealthy,
01:50:09 being beautiful, not having like abusive parents
01:50:13 or like having good parents is a privilege
01:50:15 that people take for granted.
01:50:16 Like those are the real privileges
01:50:18 that like people don't think of,
01:50:19 cause all they could think of,
01:50:20 everyone spends sort of like brainwashed into this,
01:50:22 oh, it's race and gender.
01:50:24 Everything is race and gender and sexuality.
01:50:27 Like no, it's there's other social factors
01:50:29 that determine privilege.
01:50:31 Yeah, I mean, race is a factor.
01:50:33 Like that does affect things.
01:50:35 Like you can't, you can be, you know,
01:50:38 excluded or marginalized on that basis.
01:50:41 It's just when you ignore everything else
01:50:43 just for something like that.
01:50:44 But it's, yeah.
01:50:45 It's like everybody's got blinders on
01:50:47 for race and gender and shit.
01:50:49 And they're ignoring that, you know,
01:50:50 if I can, you can have all the so-called
01:50:54 white straight male privilege in the world,
01:50:56 but if you grow up and your fucking,
01:50:58 your dad is an alcoholic
01:50:59 and he like throws you in the tool shed
01:51:01 and like whips you with a telephone cord,
01:51:03 then you're probably gonna grow up
01:51:05 with some disadvantages.
01:51:06 You're gonna be messed up in the head a little bit.
01:51:09 Yeah, yeah.
01:51:10 It's just cause those external things
01:51:11 are so easy to recognize and easy to group up in.
01:51:14 That's true.
01:51:15 They are, yeah, yeah.
01:51:16 They're very, they're very apparent.
01:51:18 You can't just make it sound right and be like,
01:51:18 you're clearly have like shitty parents.
01:51:20 You came from an abusive household, you.
01:51:23 But you can definitely say that there are
01:51:25 more abusive households for lower income people.
01:51:29 And you can also definitely say
01:51:31 that there are more minorities in lower income households.
01:51:35 Like you can say that it's all,
01:51:37 as long as you have self-awareness about what you're saying
01:51:40 and you're not just going around going,
01:51:41 ah, white people and fucking straight, you know.
01:51:44 I don't know.
01:51:45 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:51:46 I feel like I'm saying the correct thing.
01:51:48 I know that I would never say something that wasn't smart.
01:51:53 I know that, so.
01:51:54 Yeah, yeah.
01:51:55 Same, same.
01:51:56 I'm gonna jump on that bandwagon real quick.
01:51:59 I wanna say it quickly.
01:52:00 I think it's also important to have like a stable family home.
01:52:03 Like.
01:52:05 Yeah, that's what we're saying.
01:52:07 Yeah, yeah, it's a very important factor.
01:52:10 People very easily overlook, I think.
01:52:13 Yeah, I've said this a lot about,
01:52:14 or I've thought this a lot in my private dark moments
01:52:18 of bitter rage and resentment.
01:52:20 When I think about my good friend Digi, bro.
01:52:25 I just thought like Digi talks a lot about being privileged
01:52:29 and like the ultimate privilege that Digi has in his life
01:52:33 is having the family that he does,
01:52:35 the supportive mother and father
01:52:38 and the talented siblings.
01:52:40 Like I look at- For sure.
01:52:41 Say it with me and Ben, I think.
01:52:42 Yeah, like I look at the way like a person,
01:52:45 like Digi grew up, just having that family unit
01:52:48 that I never really had and I'm just like,
01:52:50 that's the ultimate privilege in life.
01:52:52 Like if I had had that,
01:52:54 I would be like a way contented person, probably.
01:52:59 Makes sense. I don't know.
01:53:00 It's just everyone thinks that the thing they didn't have
01:53:04 is the ultimate privilege.
01:53:05 Like no matter what you have.
01:53:06 You know, everyone kind of wants to-
01:53:07 It's always gonna be the crassest greener
01:53:09 on the other side of the fucking-
01:53:11 And everybody wants to be like, I did it myself.
01:53:14 They don't want, like there's an incentive to downplay
01:53:18 your own privileges, whatever they might be and so on.
01:53:20 But nobody does it all by themselves.
01:53:23 Absolutely.
01:53:24 You know, as the other village people said.
01:53:27 You know what is-
01:53:28 You know what is the-
01:53:29 He does it all by himself.
01:53:31 I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf.
01:53:34 You got privilege because you were born white
01:53:38 and some would make you rhyme.
01:53:40 And that is not all right.
01:53:45 We did it, Reddit.
01:53:47 Hang on, Munchy was jumping in.
01:53:48 I wanted to hear his perspective, I mean,
01:53:50 if you wanted to share.
01:53:52 All I was gonna say is that I don't disagree
01:53:55 with any I owe to what's happened here,
01:53:57 but as an SJW myself, I feel like everyone knows this
01:54:01 and everyone also does still talk about wealth.
01:54:05 In fact, I would say that I probably hear that more
01:54:07 as a thing than the caricature of everyone's
01:54:11 just fucking crazy about jumping on white people
01:54:14 for white privilege.
01:54:15 I almost exclusively hear social political class thing.
01:54:18 I might just be the bubble that I'm in,
01:54:20 but I feel like we might not be giving people enough credit.
01:54:23 I hear a lot, I hear Reyes talked about it a lot more.
01:54:27 I hear race and gender talked about a lot more than class,
01:54:30 but maybe I'm just not watching the right YouTube videos.
01:54:32 Yeah, that is true, Nate.
01:54:34 I think the people who are talking about race and stuff
01:54:36 are just more vocal, but there is definitely,
01:54:38 I mean, you look at like a lot of like.
01:54:41 Look at Tom's like Communist Tumblr,
01:54:43 and then you'll see.
01:54:44 Exactly, my lord and savior.
01:54:45 None of this is to say, none of this is to say that like,
01:54:49 I don't want this to be interpreted as like,
01:54:50 I think the world's going crazy
01:54:52 and everyone's a crazy SJW who's obsessed with race.
01:54:55 I think by and large, most people are sane
01:54:57 and have the ability to make logical distinctions
01:55:01 in their minds.
01:55:02 I mean, we're definitely not the only ones
01:55:03 that have these ideas.
01:55:05 I think we're the only ones thinking
01:55:06 about this galaxy brain level stuff here.
01:55:09 I think everyone knows we're just fucking
01:55:10 stuck in the fucking dirt.
01:55:12 That is the one good thing about living in a world
01:55:14 where everyone has gone fucking crazy
01:55:16 and is mentally retarded is that I can say
01:55:20 just the most basic obvious shit
01:55:22 and people will think it's smart
01:55:24 when really it's just in the whole world.
01:55:25 It's really easy to look intellectual online
01:55:28 when you do that shit.
01:55:30 Yeah, like all you have to say is that like,
01:55:32 oh, you know, it's probably bad to hate
01:55:35 other human beings for no fucking reason at all.
01:55:38 And people go, oh my God, that's like the most,
01:55:40 that's the most salient fucking thing I've heard all week.
01:55:43 I, that's, I feel that way too,
01:55:46 but I never knew how to put it into words before.
01:55:49 The bar is set so low now for being smart.
01:55:55 That's true.
01:55:56 That's true.
01:55:57 You know, that's an interesting effect.
01:55:59 You know, does anyone else notice this
01:56:01 and just think about like their own videos
01:56:04 or the videos that are popular
01:56:05 and just think like, Jesus Christ,
01:56:06 this is such a basic fucking point.
01:56:09 Oh yeah.
01:56:09 The point of me making this or watching this.
01:56:12 Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm just an asshole
01:56:15 in my own head, right?
01:56:17 Because I feel and almost,
01:56:21 I feel almost always, like almost anything that I see,
01:56:26 I feel like is at least on some level,
01:56:29 some basic shit that I could have said
01:56:31 and I could have done and I'm not impressed by that.
01:56:33 Oh my God, you know what this reminds me of?
01:56:34 This extends to almost everything
01:56:36 that I see and experience in life.
01:56:38 Very much, especially on the YouTube landscape.
01:56:41 But I watched a movie yesterday, The Big Short,
01:56:46 which is this movie.
01:56:46 Oh, I love that movie.
01:56:47 I love that movie so much.
01:56:49 I like that movie.
01:56:49 It basically, it's explaining.
01:56:52 Is it about my day?
01:56:53 It's a dramatic reenactment
01:56:54 of like the housing crisis bubble collapse
01:56:56 in 2007 or whatever.
01:56:58 And okay, what was interesting about it,
01:57:00 this was honestly kind of insulting,
01:57:03 but I get why they did it.
01:57:04 They talk about how like, blah, blah, blah,
01:57:06 like it's a movie about banking, right?
01:57:08 So they're like, oh, CDOs, IRAs, blah, blah, blah.
01:57:11 You obviously don't know what that is,
01:57:13 which is true, no one does.
01:57:14 And that's kind of the point of the movie
01:57:15 that no one gets it.
01:57:16 So to explain these technical things
01:57:19 and use these like silly metaphors to get it across,
01:57:22 they'll be like, we're now cutting to,
01:57:25 what's Margot Robbie?
01:57:26 So it's Selena Gomez to explain to us at a poker table,
01:57:31 so that your fucking retarded ape-ass brain
01:57:35 will understand what's going on.
01:57:36 And yes, like it's true.
01:57:38 I needed a baby metaphor example
01:57:40 so that I could get it, all right?
01:57:41 But I didn't need you to pretend
01:57:43 that I'm only gonna listen to Margot fucking Robbie
01:57:46 sitting in a bathtub.
01:57:47 Like, frankly, that's more of a distraction
01:57:49 because I just wanna have sex with this creature.
01:57:51 I'm not interested in listening to her talk about this shit.
01:57:53 So I wish it was like a fucking,
01:57:55 I don't know, fun teacher or something.
01:57:57 It was annoying.
01:57:58 I thought it was, I don't know,
01:58:00 kind of funny in a way, the way they did that movie.
01:58:02 They were definitely trying to be glib with it.
01:58:04 I felt, I don't know, I felt a little pander too,
01:58:07 unintended, like more than they thought they were doing.
01:58:10 But it was a good movie.
01:58:11 But like the point is, it's just like,
01:58:13 I feel like that's kind of like what YouTube videos do.
01:58:15 And like, I made my video about Huey's Law or whatever.
01:58:18 It's just about taking whatever fucking idea you have.
01:58:20 How about something like, I don't know, it's okay to be gay.
01:58:23 And you put in like a big, elaborate music video
01:58:26 where like, oh my God, can you believe it's like
01:58:28 actually not a problem to be gay?
01:58:30 You make a big production.
01:58:32 You add like some sad music things
01:58:35 as you talk into a camera about.
01:58:37 You talk about, you're making a video
01:58:41 talking about how like the new Ghostbusters
01:58:44 isn't as bad as everyone says it is.
01:58:46 And then at the end, and then you suddenly,
01:58:48 and then you suddenly cut away to like a new angle
01:58:51 and you bring in some sad music and you go on a tangent
01:58:53 about how you understand depression
01:58:55 because last year you too attempted suicide
01:58:59 and it was a really rough time in your life
01:59:01 and you were in a bad place, but you're better now.
01:59:02 And thank you to all my viewers.
01:59:04 And thank you to all my viewers
01:59:05 for watching my content and supporting me.
01:59:07 And then your Patreon quadruples overnight.
01:59:10 Yes, I don't even disagree that these points are valuable
01:59:14 and can be said and it makes all the,
01:59:16 there's probably lots of people who still need to hear it.
01:59:18 I just hate it.
01:59:20 I just hate it when I feel talked down to
01:59:23 and it's like it's so little substance at the end of the day.
01:59:26 You take a thought or a feeling that you have
01:59:28 and you just dumb it down and chip all the nuance off of it
01:59:32 and then you wrap it up in pandering
01:59:35 and you fucking, you throw it out there
01:59:37 and the dumber it is, the more simplistic and moronic it is,
01:59:41 the more people will fucking flock to it
01:59:43 and hail you as the same.
01:59:44 The more basic it is, the more relatable and comprehensible,
01:59:48 the more people will latch on to what you're saying.
01:59:50 Yeah, and if you-
01:59:52 It's literally lowest common denominator.
01:59:54 And if you use the word mental health at any point,
01:59:57 then you automatically, a million views
02:00:00 and everyone thinks you're the best person who ever lived
02:00:02 because- Yeah, yeah, yeah, everyone's like, I too,
02:00:05 feel bad sometimes. I too feel bad sometimes.
02:00:06 I understand mental health issues.
02:00:08 I too have social anxiety and depression.
02:00:12 Like, who doesn't have social anxiety and depression?
02:00:16 Am I right gamers?
02:00:17 I just like, I hear the words mental health anymore
02:00:21 and just like, my eyes just instinctively roll
02:00:24 so fucking far into the back of my head.
02:00:27 I'm so sick of it.
02:00:28 You know what it is?
02:00:29 It's not like mental health isn't a real thing.
02:00:32 No, I could agree with all of it,
02:00:33 but I would still be so fucking sick of it.
02:00:35 You know what was interesting?
02:00:36 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:00:37 There was something interesting-
02:00:38 Wait, wait, wait, let me say what I'm saying.
02:00:39 Like, what it is, is it's the same thing as charity.
02:00:42 It's the bad eggs that are asking for charity
02:00:45 that don't really need it.
02:00:46 They're abusing people's goodwill.
02:00:47 It's lay people fucking armchair diagnosing
02:00:51 and self-diagnosing a bunch of bullshit
02:00:53 has just made discussion about mental health issues.
02:00:56 It has poisoned the well and turned it into a thing
02:00:59 that I don't feel that I should take seriously,
02:01:01 don't want to listen to on the internet.
02:01:03 All of the scummiest, most like narcissistic,
02:01:06 terrible people that I've ever met in my life
02:01:09 have also just so happened to be
02:01:11 those mental health fucking people
02:01:13 who are always constantly talking about their depression
02:01:16 and their bipolar and their manic fucking what's it.
02:01:18 And it's like, the more people talk about mental health issues,
02:01:22 the more they think they can get away
02:01:24 with being a slimy fucking piece of shit.
02:01:27 Yeah, it's like drama, you know,
02:01:30 the people that say that they don't want drama,
02:01:32 the people that say that the most are the most drama-prone.
02:01:35 Listen to this.
02:01:36 Because they're thinking about drama the most.
02:01:39 I suppose that's true.
02:01:40 So the other day, I was watching a PewDiePie video
02:01:42 and it was like his news show or whatever
02:01:44 and he just brings up that it was in the news
02:01:47 that, you know, Superwoman on YouTube,
02:01:49 she's like one of the biggest people,
02:01:50 okay, Lindsey Singer, whatever her name is, Superwoman.
02:01:54 She made a video and I brought it up here.
02:01:56 Look at this video, it's called I'll See You Soon.
02:01:59 Okay, it's an announcement that she's like leaving,
02:02:02 that she's gonna-
02:02:03 Is she taking a mental health break?
02:02:04 That's effectively what it boils down to, yes.
02:02:07 And like, okay, that's fine, that makes sense.
02:02:10 Let me, can I make a prediction?
02:02:12 PewDiePie's point on this was like,
02:02:14 he was basically like, why was this necessary?
02:02:17 Why do you need to like make a big production,
02:02:19 just leave?
02:02:21 And I mean, this is coming from a guy
02:02:22 who's been through the fucking ringer
02:02:24 and has been squeezed and, you know,
02:02:26 manhandled by the fucking legacy media,
02:02:29 trying to fuck him up and call him, you know,
02:02:31 an all right Nazi and all this shit.
02:02:33 And so he's been through the scandals
02:02:35 and he is fine, whatever.
02:02:38 And he's just like, what's the big, why are you doing this?
02:02:40 Like just leave, make a humble announcement
02:02:43 and then come back.
02:02:44 Why you got a virtue signal about all this meant?
02:02:46 You know why?
02:02:47 You know why?
02:02:48 The answer's obvious.
02:02:49 So that your Patreon will quadruple overnight.
02:02:50 That's it, it's easy.
02:02:52 It's so easy to just throw out some words like this
02:02:55 and get, you know, even if you don't have a Patreon,
02:02:57 love, support, attention, any of that shit.
02:03:01 I don't look, look, okay, okay.
02:03:02 I don't want to vilify this person because-
02:03:05 I have to watch the video, so I have no idea what she says.
02:03:06 I was being, I was being salty one time
02:03:09 about this kind of thing that I'm being salty about right now.
02:03:11 People like, I mean, it wasn't about mental health
02:03:14 specifically, but it was about people using buzzwords
02:03:16 and saying the right thing to get sympathy,
02:03:19 to get, you know, to get, you know, goodwill to,
02:03:22 and you say the right thing and your Patreon
02:03:24 can quadruple overnight because what, for various reasons.
02:03:27 I was being salty about this and a guy on my discord,
02:03:32 AJ Shoup, AJ Shoups, who I think you know,
02:03:35 he's an RFCK guy, he said, and this stuck with me,
02:03:38 he said that, well, you know, like success is,
02:03:41 what is it, like opportunity?
02:03:42 It's opportunity plus action.
02:03:45 And so like, the way you succeed is when an opportunity
02:03:48 comes up, you take it, and if you don't,
02:03:50 you're just like denying yourself success.
02:03:52 And so for the, to not, to not do, like if a time,
02:03:56 if the time becomes ripe that you have the opportunity
02:03:59 to say something that will quadruple your Patreon,
02:04:01 why wouldn't you say it?
02:04:02 Exactly.
02:04:03 So like, I can't even be mad or vilify these people
02:04:06 and I don't think that they're bad for doing this.
02:04:08 Look, just look at this real quick.
02:04:08 I put just posted another image,
02:04:10 this YouTube spill channel, whatever,
02:04:12 literally makes a video called Superwoman Leaves YouTube
02:04:15 teaches everyone a lesson.
02:04:17 And you can see a snippet from her description of the video
02:04:20 that says, mental health is important, y'all.
02:04:24 And I'm just,
02:04:25 And just the fact that it's become,
02:04:26 And I'm just,
02:04:27 The fact that like sincerity and like,
02:04:30 like exposing like your real feelings and sadness
02:04:33 has become like a formula for money and success
02:04:36 is like so scary and converted.
02:04:39 Cause like,
02:04:40 Yeah.
02:04:41 I think about doing, like you see these videos
02:04:44 of YouTubers where they come out and say,
02:04:45 this is what I've been dealing with.
02:04:46 And this is, you know, how much my life sucks.
02:04:49 And this is what I've been thinking.
02:04:51 And like I sit around and I think about making videos
02:04:55 like that all the time.
02:04:56 Like I think about, you know,
02:04:59 I wish I had the courage to be a little more open and honest
02:05:03 and say, so this is what's going on with me.
02:05:05 And this is what I'm dealing with.
02:05:06 And, and just, you know, but like,
02:05:09 it's scary for me.
02:05:12 And I feel like it's supposed to be scary.
02:05:14 And if it's not scary for you,
02:05:16 if you do it so much that you,
02:05:18 that it's like normal and it's what you do for money,
02:05:20 then you've perverted it and made it that much harder
02:05:24 for other people who might actually, I don't know.
02:05:27 It's just shitty people cheap and everything good.
02:05:29 It's what it comes down to, like we were saying.
02:05:31 Like stoicism, stoicism itself is not rewarded
02:05:35 in today's like culture.
02:05:37 It like advertising one's, one's, you know,
02:05:40 victory status.
02:05:41 That's what's rewarding.
02:05:42 Yeah.
02:05:42 And I feel, I think I'm a kind of stoic guy
02:05:45 who like hides his pain.
02:05:47 Yeah.
02:05:48 And I feel like I have,
02:05:49 and I feel like I'm punished for that.
02:05:51 I feel like I have failed to capitalize on.
02:05:53 I mean, it's not capitalizing on the market opportunity
02:05:56 that the millennial culture has presented to us, I guess.
02:05:59 I think.
02:05:59 I can feel that, yeah.
02:06:00 You guys are giving too much credit
02:06:04 to practicing bad, literally bad mental health practices.
02:06:08 It's not cool to never speak to your friends
02:06:12 about your problems or to pretend
02:06:14 that you don't have any.
02:06:15 Talking to your friends is different from like.
02:06:19 I agree with you a bunch.
02:06:20 Making.
02:06:20 But it's also not cool to turn it
02:06:22 into like a thing for profit.
02:06:24 And just use your fucking-
02:06:25 Yeah, no, I'm not saying it is.
02:06:27 It's a middle ground, yeah.
02:06:28 I'm just saying, I guess I felt like the winds
02:06:33 of the conversation.
02:06:35 We wouldn't want to-
02:06:35 Everyone just, you know, everyone deals with stuff
02:06:37 so just no one should talk about it.
02:06:39 I think it's a good place.
02:06:40 Look, when I said that thing about being stoic
02:06:41 and hiding my pain, I didn't mean it as like,
02:06:43 I'm better than these people that are open about it.
02:06:46 But I agree with you.
02:06:46 We're like, encourage a type of overcompensation of it.
02:06:49 Look, you guys know-
02:06:50 I don't even, like I was saying before,
02:06:51 I can't even be mad.
02:06:53 Yeah.
02:06:54 I want my instinct is to be mad
02:06:55 because I feel like people that get this kind of support
02:06:59 and sympathy, they're capitalizing on something
02:07:01 that I just can't, either I don't know how to do it
02:07:05 or I can't bring myself to do it
02:07:06 or I just haven't done it
02:07:07 or it's just not applicable to me or something, whatever.
02:07:09 It's something that I don't have.
02:07:11 It feels like-
02:07:11 My instinct is to be salty and mad,
02:07:14 but I can't actually pinpoint what is being done wrong here.
02:07:18 Unless like, if this is being done cynically
02:07:21 and like calculatedly, then I would say, ew, gross.
02:07:24 But I don't know that.
02:07:26 I don't know anything.
02:07:27 I think because it feels disingenuous
02:07:29 when you capitalize on something like,
02:07:34 something that's so personal and sincere
02:07:36 and like that's giving you a hard time
02:07:38 and you're sharing it with people
02:07:41 and it's such a very sort of like a vulnerable moment
02:07:45 and people then capitalize on this moment
02:07:48 that it doesn't feel sincere, it doesn't feel good.
02:07:53 I'm not saying everybody does this,
02:07:55 but some people literally whore out their depression.
02:07:57 Yeah, yeah, the fact.
02:07:59 Yeah, the fact.
02:08:00 I am in all support of people sharing.
02:08:05 Like different people deal with different things
02:08:07 differently, a lot of differences.
02:08:09 But like, you know, so like I have a few friends
02:08:13 that do come to me and talk to me about stuff
02:08:16 and I'm more than happy to help.
02:08:17 I do that too sometimes with friends,
02:08:19 but for the most part, when the big things happen,
02:08:22 I usually don't share it with people,
02:08:24 but basically to vent sometimes it's good
02:08:28 and therapeutic and I am all supported with sharing and stuff.
02:08:30 But when people, like you said, whore out their depression,
02:08:34 that's when I draw the line, I guess.
02:08:38 What makes it weird is not, no individual case
02:08:42 is like horrible and like, you know,
02:08:46 I can't point to an individual case and be like,
02:08:48 oh, this person's bad, this person's being a whore or whatever.
02:08:51 But the fact that it is like a recognizable pattern,
02:08:54 like a widespread recognizable pattern and for success
02:08:58 is dystopian and horrifying.
02:09:00 I think these people who, you know,
02:09:02 do these sort of things makes it harder for people
02:09:05 to genuinely share their problems with other people.
02:09:08 Yeah, that's what I was saying exactly.
02:09:10 Yeah, because, you know, like you just wanna be honest
02:09:13 with people and share your experiences and whatnot,
02:09:15 but then like you're afraid that you'll get good compared
02:09:18 or like, oh, you're just whoring for attention
02:09:20 or you're just trying to be a victim.
02:09:22 You don't wanna be lumped in with YouTubers.
02:09:25 It's like there's such a stigma
02:09:27 because of what YouTubers have been.
02:09:30 It's like these narcissistic like,
02:09:33 yeah, this is me and look at me.
02:09:35 Like I don't wanna be that.
02:09:36 No one wants to be that
02:09:38 and you'd hate to get compared to those people.
02:09:41 So yeah. I do think some of this just kind of makes sense
02:09:45 with the widespreadedness of like us kind of all whoring
02:09:49 ourselves out to varying degrees on social media.
02:09:53 You know, I've always described or I've recently described
02:09:55 like being a YouTuber as like selling your personality
02:09:58 as a service or like whatever, you know, that kind of shit.
02:10:00 So like you really are exposing yourself
02:10:03 more probably mentally and like,
02:10:05 cause people like I really try to keep a wall here,
02:10:08 but if I was like a daily vlogger
02:10:10 and was just putting like everything I had
02:10:12 on the internet and stuff
02:10:13 and like people could see everything I do
02:10:15 and they can be like, oh, that's shit.
02:10:17 Then like that'll mean a lot more
02:10:18 than if I like edit a video, it's not funny.
02:10:21 And people are like, well, that sucked
02:10:22 cause it's not like me, they're attacking.
02:10:24 It's like a product.
02:10:25 So maybe that breakdown of that wall
02:10:28 is what's leaving people more mentally vulnerable
02:10:31 or something to this stuff.
02:10:32 I don't know.
02:10:33 I've felt like less and less comfortable
02:10:35 with that kind of stuff.
02:10:36 And like, I mean, I don't do social media anymore at all.
02:10:41 And like, I haven't been on this podcast for over a year.
02:10:45 Like, I'm at the point where just like,
02:10:49 like chipping off parts of my personality
02:10:51 and parts of my experience to like give to the world.
02:10:55 It's not fun, it's exposing and it's scary.
02:10:58 And I don't know if I really like it.
02:11:01 It kind of makes a day job seem like a nice thing.
02:11:03 Yeah, it absolutely does.
02:11:04 You don't have to sell your soul.
02:11:06 Put me in a comic book store
02:11:08 and let me like work behind a register.
02:11:09 I feel like I'd almost be happier.
02:11:12 I don't know.
02:11:13 And now I'm doing it.
02:11:14 Now I'm doing the thing that I was just
02:11:16 fucking talking about.
02:11:18 Cause now I'm fucking, so you just can't,
02:11:20 it's like a trap, you know, you fucking shit.
02:11:22 Yeah, I guess that's true.
02:11:24 Well, I'll tell you what team.
02:11:26 How about we go to those questions?
02:11:27 How about we go to those questions?
02:11:28 Wait, no?
02:11:29 I have, you know,
02:11:30 I want to say, I don't usually do this,
02:11:33 but I actually came into this episode with notes
02:11:35 and like top, I have a list sitting in front of me
02:11:38 on topics that I wanted to talk about.
02:11:41 I never have this, but I have this this time.
02:11:42 And we only got to two of them.
02:11:44 And I'm like, damn it.
02:11:45 I had actual stuff that I wanted.
02:11:47 But what are we going for?
02:11:48 Like two hours now?
02:11:49 Yeah, a little over two hours.
02:11:50 Yep.
02:11:51 Man.
02:11:52 So, okay.
02:11:53 Well, I'll leave some of these for later.
02:11:55 However, there's one.
02:11:56 Before we go on the questions, I have one thing.
02:11:58 I feel like I have, I have sensed a sort of confusion
02:12:02 or a sort of widespread false belief
02:12:05 that I live with at Digi's house with like Tom does.
02:12:09 And I just want to say no.
02:12:11 Is that true?
02:12:11 I just want to put that.
02:12:12 Where did that come from?
02:12:13 Who said that?
02:12:14 I feel like I've, I don't know where I saw it.
02:12:16 It might have been on like the PCP fan discord or something.
02:12:19 Or some, I don't know, I feel like that one time.
02:12:22 Maybe it was, yeah, maybe people got the impression
02:12:24 because I've been on IM Games.
02:12:26 But I feel like some people believe
02:12:27 that I live with you guys at Digi's house.
02:12:30 And no, I have my own place.
02:12:32 And it's a real cool guy, so cease the bullying.
02:12:35 I'm way cool guys.
02:12:36 Yeah, I'm a cool guy.
02:12:39 And I don't know.
02:12:40 Okay, I guess there's really nothing else to say about that.
02:12:42 We're at Digi House.
02:12:45 Did I mention that this is,
02:12:46 people stopped calling it Monkey House?
02:12:48 Oh, you did mention it.
02:12:48 They call it, they call it Wheel House now
02:12:50 and their name sucks.
02:12:51 I refuse, I refuse.
02:12:52 Yeah, fuck it.
02:12:53 It's Monkey House.
02:12:54 Bring it back, Monkey House.
02:12:56 Okay, well, never, sorry,
02:12:58 that was a bit of a dead-end tangent,
02:12:59 but at least it's out there now.
02:13:01 You got our announcement, you're okay.
02:13:03 All right, let's go to these questions here.
02:13:05 Wait, wait, oh man, I feel like we can squeeze
02:13:10 one more Monday joke in here somewhere.
02:13:12 I just gotta fucking think of it.
02:13:13 Hey Garfield, what's tomorrow?
02:13:17 Oh, John, you know what the worst mental health thing
02:13:24 of all is?
02:13:26 Mondays, okay, there we fucking go.
02:13:29 Okay, I got that, here's my YouTube video confession
02:13:34 for all my fans.
02:13:35 Sorry I haven't posted in a while,
02:13:36 but guys, it's Monday and I just can't do it anymore.
02:13:43 What do they say about like,
02:13:44 what's that thing like in winter you get depressed
02:13:46 is like seasonal affective disorder, SAD?
02:13:50 I think it's SAD, well Garfield's got MAD,
02:13:53 Monday affective disorder.
02:13:56 People, people.
02:13:56 His mental health just plummets.
02:13:58 We need to take mental health seriously, people.
02:14:01 If Garfield was in a coma.
02:14:03 Oh my God, he said what I feel,
02:14:04 but I could never put into words.
02:14:06 I have to fucking give him the cash.
02:14:08 If we don't start taking it seriously,
02:14:10 Garfield is gonna shoot up a school,
02:14:13 and you know what they're gonna say in school?
02:14:16 And it'll be your fault for not supporting
02:14:18 Endless Desk for saying this right now.
02:14:22 All school shootings happen on Monday.
02:14:27 I was gonna say, school shootings are just
02:14:30 a Monday thing, I mean, I assume.
02:14:32 Well then obviously the way to end school shootings,
02:14:35 every single one, all Mondays.
02:14:37 Yeah, the way to end school shootings
02:14:39 is to abolish Mondays.
02:14:41 Garfield's united with those.
02:14:43 Hey, quick question, if Garfield was in a coma,
02:14:45 let's say for three months, and then he wakes up,
02:14:48 and he wakes up on a Monday,
02:14:51 but nobody tells him it's a Monday.
02:14:52 Would he know it's a Monday, even if nobody tells him?
02:14:55 Would he somehow know?
02:14:56 I'm gonna say he would because he always gets the splort
02:15:00 on Monday.
02:15:01 What's the splort?
02:15:02 The splort is a pie that seemingly comes from nowhere,
02:15:06 a hand with a pie in it that hits Garfield in the face,
02:15:09 and the sound effect is always splort.
02:15:13 So somehow, he would get squirted, he would know.
02:15:17 He could deduce it.
02:15:19 I think he's got a sense for it now,
02:15:20 and he would very quickly realize that it was Monday
02:15:23 because like pianos would fall on him from the sky and stuff.
02:15:26 What a tragic belief system where he's doomed one seventh
02:15:29 of his entire life to be sheer agony and misery.
02:15:32 It's not, it's not belief.
02:15:34 This is not like the secret kind of like,
02:15:36 like his believing makes it so.
02:15:38 This is like, like the universe conspires
02:15:40 against the Monday.
02:15:41 Yeah, and this is like a scientific law of the universe
02:15:43 in the Garfield canon.
02:15:44 Mondays will get you.
02:15:46 I guess that makes sense.
02:15:48 All right.
02:15:49 It's like, it's on every Monday, it's like he gets hit
02:15:51 with Chris Chan Sonichu's Cursier Hamehawai.
02:15:55 Yeah.
02:15:56 Yeah.
02:15:58 Okay, let's get to a question here.
02:16:00 Oh, so we're going to the questions.
02:16:02 This isn't an actual question,
02:16:03 but here's a little sound bite from one spar.
02:16:06 Listen up.
02:16:07 Here we go.
02:16:09 Hello.
02:16:11 It's time for voicemails.
02:16:14 Yeah.
02:16:16 Oh, I like that.
02:16:17 Voicemail intro.
02:16:18 Sick.
02:16:19 That is nice.
02:16:20 Oh, that's good.
02:16:21 It's a good idea.
02:16:23 Yeah, okay.
02:16:23 It was good actually.
02:16:24 I like having like a stick.
02:16:25 It makes sense to have a little jingle for a segment.
02:16:28 Yeah, way to go once, Bar.
02:16:29 And by the way, please finish that fucking
02:16:31 a DeVoo game shit.
02:16:33 Okay.
02:16:34 Okay.
02:16:35 Finish that fucking DeVoo game shit.
02:16:38 I can't remember the name of it.
02:16:39 It's long.
02:16:39 I always forget.
02:16:40 Autonomous.
02:16:41 Autonomous.
02:16:42 Yeah.
02:16:43 Finish that let's play so I can watch it.
02:16:44 Or Ben, whatever.
02:16:45 I don't care.
02:16:46 One of you.
02:16:47 All right.
02:16:48 Next one.
02:16:48 This is from, ah, here we go.
02:16:49 This is from Radcon Israeli Defense Four.
02:16:54 So like four, you know, like the numbers.
02:16:56 Okay.
02:16:57 So let's see who we've got waiting for us in this country.
02:17:02 Radcon Four.
02:17:03 Radcon Israeli Defense Fours.
02:17:06 All I need to do is pretend that you're Jewish
02:17:09 and the Israeli government will send you a ticket
02:17:12 to Israel for free.
02:17:14 So all you need to do is find a way to pretend you're Jewish.
02:17:18 Digi, Victor, they already look Jewish.
02:17:21 So you guys can just get away with that.
02:17:23 Ben, Nate, you're Polish.
02:17:25 That's basically Jewish already.
02:17:27 Rest of you fags have to get circumcised.
02:17:29 That's it.
02:17:30 Bye.
02:17:32 I'm just saying, if we could somehow
02:17:33 trick the Israeli government to fund our trip
02:17:37 for Radcon Israeli Defense Fours,
02:17:41 that would be pretty good.
02:17:43 I doubt they're including return tickets, are they?
02:17:46 Radcon Four Israel.
02:17:49 Oh, God.
02:17:50 Do they not include return tickets
02:17:52 when you take this trip?
02:17:53 Yeah, you can only go, but you can't leave.
02:17:56 I mean, it kind of makes sense.
02:17:57 The goal is still a friend.
02:17:58 We'll go for free and kickstart the return flight.
02:18:01 It's like, hey, hey, everyone, I'm doing a go fund me.
02:18:04 Help me escape from this abusive environment in Israel
02:18:07 where they won't let me leave.
02:18:10 Okay.
02:18:11 You guys know how you can't ever choose what you remember.
02:18:15 So there's going to be some wayward thoughts there
02:18:18 for some reason are stuck in your mind forever.
02:18:20 I used to watch a ton of conspiracy theory YouTubers
02:18:23 and there's this one phrase that stuck with me.
02:18:26 Whenever I want to ratchet up things to 11,
02:18:28 I think to myself to the phrase,
02:18:31 what happens when the no fly list becomes the no leave list?
02:18:35 And that's like past 11, past 10.
02:18:38 That's like the top of the food chain.
02:18:40 Like, you know, like, let's get this party started.
02:18:42 Let's kick this from the no fly list,
02:18:44 the no leave list real quick here.
02:18:47 The no fly list to the no leave list.
02:18:49 It's like, it's like you've got your stereo.
02:18:51 You go one to eight, like pretty good.
02:18:53 Click it up to nine.
02:18:54 It's like, oh, let's go a little higher.
02:18:55 Next one, no fly list.
02:18:57 You're like, that's pretty good.
02:18:58 But we could go one further.
02:19:00 No leave list.
02:19:01 Yeah, yeah, exact right.
02:19:03 You like, you get on the plane to leave
02:19:05 and right before it gets off the runway,
02:19:08 Master Hand plucks it out of the fucking air
02:19:11 and puts it in a bag somewhere.
02:19:13 That's the hand of Trump.
02:19:14 A marble bag.
02:19:14 It is the hand of Trump.
02:19:16 A big orange Master Hand.
02:19:19 Oh no, but his hands are tiny.
02:19:21 That's the joke, so they have to.
02:19:22 Oh, that's true.
02:19:23 So it can't be a Master Hand.
02:19:25 It'd be Crazy Hand.
02:19:27 No, oh no, oh no.
02:19:29 My Master Hand joke turned into a Trump joke.
02:19:32 No, I hate when that happens.
02:19:33 Please donate to my GoFundMe.
02:19:35 No way, you're gonna get a show on Comedy Central
02:19:36 in a couple minutes.
02:19:37 So that I can get away from my jokes becoming Trump jokes.
02:19:41 The good news is you're about to be, yeah,
02:19:42 much like I said, given a Comedy Central special
02:19:44 based on that one Trump joke.
02:19:46 So, you know.
02:19:47 Yeah, all I have to do is remove all the humor
02:19:49 and punch lines from it.
02:19:52 All right, we got a voicemail from Mr. Bones,
02:19:54 who I think we've gotten in the past.
02:19:56 Let's go.
02:19:58 I recently rewatched the Digi's lecture on The Dick Show.
02:20:01 And I know that some of you have been familiar enough
02:20:03 with the story and what was going on with it.
02:20:06 And considering that it seems that Jess
02:20:08 is now back on some of these podcasts,
02:20:09 I thought it'd be worth asking,
02:20:11 are any of you still keeping up with The Dick Show?
02:20:14 And if so, what do you make of the continuing narrative?
02:20:17 It feels like in the year since that lecture was released,
02:20:21 there's been so much hot goss to come out down the pipes
02:20:24 that it kind of feels like a whole new lecture is necessary.
02:20:28 And I know that PCP lectures are, you know,
02:20:32 there's a lot of competition for what would be put in them.
02:20:34 But my question is, would Digi or any of the rest of you
02:20:37 ever consider doing the hot goss too?
02:20:40 Well, it would have to be Digi to do it.
02:20:43 To be honest, I watched a bunch of,
02:20:47 I watched like maybe half of the,
02:20:50 I was gonna say best guy ever,
02:20:51 biggest problem in the universe.
02:20:53 And I didn't finish it.
02:20:55 By the time I was there, like, you know, the whole,
02:20:58 the thing happened, they split up, Dick Show started.
02:21:01 I watched a little bit of The Dick Show,
02:21:03 mostly just like incidentally,
02:21:04 when Digi happened to be watching it,
02:21:06 and I happened to be in the room.
02:21:08 I didn't, so I haven't actually seen that much.
02:21:10 I haven't kept up, most of what I know about it
02:21:12 comes from Digi and that lecture.
02:21:14 That's me, that's where I'm at with that.
02:21:16 So no, I haven't been keeping up with it.
02:21:17 Has anybody else been keeping up with it at all?
02:21:19 No, I think when he did the lecture,
02:21:21 I was, I was, you know, all caught up.
02:21:23 And right around the end of the time,
02:21:24 I fell off the train of pretty much watching anything.
02:21:27 To me, like the lecture kind of like put the capstone
02:21:30 on my interest and like, I can let this go now.
02:21:33 I wish you'd given us some examples.
02:21:34 I have no idea.
02:21:35 I guess I wish Digi was here.
02:21:36 I have no idea what it was about anymore.
02:21:39 The goss itself just got so fucking tiresome to me
02:21:42 and boring after like, yeah.
02:21:44 It's like, like now, like,
02:21:45 I think I see tweets from mysterious every now and then
02:21:49 it just kind of seems like a lot of sort of past,
02:21:52 I don't know, like a stereo is funny,
02:21:54 so I don't want to shit on him.
02:21:55 But like a lot of what I see is just kind of like
02:21:57 passive aggressive, like look at this,
02:21:59 look at this new really stupid thing Maddox is doing.
02:22:02 What an idiot.
02:22:03 He's just embarrassing myself.
02:22:05 The stereo is just fucking hilarious.
02:22:06 It is like the epitome of being a dead horse though.
02:22:10 Like, I mean, you won the Wall Street.
02:22:11 Yeah, yeah.
02:22:12 What more can you do to this man?
02:22:14 I mean, maybe something good actually happened.
02:22:17 I mean, it does start to feel,
02:22:18 it does start to come off cruel after a while
02:22:21 and it does start to rub me in the wrong way a little bit.
02:22:24 It starts to come off cruel,
02:22:25 but on the other hand, Maddox did bring this lawsuit
02:22:28 and like caused this whole trouble that like, you know,
02:22:31 a stereo and everyone else is having to deal with.
02:22:34 I mean, I can't put myself in a stereo suit in the first place.
02:22:36 So I get why a stereo feels victimized.
02:22:41 I think that that makes sense.
02:22:42 And like, it's not like any of these things
02:22:45 that Maddox does in the suit, like any of the like,
02:22:48 it's like, ha, ha, you know,
02:22:49 we have to legally prove these a cuck.
02:22:50 Like that is funny, but it does start to be like,
02:22:53 it's sort of been the same story for what,
02:22:55 like a year and a half now.
02:22:56 I just feel like it's gotten to the point where Maddox,
02:23:00 like I feel like I might see a news story
02:23:02 that he killed himself and then it won't be funny anymore.
02:23:05 That's kind of where I started leaving interest in it.
02:23:08 It's just like, it's like, it's like,
02:23:11 it's like a flawless victory fatality.
02:23:13 Where do you have left to go
02:23:14 and like making Maddox look worse than he actually is?
02:23:17 It seems like that to us,
02:23:19 but I think to them, it's ongoing.
02:23:21 No, I totally get why, you know,
02:23:23 a stereo suit if I was in his shoes,
02:23:24 I'd be mad and fucking want to fight too constantly.
02:23:27 But I don't like, his fucking, his,
02:23:30 a stereo suit's videos where he was like,
02:23:32 Tom Phillips, the game reporter,
02:23:34 are like the funniest videos ever.
02:23:36 Like that's what I love.
02:23:37 And like his dumb characters,
02:23:39 like the fucking, that Bayou voice that he does,
02:23:42 is like a Cajun guy, that was incredible.
02:23:45 And like, I like Dick when he's just being the guy
02:23:48 who like rants about stepping in dog shit
02:23:50 and like has those everyday problems
02:23:52 and like goes crazy about him.
02:23:53 That's good stuff.
02:23:56 But no, I just, even if it weren't for like me
02:23:59 getting bored of the goss,
02:24:00 I just kind of really fell out of watching
02:24:02 or listening to fucking anything for a long time now.
02:24:06 I just fucking don't care about the internet.
02:24:07 I'm just real curious, based on what this guy was saying,
02:24:10 like it sounded like there was new goss.
02:24:12 I wonder if that's good.
02:24:13 It seems like none of us actually knows that we also
02:24:15 maybe there was some recent development of,
02:24:18 but I don't know.
02:24:19 Yeah, I don't know either.
02:24:20 All right, well, whatever.
02:24:21 Next, next call.
02:24:23 This is from easily influenced idiot.
02:24:26 Okay.
02:24:27 So people have told me that I'm smart.
02:24:30 Wrong.
02:24:31 Which is wrong.
02:24:32 Yeah, but how can I abuse that people think
02:24:36 that I am smart?
02:24:39 That's it.
02:24:41 You're a cartoon character, buddy.
02:24:44 But the question was, how can I abuse the fact
02:24:46 that people think that I'm smart?
02:24:47 He is not smart, but people think he's smart.
02:24:49 How can he use this to win?
02:24:51 How can he use it?
02:24:52 It sounded like a fucking mad hatter.
02:24:54 I did believe it.
02:24:55 Yeah, I know, I know.
02:24:55 I sound like a cartoon character.
02:24:59 How can I, how would I?
02:25:01 Keep in mind, he's not smart.
02:25:03 He's not.
02:25:04 Yeah, that's difficult.
02:25:05 I was gonna, well, in that case,
02:25:08 you can make people do what you want
02:25:09 by just telling them this is a good idea and I'm smart.
02:25:12 But since you are dumb, if you do that,
02:25:15 bad things will result because your ideas are bad.
02:25:17 That's probably true.
02:25:19 Okay, he's gotta do some sort of like,
02:25:21 he's gotta get in some sort of situation like King
02:25:23 from One Punch Man, if you're familiar.
02:25:25 Whereas everyone thinks that King
02:25:27 is the strongest man in the world,
02:25:29 but it's all due to misunderstandings and shenanigans.
02:25:32 He is actually just a gamer boy, basically.
02:25:36 He has no abilities whatsoever.
02:25:38 But everyone thinks that he's super strong.
02:25:40 But it's honestly, the role of King in One Punch Man
02:25:43 gives me such anxiety every time he's on screen
02:25:47 because I'm constantly terrified.
02:25:48 He's going to be found out this time,
02:25:51 that this is gonna be the time.
02:25:52 So I don't know.
02:25:53 I don't know if I can in all conscience
02:25:56 advocate anything that is in any way
02:25:58 not just upfront about how dumb you are.
02:26:00 It sounds to me that like the best thing to do
02:26:02 is you just keep doing what you're doing
02:26:04 because you've obviously already fooled everyone
02:26:05 to think you're smart.
02:26:06 You just ride on that social credit and just keep going.
02:26:09 Okay, because you're not smart,
02:26:11 you will not be able to make any grand plans happen.
02:26:14 But the good news is,
02:26:15 you can just make people think you're smart
02:26:18 and use that in small ways
02:26:19 to just get general social benefit.
02:26:22 Here's what I think.
02:26:24 Here's what I think.
02:26:25 You should team up with someone who is smart,
02:26:27 but maybe has low charisma.
02:26:29 And then you should be the mouthpiece,
02:26:32 and he should be the ideas guy.
02:26:33 That's a great idea.
02:26:34 Go hit up the chess club.
02:26:35 And the two of you can rise to the top together.
02:26:37 Hit the nerd club,
02:26:38 hit the computer programmer desk,
02:26:40 be elite hacker or something.
02:26:42 Yeah, do that.
02:26:44 That's what you need to do.
02:26:46 Yeah, you gotta find a partner
02:26:48 that fills in the gaps in your stats.
02:26:51 Team up with a smart guy,
02:26:52 work really hard and eventually you can get that farm
02:26:54 and tend the rabbits.
02:26:57 Based on that voice mail,
02:26:58 this man's charisma is obviously off the charts.
02:27:00 So, you know.
02:27:01 Yeah, because he sounds like the mad hatter all the time.
02:27:04 That's his real voice.
02:27:06 And everyone just finds it so charming.
02:27:08 He is literally lording the club that is that tea party.
02:27:12 Oh yeah.
02:27:13 Oh, he's lording that club too.
02:27:15 All right, next question is from our next voicemail.
02:27:18 Do it, I dare you.
02:27:19 Well, I think called in last week, but let's say.
02:27:23 All right, motherfuckers.
02:27:25 I take my precious time out of delivering pizzas.
02:27:30 Oh yeah.
02:27:31 Close your car door.
02:27:31 I still do.
02:27:32 I literally never stop.
02:27:33 Never stop delivering pizzas for a whole straight week.
02:27:38 And I asked, I needed to know whether or not you,
02:27:42 you were sledding.
02:27:43 And I spoke, I guess, with two intellectual,
02:27:48 two grand of a way of speaking.
02:27:51 And so, none of you understood that I was asking.
02:27:55 I was pleading for advice on how to,
02:27:59 whether or not I should go fucking sledding.
02:28:01 Sounds like munchie after he's gotten a job.
02:28:03 It's a living cold place where it sometimes snows.
02:28:08 But if I go up to the mountains,
02:28:09 there'll definitely be snow.
02:28:11 If I just go on, if I go on a mountain,
02:28:13 there's like 99% of the time it snows.
02:28:15 Okay, all right.
02:28:16 Wait, what is this issue?
02:28:17 If you guys ever slitted, I can't make decisions.
02:28:20 And there's people on the internet who I listen to
02:28:24 tell me about what it needs to be.
02:28:26 So fucking talk about sledding.
02:28:29 Yeah, okay, if you request,
02:28:32 oh, and it, and you still don't, yes, agreed.
02:28:38 If you, yeah, go sledding if you feel like going sledding.
02:28:40 Sledding is awesome.
02:28:41 That's it.
02:28:42 You know what, there's a hierarchy, all right?
02:28:44 It's like snowboarding is at the fucking bottom.
02:28:47 Snowboarding sucks.
02:28:48 Skiing is a little bit more fun than snowboarding.
02:28:52 Barely, sledding is at the fucking top.
02:28:54 Sledding, anyone can do it.
02:28:56 You never mess up.
02:28:57 Even if you wipe out on a sled,
02:28:59 it's somehow it's still fucking part of the,
02:29:01 it's great in the hilarious.
02:29:02 That's part, that's part of the fun.
02:29:03 If you wipe out skiing, you failed at skiing.
02:29:06 But if you wipe out sledding, you're still just sledding.
02:29:10 And also you fucking died.
02:29:11 You just become, yeah, it's part of it.
02:29:15 You're supposed to wipe out.
02:29:16 You're supposed to go like 90 miles an hour
02:29:19 on that little, on a thin piece of plastic,
02:29:22 like for babies, and you hit the end of the fucking hill,
02:29:25 and at the end of the hill,
02:29:27 it kind of goes up a little ways.
02:29:28 So you have fucking fly 50 feet in the air,
02:29:30 and you break your fucking leg.
02:29:32 That's sledding, and it's fun, and it feels good, dammit.
02:29:35 It feels good.
02:29:35 If it's good enough for Calvin,
02:29:36 it's good enough for you, dammit.
02:29:37 Yeah, yeah.
02:29:39 Those great, those great fucking,
02:29:41 you know, like 10 series long comic panels of Calvin,
02:29:45 like discussing the philosophical concepts,
02:29:49 eventually just smashing into a fucking tree.
02:29:50 That's how the last Calvin Hubstrip ended, right?
02:29:53 That's true.
02:29:54 Let's go on an adventure,
02:29:54 and they were sledding down the hill.
02:29:55 It was a big hell.
02:29:56 Did you really die?
02:29:57 Is that what's implied?
02:29:58 Oh my God.
02:29:59 Yeah, and actually, no.
02:29:59 He woke up right before he hit the ground,
02:30:01 and he was in a coma, all of a sudden.
02:30:03 Oh.
02:30:03 Is that in any way true?
02:30:05 That is completely not.
02:30:06 He just sled down, and then Hobbs turned to him,
02:30:09 and he said, listen, honey,
02:30:11 the doctors say that you think I'm a YouTuber.
02:30:13 Listen, I know you think,
02:30:15 I tell you to like, comment, and subscribe,
02:30:17 but actually, I'm your husband.
02:30:18 Please wake up.
02:30:19 Yeah, please wake up.
02:30:20 I'm trying experimental technology.
02:30:21 Can you hear me right now?
02:30:22 Wake up, wake up, Calvin.
02:30:24 Hey, remember that guy,
02:30:25 that voicemail that we got that was a message
02:30:27 from a higher reality telling us
02:30:30 that we were all in a coma and need to wake up?
02:30:33 Did anyone do that?
02:30:34 Did anyone take his advice?
02:30:35 I didn't.
02:30:36 I did.
02:30:37 I went on and got some snacks, and then came back.
02:30:39 Yeah, okay, good.
02:30:41 That looks good.
02:30:42 Yeah, Calvin wakes up from his coma,
02:30:44 and the doctor explains that you see, Calvin,
02:30:46 it was all a dream composed of metaphors.
02:30:49 Oh.
02:30:50 For example, the character of your mother
02:30:52 represented your repressed homosexuality,
02:30:55 and the character of your father
02:30:56 also represented your repressed homosexuality.
02:30:58 The character of Kock,
02:30:59 represented your repressed desire to suck cock, you see.
02:31:03 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:31:05 It's just all that.
02:31:06 Your sexually ambiguous friend, Susie,
02:31:08 clearly represented your deep, gay butt fuckery.
02:31:12 Oh, shit, my groceries are here.
02:31:13 I'll be back in a minute.
02:31:14 All right, let's go on to the next one.
02:31:16 Wait.
02:31:17 Let's go on to what?
02:31:19 Oh, I was confused if Ben actually went to get groceries,
02:31:22 or if that was part of the Calvin and Hobbs bit,
02:31:24 but I'm like, wait, why is Calvin getting groceries now?
02:31:27 I lost something.
02:31:28 I'm gonna assume.
02:31:29 Okay, next call is from, I think this is real talk.
02:31:32 This is from real talk.
02:31:34 Let's get real.
02:31:37 The PCP are just human, fallible beings, mortals.
02:31:43 Do not look up to them,
02:31:45 except if you're looking for financial advice from Nate,
02:31:49 that is just about it,
02:31:50 or perhaps art advice from a hippo or pen,
02:31:55 but it's not people who are just trying to figure out
02:31:58 their careers in life, just like you are.
02:32:02 However, maybe they're just a little bit older,
02:32:05 and you'll figure it out too.
02:32:07 So don't idolize people with a lot of pen install
02:32:10 because it's just gonna hurt you in a lot, right?
02:32:13 So, don't forget to take your call drops.
02:32:17 Yeah, I appreciate Marvin the fucking Martian calling you.
02:32:20 It sounded more like a Dalek, but just like a calm one.
02:32:23 Yeah, that's true.
02:32:25 Yeah, you know, you start out kind of in tense,
02:32:27 but you're just like, you know what?
02:32:28 Yeah, you know what?
02:32:29 Do whatever you want, make your own decisions.
02:32:32 I like when people call in with a point
02:32:35 and then refute their own point as they go along.
02:32:37 Has this become like a meme of people saying,
02:32:41 don't put us on a pedestal or anything?
02:32:45 No.
02:32:46 It seems like I've heard, did you say that a lot,
02:32:49 or something, I figured people say that.
02:32:51 Like, I don't know, I feel like if your options
02:32:54 are to either put me on a pedestal
02:32:57 or like put me on a place where you don't like me,
02:32:59 then by all means, put me on a fucking pedestal, please.
02:33:03 Please.
02:33:04 I would rather be liked too much than not enough.
02:33:07 Climb the pedestal at patreon.com slash best guy ever,
02:33:10 everybody, head over there and show your love of height.
02:33:14 Well, all right, I mean, yeah.
02:33:16 I mean, I think we have talked about this a little bit
02:33:18 about like how you shouldn't listen to us
02:33:20 for fucking gospel or whatever.
02:33:22 Like, yeah, I mean, I don't know,
02:33:24 I just feel that point's pretty clear, I guess.
02:33:26 But it's always nice to hear from the voice
02:33:27 of a literal alien, so that's-
02:33:29 Look, if you ever catch me saying that you should
02:33:34 go outside and risk the elements
02:33:37 and brave the world on a Monday,
02:33:39 then you know that I need to be off that pedestal.
02:33:42 I have lost my right to the pedestal.
02:33:45 Don't listen to me if I say that.
02:33:46 But anything else I say, you can listen to me
02:33:48 because it's pretty fucking, it's probably correct, you know.
02:33:52 Here's a voicemail I assume is either from or for Mage,
02:33:56 it's from UwuUWU, you know, with the little face,
02:34:00 so let's see what he has for us.
02:34:04 So, I've been watching the drawcast a lot lately
02:34:06 and it's really inspired me to try and learn how to draw
02:34:09 and hopefully become an animator someday,
02:34:10 so like beer games and shit.
02:34:12 So I was wondering if you guys have any tips
02:34:14 for getting good art relatively quickly,
02:34:16 relatively being like a year or two?
02:34:18 Andrew!
02:34:19 I think your art is fucking amazing
02:34:20 and I hope to be on your level.
02:34:21 Yeah, okay, okay, okay, yeah, okay, yeah.
02:34:24 Okay, is it done, is it done?
02:34:25 Yeah, okay.
02:34:26 Andrew Loomis is funneled with a pencil, that's it.
02:34:28 That's all you need.
02:34:29 Google search Andrew Loomis is funneled with a pencil.
02:34:31 You'll find a PDF like the second Google search.
02:34:34 That's it, don't come back.
02:34:36 Fun with a pencil.
02:34:36 What kind of information is contained in that tome?
02:34:38 Just for the later.
02:34:39 It takes you from literally not knowing
02:34:41 what the fuck is happening, how do I hold a pencil,
02:34:44 to being proficient in like 60 pages.
02:34:46 It explains drawing in the only way
02:34:50 that actually makes sense.
02:34:51 You can like be like, all right,
02:34:52 here's how you draw the head from this side,
02:34:54 here's how you draw the head from this side,
02:34:55 here's how you draw the pencil.
02:34:57 Does not matter until you realize,
02:34:59 oh wait, here's how you draw.
02:35:02 You take shapes that appear in the world,
02:35:04 but then you basically reverse engineer them.
02:35:09 So instead of thinking about a skull as being a skull,
02:35:11 you're sitting about the skull, okay, what is a skull?
02:35:13 It's like a sort of elongated sphere,
02:35:15 then there's the nose is sort of like a triangle,
02:35:18 like trapezoid sort of thing, okay, okay.
02:35:20 You don't think about it in terms of like symbols,
02:35:22 what you think a head looks like
02:35:23 or what you think a nose looks like.
02:35:25 You think you bring it out into the geometric shapes
02:35:27 and that's what that guy does
02:35:28 and he explains it to you in greater detail in that book.
02:35:30 No one says that, no one's like,
02:35:32 no one starts out drawing and he's like,
02:35:34 okay, time to learn the geometric shapes and shit.
02:35:36 No, that's what you have to do.
02:35:37 That's how you actually learn how to draw for realsies.
02:35:39 So do that.
02:35:41 How about you, Mage, got any suggestions?
02:35:43 Hey, I think Munchie has better suggestions.
02:35:46 I just draw like a lot, but yeah, I guess, you know,
02:35:50 using other people's examples of how to do its best.
02:35:55 But like, I mean, like the more hours you put in,
02:35:58 the better you'll get at it eventually, so.
02:36:03 How about you, Tom?
02:36:04 I would ask Ben as well, but he's not here.
02:36:07 Gesture drawing, draw from life a lot.
02:36:10 Understanding that drawing from life doesn't mean,
02:36:13 like the reason I never drew from life when I was a kid
02:36:15 because I hated drawing realistically
02:36:16 because I didn't wanna draw photorealistic stuff,
02:36:19 but none of my art teachers ever said,
02:36:21 just because you're drawing from life
02:36:22 doesn't mean you have to draw every last detail.
02:36:25 Like gesture drawing is about getting the idea of a figure,
02:36:27 not like doing every last little like skin pour.
02:36:31 So once I realized that, I started doing it
02:36:33 and my figure drawings got better in literally two weeks,
02:36:36 like orders of magnitude better.
02:36:39 Figure drawing, gesture drawing.
02:36:41 Yep, I'm doing that right now.
02:36:42 I've been doing that for the,
02:36:43 I think I said this before, but yeah,
02:36:45 I've been going gesture drawing classes every Monday
02:36:47 and I've been doing that and it's been absolutely fantastic.
02:36:49 Oh, that sounds fun.
02:36:50 I've improved nocibly in the short amount of time.
02:36:53 It's just fantastic.
02:36:55 How about you, Jesse?
02:36:56 How do we get the MS Paint masterpiece from within?
02:36:59 Put it on the canvas.
02:37:00 Well, you gotta go to a figure drawing class
02:37:02 where they take their clothes off.
02:37:03 That's the first rule, and that's really the only rule
02:37:06 because once you,
02:37:06 Hey, Kale.
02:37:08 Once you see a naked lady contort her body
02:37:12 into all manner of shapes and figures,
02:37:14 well, then you get that boner
02:37:16 and then you get that spirit,
02:37:18 that real fighting spirit in your soul
02:37:22 and you become a man.
02:37:23 And once you're a man,
02:37:24 you can draw whatever the fuck you want.
02:37:26 And if people say that it looks bad
02:37:29 or if it's a poopy drawing, you say,
02:37:31 no, that's my artistic style.
02:37:34 That's my flair.
02:37:35 That's just how I draw.
02:37:37 I hate that excuse.
02:37:39 I don't, well, I saw the naked lady,
02:37:41 so I'm a man now.
02:37:42 So he knows,
02:37:43 I think he knows a little bit more about drawing
02:37:45 than you made.
02:37:46 She's seen the naked lady.
02:37:47 I just wanna reinforce this point with,
02:37:49 okay, Uwu, so you called in, right?
02:37:51 You did a good thing.
02:37:53 You asked a question, it was a fine question.
02:37:55 We heard it and we responded.
02:37:57 You have the expertise.
02:37:58 Okay, I just wanna tell you,
02:38:00 you now have one year, okay?
02:38:03 I'm not, fuck that two year thing.
02:38:04 You have one year in order to,
02:38:07 Munchie just gave you the answer.
02:38:09 He gave it to you.
02:38:11 Just do that.
02:38:12 Did I miss anything?
02:38:13 You did.
02:38:14 This guy asked a question about recommendations
02:38:17 for how to get good at drawing in one year or two,
02:38:20 but whatever, a short amount of time.
02:38:22 Munchie said, what was the name of the book again, Munchie?
02:38:24 Andrew Loomis's Fun With The Pencil.
02:38:26 Fun With The Pencil, that's the one.
02:38:27 I mean, there's no figure drawing for fun, right?
02:38:32 There's one called like,
02:38:34 there's one called Figure Drawing For Something.
02:38:36 Figure Drawing For All It's Worth.
02:38:38 Yeah, yeah, Figure Drawing For All It's Worth
02:38:40 is my pick for Loomis, but you know.
02:38:42 I've been reading all of Loomis, he's all great.
02:38:44 The reason I suggest Fun With The Pencil
02:38:46 is because he takes you from such a low level.
02:38:48 Yes, that's good.
02:38:49 He takes you from the absolute beginner.
02:38:50 Yeah, Ben, didn't you literally decide
02:38:54 to get good at drawing in a year and did it?
02:38:59 Yeah. So there you go,
02:38:59 just do whatever the fuck Ben does, there you go.
02:39:02 And yeah, yeah, what I did.
02:39:04 I mean, don't do everything that Ben does,
02:39:06 but you know, basically do whatever the fuck Ben did.
02:39:08 I just do most of it though.
02:39:11 I feel passionate about this call.
02:39:13 You, this guy was literally just given the answer.
02:39:17 Just do that.
02:39:18 Read, start with Munchie's book.
02:39:20 That sounds like the easiest one.
02:39:21 Literally do that one thing.
02:39:23 And if you don't do it,
02:39:25 I don't wanna fucking hear you complaining
02:39:27 about how hard it is to drawing.
02:39:29 You should be drawing every single day for 365 days
02:39:33 in a row without stopping.
02:39:35 And if you do that, you'll be good.
02:39:37 If you don't, you'll be a fucking pissy baby piece of shit
02:39:40 and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.
02:39:42 So go fucking do it.
02:39:43 I refuse for this to be some masturbatory advice bullshit.
02:39:47 I will fucking gun you down in the street
02:39:49 if you have not actualized in your fucking dream.
02:39:51 You fat motherfucker.
02:39:53 So go do it.
02:39:55 I will expound a little bit.
02:39:56 Like what got me like before, before I did,
02:40:00 I kinda like got, I mean, you know,
02:40:03 obviously you never stop improving,
02:40:04 but I went from like, I went from like a three to like a,
02:40:09 well, I don't wanna rank myself on how good at drawing,
02:40:11 but you know, I made my big leap in maybe a year or two.
02:40:16 And yeah, like I had read Bakuman
02:40:19 and I had watched Strip Search.
02:40:21 And those two things got me really hyped
02:40:23 and motivated me to learn.
02:40:25 And then yeah, I read a bunch of Loomis.
02:40:27 I read some other stuff, but Loomis was the best.
02:40:30 And then I watched a lot of,
02:40:32 I watched a lot of like YouTube, like drawing tutorials.
02:40:35 Some were bad, some were okay.
02:40:37 I used to watch a lot of psychra streams and psychra,
02:40:40 like videos that was pretty inspiring and educational.
02:40:44 Yeah.
02:40:45 Do you know the YouTuber Proko?
02:40:48 No.
02:40:49 Well, someone in the audience will.
02:40:51 The Proko is like an old drinking buddy
02:40:54 of my gesture drawing class teacher.
02:40:56 Like they are friends.
02:40:57 And Proko is like a big huge drawing YouTuber.
02:41:00 I was like, like, I don't know, like probably like a bunch
02:41:02 of fucking, like a million subs or something.
02:41:04 So, and that crazy.
02:41:05 Really?
02:41:06 Yeah.
02:41:07 That's cool.
02:41:07 Weird.
02:41:08 You got to get in touch.
02:41:09 Yeah.
02:41:10 You got to use that connection.
02:41:11 Hey, hey, I just podcast.
02:41:13 I was wondering if Proko could listen to it.
02:41:15 It's called, it's called the Procraster.
02:41:16 It's called, it's called the Zit Crushing podcast.
02:41:19 I think I like it.
02:41:19 What was it?
02:41:20 The Pimple Crush podcast.
02:41:21 Yeah, Pimple Crush in.
02:41:24 By the way, you know what?
02:41:25 I meant to say this earlier, but just,
02:41:27 I watched a Joe Rogan podcast episode
02:41:30 that I would highly recommend everyone in the world
02:41:32 listen to, featuring David Goggins.
02:41:35 I think his name was first, his last name was David.
02:41:37 His last name was definitely Goggins.
02:41:39 Everyone should go listen to it.
02:41:41 It's about, it's like two and a half hours long
02:41:43 of this guy, Goggins.
02:41:45 He's a black Navy SEAL, which is relevant
02:41:48 because like he says very few black guys become Navy SEALs.
02:41:52 And a lot of, he says, a lot of has to do with it
02:41:55 because it's so water based.
02:41:57 Is it because they can't really?
02:42:00 That's really what he says himself.
02:42:01 Yes, that's what he says.
02:42:02 But the whole, the whole can't swim meme?
02:42:04 He says it's real.
02:42:05 He says it's real.
02:42:06 I'm, I'm, I'm agnostic.
02:42:07 I'm just reporting the facts.
02:42:09 Okay.
02:42:10 Here's, here's the point.
02:42:11 This guy tells his life story, which was like,
02:42:14 he was the most like decrepit piece of shit broken down,
02:42:18 sad, fucking, fat sack of shit in the world.
02:42:22 And now he is.
02:42:22 I was down and out with the blues.
02:42:25 That was him.
02:42:26 That he got himself to the YMCA.
02:42:27 He one day, okay, this is why I love this guy so much.
02:42:30 One day he was a huge avid fan of Rocky.
02:42:33 He would watch it like every day.
02:42:36 He was a huge fan.
02:42:37 Yeah.
02:42:38 He's already a wise man.
02:42:40 And it was, oh, and he loved platoon.
02:42:43 He loved platoon, specifically for the scene where Elias
02:42:46 keeps getting shot in the back by the natives.
02:42:48 This is trying to run to the helicopter,
02:42:50 but he keeps getting up and keeps attempting to escape.
02:42:53 He doesn't escape, but he's fighting to,
02:42:55 even though it failed.
02:42:56 His struggle was valiant.
02:42:57 So this guy Goggins was a fat motherfucker, piece of shit.
02:43:00 And one day something snapped.
02:43:02 And he listened to the thing for the details,
02:43:04 the Joe Rogan podcast, David Goggins.
02:43:06 And he just decided that's it.
02:43:08 He's going to now do everything he believed in.
02:43:11 And he started small.
02:43:12 He didn't do it all on day one,
02:43:14 but he just fucking stuck with it.
02:43:16 And he is now one of the most hardworking,
02:43:18 dedicated, driven pieces of people in the planet
02:43:21 was a supremely decorated Navy SEAL from nothing.
02:43:27 Listen to the podcast.
02:43:28 It's insane.
02:43:29 That's Nate.
02:43:30 What?
02:43:31 That story's a little light on the details.
02:43:32 Okay, it is.
02:43:34 Because I don't want to waste everybody's time.
02:43:35 They really should go listen to it.
02:43:36 Yeah, okay.
02:43:37 The point was he had been abused by his dad.
02:43:39 He had incredibly low self-esteem.
02:43:41 He literally faked having confidence
02:43:44 and being like a capable human being.
02:43:45 He was poor.
02:43:47 Well, don't we all.
02:43:48 Indeed, he was poor.
02:43:49 He had no money.
02:43:50 He lived with his mom.
02:43:51 He would go home and cry
02:43:53 about how sad he was about his life.
02:43:54 He had extreme social anxiety.
02:43:57 But then one day, I forget,
02:43:59 I don't remember what it was,
02:44:00 but just something changed in his mind.
02:44:02 And he began to think about, wouldn't it be crazy
02:44:05 if I, me, this huge loser, he was an exterminator.
02:44:09 He just quit his job when he realized this.
02:44:11 How old was he?
02:44:12 What?
02:44:13 How old was he?
02:44:13 He was 24, I think at the time.
02:44:16 I think he was 24.
02:44:17 So not so, he might have been 22.
02:44:19 I could be wrong about that.
02:44:20 He was around that age, though.
02:44:21 And he just decided,
02:44:23 he had always wanted to be a Navy Seal
02:44:26 and then he just decided to do it.
02:44:27 And he is now like an insane ultra marathon runner.
02:44:31 He is the world record holder for pull-ups,
02:44:33 having done 4,060 or something in 24-hour period.
02:44:38 Oh my God.
02:44:38 Oh my God.
02:44:39 He is an ultra marathon runner.
02:44:41 He ran over 100 miles in 17 hours
02:44:45 when he was starting out.
02:44:48 He's just an insane guy.
02:44:50 And when I just think about all the people
02:44:52 out there in the world.
02:44:53 Wait, is he not, is he not a Kenyan?
02:44:54 No, he's an American, he's American.
02:44:57 That's so weird.
02:44:58 There's like, cause there's like that one,
02:44:59 there's like that one tribe of people in Kenya
02:45:02 who are like disproportionately like the best marathon runners.
02:45:06 And I was like, I was sure that the world record holder
02:45:08 for marathon running would be one of those guys.
02:45:09 Nope.
02:45:10 Based on what he said,
02:45:11 seems like ultra marathon running is honestly more question
02:45:14 of pain tolerance than anything else.
02:45:18 And patience, and patience.
02:45:20 And a lot of people just don't have that.
02:45:22 So the point is just like when I hear this question
02:45:25 about like, how can I get better or something?
02:45:28 And there's an answer given immediately.
02:45:31 I've just, this is why I'm literally starting,
02:45:34 what is it, Reduwe, run every day until I'm hot
02:45:36 because I listen to this podcast and I'm not going to stop.
02:45:39 When people have the solution and they don't do it,
02:45:42 they're worthless and they deserve death.
02:45:45 But when they capitalize on it,
02:45:46 that is when I respect them and they are good.
02:45:49 So do that and listen to that fucking podcast.
02:45:52 We'll put a link in the show notes.
02:45:54 Everyone should listen to it.
02:45:56 It's great.
02:45:57 It's good.
02:45:57 I like it.
02:45:59 And also draw every day.
02:46:01 Back to, I forgot to mention as I was saying how I got good.
02:46:04 Also, I drew every day for a long time.
02:46:06 Great.
02:46:07 That was also part of it.
02:46:08 Okay, moving on to the next one.
02:46:09 Oh, and finish thing.
02:46:09 This is from-
02:46:10 Don't just do sketches.
02:46:11 Don't just do sketches.
02:46:12 Like yeah, do a gesture drawing,
02:46:14 but then like finish it on top of it.
02:46:16 Because every stage of the drawing process
02:46:19 is its own skill set and you need to practice them all.
02:46:21 Makes sense.
02:46:22 And also finishing things in general.
02:46:23 Finishing things is a skill in and of itself
02:46:25 that should be trained like a muscle.
02:46:27 Man, that's so true.
02:46:28 That's an important one.
02:46:29 Yeah.
02:46:30 Next call, relevant, is from I hate myself a lot.
02:46:33 Let's see what he's got for us.
02:46:35 Okay, choose one.
02:46:36 Either everyone you try to communicate with
02:46:39 doesn't understand you or people just inexplicably hate you.
02:46:43 What you choose and why.
02:46:44 Both of those are already my life.
02:46:47 Both of those-
02:46:48 Wait, that got cut off.
02:46:49 My life is already both of those things.
02:46:51 Hmm.
02:46:53 So it's a choice between no one understands you
02:46:57 or everyone hates you.
02:47:01 Is there the ability to recover from everyone hating me?
02:47:04 Or is that set in stone?
02:47:06 I think this is permanent.
02:47:07 Well then why?
02:47:08 Okay.
02:47:09 I think these are just your conditions.
02:47:10 That first option.
02:47:12 Okay, I guess if you can communicate with people,
02:47:14 they still might be willing to do things for you
02:47:16 for example, sell you food even if they hate you
02:47:19 so you might not starve.
02:47:20 But if everyone hates you,
02:47:22 then they might just let you die in the streets.
02:47:24 So, you know, maybe I'd probably go with the first one,
02:47:28 I guess, I don't know.
02:47:30 I mean, you could probably figure out a way
02:47:35 to have people like you,
02:47:37 even though they don't understand you.
02:47:39 Like, oh, who's that guy?
02:47:41 He was like emperor so-and-so in San Francisco.
02:47:47 I know what you're talking about.
02:47:48 He was an insane person who was like,
02:47:51 I think he was trying to be president for a while
02:47:53 and then moved on to emperor.
02:47:55 I know you're talking about it.
02:47:55 Okay, no, he was like a emperor,
02:47:58 his name was Emperor Norton.
02:48:00 Yeah, Joshua Norton in San Francisco.
02:48:03 He was like a kind of rich guy,
02:48:06 like a stock trader or something or like a rice trader.
02:48:10 And he lost all his money, basically lost it,
02:48:13 dressed up in a military uniform
02:48:15 and stalked around the streets of San Francisco
02:48:17 for the rest of his life,
02:48:18 claiming to be the emperor of America.
02:48:20 And everyone loved him and he was great.
02:48:23 So like-
02:48:24 Emperor denied his throne.
02:48:25 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:48:26 You know, people would pay him quote unquote taxes
02:48:29 if they saw him in the street, you know?
02:48:31 Like they made dolls of him.
02:48:33 He printed his own money,
02:48:35 which some people actually accepted
02:48:37 in the San Francisco area just because-
02:48:39 Damn.
02:48:40 He was like a local hero.
02:48:41 Everyone was like, man, this emperor Norton guy,
02:48:44 he's the best, we love him.
02:48:45 Yeah, so that guy was insane and nobody understood him,
02:48:48 but everyone loved him.
02:48:50 So I feel like maybe you could finagle something like that
02:48:53 with the first one.
02:48:54 That sounds like a clear choice in my opinion.
02:48:55 So I'm gonna go with that one.
02:48:57 I agree.
02:48:58 Yeah.
02:48:59 Okay, we've got one more call
02:49:01 and this one's a special treat for everybody.
02:49:03 All right, we're once again visited by the wonder,
02:49:07 the creature known only as racist forest gump.
02:49:12 Oh, here we go, here we go.
02:49:15 Janae, I'm gonna join the KKK, Janae.
02:49:22 The forest you already noticed for the last week.
02:49:25 Stop.
02:49:26 It's not gonna be as funny the second time.
02:49:28 Why are you doing this?
02:49:32 But Janae, it's funny because it's racist.
02:49:38 No, for us.
02:49:39 Why do you need this joke?
02:49:42 Why?
02:49:44 Why?
02:49:49 Janae, it makes me feel good inside
02:49:53 when I make people laugh, who do I look up to?
02:49:56 Aw.
02:49:59 Aw.
02:50:00 Why don't you just go outside
02:50:02 and get some real fucking friends, son?
02:50:05 Why don't you just do that?
02:50:07 What?
02:50:09 But Janae, I'm with Tony and I got AIDS.
02:50:15 I can't make friends, I got AIDS, Janae, I got AIDS.
02:50:24 I wasn't here last week, so that was new to me.
02:50:27 Yeah.
02:50:28 This is forest gump, a new beloved character
02:50:30 on the progressives podcast.
02:50:32 You know, I still have hope for him.
02:50:34 I think he could make some recovery here.
02:50:36 I think lots of people, lots of racist people with AIDS
02:50:41 go on to live very successful, happy lives, fulfilling also.
02:50:46 There's still hope.
02:50:47 In Trump's America, there's hope for everyone.
02:50:52 Even racist forest gump can rise to the top
02:50:55 in Trump's America.
02:50:58 There's nothing to say.
02:50:59 Let's just wrap it up there, everybody.
02:51:02 Are we done?
02:51:03 That was the last one.
02:51:04 This is a racist forest gump,
02:51:05 the last note we're going out on.
02:51:07 He's the headline for this podcast.
02:51:07 Yeah.

02:51:24 I thought it was just Patreon.com slash The Procrastinator's.

02:51:29 Okay, you're right, there is no podcast.
02:51:30 It's just The Procrastinator's, I fucked it up.
02:51:33 Oh, you fool, you just cost us millions.
02:51:35 I just cost us everything.
02:51:36 Everyone thought that there'd been an update,
02:51:38 so they unpleased, and then repledge to that one.

02:51:45 No, we...
02:51:46 We gotta get back the big account,
02:51:48 or the boss is gonna,
02:51:49 this is a million dollar deal is going down.

02:53:05 I am an asshole, I am a stupid.
02:53:11 I've got a deadline, don't wanna do it.
