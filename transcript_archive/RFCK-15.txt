00:00:30 how long has it been munchy it's been like it feels like it's been like six months i mean
00:00:36 we were what was the last one we recorded an episode but obviously i mean anyone
00:00:41 anyone who follows the show knows uh fat three two putting into that last oh god that's right
00:00:48 that's jesus pop tropica right yeah it feels the because the one we recorded that got lost
00:00:54 that was eaten by fat 32 that one it could grow into fat 33 that i mean that was what like
00:01:02 two or three months ago that was that was in november first week in november so yeah about two
00:01:09 two months whatever two two three months ago and uh after that i was like boy that was enough
00:01:16 recording for me for a long time uh that that that dude they could they could watch that video for
00:01:24 months yeah but sadly they cannot watch that video for an area second as it did not exist hey i have
00:01:31 this i have the statistics right now we the last episode was in september are you seeing the screen
00:01:36 by the way yeah i am all right well i don't know let me let me know if you got any input on character
00:01:42 creation now i like how there's only two animal preferences in this game as as i got intended
00:01:48 do these matter at all uh well like you'll have a pet in the game and it'll either be a cat or a dog
00:01:57 i feel like that's i gotta i wish i could i wish i could click this blank space over here and pick
00:02:01 none please there's a very clear killer ratty preference here it's very clear that killers
00:02:06 are cats and rats are dogs oh no i hate that i hate that don't say that i mean i mean can you
00:02:13 argue against it yeah killers hate animals okay well sure fine but if you were i mean of the two
00:02:21 it's a it's a soccer team experiment you see no i'm not i'm not indulging i'm not indulging this
00:02:29 fantasy of yours and what a fantasy what a what a we're going off the rails we're going we're
00:02:36 going off the rails if you notice dear viewer this is a slightly shorter episode at rfk probably
00:02:43 many hours long yet still however not not uh six or seven hours as i am leaving in just a few hours
00:02:52 to uh indulge my mother in some sick depravities that she has lined up for me uh people who know
00:02:58 me in real life know that uh i i took online school for my for my high school so uh i did not
00:03:05 go to a brick and mortar tradition brick and i didn't go to a mom and pop school yeah i didn't
00:03:10 go to a mom but you know this this ain't your uncle's high school uh as they as they uh called it
00:03:15 anyway i got a plumber everything like that graduated it like a year and a half ago however
00:03:21 because it's online you know i didn't uh dress up and go to the frankly god high school graduation
00:03:27 you know i had no uh fallatio you know six hour long fallatio session out in the middle of the
00:03:33 field somewhere but my mom would not you missed out on the quintessential high school experience
00:03:39 dude i've okay i've been the high school graduations before of other people and frankly
00:03:42 miss that fallatio dog i know i thank god thank god there was no woman's lips on my on my male

00:04:34 right now is that like a skeleton it can wear like like a skeleton rib cage shirt that's pretty killer
00:04:41 it is i'm gonna grow i'm gonna grow some purple i'm gonna grow some purple killer flower
00:04:48 that's my goal here whenever there's a game like this i always just randomize until i get the
00:04:53 worst looking one and then i play with that it's not that's not how i operate i operate i operate in
00:05:00 a stupid way i mean like like all things in your life anyway in about two hours uh i'm being forced
00:05:08 to go to jay jay c pennies and wear some rented uh graduation gown and cap pose for the jay c penny
00:05:16 photographer so uh i can get graduation photo wow awesome i know i'm really stoked for it
00:05:25 well i mean who wouldn't be i mean i'll i'll look back on those images of my uh yeah happy memories
00:05:33 yeah yeah happy man dude oh i remember that time in jay c pennies i used to go there all the time
00:05:40 i used to steal socks look at this ghost shirt that's fucking cool i would wear that
00:05:48 ooh what was that oh go back to that purple what this purple one yeah this is like something a
00:05:53 it's like a pilgrim would wear what no kind of like this sweater this like gray sweater
00:06:01 mm is this what half of the episode is gonna be been you gotta you gotta move on with our lives we
00:06:06 can't stay in the past like this look we're gonna be looking at this oh there it is there it is look
00:06:13 at that i see it look look at it um we're gonna be looking at this for the rest of the game so
00:06:21 yeah i mean get get comfortable oh wait look look at that like double rested like sanji fucking
00:06:27 okay what are these like locations on the side are these houses wilderness farm i think this is
00:06:36 yeah this is location and i think it determines some some shit about the game like i'm pretty sure
00:06:43 wilderness is hard mode uh man okay so it seems kind of a it seems kind of a you don't wait should
00:06:50 i be a juvie that would be really cute should i should i just be a juvie farman i think i think
00:06:58 that would i think i think our stocks would skyrocket if you were to do that all right
00:07:06 just an all just on all neon green man searing the the uh residents of this local town terrorizing
00:07:14 here we go here we go the juvie's animal preference would be like a goldfish or like
00:07:20 something not threatening um it would be like it would be like uh dandelions yeah it would be
00:07:30 their imaginary friend look at this hair jesus christ yeah it's pretty good right oh it's really
00:07:39 as Nina moria would say if she was still alive today hey speaking of high school graduation
00:07:46 those photos you showed me the other day at your house have been just absolutely seared in my vision
00:07:52 of what of me bald well i mean that of course jave had been worst been uh but but primarily high
00:08:02 school been young been which is it seems like like an oxymoron yeah definitely i mean i feel like

00:08:13 an old soul yeah true you were you were wise beyond your ears wise beyond my ears you say and your eyes

00:11:06 fuck wanders that far north uh favorite thing uh favorite piece piece um animal what do you think
00:11:21 animal preference i think a dog because they're i mean yeah all right she was right okay standard
00:11:29 standard farm riverland well i guess arson brook we should pick riverland farm right yeah that makes
00:11:35 forest farm hilltop farm okay riverland farm let's get the intro thank god all right now we're
00:11:44 actually in the game hey yeah we're only 11 minutes in huh uh uh you can now uh devote some of your
00:11:53 mental power from choosing outfits to participate maybe you know we'll see we'll see about that
00:12:00 um so uh yeah how's it going nice one how's how are you how's it going over there
00:12:10 buddy it feels good it's it's sort of a surreal scenario to be recording especially rfck again
00:12:18 rfck is sort of the uh show where i don't have to like pretend to be someone i'm not like how i do
00:12:25 on every other uh performance piece like the pcp or anything it's like a defragmentation for my mind
00:12:32 so i don't even have to uh you know like uh scream or yell i i feel like it's just a a place for
00:12:40 nothing to happen and that's what makes it good yeah it's get ready for a whole lot of nothing
00:12:45 viewers it's entertaining the same way that gossip is or gossip makes it feel like oh you're like
00:12:50 you're on the inside of something you're you're like uh you're privy to knowledge not the not the
00:12:55 average bear is i feel like the same with rfck where it's not particularly like entertaining
00:13:01 like a song and dance or like a particularly good homeless show it's more like a homeless show like
00:13:07 a boss fights no like dancing you know you know but well you see well you see ben i come from new
00:13:15 a new york city impotencies nyc and at least there the homeless have the dcd dance for that
00:13:20 money that makes the difference between a classy homeless person dot dot dot and a bomb really
00:13:26 wow you learn something new every day anyway that's what rfck is like is it like a homeless fight
00:13:33 hell yeah hell yeah buddy um we we were just privy to some major goss i mean i think i've got
00:13:42 you and me yeah you and me together when uh our uh uh what do we call it is there a personal
00:13:49 name ragcon 3.33 uh i don't think we should call it that uh but i don't know what i would call it
00:13:56 either i don't want to call it the meetup which is what i think we called it an all-planning
00:14:01 the meetup i mean that's all it was true is uh there's a whole lot of it was a whole lot of
00:14:08 nothing if you know what i mean there's a whole lot of nothing going on oh i i i do know i say
00:14:13 making a jackoff motion with my hand oh hell yeah bro um okay so what so what about it what about the
00:14:22 goss oh i'm just saying that i mean it was basically nothing but that uh there was goss sure
00:14:31 this is sort of like a continuation of of a long running storyline that was started way back in
00:14:37 frog fractions two episode one that i think uh it's sort of a culmination of all that uh there's
00:14:44 been many false culminations where this might be the real culmination i mean they if like fucking
00:14:50 hopefully hopefully this one will stick fine i actually don't know what you're talking about
00:14:57 i mean that this feels like uh way back in frog fractions two episode one we're talking about
00:15:02 oh peace to be friendship we want to be all close together oh yeah blah blah blah blah
00:15:07 whole bunch of nothing and uh there's been a bunch of uh you know development on that if i develop i
00:15:12 mean maybe in fact uh the opposite of development and in fact the regression um such you know i feel
00:15:26 fine i think i think everything's i think everything's gonna work out just fine with all
00:15:32 that i'm you know i left feeling a little dismayed but uh upon reflection you know upon
00:15:40 mulling it over hearing everyone else mull it over i you know you know everyone's everyone's
00:15:45 gonna everyone's gonna settle into what they want what they want you know what they want to be doing
00:15:51 where they want to be it's all gonna come to its natural equilibrium point uh might be
00:15:57 in too vague here i don't know how how how into this do you want to get i'm sure i'm sure there's
00:16:03 uh is any of it like is any of it like proprietary i i don't think so but i get the feeling that others
00:16:10 might think so are these rocks what are these things what logs no these oh yeah those are rocks
00:16:18 but i think i need like a hammer i think i need a hammer to destroy them and i don't have a hammer
00:16:24 uh i can get one somewhere fiber i got fiber you do please got wood why is there a hole in my porch
00:16:35 why is there a hole in my porch i don't know anyway uh i
00:16:43 i i'm ready i'm i'm i'm down again do it we can always cut it we can always uh you know remove
00:16:50 this video we can always uh make sure that no one right clicks the url this video as soon as it goes
00:16:56 public and then uh downloads as an mp4 and uh saves it before we can delete it hell yeah
00:17:03 no no load please uh well no load um what am i saying you know uh you know it seems like
00:17:15 nate doesn't you know at the time it was like nate wants to do the thing with digi
00:17:22 and did do that this new show or whatever and digi wants to move so nate was gonna move and i was
00:17:29 like ah but do you want to i don't think you want to go i didn't say this because i don't want to
00:17:34 tell anyone how to live their lives or anything but i was thinking like you're gonna do it publicly
00:17:38 now instead well i mean this is after the dust has settled right uh okay i you know i i was i mean i
00:17:47 i mean i told him this in a call or something uh i was like at the time i thought uh you know do
00:17:54 do you actually want to go where digi's going um wherever that is and then you have to remember
00:18:02 that no one knows what this meeting is about it's stuff from the very beginning do i i know how would
00:18:07 anyone know what has happened well we were meeting to discuss like who where people were you know i mean
00:18:13 basically the meeting was just where is digi moving that was it that was the meeting and i i didn't
00:18:20 like it i was very i was very bored i had very little contributed uh from my perspective pcphq
00:18:28 for a while now has been settled like tom digi you and me eventually in yeah in just a short while
00:18:36 will be in the same place and so i thought wow only nate and then maybe hippo need to come and then
00:18:43 like you know oh it's there it is for a while i've been saying like opcpq is founded like the
00:18:49 foundation is already there there's already things happening as because of it i'm games
00:18:53 prime example uh but uh somewhat to my surprise last time uh i was there i found out uh apparently
00:19:03 the the seeds of discourse were planted and in fact it's not at all uh figured out or decided
00:19:10 well it's it's very much an open question well it's just digi wants to move digi doesn't like
00:19:14 boston for reasons uh i don't get them i mean i think i've tried i think we've all tried to
00:19:25 i think you've all tried to dissuade him he doesn't like the cold the what cold he doesn't
00:19:31 like to shovel that's not that's not really the reason i don't know it's not no that's like
00:19:36 that's like eight why that's i mean that's like eighth thing down the list and the first seven are
00:19:42 my house is too expensive um and like i don't know there are cheaper houses but i just don't
00:19:50 i don't know if he wants to hear it uh yeah well well anyway whatever anyway uh this this
00:20:01 this whole mean we've we attended we gathered everyone up it was just supposed to be like i
00:20:05 was there and then you guys were already and then Nate was gonna fly on then hippo just surprise
00:20:10 yeah uh everyone like like a week before and came out uh which was cool
00:20:16 very uh it was a great time i don't really care about getting like to the meeting specifically
00:20:21 though i know people will be clamoring for it in in the comments and stuff like that
00:20:25 but frankly i don't really care about what was discussed yeah yeah i'm with you i'm with you
00:20:32 like it was a bunch of stuff that doesn't really concern me no a bunch of i didn't i didn't like
00:20:37 i said i i didn't really bear that much on me personally it doesn't matter where anyone else
00:20:44 because i'm not planning on leaving here so a bunch of stuff in the future deciding where people
00:20:52 want to live their lives uh seems like it's possible that psphq will not be in boston and you know
00:21:02 like sad question mark
00:21:06 like i i think about it in the sense that like who do i want to be around in my life
00:21:12 for various reasons you know work or or socially i don't know if i need to be around everyone
00:21:20 you know i like you ben as you might be able to tell i don't know if you can gay gay gay gay gay gay
00:21:27 gay and so i want to be in boston or you know around you because we do work together and we're
00:21:34 good friends yeah same thing with other psp members but not like everyone i don't know if i need to
00:21:40 be in pcphq i don't know if i care about like the the group it has a concept i used to i don't
00:21:47 know if i do anymore not through any degradation of character but just out of uh i know what you mean
00:21:53 like you know me like i like hippo but we don't like do anything to get i mean maybe if we lived
00:22:01 nearby we would but as it currently stands we don't and that's you know nothing wrong with that
00:22:09 um but like we don't need to you know let live together i mean same with me and tom like i like
00:22:14 tom i like hanging out with tom if you know he moved it wouldn't disrupt anything about what
00:22:22 i'm doing you know right uh funnily enough the two people you mentioned are the two people who i would
00:22:28 like to be near the most well yeah i mean so would i i'm just saying it's not yeah it's not a it's
00:22:34 it's not like a yeah i i get me mean yeah i i i i i i it just feels like there's no real like
00:22:42 there's no real like personal professional crossover there is what i'm saying that's all that's all
00:22:48 i'm saying dog i i get you yeah i get you and i'm in the same boat it it's like you know there
00:22:56 there are two reasons we have someone either you like them a whole lot or you know you have work
00:22:59 with them and you know if they can overlap then that's good but you know sometimes you can just
00:23:05 work with someone a lot and you know you like them but you don't have to be near them to work with them
00:23:11 in the case of digi like i mean what what would we do together in person that we could not do
00:23:17 over the internet like why do we have to live together not a whole lot of reason we don't have
00:23:21 like similar interests it's not like we have the same i conception of like what to do to have fun
00:23:28 so it's not like we would have that social relationship necessarily let's say that i'm not
00:23:32 friends digi you obviously understand that yeah um yeah nobody understands hating digi bro more than
00:23:40 been yeah yeah gotcha yeah uh man i feel like i kind of didn't really use my didn't really use all
00:23:49 my energy today you know you gotta you gotta be efficient in this game you gotta use your resources
00:23:56 much much like the stock market much much like the stock market you gotta be you gotta be schmott
00:24:01 you gotta be it's a pretty risky game i mean you know vegetation is on the line
00:24:10 it's it's it's it's not a risky game if you know how to play it it's a lot yeah yeah it's not not
00:24:15 if you know how to play it have we told that story should we tell that story on but you definitely
00:24:19 should okay okay so this was uh i think this will no this was maybe between your last two visits
00:24:26 yeah me and uh me and uh kazzie were out for community day uh might have been syndical day
00:24:34 doesn't matter um we went to what's that something cafe dumpling cafe yeah dumb we went to dumpling
00:24:42 cafe and um world renowned everyone everyone rfca knows who dumpling cafe is like oh they will know
00:24:50 they will know dumpling cafe because it's ours like spot now you know we own it it kind of is
00:24:56 it just sort of happens stands developed into our place but it is now yeah we all like it um it's
00:25:02 where it's pretty much like our default where do we go eat when we're downtown in boston um much
00:25:09 like how i'm holding out hope for psphq boss i'm also holding out hope for t do rfca uh headquarters
00:25:15 once you fuck fuck t do man what fuck all you t do bitches that then you'll really basic ass
00:25:22 basic ass t do bitches god i miss those popping bubbles i know i know ben you're
00:25:32 you're missing out i am look i know i know i'm missing out on the popping bubbles i love the
00:25:37 popping bubbles the boba go the tapioca bubbles but but the popping bubbles
00:25:45 it's where it's at man you know i wasn't so canned tapioca but i actually had some tapioca
00:25:49 the other day wasn't that bad actually it's not i mean i don't hate it it's not gross but it's it's
00:25:55 whatever um but the popping bubble anyway the point is we were in um dumpling cafe we were sitting
00:26:05 near like a booth or whatever we were sitting at which we're sharing a table a long table with
00:26:10 this family it was like a mom a kid who was maybe like 13 and the dad on the other side
00:26:17 and the dad was dressed in like a sweat shirt what he was just pretty casually and the mom
00:26:22 and the son they're playing pokemon go so me and kazi are like hey sup pokemon and they're like
00:26:29 oh hey pokemon you know like you do and um the kid is like oh shinies yeah we're talking about
00:26:36 did you get any shinies i think i asked them like did you get any shinies and he's like oh i got tons
00:26:40 of shinies oh and he shows me his alolan raticate and he's like oh look i've got a shiny raticate
00:26:46 and i'm like i got so many of these and i'm like that's an alolan raticate and he's like dammit
00:26:52 wait wait so he knew he was trying to pass it off like he got shinies i don't know i don't i don't
00:26:59 seem like i don't know if he knew or if i had just like and i blew his mind or if he got caught out
00:27:05 and he was upset about it if i if i were in that scenario it wouldn't be like oh dammit it would be
00:27:10 like what like it would be like i like your mind to be blown yeah it wouldn't be like oh like i
00:27:15 it sounds like he's been found you know when i heard the story you know now that i think about it
00:27:20 it's true yeah i wouldn't be mad i would be i would be confused first not frustrated yeah yeah you
00:27:27 know what that's a little punk ass bitch you just caught that guy out dude i think he was i think
00:27:31 he may have i think we may have a little punk ass bitch on our hands and you know we do punk ass
00:27:36 bitches around he had a real punk ass bitch haircut um he um he had another one he had like a dyed green
00:27:44 he had like a like a poorly dyed green sort of flip top no way just like i do just like i do now
00:27:50 this is a real juvie yeah yeah yo he was such a he was such a fucking juvie um it was oh man i love
00:27:57 it okay but that's that's not the point the point is we're talking about pokemon we're talking about

00:28:35 i feel like when you spoke those words like flew back like a powerful like blast just occurred
00:28:41 it was like using a blank in uh enter the gungeon everything was blown back all all bullets were

00:29:17 oh damn you can only you can only do so much in a day before you get exhausted
00:29:25 uh that's a marvelous story it is thank you for sharing he was a powerful powerful man
00:29:31 and i was intimidated he he's clearly a like i like and that's why he had a little punk ass
00:29:37 bitch of a son why is it that always the hardest men have the softest sons is that true yeah i yeah
00:29:45 didn't you hear did i hear you say it just now yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah that's that's a good
00:29:51 point um man i don't know you know some things are just a mystery and that's one of them ben would
00:29:58 i'd be able to beat up your son like newborn i mean did you get the drop on him no fair it's a
00:30:14 duel a fair fight i'd know no i don't think so no i'm sorry what what what what techniques what
00:30:20 skills does he have could he possibly retain um well he uh you know uh like not before you before
00:30:32 it goes to the ground right like on the ground it's all it's all about holds you know but like
00:30:38 before that it's all about momentum and um you know a baby a properly trained baby
00:30:45 you know the the the the mass differential between the two combatants is massive therefore
00:30:50 you know proper technique at redirecting momentum is is even more devastating
00:30:56 uh i've got two questions for you about your son number one how much does he weigh
00:31:01 number two was the date he born on significant for any other reasons such as was it a holiday
00:31:07 was it perhaps uh uh the uh you know the date of a historical event is does he get any sort of
00:31:14 date bonus um was he born on like january 1st and therefore had like psychic abilities first
00:31:20 dancer wait almost nothing second dancer um um talk like a pirate day and he hates it because
00:31:35 every year for his birthday he gets he gets novel he gets novelty hooks he gets novelty
00:31:41 hooks to wear over his hand because because you know everyone's because everyone's just
00:31:44 stocked up on those for talk like a pirate day anyway so they're then they they they double up
00:31:49 on it they double up on it and make it a and make it a birthday gift uh he hates he hates pirates
00:31:56 ben st jr walking down an alley away is topped by some some you know scurvy looking youths and

00:32:27 yeah i knew sons of spirits they're just they're just they're good why are they why are they
00:32:34 taking it too far why are they taking it so easy on him uh i don't know you know once it varies
00:32:42 depends on my mood depends on my mood oh i oh god i can upgrade tools oh god i can upgrade tools
00:32:49 oh god but i need fucking copper i need fucking copper i think i'm gonna have my son be like a
00:32:55 puzzle a puzzle like a puzzle solver like puzzler go on like he's like his like his main his only
00:33:02 stat will be intelligence and he'll just be able to solve rubies cubes and tetris games and like an
00:33:07 instant wow impressive on the mean streets of florida he'll be able to uh get by by by only
00:33:17 entertaining the common street criminal that comes into his abodes i imagine a lot of like a sort of
00:33:25 like dingy little shop where you know criminals and outlaws can enter for free and uh be entertained
00:33:32 for the afternoon criminals and outlaw was welcome the sign says on the yeah yeah no no track record
00:33:39 no service do you know what this game's about by the way no i have no idea what's happening the the
00:33:43 intro to this game is you are a you are a corporate you are a corporate cubicle slave shill uh working
00:33:50 for jojomart working at like jojomart corporate headquarters and then you inherit a farm from
00:33:56 your grandpa and you're like fuck this and you uh and you run away to you quit your job and you run
00:34:03 away to uh this little town to like take on the farm and start and start living a farmer's life
00:34:09 that's so clean but also jojomart there's like a jojomart branch there's like a jojomart branch
00:34:15 that's open in the town and like if you shop and like the prices are cheaper but like the more you
00:34:21 shop here like the worst everything gets and like the worst like the local yeah like the worst the
00:34:26 local economy does you need to like like you need to invest in like the local like mom and pop stores
00:34:31 to keep them in business or like jojomart takes over and you get bad end that's crazy i know it's
00:34:37 sick it's like real life it's literally real life it's like when when the opening intro plays
00:34:44 and like you see your your character like being a corporate stooge and it's it's like the game
00:34:50 itself like in your in you the player's real life you're a corporate stooge but you're you know
00:34:55 you're turning on this game and you're escaping you're escaping from your corporate life into the
00:34:59 world of fucking whatever just like you know you're turning on this game to escape from from your
00:35:05 daily they grind you know to go be a be a farmer for a little while if you if you feel me god i hate
00:35:12 capitalism i hate capitalism is that even weird i don't think so i don't think it's wow when are
00:35:20 ben and nate gonna gonna when are we really gonna get their legendary capitalism good
00:35:25 conversation the conversation to end all capitalism um i mean that'll pretty much that'll
00:35:32 pretty much be it that'll oh fuck i didn't mean to do that now there's a hole in the beach

00:35:46 anyway uh yeah so the answer is patreon patronize me at patreon.com slash ben saying if you want
00:35:55 to see me really kill take take take on a capitalism really take nate to task for his
00:36:02 questionable capitalism feelings shit oh god i'm gonna miss it i'm gonna miss it
00:36:09 what are you trying to say i don't know there's some there's some kind of like thing i have to be
00:36:13 fuck i have to be at the beach at five four you know specifically picking games i was like you
00:36:19 know starting valley seems like a pretty uh you know uh uh low tempo game and that's enough
00:36:24 you're a fool turn it on and i'm like oh god i'm gonna miss my deadline i gotta get to the beach
00:36:29 by five p.m and talk to willy the sailor what we called you son dad no i think my dad's dead
00:36:38 actually i don't think your dad is relevant in this game it's just your your grandpa's
00:36:41 dead though and he left you his farm it doesn't seem like a game i enjoy what a game about your
00:36:47 grandpa being dead no a game without a visible father figure i mean i mean i mean some people
00:36:54 play games to relax some people play games for monetary benefit i play games to uh reconnect
00:36:58 with my father by pretending that i have one i wonder i wonder if uh maybe i mean if if your
00:37:04 dad is not otherwise mentioned maybe maybe it's possible this guy is your dad maybe willy the
00:37:09 sailor is your secret dad the whole time i mean it's not a secret he calls you son
00:37:15 yeah but he was disguising it with colloquialism right like as all good fathers do
00:37:20 disguise and their true intentions hey ben why do you hate your parents don't like you asked me
00:37:28 this before i don't hate my parents they just me and my dad would fight all the time when i was
00:37:32 younger like you they show up to digi's house to drop up a chicken or something innate and to you
00:37:39 know be pleasant for me michelle is michelle the chicken oh no i thought they brought over food
00:37:44 bring me up to you but right on three oh yeah they brought over meatballs right on three yeah
00:37:49 anyway uh they come over and they're like hi ben and you and you're just in a stupor as usual sitting
00:37:55 on the couch splayed out lethargic beleaguered that's trying to play trying to play jack jack three
00:38:02 failing miserably and you say hi mom grating your teeth that's not what happened they were there for
00:38:08 like they were there for like half an hour they were there for like a little while they stood
00:38:12 around and we chatted and then your mom comes comes to hug you and kiss you and you say stop mom
00:38:17 for my bit my friend yeah oh yeah i guess i i guess that did happen ha ha um
00:38:26 look what he's what just what what is it what do you want i want you admit that you hate your
00:38:32 parents on live television okay i it's all true um no just me and my me and my dad we're at each
00:38:40 other's throats all the time i was a little when i was a kid what could you cause possibly be a
00:38:46 throats about about that sweet old man i don't i you know he wasn't always old believe it or not
00:38:55 um i don't know you just fucking be on my case about everything all the time and it really pissed
00:39:03 me off that's it that's the story not there's there's i know it's it's there's nothing to it um
00:39:10 he's just a jerk he was like a really like uh he's very he's very particular kind of like
00:39:18 he's very he's very like detail oriented he's very much like all about fuck he's all about like
00:39:25 you know keep keep keep everything keep all your ducks in a row keep everything really like well
00:39:29 categorized keep a keep a keep a spreadsheets he would like he would like draft up um he would
00:39:37 like draft up contracts for us to sign uh a lot what he would he would he would he would be like
00:39:45 we would have like a family meeting and be like okay here are all the chores here's all the chore
00:39:51 listings or whatever here's how we're like dividing the labor of the house does everyone agree to
00:39:56 ratify this agreement suddenly so many things make sense you just say in that yeah suddenly
00:40:02 everything falls into place does everyone does everyone agree to ratify this agreement okay
00:40:05 then everyone sign like everyone is expected to sign within the week or whatever this i want to
00:40:11 say is a completely obvious assessment though it like like like like literally however it feels
00:40:19 right you can either like become brainwashed by your parents or hate your parents you know
00:40:24 it's either you either you either become them or you go the opposite yeah there's i mean i mean
00:40:29 there's no other option to do you either are like the more you aren't yeah but it's either i feel
00:40:33 like it's intense you know i feel like it's a uh neither you know nate obviously would do that and
00:40:39 does that in real life currently now you know as as i was saying that i was realizing that's like
00:40:46 very that's very that yeah the way he like the way he was at radcon was or not right the way he was
00:40:52 at the meet-up rather is just a very very that was a very dead uh way to be i wonder if he'd be mad
00:41:00 i wonder if he'd be mad hearing me say that maybe but it was why would that why would that be bad
00:41:07 you know nobody wants to nobody wants to become their parents right isn't that like a thing like
00:41:11 you know you get you start getting into adulthood and then suddenly you realize you've become your
00:41:16 parents and you have an existential meltdown um sounds like a cartoon and if you know there's
00:41:22 one thing that i hate it's cartoons uh is this procedurally generated by the way the town is
00:41:29 not i think the farm is uh or no i'm gonna go with no i don't think there is a procedurally
00:41:36 generated part there's like a dungeon in the game there's like a what yeah there are mines and in the
00:41:42 mines there are monsters that you have to like fight with so yeah yeah yeah there are monsters you
00:41:47 have to fight with swords and that dungeon is procedurally generated but i think the rest of the
00:41:52 game is not okay does that answer your question poorly uh i want a hammer i know i have to buy
00:42:05 it somewhere but i don't remember where uh so so i imagine i'm i'm i'm i'm hard on this father
00:42:14 kick as you can as you can probably tell so so so he would just get mad at you about like if your
00:42:19 room being messy or whatever or something um more sinister things yeah i guess like nothing like
00:42:28 unusually yeah i remember room being messy but like i don't know i just always thought he had
00:42:33 a shit attitude about it he was always very like like when he was mad he was very like self
00:42:41 righteous he was very like i like the reason like the like this i am not i am not upset for practical
00:42:50 reasons i'm upset for moral reasons you know like what you have done is wrong uh and i hated it uh
00:42:57 really pissed me off every every every single time i remember there was one time i think i was in
00:43:05 like i might have been in college and i was home for this and i don't remember what was happening
00:43:09 i think he was doing he was doing the thing he was doing the boomer thing he was like ben get a job
00:43:15 but don't like apply online he's like no ben you you must you must like because applying for jobs
00:43:24 online doesn't look like work right like it looks easy you're just sitting there you're just
00:43:28 sitting around the house you know sitting on the computer you know applying for jobs online
00:43:34 bullshit you gotta get out there and you gotta pound the pavement son you gotta get out there in the
00:43:39 car do you say pound the pavement yes he said pound the pavement you gotta get out there in the car
00:43:44 you gotta drive around for eight hours a day i want you out of the house in the car for eight
00:43:50 hours a day going to every fucking shitty restaurant in like in like in concentric circles around the
00:43:58 town hand them an application that's how i want you that's how i want you find and work around
00:44:05 here and i was just like oh god this is i hate i hate it i hate it this is dumb and we got mad
00:44:12 we got into a fight and i'm and i'm like i'm like livid right i'm fucking like i'm like
00:44:17 i'm probably i'm like totally losing my composure as we're having the fight and he and he's and he's
00:44:23 getting and he's getting mad too right we're getting heated and he sees that i'm heated
00:44:28 and he says he says ben control your rage and i'm like i can't believe you're a real person
00:44:39 it makes me so mad that you are who you are i didn't say that like i don't remember what i
00:44:46 said but that was the that was the feeling and that was you know so there so anyway that's why i hate
00:44:52 my parents that's a pretty good reason yeah uh what what a fucking fascinating story
00:45:01 i i'm i'm i'm i'm particularly enthralled by by pound the pavement uh hashtag that put that on a
00:45:07 shirt like pound the pavement you know it's real right it's that's like a cliche but it's real he
00:45:13 lives it i i imagine the solution to your problem would just be like have a laptop and then and then
00:45:20 like say like all right guys all right dad going going out gain some jobs and just take your laptop
00:45:24 to look at starbucks or something uh yeah i didn't exist in 1920 yeah um yeah you know i hopped i hopped
00:45:31 in my model t ford and i yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i went i went down i went down to the local
00:45:38 malt shop for a for a for a for a soda and for a syrup and soda or something and and a cigarette
00:45:47 yeah um you know that i rolled myself out of tobacco that i that i picked with my own two hands
00:45:55 that don't make i don't make them like they used to
00:46:00 isn't it weird how when people get old they just become so pathetic and sweet
00:46:05 um no have you noticed this no
00:46:13 everyone oh wait i have a oh god i'm so dumb i'm so fucking dumb munchie i could have been
00:46:18 breaking those rocks i don't need an i don't need a hammer i the pickaxe the pickaxe does it i have
00:46:24 the tool for it i'm an idiot um is there any like time uh like like uh do you have like a
00:46:30 certain number of days you have to accomplish a task no it's not like it's not like harvest moon
00:46:36 you're playing harvest moon no i know about it harvest moon i mean you can play infinitely but
00:46:41 there is like a time i think you have like a certain number of years and after that number
00:46:46 of years goes by um your grandpa like comes back no it's your dad your dad or your grandpa or whatever
00:46:54 comes back to like see how you've done and if you've done everything you need to do you get good end
00:47:00 um but the uh in this game there is no time limit per se but there is a calendar and like
00:47:08 certain events will happen on certain days of the year but like there's no limit to how many years
00:47:14 you can do shit is there a win state uh i don't think so i mean you can get married uh you can
00:47:25 get married and have a kid um but yeah is he like the npc bot that does the farm stuff for you
00:47:32 the kid no no that would be really funny here we go look at all the stone you're getting i god i
00:47:43 feel so stupid i'm sure how long are we in we're like for 45 minutes and i'm sure for the last
00:47:48 like half an hour someone has been screaming at me like you idiot just use the pickaxe just break
00:47:53 the stones with the pickaxe what did i think the pickaxe was for i don't know i just thought it was a
00:47:58 scythe but thinner that's my story like yeah gotcha i love seeing rip through that those that tall grass
00:48:09 please dude we go i'm gonna kill so many pokemon hell yeah i love this yeah this is so satisfying
00:48:16 you know you can cut the tall grass in pokemon like in the real games yeah yeah yeah with cut that's
00:48:21 so crazy i have no idea i think you you could yeah you could even as far back as red and blue
00:48:27 why yeah i know right like why did they why like i mean it doesn't detract from the game
00:48:39 no really sure but doesn't doesn't really add anything you know about it yeah no i found that
00:48:46 out and i did it and i was like oh my god this game this game doesn't even work and yet they included
00:48:52 that yeah yeah the moves just don't do what they're supposed to do and yet they were like you know
00:48:59 would be really nice to put on top of this broke ass game that doesn't work just a nice cute little
00:49:04 feature where you can cut the grass with the grass tm i think they'd really appreciate that and you
00:49:09 know what they were right it makes easy to backtrack i guess huh makes it easier to backtrack i guess
00:49:18 i mean i guess if you really don't want to have a random encounter but it's probably
00:49:22 by repel it's just faster to walk maybe if you're like maybe if you're if you're nuzlocking right
00:49:29 because they because when they were making red and blue they were planning for that no they're
00:49:33 like if someone's nuzlocking this game and like they really need to get to a pokemon center like
00:49:38 and they really don't want to have and they're like really low they really don't want to have a
00:49:42 random encounter you know let's include this this cut the grass feature um you know fell appreciated
00:49:50 whoa look at this right seed seed fell right into that oh i can't oh i can't fucking get it
00:49:58 the seaweed get the eat seaweed hell hell yeah i'm gonna eat that seaweed that refill your energy
00:50:05 um i think so is it like crafting is this like minecraft i uh you know i haven't played that
00:50:14 much of this game i know that you can take you need materials to like upgrade your tools i don't
00:50:20 know if there's like crafting from scratch but i think probably like probably there are npcs in
00:50:27 town who will like combine shit for you into potions and stuff and energy potions or something
00:50:37 we gotta play minecraft i'll play minecraft uh we did i'm we did for a while they play on rfck
00:50:44 one of these days um what i wonder what the rfck server is looking like these days
00:50:50 oh that shit oh whatever who cares hey should we give well i guess can man already want a
00:50:58 contest we should give him we should give him something for the arg he should have a princess

00:54:53 words you can say either way but i think no i'm gonna bet no i'm putting my foot down on this one
00:54:59 we were talking about productivity and and projects and we're doing some of those our lives
00:55:05 oh yeah at uh at the meetup there was a legendary long night of discussion with me you tom caroline
00:55:17 and michelle for kazi for anyone that doesn't know caroline is kazi whatever whatever well
00:55:24 okay fine who cares okay anyway in in in uh conversation it wax and waned many times
00:55:34 it ranged from various uh explicit stories you told about about you know sluts you've banged
00:55:41 yeah and and interdates you've been on and uh it eventually it eventually uh uh you know devolved
00:55:47 into a sort of understated sorrow about how much uh oh we don't uh contribute to society and how our
00:55:55 lives are uh you know not what they could be uh huh there there's written there was a lot of talk
00:56:01 about how uh we aren't productive enough about how we are uh sad saps that one right and uh i i feel
00:56:10 like i i've been on a sort of productivity uh thank space for a few months now and that was a
00:56:19 a really great conversation to have and i'm very much interested in what other people
00:56:23 had to say about their about the productivity about how they work and about uh what what they
00:56:28 accomplish and so i was happy to have that conversation that was the catalyst for uh uh
00:56:34 i feel like at least for you i mean you you had a real fire in your eyes after that conversation
00:56:39 you had a real like you know drive to to work on stuff again after us talking about how uh
00:56:46 we'll never be andrew hustling we have an updated comics every single day for a year so i'm gonna
00:56:51 eat this raw heron thanks uh uh what what and and just last night you said that you had been
00:56:59 more productive than you ever been in months so um i said that i feel that i have become more
00:57:08 productive for a hot second there i mean
00:57:13 for between between maybe like uh i don't know
00:57:24 up up to like maybe september like it's not that i didn't feel like i was working but like the work
00:57:31 that i was doing was not i would like spend like a whole week or whatever like fucking around with
00:57:40 like the store you know like the rfck storefront which was like a waste of that very i remember
00:57:46 that very vividly that was like a like a real like section of your life yeah it was like a week an
00:57:53 entire like two weeks i spent and like it's so dumb like i don't i know i know how that sounds
00:58:01 i know you think about that and you're like how could it have possibly taken that long and yeah true
00:58:10 but like i found ways i found like i was working like hard i was like going at it like
00:58:18 constantly moving between like okay you know set setting up the store you know looking like oh well
00:58:24 making making new products uh making new um uh like look like compare like making a spreadsheet
00:58:31 to like compare like prices and product margins between like the different uh you know the different
00:58:37 store like which one is the best deal which one is the has the best this which one has the
00:58:40 best that where should i make this that and the other thing you know gotta maximize gotta make
00:58:44 it as efficient as possible gotta make it you know good looking gotta make it gotta make assets
00:58:48 gotta make banners gotta make icons you know i made it i made it uh take fucking where's the
00:58:55 goddamn blacksmith where's the goddamn blacksmith munchie what did you what have you done listen
00:59:04 i'm i won't tell you where he is but all i'll say is that you'll never be able to find him
00:59:13 can you enter the sewer also you were midthought what
00:59:19 oh you're just talking about oh uh anyway and you know that that i was kind of doing the same
00:59:27 thing with endless war like i was working on endless war but like there wasn't a lot like
00:59:32 there weren't a lot of moments when i was like okay this is done like it's done and i did a thing
00:59:38 i would just kind of i don't know it wasn't efficient and it was bad like like when i did it
00:59:44 when i did um slime oids like when i finally got back to slime oids like i had left that
00:59:50 for a while because i was like oh that's hard and i don't remember how to do it but when i
00:59:53 finally got back into it like i did it and then within like a week of restarting like it was done
00:59:57 and they came out and it was a new thing and it was it was done um we've got to process this geode
01:00:03 that that's a very interesting thought about how you can do a lot of work more work than you
01:00:10 would do normally but still have it feel like you haven't accomplished anything yeah i feel like that
01:00:15 especially recently when i'm doing more long-term projects like endless war where you can do i
01:00:24 upgrade my inventory or something sorry this is pissing me off okay okay i don't think anyone
01:00:29 would be like particularly surprised to find out that i haven't been like the most productive
01:00:34 member of the pcp or anything like that for the past you know whatever three years or something
01:00:39 but i feel like it might feel like to anyone looking in that i've been particularly absent
01:00:48 like i haven't made a whole lot of things recently but i feel like i've accomplished
01:00:55 way more not just in the sense that like i've been doing things outside of the internet
01:00:59 but even just the stuff i've been doing on there has had more thought put into it and i mean
01:01:04 stuff like endless war sure you can like push an update but even that doesn't feel like it's
01:01:10 anything new doesn't feel like a product you've made yeah like i can release a new video i can
01:01:16 be like wow new video no one can deny that i've made a thing yeah but even when you're making
01:01:23 like code or something you know it may even still feel then you know you put something out you still
01:01:29 feel like it's just been you know you've added upon something it's not like a a new thing you've
01:01:34 done making yeah making slime woods felt like it almost felt like a new thing because it was sort of
01:01:40 like a game within the game but even that is still like like the product the product is still
01:01:46 endless war which you know has kind of been out so it's not like a new yeah it's a little it's a
01:01:53 little it's a little bit of a drag honestly that like yeah endless war is one thing and you can't
01:02:00 be like hey guys it's out because like it's already out yeah even though it's even though it's constantly
01:02:05 being expanded and and we probably like like like it's possibly reached its its natural base
01:02:17 you know without what do you mean well i mean like anyone who would have clicked on it from the
01:02:22 pcp audience oh i see i see what you mean um yeah well oh man i was gonna say this is why
01:02:34 we need to advertise and maybe we still do but i'm but i'm project wonderful doesn't exist anymore
01:02:44 didn't realize didn't realize did you know that you can date this guy no you can date this guy
01:02:50 i think cool yeah imagine that like an old guy he's like old and shit and you can date him
01:02:57 sick hell yeah um uh uh oh yeah project wonderful um doesn't exist anymore uh sad bad uh i was like
01:03:11 oh well i guess i'll just have to find lol the guy's got no shirt on haha i guess i'll just have to
01:03:17 find another whatever service replaced it you know and advertise with them the answer is nothing
01:03:23 replaced it all the web comics that had project wonderful ads on them now just have nothing um
01:03:29 so you know marketing opportunities gone uh i actually got a lot of traffic to my website in
01:03:38 the past i didn't do this all the time but every now and then i would advertise through project
01:03:42 wonderful and the results were not earth shattering but i definitely got traffic for what i would
01:03:49 consider to be generally a reasonable price so i'm actually pretty bummed and i think there's a
01:03:56 missed opportunity here there's lost there's a lost opportunity costs with endless war uh itself
01:04:03 um i mean the i seems like the alternative is like google ads google ad words which i don't
01:04:08 know anything about but that's what they say that's what people say is like probably the other
01:04:15 thing to advertise uh with uh but i don't know
01:04:22 yep well i mean google ad words just sounds evil it's a yeah sure sure oh my god there's a goth boy
01:04:33 oh my god there's nothing more there's like he's a killer he's a fucking killer avoid
01:04:37 avoid i gotta play this i gotta play this game like a juvie i gotta think like a juvie if i want
01:04:43 to survive oh yeah he is in this in this world it's killer be killed
01:04:49 how many i have to make uh i need to meet i need to greet three more people
01:04:56 in this world it's easily be killed in this world it's be killed
01:05:00 uh truly life is hell for a young juve what would you so so would you say that you've
01:05:16 like like how would you say you've been more productive recently because i mean do you
01:05:20 still feel that way you said for a hot second you felt competitive is that is that weighing at all
01:05:24 um
01:05:30 may it well i don't feel that productive today because like for the last couple days
01:05:35 i've done other shit and i haven't gotten anything done um so maybe you don't like it like
01:05:39 there's like social stuff yeah yeah like i fucking went on that failed tinder day at lull
01:05:47 do you want to talk about that sure i guess um well but like you know other than that like i got my
01:05:54 poo videos coming out and those are good i'm doing you know i kept i've kept to my schedule
01:05:59 for two weeks now and that feels pretty good uh i'm not actively working on the secret project
01:06:09 the secret the secret uh rfck project in the unholy slime dungeon right now um because i'm
01:06:16 kind of just waiting for kind of waiting for there to be a little more there to work with um
01:06:23 but like once it's done like the hard part will be over and it will probably take less work than
01:06:29 slime oids did to get to get that new feature up and off the ground um oh hey a plant
01:06:41 i can't okay um fuck what was i oh my date my tinder date uh man boy so all right uh
01:06:53 the way i've been i don't look at tinder much sometimes when i'm bored i will just open it up
01:06:59 and just swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe right right right right right until there's nothing left
01:07:03 sometimes although that's a lot and i don't i don't have the patience to do that anymore um
01:07:08 they'll just swipe swipe swipe swipe see how many matches i get and then don't do anything don't
01:07:12 message them or whatever such a weird system wait what it's just it's like uh yeah well it's
01:07:21 not a system bunch it's not designed to get results like you're pulling a wide net and
01:07:28 laying the fishes die on the seabed that's yeah that's literally yeah i'm passing the widest net
01:07:33 possible pulling in all the fish letting them die right on my deck yep that that's that's how it's
01:07:37 been um and it's fucking sick yeah oh i if you if you couldn't tell it's great it's the best
01:07:45 well i rest assured viewers uh uh wait what what why can't i hear you you sound like shit
01:07:51 i i do what wait you're back it might have been my headphones might have been
01:07:56 discord it doesn't matter well right i'm here rest there is the fuck no no no say it again
01:08:02 say it again say it again couldn't hear you rest assured viewers fucks if if what he says
01:08:09 is to be believed he has fucked before very hard in multiple occasions thanks thanks man that's
01:08:18 that's that's my uh statement i mean don't don't believe it but if it is to be believed which it
01:08:24 isn't um okay what what happened the day um right so i've been letting these these fish as you call
01:08:36 them as you call women so sexistly um and so aptly as well so and aptly yeah um die on on the vine
01:08:45 to mix my metaphors a little bit um but uh this this time this time you know she messaged me and
01:08:54 she's like hey how whatever and i'm like hey and um she's like i look at her pictures and like she's
01:09:01 fine and like here's the thing you expect you expect people to look worse in person than they
01:09:08 do in the picture so i'm looking at this and i'm like in the pictures she looks fine she looks
01:09:14 you know pretty all right in reality she's probably worse than all right because that's
01:09:20 how it works however however um i should probably be out of my house more often so i'm like so that
01:09:28 makes up the difference and i'm like okay fuck it so we talked for a while on tinder and we're
01:09:34 basically just like hey and and i'm just i'm just we're just like so you want to just meet up and
01:09:39 fuck around and she's like i guess and she's like but it's like you know we're gonna like meet up and
01:09:45 like chat first you know so she knows i'm not an x-murder because that's what you do you meet up
01:09:50 you briefly chat you make sure they're not a fucking murderer or a scammer or a psycho or whatever
01:09:55 and then you can fucking it's fine and whatever but so we meet up and i'm so i say so there's a
01:10:04 thing or it's like oh am i gonna go to her like i would have to take a bunch of trains to get to
01:10:07 her i say i'll do it but she could drive here and she says she doesn't care which so i'm like well
01:10:13 then i guess come here well uh did you do anything to prepare for this like like what preparation
01:10:20 like like outside your normal routine what did you do um well i had already showered that day
01:10:29 i um cleaned my room up a little bit you know just made it a little more presentable
01:10:35 and that's pretty much it i mean what else is there when you get right down to it
01:10:40 when you when you get right oh mining level precast proficiency new crafting recipe cherry bomb
01:10:47 damn damn that's that's pretty hardcore for a juvie we got a badass over here
01:10:54 uh we gotta crush this guy before he gets too powerful so you clean your room you showered
01:11:02 right and she's on her way to you she's driving she's so she's like let's meet in a public place
01:11:06 and i'm like uh how about tufts university because that's like right near my house i'm like meet me

01:11:31 car michael hall and she's like um gps doesn't gps doesn't work on college campuses and i by the way
01:11:40 this girl by the way this girl is 32 so she's like gps doesn't work in college campuses and i'm
01:11:48 a little perplexed by this but i'm like huh so i guess this means i guess this means she's using
01:11:56 gps like not google maps she's using like a gps device that's weird i think that's strange but whatever
01:12:06 we'll live right we can we can get we can get through this so she's lost on the campus she
01:12:11 doesn't know where this hall is and i'm like okay new plan because she's told she said she
01:12:15 want coffee so i'm like okay new plan meet me over at such and such cafe it's like two blocks away
01:12:21 it's over on the corner so i walk out over there and i'm waiting for maybe like 10 minutes 15 minutes
01:12:27 keep in mind it is freezing cold out like she's driving around in her car she seems like maybe
01:12:31 she's getting a little annoyed that she can't find the place i am standing out there it's freezing
01:12:36 cold my ears are burning uh while i'm waiting uh my mom texts me and says ben open your pokemon
01:12:43 go gifts um so i do that um and she arrives right and then she while i see her walking up and i'm
01:12:50 like hey and now you're like i said on tinder you expect you expect that they're gonna look worse
01:12:56 than their pictures does she look worse than her pictures yes obviously however not nearly as much
01:13:02 worse as i would as as she could have right so all in all i'm like okay you know i i can't complain
01:13:11 seriously okay i'm i'm just like okay can't complain can't complain like if they show up and
01:13:17 they're like obviously and like like another person you're within your rights to be like you know what

01:13:28 not it's fine it's it's fine is what i'm saying so i'm like okay so we go so she wanted coffee
01:13:35 however this cafe and the pastry shop that are on this corner were closed because apparently this
01:13:40 was like eight o'clock and i guess on weekdays or whatever that's night yeah um so i guess they
01:13:47 didn't they don't stay open that late on weekdays i didn't know that so i'm like hey so every so it
01:13:52 turns out these places are closed the only coffee option is dunkin donuts there's a dunkin donuts
01:13:58 like over there and she's like okay fine so we go to this dunkin donuts and we get coffee and we
01:14:03 sit down for a while and we talk about shit and it's pretty you know we're pretty we're both pretty
01:14:11 just like casual we're pretty like candid we're just like ah you know tinder ah you know she she's
01:14:17 like oh yeah you know i'm kind of like a serial like outside of tinder hookups i'm kind of like a
01:14:22 serial date or you know like a serial relationship have or i get it i jump really fast into something
01:14:27 you know too serious and i'm like all right fair you know whatever and
01:14:34 you know you know there's a but like i could go through i could go through the entire conversation
01:14:40 and and like be like point by point i don't remember most of it so actually no i can't do that
01:14:44 contrary to what i just said but the point is right like she like afterwards we get up we walk out and
01:14:50 like well as she was as we were texting before she had made a joke about like you know yeah like you
01:14:55 know you're like we'll we'll go over to your place you know assuming i don't run away in terror
01:15:00 so we get we walk outside and i'm like so are you running away in terror and she's like no i'm not
01:15:07 running away in terror but i got a text something came up you know with work and i got a deal with
01:15:13 it and i'm like okay so in my head it's like all right so i'm being i'm being dumped that's fine
01:15:18 so um so i show her the phantom you know obviously
01:15:26 as she's leaving as she's leaving i'm like hey hey so and so do you uh did you did you uh by the
01:15:31 way before you go did you see the phantom oh my god and and did she and she merely turned around
01:15:38 and said you know what i changed my mind work can wait work can wait yeah that's right um no
01:15:46 how did she respond how did like like like did she did she enjoy the phantom you know
01:15:50 did she see him i wasn't doing it to like impress her i just thought it would be funny like wouldn't
01:15:54 it be funny if i showed her the phantom right now by the way viewers the phantom is not my penis um
01:16:01 in case you don't explain it in any no no no but it's not my penis um it's it's it's it's a um
01:16:08 i mean it's another person it's the phantom there's yeah there's a person there's a being
01:16:12 there is an entity i'm relate to phantom horn before you get out of your mind yeah just just
01:16:16 i mean just guess what the phantom is and you'll never be able to do it no okay it's impossible
01:16:22 so i do so i do that so you show so i show her the phantom well i ask her if she's seeing the
01:16:29 phantom she says no and then i and then the phantom appeared then the phantom appeared coincidentally
01:16:35 and she was just she's just like oh ha ha ha and like what and i'm like and i'm like whatever
01:16:42 okay you don't appreciate she didn't care about the phantom she didn't appreciate the phantom
01:16:47 so i'm like all right no skin off no skin off my back bitch um right so i so anyway i buried her
01:16:54 in a shallow grave in my backyard um no but so you know i guess that's it i guess there's really
01:17:01 not much more to tell you that's how i got that's how i got dumped i don't know like why like you
01:17:08 know i like i get home you know i look at tinder i'm i'm deleted i'm unmatched and i'm like okay as
01:17:14 expected so i'll never know why i can only speculate um i mean do you have any speculation
01:17:22 well first of all are you are you do you like do you care like it does this affect you in any way
01:17:27 i mean this was not a person who i was highly invested in right however the the only reason
01:17:36 that i do care a little bit is that i kind of went into this feeling like i was kind of settling
01:17:43 right but i didn't like it was fine but i was kind of like i guess i guess um but then right
01:17:55 but then you know we met up in person and i was fine with her but she apparently found me
01:18:00 unacceptable for whatever reason and i feel you know i feel judged you know i feel like
01:18:07 someone who's someone who i didn't value very highly looked at me and was like no thanks and i'm
01:18:13 like huh what's what's you know you know what i mean so it's like your expectations of other people
01:18:23 and others are not the same like others of you so it's like you know like people who you think
01:18:29 aren't very good like look at you and think he's really not good so it's like you feel like i don't
01:18:36 know your standards are too high no uh it's just uh you know it's just like uh well shit man
01:18:44 you know what's wrong with me you know what what what what's uh what am i missing you know what
01:18:50 what's the problem you know what is the problem did you think did you find out no i told you i was
01:18:59 unmatched so you know i can't well how would i know do you have a speculation did the phantom
01:19:05 tell you i have a couple of guesses you know i i bet she went home with the phantom afterward
01:19:10 actually he's caught by the phantom yeah yeah um i have i have appears general store affordable
01:19:17 size 24 backpack oh fuck yeah so i have a couple of speculations oh wait wait joe jamart no fuck
01:19:24 oh i'd like to remind you are drilling operations entirely legal responsible stewardship of the
01:19:28 local enviroments of top priority i can't believe you showed her that i can't believe it didn't work
01:19:37 i know right what a what a what a downer so um i have a couple of speculations one she was a cat
01:19:44 person i said i'm not a pet person she said you know that's a sign of a sociopath and i said what
01:19:53 like can't and she and and she's like i mean she was kind of grinning so she might have been
01:19:59 joking but still like the fact that she said it is all at all i found it strange she was like
01:20:06 you know that's rat poison right yeah you know you know that's rat poison she she was like um
01:20:10 um yeah like you can not own a pet but you should at least be like oh i wish i had a dog and i'm
01:20:18 like what no and she's like yeah that's a sign of a sociopath tell me when you see a squirrel
01:20:26 when you see a squirrel on the road like when you pass a squirrel do you think about like
01:20:31 what's inside it and how you can get it out and i'm like what no and she's like okay
01:20:38 she's like well whoa wait what does she mean what's inside like like like that's not what she said
01:20:44 squirrels yeah she's like do you think about disemboweling squirrels and i'm like no and and she's
01:20:51 like okay i was a forensic psych major by the way and i'm like yeah all right sure i can tell yeah
01:20:59 it really shows and not necessarily in a good way um it's just i have a sociopath you know
01:21:08 oh yeah i'm not a dog person i like to watch squirrels get disemboweled though yeah pretty much
01:21:14 so so so that so that so i don't know if maybe she thought something about that i think more like
01:21:19 like i was joking about how small my room is right i was joking about like haha yeah it's basically
01:21:26 a closet i think she might have like believed me you know like and also like i told her that like
01:21:32 okay she definitely didn't like that i have uh housemates which fair you know i'm not even
01:21:37 gonna say they're like oh what the fuck it's fine like no whatever that that makes sense i get it um
01:21:45 so it might have been it might have been that she didn't want to come in here while there's like
01:21:49 other people live here you know i mean there wouldn't be like i mean they'd be in like separate rooms
01:21:54 but like yeah that's fair um maybe she didn't like maybe she thought oh this guy you know he's a
01:22:01 procast bitch and he's got you know his his room he lives in a closet you know no thanks
01:22:06 that while not true really you know if she believed that it's like well all right fair or it might
01:22:13 have been the dog sociopath thing probably not but you never know um yeah those are my spec
01:22:21 those are my speculations on the matter does does this like dissuade you from trying gender
01:22:28 or is this just like a blip on the radar and like you know i mean it was a little bit disappointing
01:22:32 i tried to give it but like i mean it was a little bit disappointing and it hurt my pride just a
01:22:37 little bit but like you know whatever uh that's that's that's what happens right that's that's
01:22:46 that's what that's well that well mark that's life to quote did a man after reciting your mini
01:22:54 past been uh trifles with with with the other gender yeah the lesser gender you mean yeah yeah
01:23:01 the lesser gender yeah uh are you trying like like this is i mean i don't know how often you
01:23:07 go on tinder but i've never heard of you going on a tinder date uh i um i tried to reconnect with
01:23:12 i went on i was on like before i moved in with digi like when i was living here at monkey house um
01:23:18 we'll have before i moved in with digi i was well i hadn't been for like when i when i moved in here
01:23:25 i was on tinder pretty a lot um i was doing a bunch of at some point i kind of like got sick of it
01:23:31 was like whatever uh and i stopped for a while and then in virginia beach it just didn't work
01:23:37 like there were no responses like they like i never got any matches because like nobody was
01:23:43 using it in tinder or whatever funny story okay i thought that like living near boston you would
01:23:50 get a ton of matches and that's kind of true however the matches that i get they don't come from
01:23:55 boston like never like nobody in boston is tinder it's all girls from salem like every single one
01:24:02 of them is a girl from salem i see and i don't get it i just don't fucking get it maybe when
01:24:10 you're in the city you don't like need tender uh maybe yeah maybe maybe it's like if you if you're
01:24:19 the kind of person who would use tender you are and you're in the city you would already be meeting
01:24:24 other people outside of the app so you would have no need for like a secondary source um person who
01:24:31 would need yeah like you know if you're like in a like a smaller town you know you're not gonna
01:24:35 meet as many people you'd be interested in oh wait wait for my return on the dawn of your third
01:24:40 year oh shit there is like a time limit grandpa's grandpa's coming back and he's gonna be in a mean
01:24:47 way oh shit um yes uh yeah that's a pretty good theory i believe that so so i mean are you trying
01:24:59 to take are you trying to get to another relationship no what's happening right now no stupid if i'm
01:25:08 fair uh okay i think that's pretty well covered i think we're this is pretty well covered at this

01:28:23 stcomics.com rereading the the white lion and uh i went to the about page and there's a a surreal
01:28:31 moment when i when i read that brunswick and the champion both came out in 2016

01:29:16 like early 2018 or like mid mid to late 2018 or something uh yeah i mean yeah it's a long time
01:29:28 fuck obviously no judgment i'm no better but would you say you're i mean i mean do you have
01:29:38 any like priorities or are you just trying to like like is there any methodology to this or are you
01:29:44 just uh trying to do things harder no there's no methodology i'm just trying to do things harder

01:34:06 i don't know it's i mean it from what i know tbap wasn't scripted but it was like you had
01:34:15 notes right tbap was there would occasionally be a scripted bit in it uh it was mostly off the cuff

01:40:12 said description i mentioned endless war okay well good it bears it bears mentioning yeah i i also
01:40:18 have it in my resume as programmed a computer game which is quite a lot of sort of sort of
01:40:27 doesn't sound as impressive when you say it like that you think so i thought that sounded more
01:40:31 impressive how would you how would you at most impressively describe it i mean the impressive
01:40:36 part about endless war wait oh fuck that was a bad item the impressive part about endless war is not
01:40:44 that a game was programmed it's that a game was programmed and it's a masterpiece and everyone
01:40:49 loves it yeah okay and that like you know there's a community around it you know that that's

01:43:12 okay uh the way you god who is the guy who look at this fucking bear and what i mean what yeah i mean

01:44:52 i'm a fucking cursor is turning into a hand yeah fine
01:44:56 fuck it what were you talking about i feel like we got swept up in how great that game was
01:45:01 yeah we got swept up by big iron um um i i i submitted to college yeah it feels good
01:45:09 now my plate's clean finally actually actually it's clean for a moment or two but now it's
01:45:15 going to be completely dominated by commissions again so i guess uh for all the new purposes
01:45:19 i'm still away on how it is commissions are great by the way they're really fun
01:45:25 why can't they're talk they're really useful uh to motivate you to draw every day because you
01:45:31 have to because there's money on the line you see yeah i guess uh yeah i mean they did get me to draw
01:45:39 um at times oh shit that reminds me a guy was like tentatively going to commission me
01:45:48 and i think that he thought that i didn't want to take it but i like did a sketch and like sent
01:45:54 him the sketch like two days ago or something and i don't know if he responded so i should check if
01:46:00 he responded i should check and find out if he responded he was gonna he was like he was like
01:46:07 hey yeah i'll pay you know i don't know how hard this is i'll pay like my budget is maybe 50 to
01:46:13 150 dollars for it that's a big budget yeah so you know i'm tempted you know part of me is like
01:46:22 this guy's willing to pay 150 dollars everything in line everything is worth what people will pay for
01:46:29 it and no more and no less so i should charge him 150 dollars but i don't think i don't think i can
01:46:36 justify it because i don't feel like it's a hundred and fifty dollar job it's not that hard what is it
01:46:42 he just he wanted me to draw like an icon for him oh what like um like yeah like a like a pro like
01:46:51 an well like a profile picture slash avatar image hey come over to munchie w tiny hats on twitter i do
01:46:59 it for ten dollars scoff it works that's how you know that's how you know it sucks dick because
01:47:08 it costs ten dollars yeah true but hey i walk out with a cool crisp ten dollars that that paid for
01:47:18 mini a t-ride like yeah you could go there and back wherever there is like twice on that yeah
01:47:27 exactly hell yeah fuck yeah dude i can even afford to mess up and get off at the wrong station a couple
01:47:34 times easily easily
01:47:41 ah the town of osalito road stranger one day alf no salsalito like the cookie oh like like
01:47:50 velvita the town of salsalito to the town of velvita road stranger one day i'm happy but
01:48:00 it's a recipe i don't need new friends do you ever draw without like like non-comic work
01:48:07 almost never how often would you say you draw basically basically only when i'm drawing a
01:48:15 comic well no okay you know i mean i drew that clefable thing the other day just like when i get
01:48:23 an idea for something and or i mean you know i used to draw every day i don't think i draw every
01:48:33 day anymore but like probably most days or maybe i mean not less than half i don't think
01:48:45 man i should draw every day again wait wait so you you draw mostly every week no most most days
01:48:52 oh you draw most days okay and you're like sketchbook or whatever i don't have a sketchbook
01:48:58 no i told i told you i don't like i don't have a sketchbook and i'd like don't draw other than
01:49:03 when i'm doing a comic page or when i'm like working on a thing that i put out on the internet
01:49:10 okay i told you this i i was confused i thought you said that you drew mostly every day just
01:49:18 yes that's what i said okay how can those two things be the same that exist at the same time
01:49:26 you don't draw almost never but you draw almost every day
01:49:32 no what is no i said that i draw i draw almost never except for those things that i draw
01:49:40 okay there okay
01:49:45 smh yeah clearly
01:49:50 hey what's the goal of this by the way to like date people
01:49:54 um date people get rich

01:51:47 how happy i was that you weren't drunk but same that's the same thing that's the same thing

01:52:04 it was great yeah yeah it was good i was that was i forgot how nice you could be
01:52:12 sometimes i can be nice yeah sometimes once once in a blue moon um not now though

01:56:28 explain well what did you get did you get a diploma or what did you get like yeah well
01:56:34 for all intents and purposes it's a g ed yes but it's under a different name
01:56:40 what's it called i don't want to say wait why i don't know i it's it's sort of weird i don't
01:56:48 want anyone will be able to trace me back because of it wait hold on i don't understand like if you
01:56:55 said yeah i got a g ed or yeah i got a phd or yeah i got you know such and such qualification
01:57:02 that's not that's not doxing yourself is it is that is this like is like knowing what did what
01:57:09 qualification you have like an identifying piece of information no but this is less of a general
01:57:16 diploma and it's more i imagine it's a way smaller group of people it's not like it's it's like it's
01:57:22 like a private thing that i've gotten uh all right fair fair enough i guess but anyway yeah i uh i got
01:57:34 that quite a while ago and so now i've for a while i was just like well this is my life now uh but then
01:57:40 but then like like six months i started seriously considering college now here i am uh the last thing
01:57:48 i did to do college was an essay and i had everyone review it and it was nice if you if you were in
01:57:56 the endless war homework server then then you know what i'm talking about god bless the homework
01:58:01 hey so um so again i don't want to give any details on this but we got i got the uh i got the secret
01:58:12 project being worked on by my by my slaves in the in the slime dungeon in saint ben's cathedral
01:58:20 and man i don't i'm not i'm not complaining about this i'm just it's just an observation
01:58:27 um i'm looking at the stuff people have written because it's a writing thing people are contributing
01:58:31 like bits of writing to the game and it's very frustrating not because it's bad or anything
01:58:40 but every single thing that someone writes i read it and i'm just like i would have worded this
01:58:47 in such and such way you know like i would have worded this differently and i want to change it
01:58:53 even though it's not wrong you know uh well i mean why can't you i might i might just do that i
01:59:02 can i can do it is the i mean it it's it's easier to write than it is you're still saving time it's
01:59:08 not like you're you know there's no point to having to be community outsourced then i guess you lose
01:59:13 i mean i guess you do lose the the conception of like wow get your work in the game like get
01:59:19 yeah in the game that will be i don't i don't want to do too much of that
01:59:23 i don't want to do too much rewriting i don't want to do any more than i need to
01:59:27 i mean i will do i definitely will do some hey no i wanted to give you my fucking fish
01:59:33 i just missed him i just missed him take my fish
01:59:40 alas well i mean it that's it's sort of a good thing to change it i mean rewrite it i mean
01:59:48 to make like to make like the tone of it consistent exactly i mean that's how you make a consistent
01:59:54 you know uh voice yeah i mean i definitely will do some i you know i like i want to preserve the
02:00:03 community aspect of it like i want to keep the like yeah players you know the players came together
02:00:11 to work on implementing this feature um so you know i like that part of it but you know i want
02:00:20 the tone to be consistent and you know i just want to i will probably go in and just oh look at all
02:00:26 these fucking look at all these hanging participles and and you know uh sentence and ended with the
02:00:32 preposition or you know whatever nitpick shit that might bug me that would have
02:00:41 obviously you have to be like grammar and fucking shit like that yeah it's it's mostly fine um but
02:00:47 you know there's there's always something there's always something there was a there was a there was a
02:00:53 there was a panic there was a panic in the dungeon in the work dungeon yesterday over um
02:00:59 improper improper pronoun usage um there was a big push to go back over everything you've made and uh
02:01:07 do some uh it doesn't reference any particular genders do some do some do some do some pronoun
02:01:13 do some do some pronoun uh management generally um
02:01:21 shit how do i how do i get on this subject we were talking about projects we were doing
02:01:27 right talking about about in this war and and doing oh you you had asked me when i finished
02:01:35 school and then i and then i said and then you were like cool and then said so uh endless war
02:01:39 dot dot dot right oh god boy boy howdy yeah one i need to introduce myself to one more person okay um

02:02:02 it's it's it's quite nice uh i've had an extremely like abnormal high school life
02:02:09 i know it's it's it's it's probably not like the same sort of feelings that one would have it's not
02:02:16 like man i fucking hate my teachers what a bitch or like you know oh i'm not popular
02:02:23 it i i i didn't dislike it at all really it just was annoying so i guess i just dislike it

02:02:58 map trying to get places in time and you never do sometimes they do sometimes build a coop okay i
02:03:06 gotta build a coop go to the arcade again uh no there's important you you you pivoted and you're
02:03:15 gonna walk back and then you had this look there's important shit to be done all right this business
02:03:21 to attend to you know juby doesn't just the economy this economy is not going to maintain itself
02:03:29 you have to support those local mom-and-pop businesses else you're going to yeah juju
02:03:33 fucking juju corp or whatever isn't it's gonna fuck us all over i'm wearing my slime corp shirt
02:03:39 by the way oh shit nice yeah oh we were so distinct been but i'm i'm glad on the final
02:03:46 day on the final day we were together uh we we we both had the uh the hearts of each other the
02:03:52 routing killer pride on yeah yeah we were really tsundere there like we like we never wore it at

02:04:39 come and enjoy him dude okay tom has a quality which like i like i didn't realize that i missed
02:04:46 from my offline friends like i didn't like realize was a thing that i appreciated but like tom's like

02:05:05 i liked it a lot and like i can't believe it like i can't fucking like it like shatters my world the
02:05:12 very foundation of of my interpretation of events it just like disintegrates tom is like like like a
02:05:20 joyous soul who is like enjoys my company and like expresses it and like i can't believe it
02:05:27 it's insane like it like like he'll just say like it won't even be like he's trying to like get

02:07:02 i don't know of cynical behavior you know yeah criticizing everything yeah yeah
02:07:11 it sucks yeah it's lame it's lame as hell so that's what i enjoy when i when i
02:07:18 tom hippo you you guys are are i would consider probably my best friends i remember i remember
02:07:26 we had we had like a like a like a weird confrontation i feel like i used the term
02:07:30 best friend more flexible than you and i remember that you felt really ashamed that like like you
02:07:36 were like uh we discussed best friends and i was like yeah like vince vince oh that like it was it
02:07:42 was it that was it that like i felt that i couldn't categorically i couldn't categorically place you
02:07:48 as like a definitive number one over and above all others and i was like i'm so sorry yeah yeah
02:07:54 i was like i don't care yeah yeah not a big deal yeah uh let's well meet for me personally
02:08:03 it makes me fucking pissed that you won't definitively place me over and above all
02:08:07 others so are you really no i'm no i'm joking please please know that i'm joking when i say
02:08:13 okay all right i'm i'm really fucking mad right now um just just just to warn you i'm on the war
02:08:21 path that that was that was the sort of thing where i couldn't like completely outrule that that
02:08:27 would be real i didn't expect it to be true but munchie that's such a horrible thing to say
02:08:32 how could you think i meant it well you know oh god oh i'm out well no it's it's sort of like you
02:08:43 know it's one it's one of those things that you you think and you don't want to say to other people
02:08:49 but i mean ben just says ben's an honest man
02:08:54 but he had always told the truth that he was an honest man and brandy does
02:09:02 look at the man in the mirror to understand something make a change
02:09:09 take a look at yourself and make a change if you want to make the world you know you know
02:09:15 you ever heard of a guy named michael jackson uh i don't know if i told this on stream or anything
02:09:21 oh my mom soggy newspaper whoa do read it okay i don't think this is trash
02:09:29 nice no bones about it unironically asked me uh in in full sincerity well do do kids
02:09:39 do kids these days know about the holocaust and about nazis that's a fair question
02:09:44 why no that's not if what are you joking no well look i mean i know that the answer is yes
02:09:51 but i mean imagine you're not in school you don't you don't know any kids you don't talk to kids
02:09:56 how would you know how would you know that the way you know is that like do you know about things
02:10:03 from your past like do you know things like or rather do you know about events that have
02:10:08 happened in the past before you were alive like does my mom know about abraham lincoln
02:10:12 did you know what the silver wars i mean yes so obviously a big event will be remembered
02:10:19 it will be remembered but like i mean until war two was before her time okay well i mean
02:10:24 my grandpa fought in the korean war i don't know almost anything about the korean war
02:10:30 and that's like that's more recent than the holocaust uh well first of all very slightly
02:10:36 more recent yeah like that sure but but still you know i couldn't tell you very much about the korean
02:10:44 war um well i feel like even at time it's cool i mean i don't think anyone was under the impression
02:10:54 well okay specifically with the korean war i feel like maybe some people thought that it might turn
02:10:58 into another global conflict but like even just like a few years out it was clear that was not the
02:11:04 case and the korean war was not indeed another like you know turning point in american history
02:11:11 like world war two i feel it's clear there's a difference of scale there that could ease i mean
02:11:17 i mean even the fact that like surely there's like you are aware that there's a complete over
02:11:25 saturation of media about world war two that's true um clearly you are aware that it is a big deal
02:11:32 to at least like you know moviegoers or you know what yeah yeah there's yeah there's there's so many
02:11:37 world there's so many world war two movies there's so many holocaust movies i mean yeah like obviously
02:11:42 the answer is yes i'm just saying i understand i can understand where the where the question comes
02:11:49 from if it were a lesser event if it was the korean war if i said like do you know about the
02:11:55 korean war i i would have it would have been yes we do my my dad my dad once uh he was there was a
02:12:04 time when he was unbelievably condescending to my sister my sister was maybe like 18 at the time
02:12:11 and he this is so but this makes me a little mad just thinking about it we were i don't remember
02:12:18 we were sitting at the dinner table the conversation referenced like we mentioned like hitler we mentioned
02:12:25 um uh mao mao zidang uh kim jung un or whatever you know we're talking about like dictators and
02:12:33 and stuff and you know we're we're talking about this we're saying whatever it is and my dad like
02:12:38 leans over to my sister i can't believe this man he's like by the way he says to to my adult sister
02:12:47 he says by the way these are all very bad men uh doesn't it make you feel icky i mean was it was
02:12:59 it a joke no no i get the impression that yeah i mean i wouldn't imagine that it is but like
02:13:08 it feels like there's no way it couldn't be yeah no i get that and yet and yet here we are
02:13:16 uh have i talked about have i talked about my
02:13:24 oh i want this chest oh god i need this fish sorry no the fish
02:13:32 okay okay have i talked about my a guy who lived here in monkey house briefly a guy named a chinese
02:13:39 kid named jerry who uh didn't know who elvis was uh you talked to me about this many times but uh
02:13:46 he didn't know who elvis was you didn't know like my my downstairs we don't have downstairs
02:13:52 neighbors anymore but at the time we had downstairs neighbors and their like grandma or something was
02:13:58 like turning 90 and on her 90th birthday they had a party in the backyard and they had an elvis
02:14:03 impersonator and jerry didn't know who elvis was now i wondered you know do maybe in china
02:14:12 elvis isn't as famous as he is here but i don't believe that elvis is like so big elvis is like
02:14:18 transit you know who the beetles are yeah pretty much um everybody knows him right i'm sure of it
02:14:25 i'm sure they know elvis in china oh a new record um but it doesn't even matter because it was just
02:14:30 like ethically chinese who was born there right well he grew up in america he uh half and half
02:14:36 yeah like he had spent enough time in america that no that's not that can't even be the reason um
02:14:43 he's just a fucking zoomer who doesn't know who fucking elvis is i don't even like elvis i don't
02:14:50 care about elvis but like leelo and stitch you gotta know you gotta know by the way meeting
02:15:01 going to your house oh yes you finally met dweeb you finally met dweeb and obviously like i don't
02:15:07 know anything about him in real life i don't know what he looks like so when this man before yeah
02:15:12 yeah yeah when this man entered he was like uh you know i know he was munchie and i was like oh
02:15:21 okay like i had no idea it was him until i remember i specified i remember realizing that oh yeah of
02:15:28 course you wouldn't know that this was dweeb until i told you but it didn't occur to me that i needed
02:15:33 to like point that fact out i i mean like i like you know there was a ton of other there was a gaggle
02:15:39 of other men there that y'all easily could have been dweeb i mean i didn't really like recognize his
02:15:43 voice really yeah sure yeah and you know it sounds way different on the line everything like that
02:15:48 have you ever heard him in a voice call have you talked to him in voice before yeah yeah i've talked
02:15:52 to him in a couple okay uh yeah uh yeah he uh he didn't make it to rfckcon he had plans that day
02:16:09 god i want that fucking bag upgrade oh another one of those in march by the way i don't know the
02:16:12 date yet but uh yeah good uh in like the first week oh my god is this yes you did it why did you
02:16:24 become a farmer i want to make tons of money it's more real than living in a city i wanted to escape
02:16:29 i wanted to escape my old life in the mines of getting shot getting shot every day okay cool um
02:16:37 sorry what uh i was just talking about the fact i met dweeb yeah uh you were the phantom machine
02:16:47 that night that was at your house well not by choice you guys kept bullying me to do it yeah
02:16:55 you you you couldn't i mean you you you were the only one with a vape you're the only one that
02:16:59 could do it sure sure but you you just you just you just kept wanting to see it you just wanted
02:17:06 more and more you just take and take and take well whenever we met a new person i i made been
02:17:12 reveal the phantom yeah yeah person and it like for some reason like the universe inspired against
02:17:21 us because like every single new person like this is a person who had never seen it before and just
02:17:25 by chance their reaction was less and less thrilling each time like at the end i think the last
02:17:31 person we we did is that is that is it so surprising well is it so shocking i would imagine like like a
02:17:38 new text a new test subject each time would be just as thrilled as last but you know no communication
02:17:44 you know maybe our energy level was going to maybe we were less and less enthused about it and maybe
02:17:49 that you know carried over into their reaction maybe is isaac the guy who's playing persona five
02:17:55 lucas lucas lucas the guy the guy with the the ghosts the guy oh was that the ghost that was
02:18:02 that was well that yeah he was the guy who was like let's do the seance for ghost reasons uh
02:18:10 anyway we showed it to him and and his reaction was just uh like like uh like uh
02:18:17 well that's well that's lucas okay okay yeah yeah good stuff good stuff good yeah great work
02:18:29 and it was
02:18:32 is there anyone you can make the holes disappear
02:18:36 why can't uh they i think they just disappear on their own after a while if nothing's planted
02:18:41 in them right do you want you want it nice and clean yeah i do yeah i do too no once you dig a
02:18:47 hole you just gotta like what let it fuck it's you're just you're just fucked
02:18:56 jesus my life's not gonna like this oh my god you're gonna die i'm starting shit i'm starting
02:19:02 to feel exhausted oh my god but it's okay i don't think planting seeds takes energy
02:19:08 can't eat food to regain energy uh i could but i don't have any food well i guess i have this
02:19:16 this wild potato yeah yeah i'll eat this potato yeah sick okay it did nothing for me wow cool
02:19:30 uh i can still do stuff even when i'm exhausted oh wait no i did it did refill some energy that's
02:19:35 good i can still i can still do stuff when i'm exhausted i just like move really slow
02:19:44 oh fuck oh i'm out of i'm out of water i really want to get i really want to get all my plants

02:20:38 juve um it's as much as much like real life they just uh everything whizzes by and you uh waste
02:20:46 your time on this on the surface yeah you um if you're out past a certain time you just like

02:23:14 better care of yourself and go to bed at a reasonable hour since you have no money i provided
02:23:18 your medical care free of charge dr harvey thanks buddy the pay it pays to be broke
02:23:25 it really does truly then it's it's been like a depressing nightmare to be back in san diego
02:23:31 after being in boston why because do you miss me do you just miss me that much uh bitch yeah
02:23:40 sure let's go with that yeah yeah yeah yeah when i'm in boston i feel like my life is progressing
02:23:46 i feel like i'm accomplishing things and i'm and i'm getting work done especially this trip
02:23:53 times before it's been like you know i'm on vacation you know i'm just sort of seeing the
02:23:57 sites and having fun hanging out and uh you know wasn't really getting a lot of work done but
02:24:02 especially this time like i'm uh like i like i actually i mean i was on that computer i i could
02:24:07 do i i mean i edited the drawcast there before it's a podcast there and a whole bunch of stuff
02:24:12 especially after that since i was there for such a long time i didn't afford not to so it really
02:24:16 felt like wow it sure feels great to live in a city that i enjoy and be able to you know meet my
02:24:23 friends on a reasonable basis and be able to you know go into the city and you know hang out there
02:24:29 and now it like it felt like wow sure feels great to live here uh and then uh you know i was there
02:24:36 for like a month and a half and now i'm back here it feels like wow all my progress has just been
02:24:40 undone like i like i'm i'm right back at square one and now i am toiling away in the mines wasting
02:24:46 away and just counting the days until i can go back that's how it feels oh it's fun now i'm exhausted
02:24:54 again like help um um well well you're coming back in like a month right yeah so it's not too long
02:25:01 it just it sucks and i hate it there's only a few more trips before it is actually well i mean
02:25:09 if everything goes play in only a few more trips are you going to sleep right now at 11 um i i can
02:25:16 barely move okay holy shit yeah i fucked up i shouldn't have i shouldn't have chopped that last
02:25:24 tree i could have let i could have like walked to the pier and like uh oh great i could have like
02:25:30 walked to the pier and gone fishing and made some money but uh you know i fucked up fucked it up
02:25:35 what's happening right now i'm getting a fucking dog
02:25:46 i was just thinking because i saw it's that little dog bowl up in the top left there and
02:25:50 i was like when's that dog coming turns out right now don't you think don't you think this farm
02:25:55 could use a good dog no oh my god like you can decline you can decline
02:26:01 yeah but would but would jenny the juvie decline
02:26:07 hmm well i feel like jenny the juvie doesn't have good wits about him so he'd probably accept the
02:26:14 dog no matter how much maintenance he had to do it yeah i think jen i think i think the juvie move
02:26:20 is to adopt the dog and since this isn't a role-playing experience i'm gonna do it however
02:26:26 let me make my objections very clear what's open yeah uh slime field it's slime field
02:26:40 i don't know but i'm not i'm not particularly invincible we were in that pet store together
02:26:44 you uh you you went out some some strange expressions i've never seen you make before
02:26:50 dogs are cute puppies are cute don't get me wrong they are i don't want one
02:26:57 but they're nice to look at from time to time do you do oh oh oh
02:27:03 huh say when someone else when you're at someone else's house or even just you're out for a walk
02:27:09 and you see a dog what's what's your uh it's generally positive okay it's a generally positive
02:27:16 reaction to dogs you know i i get it i get dogs i get the appeal i do but like fuck it
02:27:28 fuck it no no thanks i mean there would be there would be there would be literally no room for
02:27:34 a dog for you so it's not like it would be even be possible yeah that's true even even on a desirable
02:27:41 apparently um there used to be a guy that lived here briefly named conrad not oh no a different
02:27:48 conrad i doubt it and he uh he kept a cat here apparently and everyone hated it it was like well
02:27:55 sure yeah i mean it's a pet in the in a shared space unless it's like a really good pet like yeah
02:28:04 yeah i mean we take well like our downstairs neighbors moved out we used to pets it their dog
02:28:10 they had a a very sweet dog named mabel mabel was a pretty good dog but you know she was a hassle
02:28:17 and like she like peed on our stairs a couple of times that's not good yeah actually only i think
02:28:23 that only happened once like one time she just like they dropped her off and she immediately
02:28:27 just pissed on our front stairs like inside but you know that's life sometimes in life you just
02:28:37 gotta fucking piss on the ground shit i should have watered these like less mature plants first
02:28:47 oh no this is such a bummer i need to eat something i need to eat something like right now
02:28:54 you like all your life is just like waking up watering these plants and going to bed
02:29:01 exclamation point toil yeah exactly i don't i don't even have any money to buy food
02:29:08 jesus christ i can't can i eat the sap can i eat the sap in my inventory how do you get more money
02:29:15 well selling selling crops mainly okay
02:29:21 okay it's okay it's early in the morning so i can go fish i don't think fishing takes energy
02:29:27 so uh i can just go fish and maybe make some money that way maybe i can buy some food you wake up
02:29:34 you're immediately exhausted because all i want is just to like i just want to finish watering my
02:29:41 fucking crops so they all like grow in at the at you know as close to the same time as possible
02:29:47 i guess it doesn't matter that much because i mean i've obviously i've planted too much
02:29:54 and i can't water at all so like you know it doesn't all need to come in at once anyway
02:30:01 but hey that's just a theory a game theory
02:30:07 huh how much coin does it take to play the arcade game
02:30:13 i'm not sure it costs any money i think you know what we're doing
02:30:18 no no not big iron look there's important shit to do what could be more important than big iron
02:30:27 seaweed seaweed's not important
02:30:30 wait no i have to i have to eat it no i had to eat that seaweed no
02:30:40 the seaweed keto yeah i think so
02:30:47 uh do i need this sap do i need damn it but by the way last night in the pc in the conversation
02:30:54 we had over text you said that you were back on keto you did you ever leave i got off it for the
02:30:59 holidays okay um but i mean was that like an intentional like leave like like you you said
02:31:06 to yourself i'm not gonna be on keto for a while yeah for like a week i was oh shit no i'm sluggish
02:31:12 from over exhaustion i'm fucked i'm fucked i'm gonna die munchy i'm going to die no don't worry
02:31:20 just get a fish i can't do it i can't do it oh oh my god okay can you eat anything
02:31:30 i could have eaten that seaweed but i didn't have room in my inventory for it
02:31:35 that seaweed was my lifeline can you panhandle for money no
02:31:41 no
02:31:44 god i can't i can't let anyone see me i can't let any of my perspective boyfriends and or
02:31:49 girlfriends see me like this better walk into town and collapse in the middle um well during
02:31:56 this long walk home i'll get to appreciate jenny the juvie i just love jenny the juvie
02:32:03 i just love jenny the juvie so much i'm loving him more every moment
02:32:09 he's got good style he does i mean i mean he has the oculus rift on he's probably not
02:32:16 even paying attention to what he's doing no he doesn't he he doesn't even know he's a farmer
02:32:20 yeah he thinks he's a badass action hero and wherever he plants me down he's bringing someone
02:32:27 skull in he thinks he's a space marine
02:32:35 you are you are in my heart jenny jenny juvie first name jenny last name juvie are these cows yours
02:32:44 no these belong to um what's her name down there the girl who gave me the dog or woman rather
02:32:51 man i'm going a long way take the long way home take the long way home let's you know let's just
02:33:00 fill the rest of the episode with like saying something and then singing a song that whatever
02:33:04 we just said reminds us of sounds like a great idea that's how i feel time i don't know about you
02:33:13 fucks gotta fill up my water and can uh hey what time is it how much longer how much longer do we
02:33:20 have it's i i have like 10 minutes really okay yeah i mean we've i feel like we covered some good
02:33:29 ground we covered some ground today i feel like ground was stepped upon uh-huh but not covered
02:33:39 no i feel like it's it's like a splatoon map and we did like 60 of it uh i don't know like
02:33:50 is there more is there more you wish we'd gone into
02:33:56 maybe i feel like we could have gone more in depth about any number of the things we talked about
02:34:03 but i mean i mean i guess it's just not the way the conversation developed there's a way in your
02:34:07 head you expect conversations to go but they hardly ever pan out the way you do that you expect them
02:34:12 to well hey man um we should take this as an opportunity to reflect we should reflect on all
02:34:20 on all the things we discussed today and think about we should do another one soon right yeah
02:34:29 no i don't know uh i i'm i'm i'm a big proponent of the idea that we don't have to do rf2k is
02:34:35 so close together i know i know the game the game of youtube and the game of twitch is the
02:34:42 release regularly i know we do weekly streams but honestly i don't think we have to i think
02:34:48 that's part of what makes them special is that they're an event and also that no one gets burned
02:34:53 out no one gets burned out of rf2k you know you can get burned out of endless war since it's an
02:34:58 ongoing game but like no one's ever going to think like oh fucking man they've just like
02:35:02 run out of things to say well actually everyone thinks that every single episode yeah no one will
02:35:06 think i've heard too much you know like i like oh like jesus christ let it in really like game
02:35:13 grumps at least a video every day where they said let's play every day eventually you're gonna
02:35:16 loop conversation eventually you're going to like you know like actually really have nothing to say
02:35:22 and it will just be game commentary of over and over again which is not anything that i want to
02:35:28 me personally me personally more than happy to just comment about how my farm is
02:35:36 i'm ready to turn this into an immersive role playing experience i'm ready to develop the
02:35:40 narrative of jenny the juvie uh well uh it seems like everything's already pre-decided for you
02:35:46 i mean you didn't decide to get a dog it just like a dog just appeared on your doorstep like you know
02:35:52 i mean how much role playing can happen that isn't already predetermined by the game
02:35:56 well you know i gotta choose my my cutie my cutie gf slash bf um i gotta choose what i gotta choose
02:36:05 what crops to grow you know i got i want to grow that killer flower why are you just intentionally
02:36:11 leaving some some crops i can't pick them because my inventory is full and i'm pretty sure the reason
02:36:17 for that is that they are like uh special they're like silver parts like they're higher quality so
02:36:23 they count as a different item so i'll just have to get them uh in a second
02:36:29 i'll have i'll have to come here we go now oh wait no first i gotta water my cauliflower
