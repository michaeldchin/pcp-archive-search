00:00:00 Yesterday, I had the Thomas the Tank Engine theme song stuck in my head all day.
00:00:05 Why?
00:00:08 Now it will be in your fucking brain throughout the entire podcast.
00:00:15 Well, maybe it will be in your head.
00:00:18 It's always in my head. My name is Thomas.
00:00:21 Percy was such a cunt.
00:00:23 Hum that again. I haven't heard it in so long. I need to go back.
00:00:27 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
00:00:34 Oh yeah, oh yeah, Thomas. You're my first love. My only love.
00:00:40 Hey Jessie, we're starting.
00:00:43 Wait, we started recording, but we haven't started, started so-
00:00:46 We haven't synced. Can you hear us?
00:00:50 We hear you.
00:00:51 E. Hello?
00:00:53 Oh.
00:00:57 Hello?
00:00:58 Duh.
00:00:59 Wait.
00:01:00 Sorry.
00:01:01 That wouldn't count.
00:01:02 Is Jesse like ten seconds behind?
00:01:03 Oh, no.
00:01:04 Poor Jess.
00:01:05 Okay.
00:01:06 I mean, if you feel that's appropriate, then fair enough.
00:01:11 Fair enough.
00:01:13 Okay.
00:01:14 Take care, Jess.
00:01:15 All right.
00:01:16 See you later, dude.
00:01:17 All right.
00:01:18 Later.
00:01:19 For the viewers at home, his internet is bad.
00:01:20 He can't do it.
00:01:21 That's why.
00:01:22 Okay.
00:01:23 Cause this is all stand-in.
00:01:24 Cause this is all stand-in.
00:01:25 I mean, just cut that out.
00:01:26 No, no.
00:01:27 This is all stand-in.
00:01:28 This is all stand-in.
00:01:29 This is all stand-in, dude.
00:01:30 This is all stand-in, dude.
00:01:31 This is what the people want.
00:01:32 They want inside baseball.
00:01:33 This is what the people want.
00:01:34 Confusing messes.
00:01:35 I don't think they do.
00:01:36 Uh, but that's just me.
00:01:38 I have no idea.
00:01:39 I can't wait to give this to our new editor and just be like, here's the mess of the
00:01:42 beginning.
00:01:43 You have to try and find a way to sync it up.
00:01:44 Yes, Zach.
00:01:45 Good luck.
00:01:46 Beautiful.
00:01:47 Perfectly fine cutting it.
00:01:48 No.
00:01:49 Okay, whatever.
00:01:50 On that note, I guess the episode started.
00:01:51 Uh, welcome one and all to the inaugural episode.
00:01:55 Really organized, well thought out content cluster.
00:01:59 The PCP, the piece of crap podcast, back at it again with another episode.
00:02:03 All of the life and soul is drained from you, Nate.
00:02:06 You just look like you got to have a wood chipper.
00:02:09 I feel like I'm climbing into a wood chipper and I can't wait.
00:02:14 Here's the deal, people.
00:02:17 It's time.
00:02:18 Jesus.
00:02:19 The time is finally here.
00:02:20 The time is now.
00:02:21 The time is come and so have I.
00:02:22 I forgot what I was talking about.
00:02:24 Oh, right.
00:02:25 Uh, the editor contest.
00:02:27 So you, okay, here's your challenge.
00:02:29 Here's your challenge.
00:02:30 I'm getting my life back.
00:02:31 Do not scroll down and notice in the description where it says you edited.
00:02:37 Don't do that because as you probably could tell, we got the new editor.
00:02:41 Got a new editor, baby.
00:02:44 And it's time to announce it.
00:02:46 What'd you say?
00:02:47 What?
00:02:48 We got to say some, some honorable mentions.
00:02:49 Is that the plan?
00:02:50 Oh, okay.
00:02:51 So here's what we're doing, people.
00:02:52 So we got it.
00:02:53 We're going to let you know who did well, everybody who entered.
00:02:56 Thank you so much.
00:02:57 We're sorry to keep you waiting all so long and jerking you around.
00:03:00 But we are going to tell you some of the people who did a fine job in this here contest.
00:03:06 So here's our 11 top picks, our top 11, because we're like the nostalgia critic and we like
00:03:10 to go that one step further.
00:03:12 One step beyond you fucking fake fan.
00:03:14 Is that what he says?
00:03:15 We, we, we used a, we used a first pass the post voting system or something.
00:03:19 I don't actually know what that means.
00:03:21 Something like that.
00:03:22 It was a point, a way to point system.
00:03:24 Yeah.
00:03:25 Yeah.
00:03:26 We use social credit to determine how much each vote was worth.
00:03:28 So, okay.
00:03:29 So this is what we did.
00:03:30 These were our top guys.
00:03:31 Um, okay.
00:03:32 So, so, you know what, uh, this is not in point order, uh, specifically because I have
00:03:37 to obscure who's the winner and who's the loser here.
00:03:39 So this is totally unordered.
00:03:41 Uh, here we go, uh, John Kano, Donasaur, you Caterpillar, unusual Caterpillar, Ed, Kulik
00:03:50 64, Alden, Green Fleshy Flowers, Calazar 321, those Tismis, those, those Timmy's, those
00:04:00 Timmy's.
00:04:01 Oh, those Timmy's.
00:04:02 Okay.
00:04:03 Right.
00:04:04 And Eleazar and Oblivionfall.
00:04:06 Those were our finalists, ladies and gentlemen.
00:04:09 And if you are on that list, um, get ready because you're going to find out whether or
00:04:13 not you edited this episode.
00:04:16 Indeed.
00:04:17 Fingers crossed every point.
00:04:19 You know, we, we, we could announce that right now, you know, we could let them know
00:04:22 like the landmark announcement of their entire youth, you know, let them know, you know,
00:04:28 what will define their lives for the next like 10, 20 years, but you know, you know,
00:04:33 what if we just, we'll just dilly-dally for a little bit, you know, what if we just twiddled
00:04:36 our clip for, you know, um, 20 more seconds right here, you know, what, what, you know,
00:04:40 why, why be too hasty?
00:04:41 You know, why do you be too hasty?
00:04:42 Well, you're going to give some honorable mentions, right?
00:04:44 And even want to shout out your peeps you liked.
00:04:46 Um, no.
00:04:47 I'm 64, your pizza-chan, therefore I hate you.
00:04:51 Yeah.
00:04:52 Sam.
00:04:53 Um, oh, Pete, you, I don't know.
00:04:56 There were a lot of like, I don't know, I don't fucking remember any of them.
00:05:00 I voted in a drunken rage.
00:05:02 Everybody on that list could do the job as far as I'm concerned.
00:05:05 So that's cool.
00:05:06 Yeah.
00:05:07 Um, definitely, definitely.
00:05:08 The people who gathered to, to, to choose the finalists, we had such a hard time to
00:05:12 choose who.
00:05:13 We, indeed we did.
00:05:14 That's why it took like three years.
00:05:17 Um, it was a nightmare.
00:05:18 We had to have one of these patented, awful, Nate, quote unquote, fair processes no one
00:05:23 likes.
00:05:24 Exactly.
00:05:25 So, you know.
00:05:26 It wasn't a dictatorship and that was truly our downfall.
00:05:28 Man.
00:05:29 Okay.
00:05:30 So there were a lot of like really creative like layouts and like art styles that went
00:05:33 into a lot of these.
00:05:35 And personally, what I would like to do and what I plan to do is, um, okay, well, what
00:05:39 we did was we recorded like a 15 minute sort of test script or a test episode and gave
00:05:44 it to the editors to edit together.
00:05:46 And what I plan to do is take a bunch of those hang on, Ben, if you say it, maybe you'll
00:05:50 never make it.
00:05:51 Do you want to just hold on and make the thing?
00:05:53 Or do you want to let people know?
00:05:54 No, let them know.
00:05:55 Like I basically, it'll be like piece by piece, putting the episode together, but composed
00:05:58 out of like what everyone made.
00:06:00 I think it was in particular, I had like a really cool like layout and like, even though
00:06:04 we didn't end up picking it for the winner, I think it deserves to be shown.
00:06:08 Wait to spoil.
00:06:09 Ben, you just spilled the beans about shot him down.
00:06:13 Okay.
00:06:14 He's, it's all right.
00:06:15 He's a smart boy.
00:06:16 He figured it out.
00:06:17 Sensor that.
00:06:18 Sensor that.
00:06:19 Oh my God.
00:06:20 Oh my God.
00:06:21 No, it's okay.
00:06:22 Sensor everything.
00:06:23 All those.
00:06:24 Okay.
00:06:25 All right.
00:06:26 Let's re-sync.
00:06:27 Let's re-sync.
00:06:28 Let's start over.
00:06:29 No.
00:06:30 No, we're keeping it in.
00:06:31 Sensor it will save us.
00:06:32 We're keeping that in and we'd censor it.
00:06:33 You hear that editor?
00:06:34 You're censoring those things.
00:06:35 It's crucial.
00:06:36 It's like the worst way could have possibly have gone.
00:06:37 We spent like literally an hour just like, like dictate exactly like the minute details
00:06:41 about how we would announce it, win, and what like order we would announce the finalists
00:06:45 and the winner.
00:06:46 And we're just, oh, fucking, you know, there's some people here.
00:06:49 Keep all that in.
00:06:50 Keep all that in.
00:06:51 Sensor that.
00:06:52 Sensor that.
00:06:53 Look, it was not my fault.
00:06:54 I fought for a real start.
00:06:56 You people overthrew me.
00:06:57 You people.
00:06:58 Yeah.
00:06:59 You people.
00:07:00 All right.
00:07:01 I was just saying, he's not the only one.
00:07:02 Hey, a bunch of them have like really cool layouts and I want to show them off and I want
00:07:04 to let people see the work because a lot of these, a lot of people put a lot of work
00:07:08 into the submissions and I'm going to, we're going to, we're going to feature them in a
00:07:11 thing.
00:07:12 I am committed to this.
00:07:13 Okay.
00:07:14 Well, cool.
00:07:15 We'll hold you to it then.
00:07:16 And so will they.
00:07:17 Yes.
00:07:18 Please hold me to it.
00:07:19 Ha ha.
00:07:20 Anybody, anybody else want to shout any honorable mentions that you liked?
00:07:21 Oh, by the way, there was like 50 entries, I should say.
00:07:23 I believe there was exactly 50.
00:07:25 Were there?
00:07:26 Yeah.
00:07:27 Yeah.
00:07:28 I think so.
00:07:29 It's hard to say because some of them were questioned like oblivion falls was in particular
00:07:31 was like, we didn't think it was a real submission until we like specifically asked
00:07:35 like, Hey, do you want us to consider this like for real?
00:07:38 I mean, yeah, that's true.
00:07:39 That's true.
00:07:40 And there was another one too.
00:07:41 So another guy finished his and submitted it and said he was doing like when we said,
00:07:46 when we did our hilarious update and said like, Hey guys, you actually feel free to
00:07:50 like make fresh visuals and whatnot.
00:07:53 This person kind of, it's on the charts on the bottom.
00:07:56 Like they said, like, I'm going to make a new one.
00:07:57 And then they're like, I actually don't have time.
00:07:59 So please just don't count.
00:08:00 Like day one, he turned in a submission and they just didn't, you know, then he realized
00:08:05 I don't have time to do this, which I totally respect.
00:08:07 That's totally cool.
00:08:08 Better to realize it now.
00:08:09 What the fuck is it?
00:08:10 I've got it right here.
00:08:11 It is, it is scroll down.
00:08:14 God damn it.
00:08:15 Fucking one spar.
00:08:16 That's who it was.
00:08:17 A good old one spar.
00:08:18 Oh, that guy.
00:08:19 We all know that guy.
00:08:20 Yeah, that guy.
00:08:21 He's iconic.
00:08:22 Whatever happened, whatever happened to one spar, whatever happened to one spar weekly.
00:08:25 I had my finger on the pulse and now I don't.
00:08:27 Good question.
00:08:28 Good question.
00:08:29 Are one spar and center point 3000 the same person?
00:08:32 I think so.
00:08:33 I don't think so.
00:08:34 I don't think it's distinct, but similar.
00:08:35 Might as well be the same.
00:08:36 Well, center point was another contributor.
00:08:39 He was another entry, so unless the same person entered under two different names, I don't
00:08:43 think so.
00:08:44 Unlikely.
00:08:45 Rest in peace, center point.
00:08:46 Center point starred in my hit video, feeling closer to death, so appreciate that.
00:08:51 One spar is struggling right now with multiple systems, you know, he's got multiple personalities
00:08:55 in his head and they all have different Twitter handles.
00:08:57 You know how it is.
00:08:58 You know how it is.
00:08:59 I thought you were going to say multiple sclerosis and I was going to be like, oh, and
00:09:02 tug my collar.
00:09:03 No, no, did not.
00:09:04 Was not going to go that dark.
00:09:05 Guys, my joke that we that we wouldn't get to the finalist was turned into reality.
00:09:11 I should have known.
00:09:12 Listen, we can't give the people waiting any longer.
00:09:15 That's true.
00:09:16 Wait, let me just say the other honorable mentions.
00:09:18 I just had a fellow human.
00:09:20 I picked top 10 whatever.
00:09:22 Fellow human person was good.
00:09:24 Everything was moving a lot, like almost too much, but there's a lot of movement.
00:09:28 I appreciate that.
00:09:29 It stimulated my lizard brain.
00:09:31 So Dell, Dell was up there and also zero and hoodie.
00:09:35 Those are all my top 10 in addition to the others that were picked.
00:09:38 But OK, that being said, let's move on.
00:09:40 Let's actually announce the real winner, ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be eviscerated.
00:09:46 And the winner is Oblivion Fall wins Oblivion Fall came in with the animator chops, the
00:09:58 editing, audio quality, copyright strike, just so people know the full story with him.
00:10:09 He made his submission said not to be counted up front and he made it just to flex on everybody
00:10:15 else.
00:10:16 He said it was just a flex to prove that he was the most powerful and he was the most
00:10:20 powerful from the start.
00:10:22 It's very true.
00:10:23 And then when we're at the end, we were like, Hey, are you sure you don't want to because
00:10:26 this is really good.
00:10:27 And he was like, No, OK, I'll do it.
00:10:30 So yeah, I told him I knew it.
00:10:32 I knew he was a filthy liar.
00:10:34 It was almost unfair.
00:10:35 Yep.
00:10:36 So Oblivion Fall, welcome to the PCB family.
00:10:38 Bring, bring, bring, bring.
00:10:39 Yes.
00:10:40 Hello.
00:10:41 Yeah.
00:10:42 Sorry.
00:10:43 Call from corporate guys.
00:10:44 The contest is canceled.
00:10:45 We still have to edit ourselves for another eight years.
00:10:48 Also you're adopted.
00:10:49 Uh-oh.
00:10:50 Uh-oh.
00:10:51 We didn't make enough on patreon.com slash the procrastinators to pay an editor.
00:10:54 So looks like you're on ice.
00:10:56 You're on ice, buddy.
00:10:57 Yeah.
00:10:58 That's that's support us.
00:10:59 Please.
00:11:00 Please pay us more.
00:11:01 I'm just saying, if you feel bad about editors not getting paid enough, give us more money
00:11:05 so that they get a larger share.
00:11:06 If you don't want to give us money, think of Oblivion Fall.
00:11:09 Think of poor Oblivion Fall slaving away, you know, like whittling away at his podcast
00:11:16 episodes, slaving away on his cuphead animations, like, like, like a, like a, like a, like a
00:11:22 pro.
00:11:23 Indeed.
00:11:24 Just trodden under the boot of society.
00:11:26 Uh-oh.
00:11:27 As our newest ward soon Oblivion Fall will blossom into Oblivion Summer.
00:11:32 Wait, after fall comes winter.
00:11:36 Don't say that.
00:11:37 No, don't say that.
00:11:38 Don't say that.
00:11:39 Oh no.
00:11:40 Winter is approaching.
00:11:41 I think, I think you gotta, you gotta admit though at the end of the day Oblivion Fall
00:11:42 being the winner does make the most sense thematically because because he procrastinated
00:11:46 the entire contest and then decided right at the very end he was going to take it seriously.
00:11:50 And in a way he procrastinated, although he made like an amazing entry, you know, early
00:11:54 on.
00:11:55 But okay, I get your point.
00:11:56 I get your point.
00:11:57 It's brand recognition.
00:11:58 Right.
00:11:59 Good point.
00:12:00 Yeah.
00:12:01 Although you could say that he fulfills the other spirit of the procrastinators by perhaps
00:12:05 procrastinating on his many other like animation jobs to take the time to make the editor submission,
00:12:10 which is the spirit of procrastination, you know what I'm saying?
00:12:13 I think the real winner of the editor contest were the friends we made along the way.
00:12:17 I was, I was, I was expecting that.
00:12:20 That's fair.
00:12:21 It's just so true.
00:12:22 And you know what?
00:12:23 It's just so true.
00:12:24 It's unironically true because a lot of great people submitted.
00:12:25 Eleazar, I think Eleazar learned how to edit apparently for this contest and I'm just
00:12:30 going to tell you, he was tied for number one with green fleshy flowers.
00:12:33 Eleazar overrated.
00:12:35 Green fleshy, for me, there's no, for me, it's all about that green fleshy flowers.
00:12:39 Just for those who are curious.
00:12:40 And that unusual caterpillar and that Q like 64 baby.
00:12:42 Indeed.
00:12:43 I'll give you the top 10 according to our voting.
00:12:45 Okay.
00:12:46 Eleazar and green fleshy tied for first.
00:12:47 Alden in third place, unusual caterpillar in fourth, Donasaur in fifth, John Kano sixth,
00:12:53 Ed seventh, Kula 64 eighth, Kalazar three to one and ninth and those Timmy's in tenth.
00:12:58 Oh, look at those Timmy's baby.
00:13:00 Oblivion fall wasn't on it because he said it was a joke, but then just.
00:13:02 So what you're saying is that after we procrastinated all that time and like try to do all these
00:13:06 things and spend all this time dividing like a voting system, none of that mattered in the
00:13:10 end.
00:13:11 Of course it mattered.
00:13:12 100% mattered.
00:13:13 I mean, if it didn't matter, it was because oblivion fall, you know, misled us with his
00:13:18 liberate.
00:13:19 It's just a prank, bro.
00:13:21 So you know, get mad at him if I fucking got us good.
00:13:25 Shit.
00:13:26 I feel, I feel pretty pranked.
00:13:28 You know, a lot of people or a lot of the submissions were pretty much, they didn't have a lot of
00:13:34 like editing per se, like a lot of motion, but a lot of people did have like a just sort
00:13:38 of do like a cool sort of their own art style interpretation of it, like they just sort
00:13:43 of drew our heads in their own style or like did like a pixel art style.
00:13:48 I remember a chuck chucklehead 95 had like a cute pixel aesthetic and like retro PK.
00:13:54 So just drew us in his own little thing.
00:13:56 I don't know.
00:13:57 This is why.
00:13:58 PK his art was great and I love the layout of that.
00:14:02 It was really nice.
00:14:03 Big, big, big fan.
00:14:04 I was pretty impressed by Dona sores just like really pleasing like, I don't know, there's
00:14:09 like a video of like plants in the background with like some waveforms going on and stuff.
00:14:13 I thought that was real neat, but very Zen unusual caterpillar and some cool like eighties
00:14:18 aesthetic thing going on.
00:14:19 I think that as well.
00:14:20 I think unusual caterpillar and Qlex both did like an eighties like vaporwave kind of.
00:14:25 Yeah, I think so.
00:14:26 Which I really liked both of I forget Alden's off hand.
00:14:30 What was Alden's again?
00:14:31 Alden's.
00:14:32 Oh, he didn't he do do do like the drawings and like I was a butterfly, wasn't that the
00:14:38 one?
00:14:39 Yes, that's the one.
00:14:40 Oh, yeah.
00:14:41 That was weird.
00:14:42 That was just weird looking.
00:14:43 I don't know about that.
00:14:44 You guys all loved it, but I liked it enough, but I didn't like the air raid segment.
00:14:55 I just in my notes.
00:14:57 Oh, yes.
00:14:58 I remember that.
00:14:59 In my notes.
00:15:00 I put down just like no more of that, please.
00:15:03 Green fleshy flowers had like a really cool thing where like it was it was it was in like
00:15:08 a basement or like a room full of like TV monitors and the TV monitors like turned on
00:15:14 with our faces on.
00:15:15 I like that so much.
00:15:17 That was a really cool idea that we may rip off.
00:15:19 Yeah, it's great.
00:15:21 Who was the one who there was one where like the whole screen was like a soundboard and
00:15:27 it had like our waveforms on it and like in the waveform you could see our like logo.
00:15:33 I can't remember who that was.
00:15:34 I remember that.
00:15:35 God damn it.
00:15:36 I really liked some like green fleshy definitely did this where like there were multiple screens.
00:15:40 So like if you have images to edit like big fat mama as she was, you know, famous in
00:15:44 that episode, which I've heard a thousand times now, like, you know, images like that,
00:15:49 like there was a designated screen for them to like go on to.
00:15:52 It was a cool touch.
00:15:53 Oh, yeah.
00:15:54 Yeah.
00:15:55 The like front screen.
00:15:56 But then again for visibility, the thing about green that was interesting was like I didn't
00:16:00 actually know if that was necessarily for the best because those are kind of small and
00:16:03 there was a lot.
00:16:04 I don't know.
00:16:06 I liked it and I was impressed by it obviously.
00:16:08 But some of the layout choices were conflicting.
00:16:10 Now, now of course, if like green was our only.
00:16:12 Oh, wait, it was John Cano.
00:16:13 John Cano was the one where everything was like the whole screen was like an audio mixer
00:16:17 layout.
00:16:18 Oh, yeah.
00:16:19 Pretty sure.
00:16:20 Yeah.
00:16:21 Okay.
00:16:22 Again, like all of these things were great and we could have worked with any of them,
00:16:23 but yeah, just lucky to have very talented people.
00:16:26 So, you know, it was it was truly an embarrassment of riches we were faced with picture me with
00:16:33 that DJ Khaled holding my head and with suffering from success across the top of the of my new
00:16:40 album.
00:16:41 All right.
00:16:42 Is that what his album is called?
00:16:44 Yeah.
00:16:45 Does he even make albums?
00:16:47 He's a producer.
00:16:48 So, I think so.
00:16:49 I think he raps a little.
00:16:50 No, I think he's just a producer.
00:16:51 I don't know if he raps.
00:16:52 Yeah.
00:16:53 Okay.
00:16:54 Anyway, any final thoughts because I think we're ready to move past this forever and
00:16:59 be done with it.
00:17:00 I'm glad it's finally over.
00:17:01 The fucking Herculean effort that I observed and did not participate all that actively
00:17:06 in is finally behind.
00:17:07 Indeed.
00:17:08 But I'm sure it was really stressful to watch other people try and really hard on.
00:17:11 Yeah.
00:17:12 Because like I was just watching from on high.
00:17:13 I've been like, do I have to intervene and fucking save these peasants from themselves?
00:17:16 You all know with Tom's guiding hand, it would have been done with a slickety split in a
00:17:22 smack.
00:17:23 Exactly.
00:17:24 Well, he did have to listen and vote on them.
00:17:25 So, fair enough.
00:17:26 Well did.
00:17:27 Uh, except.
00:17:28 Except me?
00:17:29 I think.
00:17:30 Except me.
00:17:31 Except me.
00:17:32 Munchies didn't give a shit.
00:17:33 I didn't vote at all.
00:17:34 Completely abstained.
00:17:35 Yeah.
00:17:36 Munchies spat on every participant individually.
00:17:37 That's 50 spits he did one at a time.
00:17:39 Because deep down, Munchies still mad because from if we go rewind all the way back to like
00:17:43 PCP episode like 10 when we talked about the redesign and Munchie was always saying he
00:17:47 was going to do it.
00:17:48 And now it's out of his hands and out of pure spite.
00:17:52 Oh God.
00:17:53 Remember that?
00:17:54 Time for me to give my top three overrated editor submissions that everyone liked even
00:17:58 though they sucked shit.
00:17:59 Eleazar Alden, Donasaur.
00:18:02 Get fucked.
00:18:03 Everyone else voted for them except me.
00:18:06 Wait, no.
00:18:07 Digi didn't.
00:18:08 Jesse didn't.
00:18:09 Okay, it's not entirely true.
00:18:10 I didn't.
00:18:11 Uh, whatever.
00:18:12 Okay, so there's other people of good taste as well.
00:18:13 I just, I just resent.
00:18:14 Oh, wait, wasn't true.
00:18:15 It was actually just needlessly mean for no reason.
00:18:16 Oh, shit.
00:18:17 Oh, God.
00:18:18 Oh, fuck.
00:18:19 No, I just, I just, I resent everyone who made it into the top 10 who I didn't personally
00:18:22 vote for.
00:18:23 I'm a pained appearance without some shade being thrown.
00:18:25 You're, you're encroaching on my safe space.
00:18:26 Uh, and I just wanted to thank our top six guys.
00:18:29 We sent them all questionnaires to give us like extra info.
00:18:32 I very much appreciate you guys doing that for us because we, we took you guys all seriously
00:18:35 and we're really thinking about who'd be the best choice.
00:18:37 Yeah, we did.
00:18:38 Yeah.
00:18:39 Thanks.
00:18:40 Appreciate all the effort.
00:18:41 We did not underestimate you.
00:18:42 Yeah, like I said, it was very difficult to choose between the finalists.
00:18:46 Yup.
00:18:47 And don't, we appreciate all the work.
00:18:48 Which is why, which is why I procrastinated on brands so long before I voted.
00:18:52 took me forever to get around to because I just didn't want I didn't want to crush the dreams of
00:18:58 all those those delightful shining faced young people out there who just who just want to who
00:19:04 just want to you just want to reach out and be a part be a part of this grand project known as the
00:19:09 procrastinated listen uh listen to Ben's new album that's uh suffering from kindness that's him you
00:19:15 know sadly looking down he's too kind just too kind to help anyone uh well oh you also
00:19:24 DeVoo didn't vote but he's been AWOL so yeah that's fair you want to talk about how DeVoo's dead
00:19:29 I mean there's not much to say he's just doing other shit I guess mayor may come back one day
00:19:33 I don't know it was just literally AWOL well he uh you know he he tweeted about it I don't know I
00:19:38 think it's interesting I think it's relevant okay talk about here sure apparently he whoa hold on
00:19:44 there buddy boy what what what did he say in the tweet because you might be about to say something
00:19:49 he didn't say in the tweet no I'm not gonna say what you said what I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
00:19:53 reveal your secret cache of knowledge just saying he's like he's like just going yeah just just going
00:19:59 completely AWOL it's not a huge change from the internet to work on his stuff or is it just his
00:20:04 game in hardcore with his game or not he's he's focusing on on other aspects of his life other
00:20:11 he said he's going to go he said he's gonna work on getting a real job and okay and something in his
00:20:18 tweet longer said something about like trying to use that experience to like hopefully build
00:20:24 like a game dev career in the future that's like more sound sounds like he's going home
00:20:31 to be a family man now go home to be a family man I've always put forward that it's perfectly
00:20:37 I mean it's easy to do the PCP and you know anything else it's a once a week commitment
00:20:42 and I guess the not even you don't even have to show up to all the episodes yeah but I think
00:20:45 it's more that he just doesn't want to you know he wants to get his baggage out of behind him and
00:20:50 I don't know be a real person in the real world or something hey god bless him you know whatever
00:20:55 fair enough sure whatever man I mean I don't want to do it but if he does cool whatever makes
00:21:02 him happy yep man more power to him well although I know I know every every every once in a while
00:21:08 there's an outcry there's an outcry in the comments of where's DeVoo I mean that's true that's
00:21:12 true DeVoo does have a he has a loyal a vote is a vocal I wouldn't even say a vocal minority
00:21:19 because it's not even that small yeah there's a vote there was a segment of the PCP population
00:21:23 there's a vocal community yeah that is vocally that vocally craves craves more of that DeVoo sauce
00:21:30 they think back to the virginity cast and they want get me some more of that sir I want an
00:21:34 extra heaping of that business over here and I don't blame him no it's fascinating indeed indeed
00:21:40 he's doing well you know I've at least talked to him and he's doing well uh so this isn't
00:21:46 they're sad enough this isn't uh you know he's not leaving on a bad note here but just you know
00:21:52 can we get a lowercase o and seven in the comments a little salute he talked he talked to me on
00:22:00 discord very briefly about uh eating too much sugar and I advised him to look into stevia
00:22:07 or sucralos and that's like that's how much I've interacted with him in the last like six months
00:22:14 yeah get a ping over here and then we talk briefly that's fine hello yeah oh no oh my god
00:22:22 you recording hippo I'm recording I'm sorry I'm late I just had we announced the winner of the
00:22:26 editor contest oh hooray what's that bread doing in your mouth get that the hell out of your mouth
00:22:34 hey it you guys can't chew in class I finished my chewing it's all done I had an I had a baked
00:22:41 beans on toast oh the what's that your cheek what's that on your little bit of a cheek right there
00:22:45 you got a little bit of a chip on the cheese did you put cheese on it did you have cheese on it
00:22:49 uh no that's not just cheese it's not good ew and beans and toast gross do you put cheese can
00:22:54 we just like ban cheese cheese is illegal uh as far as I'm concerned uh I've learned to love cheese
00:23:00 I've learned to love cheese because it's keto it shouldn't be it should be banned is what it should
00:23:05 be what what do you got against cheese Nate there are two states of being for things in this world
00:23:09 keto and ban this one needs to shift to bang what's right tell me tell me your cheese grievances
00:23:14 your cheese while while cheese may while cheese may be keto and those with the correct uh knowledge
00:23:21 and power to use it effectively I'm sure it can do good things but that's not how it's used especially
00:23:26 out in Ohio where you buy fucking chili you buy a fucking salad and it comes piled high there's
00:23:32 like more cheese than salad yeah on that fucking thing this is it's a misuse of the power of cheese
00:23:38 and it's fucked up and I'm just ready to cut the cord you know when I when I used to you know before
00:23:43 I got into keto in the times in the past when I tried to like you know lose weight tried to like
00:23:48 do a traditional diet like a low-fat diet like cut my calorie intake I would always for go cheese
00:23:55 because I was like well okay yeah like I'm gonna eat a burger right well I can eat a hamburger or
00:24:00 I can eat a cheeseburger and the cheeseburger is like an extra like 150 calories and it doesn't
00:24:04 like huge you know some people will fight me on this but I don't think that like adding cheese to
00:24:09 like a burger like hugely increases the enjoyment of it I don't think it's like a game changer or
00:24:15 anything so I was I was always fine like I'll have the normal thing cut the cheese that cuts like
00:24:20 you know a third of the calories cut the cheese guys am I right in what I'm saying I'm losing to a
00:24:25 bird but now but you know now that I'm keto now that I've got the all the powers and privileges
00:24:32 associated with that I've got a flipped a flip the script on cheese are you like are you like a vegan
00:24:37 man from scott pilgrim with your superpowers I was yeah exactly only only with vegan man
00:24:41 you get weird like psychic powers with with keto with keto you just get pure kidney stones it's
00:24:47 just pure kidney stones ladies and gentlemen at light speed would you like to relate to us that
00:24:53 story then well yeah so the way I found out about this is we were going to record a stream
00:25:00 on rowdy fuckers cop killers and then you message me early that morning say I can't do the stream
00:25:05 today I've got another kidney stone oh my god I didn't know there was a second one there was yeah
00:25:11 on Friday you know you know first you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on
00:25:17 kidney stones slash keto so what do you have to what how are you going to repent this obviously
00:25:22 terrible lifestyle you're leading um listen I might have kids drink more water yeah yeah I'm
00:25:29 gonna drink a lot more water I think that's okay like I people say like soda people say
00:25:36 energy drinks people say caffeine I've here I've heard these things I you know I gotta look more
00:25:41 into this because I did some cursory googling and not exhaustive by any means but I actually
00:25:47 found an article saying that caffeine intake is actually linked to a lower instance of kidney
00:25:51 stones so caffeine sure but maybe it's like the so isn't it sodium deposits generally so I mean
00:25:57 well the caffeine might help maybe the sodium could be calcium calcium I don't know see I don't
00:26:01 know enough I need to find out more before I could form like a really solid opinion but I
00:26:05 definitely should be drinking more you should you should check to see if if the articles that you
00:26:10 read have sources that are like to oh like coke by bang like this one this this one this one I'm
00:26:19 talking about was specifically like an academic like journal was it peer reviewed the association
00:26:24 of modern-day potion chemists yeah yeah it was pretty good this was very official but I need to
00:26:28 buy the point that I need to find out more um anyway so yeah I woke up on Friday at like 5 a.m.
00:26:33 feeling a certain pain being like oh god oh god and it got worse over the course of like half an
00:26:39 hour and I'm like yep here it is again and I'm like okay I'm gonna go to the doctor no because
00:26:45 going to the doctor is really expensive and I don't want to do it and all they really did last time
00:26:50 was give me some well they gave me morphine for a little while and then they just sent me home
00:26:54 with some percocet and I was like well I've still got a bunch of that percocet so I guess I'll just
00:27:00 try that and I did so for the rest of the day what I did was I would take a bunch of percocet
00:27:05 try to sleep fail like 15 minutes later the pain would be too bad I'd wake up however I discovered
00:27:11 that taking a hot shower made the pain mostly go away so I would take a shower for like 40 I would
00:27:17 sit in the shower for like 45 minutes try to sleep for like 15 minutes not be able to take
00:27:22 another shower for another like 45 minutes and then I just repeated that cycle for like 26 hours
00:27:27 straight um perhaps some sort of warm compress would have you know been a good water bottle maybe
00:27:34 not it's not a bad idea it could have worked maybe but uh the shower was good trying to sleep
00:27:39 through it made the time pass faster and it only lasted I think at around like 3 a.m. the next morning
00:27:45 or no maybe like 6 a.m. the next morning I woke up feeling a little better and I was like I think
00:27:50 it's over I think it's done well Ben I got some sad news for you because the pain was the least of
00:27:55 your problems your kidney stone has depreciated in value oh what I'm gonna spend what 40 grand on
00:28:01 this keystone he's gonna pop out another one next week no well see I didn't I didn't catch I didn't
00:28:06 catch this one I didn't have the mesh so so this one this one was lost to the ether oh but now the
00:28:12 great hunt begins through the sewers once you've made six kidney stones then you can put them in
00:28:20 the keto gauntlet and then you'll be you'll be all and if you get seven you can summon the keto
00:28:27 dragon dragon one wish you know when I stamp my fingers half of all carbs on earth can we make
00:28:35 that a hundred percent can we get that up to a hundred percent please Ben just starts snapping
00:28:39 furiously I gotta get rid of all of them I guess I gotta get rid of all this fucking the Zeno's
00:28:45 paradox I keep half you didn't have it I can't get zero there will always be the the primordial
00:28:52 carb will continue to spawn you gotta fucking take it down we gotta track the fucking car broaches
00:28:57 you can't every time you squish one more just keeps showing up no hey speaking of Thanos I'm just
00:29:02 curious please no spoil please as anyone seeing the new avengers I'm probably seeing tomorrow morning
00:29:09 is the plan oh I want to see it I want to see it as well I'm going to uh team up with a local friend

00:29:39 finds out mage what would have god smites us for our sins mage then smite you know speaking
00:29:45 speaking of this though I just I think we've talked about this before but uh movie theaters have
00:29:49 become such a luxurious experience they're pure decadence so I'm gonna fucking get my lady dress
00:29:56 her up in her finest whore's makeup and we're gonna go out and we're gonna hit the town and we're
00:30:01 gonna get like a fucking pizza delivered to us in the movie theater while we sit there just you know
00:30:06 pure decadence movie theaters have fully shifted from like cheap bullshit to just like complete luxury
00:30:12 like they've got like like recliner chairs yeah that's got like they got it okay okay every single
00:30:18 movie theater just has like bars in it now there is everything I've had like fucking liquor in it now
00:30:24 okay but here's something even got the notion to put liquor in it man that's a waste of watermelon
00:30:31 you see it's interesting that you cut all the guts oh my fucking god you know what I'm talking about
00:30:37 I remember the video I can't remember it's like the guy you're talking about pdps pd greens
00:30:41 washington I want to hear what Tom has to say guys nobody listens to me mage it's fine no it's not

00:30:57 sorry oblivion fall I'm sorry you have to edit through this mess this is your inaugural episode
00:31:02 I was actually interested Tom uh in your discussion of movie theater well well the
00:31:07 interesting thing I was going to say is that I'm going to go see the movie tomorrow but I'm going to
00:31:10 the theater in my hometown which is like a fucking time machine because you go in there it hasn't
00:31:16 changed in like 20 years I've been here so it still has the shitty seats it has none of the
00:31:21 recliners has none of the new services like you you still have to like bomb in and like hunt for a
00:31:26 seat you don't get to reserve your seat or any that shit so it's just like going back to like the
00:31:30 90s and it's just like disgusting you know when I was young we used to go till it was like the
00:31:36 it was like uh I forget what it was called but there was a movie theater that would specifically
00:31:39 play like movies that were like out of the main cycle Patriot cinema Patriot cinema yeah Patriot
00:31:44 cinema there was like a dollar fifty oh yeah we went to the zeotrope that they did that the
00:31:49 zeotrope the zeotrope that was called but did the same thing were they growing like were they
00:31:53 growing aliens and like tubes underneath uh no well maybe they're gone now so maybe they
00:31:59 went home uh they were just fun trying to fund their reason I haven't been to the cinema in like
00:32:04 over a decade no no less than a decade hippo tell me tell me how are theaters nowadays made you
00:32:10 goddamn neat get out of your house and go kill Thanos like the rest of us don't do something useful
00:32:15 like go to the movie theater something productive I haven't been to a theater uh I think since
00:32:22 star was the force awakens and uh back then it was just like your average like reg you know
00:32:29 the the normal sort of theaters where yeah there's no big I mean I think I've been to one cinema
00:32:35 where they had the big funny chairs the big funny leather chairs I have only been to yeah the the
00:32:42 last cinema I remember going to was with my friend and it was like it it was like in this
00:32:46 really small building that was like someone's house at some point I feel it was like the
00:32:52 tiniest cozy little cinema and it was pretty neat I wish I remembered one movie we watched though
00:32:57 I don't remember I only ever went to one theater that had the big cushy chairs and stuff and it
00:33:02 was also the last time I ever went to the movie theater and it was with it was with uh digi
00:33:07 and and May and Tom Tom did you come to see Princess Mononoke that one time yes yes I did oh
00:33:15 yeah Kazi was there yeah yeah and uh that was pretty fun um hey too bad he's dead I just confirmed
00:33:21 with my main bitch we're going to see Avengers today and it's gonna be sick damn what a sensual
00:33:27 date though yeah we got her fresh collar and chain so she's gonna be the talk of the town let me
00:33:33 tell you Nate Nate's going with his main bitch but he's really there to date Thanos his his love
00:33:38 his lord and savior she's my she's my beard she's my beard for sure or is there an anti-beard is
00:33:43 there an opposite beard what do you mean bitch she's my pussy she's my pussy you know you're gonna get
00:33:48 the the weird lines your chin is a tattoo uh I love a life of duality you see because like most
00:33:57 things outside I'm only gonna do it if I'm with someone else right like I'm not gonna like go to
00:34:02 the movie theater alone like I'd rather kill myself than do that than face the consequences I've
00:34:08 done that multiple times I don't give a shit fuck it so there are two there are two circumstances on
00:34:14 which I go to the movie theater one my local friends are back in town from a back a back uh
00:34:19 from being away from their college dorms or I'm in Boston oblivion please play the boys are back in
00:34:25 town and no no you said same are you pro or anti going to the movies alone uh well I generally go
00:34:33 with people but I'm absolutely if no one wants to go I will 100 go myself I don't give a shit I
00:34:38 mean I wouldn't be against it if like I was really into movies just I can't remember that last time
00:34:43 there was a movie that I was so excited about that I would go see it without making it without it being
00:34:49 like the thing we were doing that's another question the embarrassment was a cover-up and a joke and
00:34:53 not real the real reason is because it would be boring and I would have no reason to do because
00:34:57 I hate movies no I disagree fuck people I'm there for the for the story in the mood okay anyway sorry
00:35:01 go on anyway so so I'm either in San Diego or I'm in Boston when I watch a movie and San Diego
00:35:07 experience is far different so with Boston you got you know you got the liquor you've got the
00:35:11 watermelon rind you've just got people zigzagging and bopping and fucking just all over the place
00:35:18 semen drenching my eyeballs when I'm at the movie theater in Boston you get to watch like
00:35:23 jibbly movies there it's crazy just the height of luxury well they were doing a thing there was
00:35:29 like a that was like a national a national event it was an event unfortunately it ended I was
00:35:34 I was really hoping to see porco remember that that classic jibbly line I just don't understand
00:35:39 how we black people starting I went to a party these nice white folks they had slices
00:35:47 one white woman she said she said to me oh I didn't I didn't think you black folks ate watermelon
00:35:51 like that no more
00:35:58 link below I said lady you just trying to get me to cut up all the guts so you can keep all the good
00:36:03 part for yourself oh pete green where'd you go pete green uh so so in San Diego there is a
00:36:13 there's an iconic mom it was a staple of san jacan culture and all you locals choose a man
00:36:19 friday I'm talking to you hoarding plaza iconic getting torn down our place with office buildings
00:36:24 so this dilapidated once iconic mall is just in shambles and in there there is an amc and it is
00:36:30 a huge theater but no one gives a shit because their days are numbered and last time I think I
00:36:37 just tried to have spider-verse I snuck into the theater with my friends and then stole the 3d
00:36:42 glasses from the trash that's what every experience is like watching movies there of course you know
00:36:47 just walk in you you don't ask anyone you don't pull out a ticket you just walk fucking in
00:36:52 fish whatever essentials you need out of the trash like you do and then watch your movie in peace
00:36:56 walk out the door and you know it's it's sticky it's terrible I have a photo I have a photo that I
00:37:01 took I forget even I think it was the Grinch CGI Grinch that I took and it's my friend just in front
00:37:07 of like a completely empty row of seats I'm gonna try if I can get out put in the show notes link
00:37:13 on screen right now to look at it just no one's here it's my own personal playground to just fucking
00:37:18 suck and it's great but you know it's a fast and different experience and then you know it's fine
00:37:24 I try when I go to the movie theaters I try to optimize the time that I go so that nobody will
00:37:29 be there like that's why I'm going yeah I'm doing Q&A's at the point you know I love at the movie
00:37:33 in general what's up guys just defeated Thanos I'm ready for a Q&A yeah they're asking questions
00:37:40 about what movie you're watching and what's going on and you're just like live commentating just
00:37:44 live instagraming during the movie and that's why I gotta make sure nobody's around because I can't
00:37:48 you know gotta have a little bit of respect on the sub on the subject of yeah on the subject of
00:37:52 pete green uh-huh I just want to let you all know that pete greens autobiography laugh if you like
00:37:58 ain't a damn thing funny was published in 2003 and he and green was portrayed by Don Cheadle in the
00:38:06 2007 film talk to me which was inspired by his life and career wow yeah that's great I don't actually
00:38:12 know what his career is I mean I know he had he had like a Washington DC area like like morning
00:38:17 talk show and that that clip of him getting really angry about people eating watermelon the wrong
00:38:23 way yeah is the funniest thing I've ever linked in the show notes I have placed it there yeah okay
00:38:28 excellent um and yeah and apparently you can see Don Cheadle play him in the 2007 biopic so there you
00:38:34 go uh munchie who's this modern day ghoul that you've posted in the person when I saw uh Grinch
00:38:40 2018 with the best movie ever made by the way Jim Carrey's Grinch how could it even compare to you
00:38:45 know story anyway so I saw it with this guy and uh I uh I took during the entire you know when you
00:38:55 go to the movies and you get there like early because you know you're a good boy you're a good
00:38:59 you want to see yeah you know Roman Catholic uh and they just have like the bizarre like please
00:39:06 god by our procs movie theaters are dying do all this weird gimmick shit so uh there is literally
00:39:13 an app that was advertised in the previews of this no there weren't like movie previews there were
00:39:18 just like app previews and this was for an app called new v not joking new v for the in new
00:39:26 movies wait a minute audience uh well the first there was new goal now we've got new
00:39:30 v's left right and center it's just like was was like this app bought by new goal just like
00:39:36 youtube was bought by google they just try to mirror their movements I can only imagine so what it is
00:39:41 it's do you guys remember face Raiders on 3ds yeah no no so literally face Raiders but for movies
00:39:49 so there would be like on screen and be like without your phones without your tm new v's
00:39:55 app and start clicking right now three two one go I don't know so maybe you could like
00:40:05 choose the ending like do you want the Avengers to a no no no so what will happen is there will
00:40:10 just be like a like a stock photo of a movie theater you know where you are right now just a
00:40:15 sock like of the concession stand and I'll whip out new v to see the creatures to see the critters
00:40:21 run and you look at the new v app like of course we did we scrambled we like we like ripped out our
00:40:26 phones we almost broke it like like fidgeting with it tried to open it as fast as we possibly could
00:40:31 desperate to get it open and then there and there were like little creatures little UFOs little
00:40:35 aliens tried to invade get into our ears maybe plant some eggs you know to shoot them yeah they
00:40:39 were like AR what I'm trying to say they they were right right right okay objects that were in
00:40:43 your phone screen you had to shoot them you don't only see them if you're pointing them at the screen
00:40:47 would this like pause the movie to happen no this happened before the movie okay so so is this
00:40:52 are you saying there's there's there you're in the movie theater right i'm just trying to paint
00:40:57 the picture for myself so the screen is displaying a generic movie theater that's empty and then if
00:41:04 you point your phone at the generic picture it will show items on top of the generic picture but
00:41:11 not in the actual environment you're actually really sitting in the actual movie theater it's only
00:41:15 the picture of the movie theater indeed indeed in AR i'm very confused that is the most retarded
00:41:20 thing i've ever heard in my life no no it's engagement it's it's entertainment god damn it
00:41:27 i was entertained and i was engaged can you imagine one isn't enough but both this sounds
00:41:35 like this sounds like the ubisoft presents dog pals rip off of nintendox which is face raiders
00:41:41 all right this sounds like a blame it sounds great something gets way better so that's what the
00:41:46 movie theater experience is like in in horn plans are just decrepit literal mummies mummies
00:41:52 roaming about like actual dead people i saw some dude piss in the movie theater uh like
00:41:58 i said rummage through the trash or there was a lot of like you know birth control in there you
00:42:02 just not a good time just not a good time but you know it's worth it as long as i got to see
00:42:06 Superman spider-verse fucking suck uh hey i've got a thing of note now i do not
00:42:14 want to make this overly political however it is interesting but i hate the current president
00:42:19 no i don't want to yet i want to call out everyone in the comments like okay what do
00:42:24 everyone in the comments ever on the show everyone in the world who's against this i was
00:42:28 trying to avoid this okay me me and you talked about what was it last week we talked about some
00:42:33 like slut oh we were just we were talking about the um marcess man versus peterson debate
00:42:38 yeah that's right very briefly briefly and everyone's still in the comments like it's too
00:42:42 political we were i think it's a mean we were barely even talking about because people are tired
00:42:47 of any mention of politics i think they have a negative association which you know what their
00:42:51 fucking brains are broke and they need to fix it ironically unironically i think because you two
00:42:56 are like on you know somewhat on opposite sides politically um and and you like talking about it
00:43:03 with each other i really think you should bring back t-bap but replace ponies with politics
00:43:08 you know what literally the name doesn't have to change i don't even think that's a terrible idea
00:43:15 it would be really funny do it so you don't have to do it here look i yeah i get that okay but
00:43:20 none of what i say will consider this none of this has to do with what i was about to say which
00:43:23 is just that so like an hour before we started recording or whatever pewdiepie uploaded a video
00:43:30 called ending the subscribe to pewdiepie meme and i watched this video before and basically this is
00:43:37 this is troubling implications for me personally um basically what he says is like hey guys so
00:43:41 subscribe to pewdiepie was really great it was really fun i never expected to last as long as it
00:43:46 went but here's the thing i got like 90 million subscribers now and some bad apples have crept
00:43:52 in and like you know only now only with that last couple million did a few bad apples creep in
00:43:59 that's exactly the point i mean i'd argue he's not response okay but okay let me finish i mean
00:44:04 okay whatever go on okay the point is he just said like so and obviously he addresses like
00:44:09 the christ church shooter yeah who says subscribe to pewdiepie and so obviously this he said like
00:44:13 this is really weighed on me like personally this has been like an issue and i didn't want to
00:44:16 acknowledge i didn't want to say anything publicly except on twitter his disavowal because like i
00:44:20 didn't want to like draw any attention and it wasn't about me so like you know we didn't want to do
00:44:24 that okay but now he's saying but like but i want to end the subscribe to pewdiepie meme whatever
00:44:29 t-series has passed me and i don't want to make hitting a hundred million be like because i'm trying
00:44:33 to beat someone else so okay now look the message is fine the thing that troubles me about this and
00:44:39 i'm curious if you guys agree disagree or whatever is that like basically what i'm taking away from
00:44:45 this among his perfectly reasonable points is that all he takes is one bad apple and like i know
00:44:51 there's more than one but like he really drew the christ church guy if you have 90 million followers
00:44:56 if you have one bad follower it's your like you bear responsibility like you are the guy who what i
00:45:04 don't know encourage this like you have to stop what you're doing like oh this is just it reminds me
00:45:09 so much of like if there's any accusation of any wrongdoing by anyone to anyone today that enough
00:45:16 seems like that seems like that's enough these days to like stop any like campaign whatever
00:45:21 approaches tracks but i don't think he bears that responsibility is there anything i don't i think this
00:45:26 is more of just a personal thing the pewdiepie is like some killer was spouting a meme that had
00:45:33 his name in it and that's just sort of fucked within a little i don't think this is like people
00:45:38 are campaigning to destroy pewdiepie because he endorses killers because he obviously doesn't
00:45:42 maybe it's not you know that could be true but however like i'm just saying if i agree that like
00:45:48 pewdiepie can allow or anyone you can let a meme be tainted by some bad actors then like every meme
00:45:56 has bad actors like i don't know pepe obviously has tons of like racist stuff about him but like
00:46:01 do you have to let that be the way that you appreciate the joke or the character i mean i don't
00:46:07 you don't have to let subscribe to pewdiepie be tainted by what if your pewdiepie yeah like
00:46:11 imagine your pewdiepie and you know the tea yeah dude yeah pretty sick dude pretty sick
00:46:18 fist bump um so your so your pewdiepie and this this t-series things happen and you know it's
00:46:24 kind of it's like a fun thing it's like healthy competition it's growing your channel by a lot
00:46:28 and it's really exciting you're like yeah you know what this is cool i didn't like do this on purpose
00:46:32 but it happened organically and i'm just gonna run with it yeah it's fine and then at some point
00:46:36 this thing happens and now like you're seeing the same meme and you're seeing you're seeing your name
00:46:43 be you know propagated in with you know with with association to this horrible thing that like people
00:46:50 you know whether you didn't do it but like people are associating you with this thing now like
00:46:55 i could i can understand why he'd want to be like let's not let's take that let's try and take that
00:47:01 element out of it like maybe maybe not like yeah maybe maybe if i pushed the subscriber
00:47:06 pewdiepie i mean even harder maybe i'd hit a hundred million faster but yeah isn't it better
00:47:11 to hit it later and have like less of that poisoning the water yeah i think you know that
00:47:17 this was like maybe he was kind of getting tired of it and and like event and this was sort of
00:47:22 like the last straw because he did you know it's sort of like said like you mentioned a few other
00:47:27 reasons why he's sort of stopping it uh that that was one of you know one of the reasons but not the
00:47:32 main reason um i have a somewhat similar experience like on a very much smaller scale and not as you
00:47:40 know so uh horrible i guess um back in my pony days i used to do like this whole touch face thing if
00:47:49 you guys remember and it was like oh how could how could we forget how could anyone in our audience
00:47:55 everyone touch face for mage down in the comments time for the simpler days it was it was touch
00:47:59 facing in the comments oh no no stop no the point is like i i started doing it because i thought it
00:48:06 was uh funny and kind of cute and it's just like something weird you know um people took a liking
00:48:11 to it and it sort of became a little bit of a meme in my sort of circle of friends in the community
00:48:17 a bit and whenever people started seeing me online and so the first thing they would say is like hey mage
00:48:23 touch face and like it got really annoying after a while because that's all it was to those people
00:48:29 that's all they said to me in like group chats and stuff and yeah and like people assumed they knew
00:48:37 me just because they knew this one meme that related to me and like i stopped doing the touch face and
00:48:42 i think it took like maybe a year almost maybe two for people to sort of caught on the caught
00:48:47 catch on that i'm not doing it anymore because they kept doing it yeah and i i feel like pewdiepie
00:48:52 and you know the subscribed to pewdiepie isn't going to die just because he said to yeah that's
00:48:57 what i was gonna say like the fact of the matter is he can't stop it like if you know but i think
00:49:02 if people want to keep doing it they're gonna people i think people who do respect pewdiepie
00:49:07 and his wishes and pay attention they will stop just because you know he asked nicely but people
00:49:13 who don't care and just want to meme on people and be mean i guess will continue to do so but
00:49:18 eventually i don't think you have to even be mean like i straight up i mean yeah you certainly don't
00:49:24 have to have malice to choose to not like agree to end a meme because i mean that's pretty artificial
00:49:30 anyway to go to your main point about like i think it's just the nature of the world and the
00:49:37 interconnected nature of the society that we live in um that words change um things get hijacked
00:49:48 and you know labels and and stuff like that gets tainted and it's i feel it's naive to just ignore
00:49:57 the fact that the public perception of those things can shift to something that you don't like
00:50:03 or don't agree with it's it's unfortunate and it sucks but like if you use a word and then like a
00:50:10 year later the word means something completely different stubbornly continuing to use it in
00:50:15 that sense is just gonna be confusing when you have when you make a meme it can easily grow out of
00:50:21 your hands as it did for touch face as it did for you know subscribe to pewdiepie and when you know
00:50:27 if that meme which you've started has you know turned into something else and he's used primarily
00:50:34 by people that you don't like that can be a discomforting fact that can be even if just in
00:50:38 the hands of a few people who you disavow i don't it can still be like you all this all of this point
00:50:44 is assuming that these things are tainted and like it's just so easy just let's just seed ground forever
00:50:50 just give up everything god like i don't know it's it's a personal there is no objective amount of
00:50:56 which something needs to be tainted for it to be like quote unquote tainted i think it's really
00:51:00 just down to public like a perception of the word in who you know whoever's thinking about it if you
00:51:06 don't believe that varies between bubbles though i mean yeah i mean i don't know what's what's your
00:51:10 objection they well here tom did you want to say something i'll say that afterwards um i mean i just
00:51:16 think in my perspective i don't think it's about like being tainted or anything i just think it's
00:51:21 pewdiepie has been the punching bag of the mainstream media and like like for what like four
00:51:26 five years now like he's just the guy they point to of saying like he's this problematic guy causing
00:51:31 all this fucking shit and like you read it like i haven't read it but i've heard like people summarizing
00:51:36 the christ church shooters manifesto and like all of this was designed to increase tensions on purpose
00:51:41 like he didn't actually give a fuck about subscribe to pewdiepie he said it to piss off liberals you
00:51:46 know because they knew they hated pewdiepie and they had this whole nazi agenda against him you
00:51:50 know and he's he just the entire thing was constructed to increase tensions between the
00:51:55 left and the right and it worked perfectly like he fucking played everybody you know that that's true
00:52:00 but when people when people have raised that point as like a way to like like you silly sjw i'm not
00:52:05 even really i kind i basically agree but like when people say like you silly sjw's like you're playing
00:52:09 right into his hands i mean like yeah but like what's the option here just the sjw's it's everybody
00:52:13 you know like every everybody on both sides but like that's my point is that like even i'm part
00:52:18 of the pro i wish i didn't even have to say it because like that's what i would do except that
00:52:21 pewdiepie himself has basically given ground and says that he agrees it's problematic now i don't
00:52:26 even think that he's given ground at this point i think it's just the fact that like because he's
00:52:30 been in the crosshairs for so long like this is just a way of like trying to like get some of the
00:52:34 heat off of him yeah i think they've beaten him down i need to broken his spirit a little bit
00:52:38 that would be my argument i mean even if even if it has nothing to do with it like i if putting
00:52:43 myself in his position like even if it is just for the memes like and and like was done you
00:52:50 know as like a way of like manipulating culture to have yourself even like you know remotely
00:52:55 connected to a shooting is fucked and like that of course it doesn't it doesn't matter like what
00:53:00 the reasons were that will make you feel like ass and i'm sure like that feels like shit yeah like
00:53:05 i think i think the discussion you sort of want to have maybe pewdiepie wasn't like the best
00:53:11 to be to to choose because like i feel like his situation is a little bit it's a little bit different
00:53:19 due to the shooting it's kind of been loaded loaded of a situation so it's a little hard to
00:53:24 that's just an extreme version i mean now fuck that i don't associate a subscribe to pewdiepie
00:53:29 with that guy at all i mean that guy is trying to latch himself on to a movement uh but i mean
00:53:34 look i know the guy because i read the fucking manifesto he doesn't believe it at all like i
00:53:38 don't know he probably loves that pewdiepie is white but like i don't know that's not pewdiepie's
00:53:43 fault that's uh you know it's all in this guy's head and and like here's the thing like i i have
00:53:49 such a reject i feel it burning inside this feeling of like like i was saying like giving
00:53:55 ground and just allowing people to just take and take and take these ideas and like okay right now
00:54:01 let's say another shooter whatever shoots up a church somewhere and says like i love pcp baby
00:54:07 i was high on pcp i listen to the pcp haha uh it's like we're the reason people are dying baby
00:54:13 black black black you're describing the wildest fantasies right now real real situation that
00:54:19 happens that could happen we've got thousands of listeners we've got tens of thousands one of them
00:54:23 could be a shooter absolutely but do we like what do we do then is our brand tainted do we need to
00:54:29 shut down the show because one person is insane it's not about like shutting down shutting down
00:54:34 that's not what that's not what pewdiepie is doing either he's shutting down the meme the idea is being
00:54:39 shut down he didn't he didn't even make the meme in the first place he didn't engineer subscribe to
00:54:44 pewdiepie like if if somebody just likes the pcp we're not going to stop doing the pcp because we
00:54:50 obviously don't rebrand though like let's say the entire mainstream isn't even rebranded he's just
00:54:56 look he's ended he's ending a meme it's the same way that the guy who made pepe basically disavowed
00:55:01 pepe and killed the character and you know i don't even blame it he can do whatever he wants it's his
00:55:05 character pewdiepie doesn't want to do this but he's being forced to for damage control purpose i
00:55:10 mean that's the nature that's the nature of being an incredibly famous individual that has to
00:55:17 like compromises have to be made i'm not saying any of this is like the best way for the world to be
00:55:22 i'm just saying it makes sense for him to do that and i don't begrudge him that i feel like i just
00:55:27 i feel like roar shock from watchmen i feel like i'm just witnessing bad things happening
00:55:31 and everyone's like yeah you gotta be pragmatic dude okay i'm just like but it's wrong but it's not
00:55:36 right so is your problem that what pewdiepie is a coward for for killing the meme is that your
00:55:41 problem he he gave in yes he gave in and i was i don't like it but it was his choice in the end
00:55:46 to do it he was i'm guessing like this i'm just guessing but i think he was just tired and he
00:55:52 just wanted it to end uh like if something bad similarly happens to pcp and like if one of us
00:55:58 decides to not associate with the pcp it's not i wouldn't blame me how about this name maybe the
00:56:05 cat's argument the cat's yeah let the cat speak um i just want to say uh look i'm aware if i was in
00:56:12 his position like there's a distinct possibility i would have broken long ago i just hope that people
00:56:17 who are you know who who value like i don't know not seeding intellectual ground just because
00:56:23 there's like a fuss that you might not agree with like i hope i would i just i just disagree generally
00:56:28 that this is like intellectual ground like he's not he's not changing his whole world he's just
00:56:33 like tired of the thing it's not about world it look they could do this about anything they could
00:56:37 take any meme any of us make ever and someone if they want to they could do a school shooting
00:56:42 and associate with that meme are you if you give ground on this you have to say that any meme can
00:56:46 be corrupted by one individual doing something extremely black and white about this of course it
00:56:52 can be corrupted i do not agree there's not a it's not a fucking light switch like you flick it and
00:56:58 then it's corrupted and if you say you are a school shooter it's not as drastic as that you're accepting
00:57:03 the principle that i don't i just don't i mean look yes it can happen but you shouldn't give it
00:57:08 it's wrong you don't you don't think that meaning can be changed by the addition of context i believe
00:57:15 very much in performative meanings no one has to say that subscribe to PewDiePie is like evil
00:57:21 or bad or associate with shit if you just don't associate okay but i think about it you you can
00:57:27 choose to believe whatever you want but that doesn't change the fact that lots of people out in the
00:57:30 real world now do associate that phrase with the new zealand shooter how do we square that with the
00:57:36 fact that those people have been fucking duped they've been okay because it doesn't matter it
00:57:41 doesn't matter if they've been duped the point is they they have the association is there now
00:57:45 it can't let's correct them one by one it can't be gotten rid of it's like i said earlier it's just
00:57:50 it's just naive i just want to quickly shift like the um we can use a similar um
00:57:58 hold on overwatch overwatch did like a ban on something on like the okay sign recently or
00:58:02 something like that because like one person complained about the okay sign and they just
00:58:08 someone flashed the okay sign during an interview yeah exactly and they censored it because this is
00:58:12 what i'm talking about yeah exactly like and i it was me it was me i was dog whistling i admitted
00:58:17 and like i think in that in that context that was dumb of them and i like sure and overall i do
00:58:23 agree with you nate but like with pewdiepie's case like i said i feel like it's a little different
00:58:28 and it's just like it's i mean are you aware that the christ church guy did the okay like obviously
00:58:34 he was doing it to play into the racist you know the newly formed like not actually the real meaning
00:58:39 of the thing or not the historical meaning of the way he did it when he was in like uh at court
00:58:43 or whatever when he was being tried or something right yeah so like i mean yes he's a hundred percent
00:58:48 i guess quote dog whistling but it's just i from what i heard he just did a lot of things to piss
00:58:52 off as many people as he could uh right yeah and he was a memer for yeah yeah absolutely i don't
00:58:57 agree with the whole okay sign being censored because people are taking over uh the meaning of
00:59:03 it despite it actually i just think it's the same logic i think those are like very similar
00:59:07 i mean it's the exact same thing it's someone taking something that's benign and trying to inject
00:59:13 poor beliefs yeah that's that's what's happening yeah but like i don't know like it's not like
00:59:17 pewdiepie saying like now it's bad it's just like i'm kind of over it now the difference in the
00:59:23 response he's agreeing it's been corrupted the difference between these two things is that like
00:59:27 with with the overwatch thing that was blizzard making a decision for someone else's actions
00:59:32 whereas with pewdiepie he's making a decision based on something revolving around his own brand
00:59:36 yeah so i can like i understand pewdiepie's position on a personal level even if i disagree
00:59:42 with it on a philosophical i mean that's and you know what i don't want to be overly critical
00:59:47 gib here you go well yeah i'm just the the the thing that's annoying me about like your argument
00:59:52 is that i like what do you suggest we do like i'm saying that that's the way it is and i don't like
00:59:59 it and you're saying the same thing but you're just i don't know like what like if i think it is
01:00:05 really stupid and naive to imagine that you can just tell each person individually by the way that
01:00:11 word doesn't actually mean that because language like in general is it shifts all the time words
01:00:18 start to mean different things and people don't like it people don't like that literally doesn't
01:00:22 necessarily mean literally anymore it just it can mean figuratively as well and that's just the way
01:00:28 language is like how how would you go about how would you go about changing something
01:00:34 that has been changed in a way that you don't like the thing is there's a lot of retroactive
01:00:38 continuity going on here like like i don't know people show like obama's made the okay symbol
01:00:43 has that word changed was he dog whistling all along do we need to give like time stamps to when
01:00:48 words meant certain look i i know this is all muddy but like i mean here's my solution whenever
01:00:54 you like you do an okay sign and someone says uh hey you know that's uh racist or something you
01:00:58 say no it's not uh that's you know i'm not using it that way like i i'm aware that some people do it
01:01:03 i don't think about that there i mean it's kind of like the same argument is like back in the day
01:01:08 like using gay you know it's like gay doesn't mean gay it means stupid like it's it's just a different
01:01:13 way of using the word and this is a different way of using the symbol and that's always gonna
01:01:17 have pushback because you have people who look at everything uh with like a certain context and
01:01:23 other people looking at it in a different way you know because like you have people who are taking
01:01:27 like modern day sensibilities and projecting them on the entirety of human existence and you're
01:01:32 obviously going to run into problems with that whereas you have other people who take a more
01:01:36 nuanced approach and it's just the different ways people look at things i just think like
01:01:41 if if something as big like the okay sign that is very ridiculous that is like you make a circle
01:01:47 with your hand right that's that's what it is um that being turned into a no you make a w and a p
01:01:53 for white power dog right of course like what i read like you're like the actual white pyro sign
01:01:59 involves two hands rather than one yeah there's like a historical one that's like so you take
01:02:03 both hands and you form them into a blod and it's you guys know how to do that i'm doing it right
01:02:09 now i i do yeah uh it's all right go ahead get uh fucking lost my train of thought this is this
01:02:17 always happens when i'm in the middle of a point brilliant blood comment ben way to go no it's
01:02:22 everyone everyone's like it all right real funny though i apologize uh the okay symbol right the
01:02:27 okay symbol it gets changed um changed as in like quote unquote changed like some people start using
01:02:34 it as a meme how many people in the entire world is the majority thinking of this as a racist thing
01:02:39 now it's really just like you give it a couple years until it is guaranteed yes everybody knows
01:02:46 this thing to be to be like culturally insensitive or racially insensitive or something and then once
01:02:52 it's like pretty clear then you don't use it just to out of respect because like if the if you've
01:02:58 lose if you lose the battle and the word now means something else then what are you gonna do are you
01:03:03 going to constantly fight the rest of your life over this one thing that you just nobody you're
01:03:09 never going to convince everybody that it used to be something else and you're going to continue
01:03:12 using it the old way because at some point it it's just changed it's like words change their
01:03:18 meaning i mean i guess i don't think that we're there i guess i think that it's not you big yeah
01:03:22 not not for the okay sign or it's changed that meaning and you can't just say well i'm just not
01:03:26 gonna accept it or you're just gonna end up being wrong what are we actually we're actually talking
01:03:31 about subscribe to PewDiePie which is obviously not inherently racist i mean if you think PewDiePie
01:03:36 is a racist terrible person like okay well i don't think that what do you mean it's obviously not
01:03:42 inherently racist it means whatever you think it means well okay we can say that for literally
01:03:46 every word so let's not yes we yes we sure sugar can my my friend like and and we will it's it's just
01:03:52 it's just like i'm coming at it from like a perspective of uh you know if i find out that
01:03:59 something is racist then well i'm gonna stop doing it if it you know in the context in which
01:04:06 that would be you know that would get me in trouble or is just be a stupid thing to do for no reason
01:04:11 like i wouldn't go out of my way to say something that i don't think is racist but people have
01:04:16 have decided is racist i i just would like well you know i can do without that word if every word
01:04:21 in the english language was suddenly you couldn't say it then that that would be something different
01:04:26 but like i i don't i don't inherently find losing ground as like like a terrible thing
01:04:34 like i i understand like if the the subscribe to PewDiePie thing it's not that old so like
01:04:40 i can see just still using it like innocently enough so i wouldn't demonize anyone for using it
01:04:46 using it in the in the the more innocent like interpretation of it it's just like once you
01:04:51 know once you are aware then there's a certain level of responsibility that comes with knowing
01:04:56 when to say it i i sure didn't i wasn't saying subscribe to PewDiePie all the time but i sure
01:05:01 would have thought twice about it you know after the whole well well here's the thing right like
01:05:05 what you have you when you're in a transition period like that you know because like you're
01:05:09 we're asking like when does the scale tip or when does the the switch flip and all that kind of
01:05:13 shit and like it really just like for a while things just have dual meanings like right now
01:05:19 like the okay sign means okay or white power depending upon your intent because like a joke
01:05:24 got out of hand on 4chan and now it has two meanings and while i can understand on the one hand
01:05:29 saying like well if something changes we have to respect that new meaning because things do change
01:05:33 over time the way they change over time is doing what Nate's mad about and giving that ground uh
01:05:39 yeah and look i know there's people who aren't clued into like it might i don't know your fucking
01:05:43 grandma or whatever like she'll be like oh my god they're using this symbol and it means a horrible
01:05:47 thing uh i didn't think it meant that but okay i guess it does oh better not do it like they're
01:05:52 not clued into the whole fucking back and forth here i i get it but i don't know i when you when
01:05:59 maybe i'm being conspiratorial but when look i'm not even saying i sense an agenda of like a force
01:06:04 that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying that like we this guy for example said he was trying to
01:06:10 make people you know more angry and divided and all that stuff and like and that's what's happening
01:06:15 so why i mean we just feel like well look obviously this doesn't mean what do you think well the thing
01:06:19 is with that is that um what he's trying to do is like the easiest thing in the world like it only
01:06:25 takes well you know it takes like a sentence to ruin any friendship you have uh yeah i suppose so
01:06:31 a friendship that can last for that can be built up over years like if you say the wrong thing then
01:06:35 it's all over so like causing discord and and disruption and making people fight each other
01:06:42 is like not not even slightly a challenge so it's not like he can it's not like him manipulating us
01:06:49 is some feat that we you know i mean anything he said like like he used the he used the um you
01:06:55 know the marine copypasta right he said the whole like i'm a i'm a such a such a marine was so like
01:07:00 that's tainted now too maybe not oh that is fucked up ben that is fucked up well here's the thing
01:07:06 shut the fuck up and let me finish the point is that it has an association to that guy
01:07:16 just like anything he did is now associated with that guy and there's just no helping it
01:07:21 and like yeah he said the pewdiepie thing so of course that connection now exists and it was a hot
01:07:27 topic at the time it was like a hot meme at the time so of course it's got you know it attracted
01:07:32 a lot of attention along with the in association with the story and and that's just an unavoidable
01:07:38 thing like hippo was saying it's the easiest thing in the world to connect two things like i'm not
01:07:44 saying i would love if people could just disregard that guy or if he got no press whatsoever it would
01:07:50 be even better it would be it would be nice um but the fact of the matter is information travels
01:07:54 really quickly and now people know those things and it's like you did he leave oh no we lost him
01:08:03 nate nate what nate nate uh rage course oh he's back oh no he's back no he's back oh we had five
01:08:09 glorious seconds of no nate what happened uh uh yeah sorry about that um i'm sorry i guess i just
01:08:15 looked at you were saying this discussion's like fucking sick and all and like talking about politics
01:08:19 that aren't actually politics being political uh that's great uh but but i want to talk about uh
01:08:24 i played dark souls let's talk about trees in dark playing fucking dark souls i'm playing dark
01:08:28 souls in bloodborne let's talk about that instead it sounds way more calm tell me about all the trees
01:08:32 in in in dark souls the dark the trees in dark souls actually my sister was laughing at them
01:08:36 yesterday because they use the uh the cross textures they just take a flat image and put it
01:08:40 in like a cross shape to make it look like 3d oh yeah she thought that was funny uh because it's
01:08:44 an old game and she's a child you guys understand the graphics used to suck i can't believe dark
01:08:49 souls is an old game it feels like just yesterday i just i got the lord vessel and i killed i killed
01:08:54 two two of the boss of the big goss of the big souls so far uh nice i don't know dude i'm trying
01:09:00 i've got 40 something hours in i still can't i can't get into dark souls it's just sick real on
01:09:05 switch what secaro is not the new one on switch not yet i think secaro is not on the switch dark
01:09:11 souls i'm playing dark souls on the switch i guess it's like not the remaster it's just the vanilla
01:09:15 version at a higher frame rate yeah it's just the older isn't that isn't that just what the
01:09:19 remaster is that it's just the remaster changes some visuals and stuff i guess and people are
01:09:24 like bent about that like yeah the the visual the visual changes i've been watching the digital
01:09:28 foundry visual yeah there's none of those in in the switch version because i guess i can't run them
01:09:32 or something so it uses all the old i have a question to y'all have y'all played like this um
01:09:38 old bioware game called jade empire i played some of it yeah oh did you like it it was pretty cool
01:09:44 it was it was i liked it more than kotor because it actually had real-time combat i always thought
01:09:48 it was dumb and kotor wearing like i pull out a lightsaber and i'm ready to fuck people up and
01:09:51 then just freezes and i got to like do turn based stuff i was like oh yeah jade empire was like
01:09:58 bioware's first like not their first original ip but like it was their first of that generation
01:10:04 because i did star war stuff and then they finally made their own shit it was pretty cool and there
01:10:07 was like kung fu and it was cool yeah it was basically my childhood and i loved the game so
01:10:11 much i could never do the bad route i just felt so bad you had to be so mean that's that's that's
01:10:15 bioware's shtick yeah but like i really liked how when you were evil like like the shadows would
01:10:20 just sort of like start like slowly yeah yeah it was so cool not enough people played jade empire
01:10:26 yeah it's weird like it's like it's the redheaded stepchild like people remember kotor people remember
01:10:30 mass effect really fondly but jade empire was there and it was like the stepping stone between
01:10:34 you should you should play it on iam games uh i should yeah i'll have to wait i'll have to get
01:10:39 isn't isn't iam games done isn't it isn't it season season one is wrapped but uh uh once i get my
01:10:47 injury figured out i will hopefully be reviving it and continue so so you so you got that in the
01:10:53 divorce yeah yeah it's not even that i got it in the divorce it's that did you never gave a shit
01:10:58 about any of this shit surrounding iam games and so i'm the only one in the discord you know that's
01:11:02 i have the power i'm so so it's all mine you know i was i was uh organizing my room the other week
01:11:09 or last week and i don't know where my iam game shirt is i know i have it and i it's buy another
01:11:15 one don't you have to like you'll be both games it's different though that was that was a handmade
01:11:20 one that was the original run oh it's gotta be somewhere it's gotta be somewhere please find
01:11:26 faith you'll find it i i've been dying to get back in the video games i'm notoriously well like
01:11:32 have not played single player games let me let me tell you my sheet all you got to do is just
01:11:37 injure your spine and then you just have no desire or drive to do real work because every moment of
01:11:42 being awake is i've noticed you've been tweeting a lot about video games lately i've done nothing
01:11:46 but play dark souls and bloodborne for the last two weeks and uh it's been and i can tell you're
01:11:51 having a real shit time of it and you hate dark souls and i don't understand it makes me mad is
01:11:56 so miserable it sends fortress is so hard guys well it is i can't what is what are all these
01:12:01 fucking snake men doing here like uh why do you want to kill me so bad yeah like i wanted to give
01:12:06 him a hug why they sell all these traps for me what the fuck yeah it's pretty it's pretty it's
01:12:10 pretty not fun and i was i was really upset i'm beating it out of pure spite right now because
01:12:15 every time i say like i'm treating like twitter right now is just like i'm live tweeting dark
01:12:19 souls like you're just like i'm just playing it i got my phone in one hand those topical games of
01:12:23 playing yeah yeah exactly um but the reason i'm playing it is because i want i want because
01:12:29 everybody in this chat fucking loves dark souls and i'm like all right i gotta i gotta i gotta
01:12:33 figure it out i gotta get to the the meat and never play dark souls everything about this new
01:12:38 from soft game and i don't really understand what the deal is i mean it's it's just dark souls but
01:12:42 again like there's literally no difference like i don't understand so live tweeted yeah so i'm playing
01:12:46 playing fucking dark souls and i don't know i guess it's because like it started back in iam
01:12:52 games because like did you was always talking about dark souls and i was like i don't really like it
01:12:57 and then we got neo because he's like oh neo is like a dark souls s kind of game but by team ninja
01:13:01 who made ninja guide in one of your favorite games so maybe you'll like that and i started not really
01:13:06 liking it then i got into it and i played way too many hours it but like neo is way harder than
01:13:11 dark souls and it's way harder than blood boron it like fucking beats the shit out of you so then
01:13:16 i started playing blood boron again because i had that since i got my ps4 and just couldn't get
01:13:19 into it but this time for some reason it clicked and like i played it just on stream randomly to
01:13:23 kill time i think it was when digi wasn't there he was like away getting his house shit sorted out
01:13:28 i needed something to play and then i packed up all my shit to move back to my parents place while
01:13:33 i got my spine fucking surgery done and like the entire time i was like getting my shit packed up
01:13:37 like man i just want to play blood boron right now it's kind of weird so i got into it and i
01:13:41 bought the dlc and i fucking destroyed that game it was pretty fucking cool and i was like all right
01:13:45 i've done it now i can play dark souls and get it and i played dark souls and i still don't get
01:13:50 i mean dark souls and blood boron well actually demon souls and blood boron are the most like
01:13:56 divergent in terms of the type of gameplay and yet also the same yeah and i'm having tons of
01:14:03 arguments on twitter about it and i'm trying to be respectful and not mean because i don't i don't
01:14:07 think dark souls is a bad game i just think dark souls does nothing in terms of like what i really
01:14:11 like in games like it's pretty fucking cool and there's like some little interesting bits but
01:14:16 like the core gameplay loop isn't enough to like keep me invested because like that was a thing like
01:14:20 i got to father gas coin in blood boron and then that's when i ended the stream and i started to
01:14:26 pack it up my shit up and i was like thinking the whole time like man i want to like take that hunter
01:14:30 axe and kill more shit because it feels fucking great and that's why i went through and finished
01:14:33 playing everything and that like fun of the core gameplay loop got me through all of the
01:14:38 frustration of playing blood boron um dark souls is combat and just like core gameplay loop isn't
01:14:44 as engaging for me personally uh because a lot of it's just like waiting because you have to
01:14:49 like keep your shield up and like you know wait for openings and stuff where blood boron was way
01:14:52 more aggressive based which i kind of enjoyed that was like the idea behind it there's nothing
01:14:57 there's nothing but hatred driving me to beat this because i just because every time i say something
01:15:02 uh i don't really know if i like uh this part of the game it's not really doing it for me like
01:15:06 i'll just get a response it's get good so i want to get good i want to beat the game and then when
01:15:10 i go on twitter and be like guess what i got good and it's still gay and i still don't like it sorry
01:15:14 bro i hate get good so much it makes me sad i just went from playing securo jumping into playing
01:15:21 dark souls on switch which by the way calls itself dark souls remaster so i assume that it is but i
01:15:26 mean maybe there's more to the story securo calls itself dark souls remaster no dark souls the dark
01:15:32 souls on the switch says dark souls remaster right on the thing which is brand it is dark souls
01:15:37 remaster because they the changes of like uh being able to change your covenant from the
01:15:41 bonfire and like a couple other mean little tweaks like that are there but the graphics engine because
01:15:46 it was developed by it it was ported by a different company than the ones that did the ones for ps4
01:15:50 and xbox they just took the base uh the base xbox 360 well shit that's probably the best version
01:15:56 then because the dark souls normal remaster looks like shit on on pc possibly i don't know i thought
01:16:02 the flame still looks shitty on the bonfires this or whatever maybe uh but uh jumping from that from
01:16:08 securo to that game was like stepping into you know you know when you're in dark souls and you go
01:16:13 into the swamp and you start moving at like you know quarter speed or whatever yeah that's what
01:16:17 going from securo to dark souls feels like all the time and it's it's you know it's more deliberate
01:16:22 it's more you know whatever you gotta think about yourself as someone who plays devil may cry all
01:16:27 the time like that's what playing any from game feels like and and like that's understandable
01:16:31 going to dark souls one just like overemphasize that like even you know i'm like uh i think i mean
01:16:38 playing dark souls now it's good i mean i i got like i respect it as like an art piece obviously
01:16:45 and i'm a huge fan when i played it back in the day but having played dark souls two three blood
01:16:49 born and securo now it's hard to go back and i feel like a lot of the joy of the game is actually
01:16:55 about like the multiple playthroughs and the different play styles well that's why i got dark
01:17:01 souls on switch because my idea was like everyone because i watched i watched all of hippo's dark
01:17:05 demon blood videos before i bought anything uh because i wasn't sure if i was gonna get demon
01:17:09 souls or not and based on your demon for any video i was like i don't think i'll probably be able to
01:17:13 get into demon souls if it's even slower um so i kind of passed on that maybe i'll go back to it
01:17:18 at some point demon souls i think is like the they they got it right the first time sort of game
01:17:24 like it is slow but like it's so much about it is so good yeah it's great maybe maybe maybe i'll
01:17:30 get to it maybe you should go go to the voicemail ralph pete green was a comic genius who spent years
01:17:37 quote clowning around and spiraling to life's lowest depths then he conned rhymed and quote
01:17:43 speechified his way to heights he hardly dared imagine using lessons from his unconventional
01:17:48 grandmother on national tv with pete greens washington he'd end with a signature rhyme
01:17:54 i'll tell it to the hot i'll tell it to the cold i'll tell it to the young i'll tell it to the old
01:17:59 that had viewers asking who is this man laugh answers and introduces two characters destined
01:18:06 to capture hearts that's it that's the description for laugh if you like ain't a damn thing funny
01:18:11 the life story of a ralph pete green as told to lerma wrackley which i am really coming out you
01:18:17 obviously message pete pete white pete green and and he's late on you yet again lerma i messaged
01:18:24 lerma wrackley i messaged lerma wrackley but she's too busy playing skyrim and she won't make an acx
01:18:28 account so we can make the fucking audio book together god damn it i'll do the accents and
01:18:33 everything i'll fucking do it i don't care oh that that'll go over really well that that everyone
01:18:38 man that's a waste of watermelon oh god hey guys uh that's just what he sounds like i
01:18:46 everyone in this chat it just loves dark souls comes on it i've got come on the mind today you know
01:18:51 i guess that's what you get when you bathe in seaman anyway guys it's me uh i'm here on the pcp
01:18:57 i forget what i was oh dark souls i everyone likes that's all you were saying something though
01:19:01 no no let let my cheek go okay oh i i uh and i tried to play on pc i thought i was uh i don't
01:19:09 want to say boring uh i think it says this is the house but i just assumed that everyone was right
01:19:13 that was a good game i just stopped playing it's like you know i'm sure they're right you know it's
01:19:17 okay all right and then i stopped to save time but uh bloodborne has always seemed really appealing
01:19:22 to me it's always seemed like a game that i would really enjoy but it's on a ps4 and like are you
01:19:27 joking me like ha ha is what i say to someone saying the words playstation 4 to me like there's
01:19:33 no way i would ever acquire one at all but like what i like played at digis house was so good and so
01:19:38 fun i just craved and knew it but unfortunately i'm blocked by by the tools at my disposal and makes
01:19:43 me upset every single day yeah hey you know bloodborne that's surprisingly good it's definitely
01:19:47 the worst thing about all of it is that they're on lockdown consoles i really wish bloodborne and
01:19:53 demon souls you could just play on pc well actually i was gonna mention one of the things
01:19:57 i wanted to bring up was that playing dark souls actually kind of like sort of meta ruined some
01:20:04 of my appreciation for bloodborne and the reason for that is that it it became very clear when
01:20:09 playing dark souls how bloodborne came to be um because it was clearly like like sony rolled up
01:20:15 to from software it's like hey that dark souls thing pretty big we had a thing with demon souls
01:20:20 and we fucked it up sorry about that why don't you make us another exclusive kind of game like
01:20:25 that but like you know gaming's like bigger and more mainstream now so maybe like uh make it
01:20:29 more accessible for stupid people like maybe take out a lot of like the weight restrictions
01:20:33 and uh and a lot of that should maybe make it simpler maybe pare down all of the rpg stuff
01:20:38 make it so that our dumb console install base will be able to play it a bit more so we can sell
01:20:42 a couple extra million copies thank you very much and that's definitely what happened with
01:20:46 bloodborne i mean yeah and i'm a stupid person and i like sounds like they made a better game
01:20:50 that i would like to enjoy yeah i think i think exactly i'm one of the dumb peasants that liked
01:20:55 the streamlined simplification i mean all right i i hate like the the the whole like get good
01:21:01 atmosphere of the dark souls fanbase more than anyone um and yet i love those games and it's
01:21:08 it's always annoyed me how like there's this elitism about you know all that stuff well i yeah
01:21:15 it's it's just like all right i am a casual gamer i i don't play games a lot and when i do
01:21:21 i want to win all the time and so for me dark souls is just sort of inherently interesting
01:21:28 uh because i want to play it despite i get mad and throw the controller across the room
01:21:34 maybe i'm just mentally strange that way i also really like the swamps i don't know why i like
01:21:39 the swamps but i really like uh the the it's all that mud it's all that mud like this it's all
01:21:45 that good gloopy bubbly mud it's it's the sort of like grossness and the depraved like sludge
01:21:52 and and and you know blood monsters and flies and you're making me hungry and it's like all all
01:22:00 all coagulating at the bottom of the world and it's like yeah that's what i want to go into i want
01:22:05 i want to trundle through that stuff and kill everything um speaking of hunger uh uh and
01:22:11 swamps uh what do you call a white girl with a yeast infection michelle cracker with cheese gross
01:22:20 got them oh no i was googling what do we do we do we want to do we want to do we want to duck
01:22:29 back real quick to that shouting match we were having a minute ago and see if we can't just
01:22:33 smooth that over the entire reason i brought up dark souls was to end that no but i know you're
01:22:37 well i'm being transgressive by suggesting we dip back i feel like i feel like we got the end to
01:22:42 the end of that conversation i don't think everyone dislike that but also i have a new thing to talk
01:22:46 about um please god i i'm a web comic guy and i do web comics and my newest web comic is red
01:22:54 man and the things he says in four panels over and over again i love the red man this is a slice
01:22:59 of live comic yeah the slice of life he is he's just sort of he's such a simple wholesome you
01:23:05 know blood beast was this was this intentional did you did you like sit down and make this
01:23:10 like with a plan in mind or is just something that you did dry all right and decided to make a
01:23:15 thing i had in the past i had in the past uh drawn a four panel or a three panel like garfield
01:23:22 comic i took the garfield without garfield without john and um i had jim davis written there and i put
01:23:29 blood man i put red man and gun girl uh and gun girl shot red man and that was funny um oh no she
01:23:37 just sort of didn't like him and that was the whole comic he just said hello and i i just liked that
01:23:41 as the the you know a tiny panel comic and i was thinking red man and gun girl are my two ocs in
01:23:48 rowdy focus cop killers universe and i was thinking i could do like a garfield uh comic with them as
01:23:56 the characters and one day i was thinking hmm i should really get around to that garfield comic so
01:24:01 i just drew some really crappy red man thing of him saying i just drew three three lines in a small
01:24:08 document drew red man and then i put some text on it and uh it was it was just really funny and so i
01:24:16 thought this reminds me of dinosaur comics i was gonna ask if you were influenced by dinosaur
01:24:23 comics because it was like the format's like identical of like the art stays the same but
01:24:27 you're changing the captions yeah it's it's the it's the coolest idea i've ever i've ever seen
01:24:33 and you know that those dinosaurs are so funny we gotta we gotta get red man syndicated in the
01:24:38 slime times munchie yeah the slime times needs to come back we gotta revive that just for him
01:24:44 yeah the blood times it will be called was the perfect chroma keying green background done for
01:24:50 pre-emptive uh uh memification purposes no that was just because green complements red as a color
01:24:56 and if you'd pop out of the screen and also it was garish which is very rfck core that's true we
01:25:03 should be our endless war should saturation all the way up yeah it's it's it was really funny the
01:25:09 first few times i was like ha yeah i could do this i could do this as a little side comic and now
01:25:14 whenever i have something that i would otherwise make a tweet out of i make red man say it and it's
01:25:18 suddenly a million times better damn that's good way more yeah that's really that's really good
01:25:25 got it you gotta figure out it's a good scheme you got going there yeah it means blown up immediately
01:25:30 upon posting it everyone's just latched on to it like a baby to a tea yep exactly in the back of
01:25:38 my mind i'm thinking hmm what if i make a million of these and then i publish a book and have them
01:25:43 all in there and ruin everyone's goodwill yeah i'm imagining like a hardcover book that's like
01:25:50 really big like one of those like novelty books you get if you're like a kid it's just like the
01:25:54 big book a fucking suckin dick and then uh it's you know a huge book that's like the entire like
01:26:00 width of your tour so but it's just is all like a red bang comics for like hundreds yeah how funny
01:26:07 would that be i i would buy that and put it on i would i would buy that absolutely you gotta have
01:26:12 the format it's just one strip per page and then like huge white borders so the maximum thickness
01:26:19 yeah i would sign each page individually yeah yeah oh do you gotta have a you know you gotta have
01:26:23 like hussey style like uh author notes at the bottom of each page explaining each one they'd
01:26:30 be unbelievably like like orders of magnitude longer than the comic themselves it's like no no
01:26:36 it's like half the pay like like the top half of the page is the comic and a huge white border
01:26:40 in the bottom half is just like a long like paragraph but all the art all the commentary has
01:26:44 to be about the artwork even though it's the same artwork every time yeah it's like i was going for
01:26:49 i was really trying to emphasize the motion of this of this one uh you know 10 out of 10 i want
01:26:54 this to be real you have a long-term goal now i just really like the way he smiles at the end
01:26:59 because yes and the fact that like it's binary brush and it's all very small so like that every
01:27:05 pixel that sort of adds to his smile sort of like makes it hard to discern exactly what he's
01:27:10 thinking so it's just it could you could interpret it it it's literally like the money by the
01:27:15 content who knows what who knows what's behind that like that smirk can mean anything just
01:27:18 depending on the panel before someone said it's it's fucking brilliant i did so now that you've
01:27:23 become a mean a meme hippo do you want to continue to melt your viral viral worth for all it is worth
01:27:30 do you do you plan to make more memes in the style just let it come naturally are you an
01:27:35 artist about this or is gonna be your new career path your patreon one dollar pledge get new red
01:27:41 band comic no i think this is gonna be like as long as i can think of something funny to put
01:27:48 i will put something and then uh my i mean it takes like one second to make one of these uh wait
01:27:54 really it looks really involved the end product
01:28:01 don't don't don't don't stare this when you're when you're just that fucking good you know just
01:28:05 makes the rest of us look like we're moving in slow motion i really like how people have taken to
01:28:09 to making their own yeah that's the way to win would you say i think you should probably bring
01:28:15 litigation against those people yeah you think i should destroy them yeah i think so welcome for
01:28:20 all their work here's the scenario hippo uh blood man becomes real and start feasting upon blood
01:28:26 do you disavow the red band comic what the he like a person becomes real as red man and is the same
01:28:33 guy no no red no no listen you're making the technology that every child wants the technology
01:28:38 to enter the side of the tv to jump right in like you're dived into a swimming pool you get into
01:28:43 the cartoon world but what's this while exiting red man himself comes out and says his favorite
01:28:49 catchphrase blood and continues to beat the blood of in a sense do you say no rayman that's a bad
01:28:56 stop or do you say well you know that's just his prerogative and then keep and then crank it keep
01:29:02 crank it out your red man comes i would probably um uh set him loose or against uh the uh the the
01:29:11 farm animals instead of the people but then the farmers would be mad farm animal blood is that
01:29:16 okay is he okay with animal blood i think he's pretty i think he's pretty happy with it like he
01:29:20 gets a chicken and he's just so squeezes it until everything comes out and then just shows that
01:29:24 in his mouth animals to red man let's be honest i like it i like it dude draw draw draw that now
01:29:31 i'm slamming black blood the other day let me just tell you the bars tab grew sky dude red
01:29:39 dude red man's gotta make a uh a beverage to compete with fuck energy he's gotta release
01:29:43 blood energy he would never sell it that's the that's the problem he has like a whole thing
01:29:49 like it's canned and bottled and it's got a custom label but it only for him it's not for sale
01:29:54 anywhere it's like cunt corona selling his like kool-aid man but he shows up to the blood bank
01:29:59 and bursts in the walls and takes all the blood he wants that blood man and he and he unlike most
01:30:05 good dealers you know he definitely is partaking of his own stash so so red man played too much
01:30:10 blood born got all those blood vials he's like i want to do this in real life he's blood drunk
01:30:15 he's one of those he's one of the fat guys from blood born but real shit red man and gun girl would
01:30:20 be a great like actual like like like short on youtube like five minutes every like six months
01:30:26 that'd be great yeah i would need to get like a voice actors for that put that shit on new

01:31:10 sure is nate is nate alive i'm yeah i'm here i'm here let's do voicemail you fall asleep you
01:31:16 went catatonic after we stopped talking about politics all the energy drained from his body
01:31:19 oh no more drump no more nate he said leaving as fast as he could i mean i had all this rage and
01:31:25 then i was just had nowhere to put it so it just turned to ashes in my mouth his soul left his body
01:31:30 and floated up like Winnie the pooh you're gonna ashes in your mouth get in an ash tray dumbass
01:31:34 see i'm not mad about politics anymore because i'm just so mad at dark souls all my rage just goes
01:31:39 to dark souls now i don't i don't get just something happens trump says something elizabeth
01:31:44 warren says something i don't care i'm still mad about blight town it's fine dammit i wasn't
01:31:47 trying to make it about politics it's about basically in blight town right now i'm my right
01:31:51 fellow man i hate politics first voicemail first voicemail i want to talk about fucking politics
01:31:58 and shit i'm gonna talk about it no you're not i'm gonna talk about something else no i don't give
01:32:03 a shit anymore i don't give a shit either no politics go start teabap again voicemails go that's
01:32:08 not how that works no nate nate nate nate why are you mad why are you mad i'm not why may
01:32:14 why is mage mad because i'm tired of politics i took a break from pcb for like three that's a
01:32:19 that's a weak that's a weak opinion philosophical discussion that is that is a weak commenter to
01:32:23 your opinion oh it wasn't about politics i mean politics technically if you if you widen the
01:32:30 brush to involve anything social commentary there are not modern you know us politics yeah okay okay
01:32:35 what would just would annoys me is when people especially in the comments but anywhere will just
01:32:41 they'll use they'll call it like oh i hate all this talk of politics when like it's not even it's
01:32:46 really just like an opinion i just want to i just want to move to voicemails that's all i want i do
01:32:52 i mean i do too i do too i just all right people just just we'll just throw that word around like
01:32:57 a general dirty word it doesn't mean it's been diluted it doesn't mean anything anymore i just
01:33:01 sense that may spend me in exchange they they think the word politics mean i'm not going to
01:33:06 apply the new concept we have to disavow i guess okay the final point we'll move on yeah i'm just
01:33:12 saying that like i think that that particular discussion could have been decent but perhaps
01:33:17 it went on too long we got too into it and expanded to too many categories and perhaps that was
01:33:21 inevitable because i'm aware we're making a product here i don't want to make this unpleasant for
01:33:26 people to listen to i want this to be a good thing but i mean there has to be some room for some
01:33:31 amount of discussion of some of these things sometimes yes there is we were we were getting
01:33:35 into like the fundamental nature of language though and you know you yeah once you're there you can't
01:33:41 wrap that up on a podcast that's fair that's fair so sorry major didn't mean to yell at you that was
01:33:46 a built up frustration about things so okay all right let's sorry i yelled you i was just doing
01:33:51 a funny because mage yelling well i was not doing a funny i was doing an angry for sure well the
01:33:57 well that's that's that much is clear i'm trying i'm trying to make a joke and be like oh you can't
01:34:01 do it it's impossible funny is funny is just depends on what the individual believes it means
01:34:07 why do we have to disavow they make jafar like a business like a fucking salary man he sounds like
01:34:13 don't get me the lamp please i beg of you he sounds like a fucking faggo sounds like a twink
01:34:19 please anything for a lamp and it's just it's just not right i just don't agree with it at all
01:34:25 fetch me the lamp a ladder no it'll be your last sunrise he's saying that no but i mean he should
01:34:31 it sounds like something he'd say that fits into my generic employee jafar jafar's awesome
01:34:37 jafar's the coolest he's such a pussy now yeah he's oh he's great he's great but they ruin them
01:34:42 they ruin a new one well i mean give him a chance maybe oh the new Aladdin wait what do you mean

01:34:58 yep that's also coming soon i think okay it's coming soon okay all right great it stars a spoon i
01:35:03 think yes that's right i've seen the spoon it is spoon getting into the fundamental nature of what
01:35:09 is it to be alive what is it to be a toy what is it what is it to worship a capricious god
01:35:16 up around whom you define your entire identity on their on their approval of your of your existence
01:35:22 was was was woody just indoctrinating buzz into the into the andy cult the whole time yes
01:35:27 should we really look so fondly upon all this pure projection of andy's homosexual urges uh
01:35:33 but that being said uh let's check with our boy sex rex for our first voicemail yeah uh all right
01:35:40 here we go commands hey guys it's me there's sex rex um i was uh listening to the pcp big

01:36:26 looking at old twitter things and uh i saw it wasn't that like wasn't that like well like when we
01:36:31 were thinking of things to name the podcast or something i think it was i think this was gonna
01:36:35 be the dino sluts podcast why didn't we call it the fucking dino sluts that would have been so
01:36:41 much better once again there'd be a divided community the dinos versus the sluts you choose
01:36:45 your side ladies and gentlemen we got a rebrand okay we got listen ever since we made that we're
01:36:53 the reason people are dying shared our brand has been tainted and we've got to walk it back we've
01:36:57 got to roll back the brand we've got to come back out as the dino sluts there's still time i think
01:37:02 i know jessy'd be on board for sure i drew like a little i drew like a little icon it was like a
01:37:07 like a banner that said dino sluts and it had like a t-rex roaring but it had like big tits
01:37:12 can we get that in the show notes that's gotta be a bit all right fine i problem man i don't know
01:37:17 i feel like i can i can i can get the the tweet that i saw it from okay great all right put that
01:37:23 in the show notes assuming whenever possible uh but okay let's move on uh that that was a good
01:37:29 question that unearthed some deep lore uh like primordial lore of the pcp stuff that i'm not sure
01:37:34 anyone anyone listening would ever have heard before yeah damn that's probably the juicy
01:37:39 shit they want to hear but uh let's move on baseball that's that inside baseball i'm talking

01:38:12 time wait what is that what is that concoction exactly is that a drink it's it's just keto hot
01:38:16 chocolate oh okay or i mean you can blend if you blend it in like a blender i mean i put ice in it
01:38:22 and then it's come like a milkshake but you can dilute it with a little milk and then heat it up

01:39:11 joke okay anyway uh fat cock 69 uh we've got a message from you let's hear it
01:39:22 so my friend recommended me this podcast the pcp podcast yo listen into that shit this is
01:39:27 pretty fucking entertaining bro yo this is a funny shit anyway thanks this is your podcast
01:39:32 i was listening today the best guy i ever talking about and fucking that we're taunted bitch that
01:39:36 was pretty interesting to me that was pretty entertaining anyway so i listened to that i
01:39:40 was thinking about it i was thinking about the concept of having sex with we're taunted
01:39:43 bitch so i was thinking about that concept and i was hearing that with the concept that you
01:39:47 discussed the engagement concept to jim davis jim davis's idea of engagement and so i was thinking
01:39:53 our city here i was listening to this podcast with my friend and i was like hypothetically
01:39:58 hypothetically hypothetically would fucking we're taunted bitch be considered engagement you see
01:40:04 let me explain this to you entertainment because you're having sex and sex is inherently entertaining
01:40:09 it keeps you engaged also yeah it's engaging because it's sexy you're having sex you're going
01:40:14 for that not but you see there's a lot of entertainment and it's on top of that because
01:40:19 the bitch is retarded that's interesting that's an alternate experience that's interesting yeah
01:40:23 that's real good and i'm retarded so i'd like to i want to experience the other side of that
01:40:28 that's what i was thinking about anyway i appreciate you listening to my voicemail
01:40:32 back off 69 thank you i love you guys so much
01:40:38 okay so so i'm pretty sure so i'm pretty sure he answered his own question there yes
01:40:43 having sex with the retarded bitch is enter gauging however i want to ask another question
01:40:48 nate did michelle hear the podcast last week oh you know i don't think she got that far i don't
01:40:52 okay i was gonna ask what did she think of that whole thing shit you know what i i told her that
01:40:58 there'd be a great part that she should listen to but i don't think i'll have to remind her to do
01:41:01 so okay i'll report back with results um i was here yeah okay well blasted on the car stereo on the
01:41:07 way to the adventures good idea good idea make a twitch highlight okay next one we got uh hell no
01:41:14 fresh uh calling it yeah let's see what this is about i just don't even want to what am i do
01:41:19 that's not from hell no fresh are you retarded or or don't know how to cook of course you are
01:41:23 listening to this podcast oh it's recipe we're gonna be making peanut butter ramen i know that
01:41:29 sounds a little wacky but if you're ahead something like peanut chicken it's basically the same idea
01:41:33 whatever fuck you dude flavor wise as far as packets of ramen go for this i'm gonna go ahead
01:41:37 and recommend something like pork chicken chili oriental would probably work something like
01:41:43 creamy chicken you probably got a little bit too much going on i'd be a little bit of dubious
01:41:46 selection but that's shit you my man you're gonna want to get two or three green onions
01:41:51 chop them up into little little little sections uh take the tentacle looking bits off the bottom
01:41:56 and fucking chuck them bitches into your yard next time your dad knows the grass you can sift
01:42:00 through the clippings with your greasy little peasant food you might find some free green onions
01:42:03 that's pretty dope take that shit on the stove throw your fucking noodles in there throw your
01:42:09 fucking water in there empty the sauce packet in there put 75 percent of your green onions in there
01:42:15 and then a dash of sesame oil and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and once that shit gets going
01:42:20 you want to take a scoop of your peanut butter and just toss that shit right in there it'll get
01:42:24 on nice and emulsified it's fucking great you want to take the remaining 25 percent of your
01:42:28 green onions and sprinkle those along some red pepper flakes on top of your sunny side up eggs
01:42:33 that you've got going on medium heat cover that shit because you want to ensure that the yolk
01:42:38 remains raw right so when you put the nice crispy eggs on top of your fucking soup you can bust the
01:42:45 yolk into the broth and your dick would be crackling with sexual energy hey hey hell hell no fresh
01:42:53 that's actually the the the sesame oil and stuff like that is sounds incredible it's actually a
01:42:58 somewhat similar concoction to a thing that I make with ramen all the time it's ghetto carbonara
01:43:05 carbonara is a spaghetti uh dish sort of thing with egg in it and I make ramen with that so I
01:43:11 put uh I put I put also as well the chili flakes and like some a lot of like ground up red pepper
01:43:16 and then I put on an egg on top of it and I make sure to keep the yolk bursting on that as well
01:43:21 like a sunny side up yolk and I burst the egg into that shit and it's delicious if there's not that
01:43:26 much water in the ramen so it just kind of like the egg just coats the ramen without like yeah
01:43:31 the water sort of like you know alleviating that and it's just like carbonara it's just it's just
01:43:35 eggy noodles and it's delicious doesn't make that hey by the way I want to make that today
01:43:41 you know why am I the first because my kitchen works literally congratulations my kitchen was
01:43:48 fixed and I got groceries and I'm finally gonna be able to do my fair day in the world and fucking
01:43:52 cook again for the first time in literally months I'm so excited that's wonderful I feel an urge
01:44:00 to push back on mr hell no fresh because it seemed like the main component of his dish was like
01:44:05 instant ramen is that really like I mean can't you do better than that if you're cooking well
01:44:10 hold on shit out of instant ramen I mean it's not I mean it's not keto so it's obviously a zero out
01:44:15 of ten sure you can do it well I don't understand I mean it's an agree it like any other does it
01:44:21 taste the same as normal ramen no not really I mean though the the noodles in in instant ramen are
01:44:27 fairly low quality compared to other stuff I mean can't you you don't have to have a good dish with
01:44:32 like high quality ingredients that doesn't necessarily I'm just saying if you're making you
01:44:35 I mean are they are they any worse are they any worse than like regular pasta that's great because
01:44:40 it's easy to make and it's simple and it's you know you can make you can make it pretty reliably I
01:44:45 would say almost anytime you want to make top ramen I mean it seems like you're not even I mean okay
01:44:50 obviously there's other shit going on the peanut butter sesame alright it all sounds cool but I'm
01:44:53 just saying like the fundamental here like that's I don't know it feels like a cheat it feels like
01:44:58 it's not or it's not as good as it can be to make ramen noodles every single time you I'm with
01:45:03 munchy I'm with munchy and the instant ramen noodles are an ingredient like any other I I suppose
01:45:08 that's true and like you'll get it you'll get a different tasting dish if you use them as opposed
01:45:12 to I don't know a linguine well yeah I mean isn't there any kind of like raw ramen noodles you can
01:45:18 get like on its own and then like add you know spices and shit just of your own that gotta exist
01:45:24 somehow right like not just are you talking about the packet you can't just not use the packet
01:45:29 now well I'm saying like we're gonna get ramen noodles that aren't like the instant kind that are
01:45:33 you know like better you gotta go to knee home you go to where they sell the pasta you just boil
01:45:41 noodles in a you know they just come in packets similar what are ramen noodles I guess is the
01:45:47 real question I'm asked well instant instant instant ramen goes through a strange process that I saw
01:45:52 on TV once that involves something and it may or may not be good for you good but normal normal
01:46:00 ramen and pasta noodles that are not like instant and you have to like boil them for a number of
01:46:07 minutes those are just normal I've seen videos explaining how to make like real ramen and the
01:46:13 thing about it is that it is like a really complicated thing where you have to like steep
01:46:19 multiple like you have to do like multiple steps of like steeping different like herbs and ingredients
01:46:24 and like flakes of stuff and okay it's like it's like a it's like a pretty complicated process
01:46:30 that's how a lot of Japanese stuff it's like the katana food you gotta fold that yeah the invention
01:46:35 of making an instant ramen is like cutting out a million steps so yeah I guess there's no wonder
01:46:41 it's popular I think you can at like an asian market or something I think you can just sort of buy
01:46:46 like new like bundles of new of ramen noodle like you're not in like an instant pack but just sort
01:46:51 of tied up in like a like rolled up in like a ball sort of huh yeah okay that's kind of what I'm
01:46:57 talking about that'd be cool but maybe that's slightly more complex than I remember this recipe
01:47:01 involved the flavor packet it might it did it did okay he gave a couple of choices okay well
01:47:07 whatever fuck that he did say it was a ghetto dish so you know he did that's exactly kind of dish I
01:47:13 want a millet taste good is involved but doesn't make you want to kill yourself after the price
01:47:19 okay next voicemail let's do it it's uh Duke Nishimupil let's see what he's got for today

01:50:55 all right tom so choco taco you got one go toms or taco choco everybody i just wanted to correct
01:51:01 something nate said last week yeah you actually still can download stuff from emu paradise it's
01:51:07 just you have to download an extension called uh tamper monkey and run a script through it
01:51:14 this is pretty easy to set up you can just google it it works fine i disavow any kind of
01:51:22 illegal activity this man might be engaged in here uh i heard i heard that you just need a link
01:51:28 that like the the emulators are still there you just need to find they don't have the direct
01:51:33 links to them anymore so you need to find the direct links elsewhere like there's a subreddit
01:51:36 or something like well you know the links to download emulators are legal emulators themselves
01:51:41 are generally legal there's there's i'm i'm talking about the roms though i'm talking about the games
01:51:46 yeah um but i haven't actually tried it so i don't know if i mean there's an even easier way than that
01:51:52 friend all you have to do is buy the game purchase them on your nintendo switch yeah that's a stupid
01:51:57 idea it doesn't sound that something doesn't sit right about that to me on a moral grounds
01:52:04 get in contact with your friend andy activision and he'll hook you up with any game andy activision
01:52:10 did a hell of a job with securo so you know what i'm on i'm on his side right now uh but okay let's
01:52:15 let's listen up to uh lost tape archive number three
01:52:19 nate well it's by time i guess uh time to face the fire go i was blitzing through the cosmos
01:52:26 the other day in search of the holy bludge i crashed into a remote aquatic planet called florida
01:52:37 it extended its watery arms a wet tape in its clutches it whispered
01:52:43 take me take it my darling take it for nate
01:52:55 i am a being of pure utilitarian bliss sounds like it i hail from the holy nation the nation of
01:53:05 hydration drink your water drink your water i drink florida with a straw i now have the mass
01:53:26 of ten moons
01:53:43 i mean i think is the canon lower behind these like these are our private recordings
01:53:50 that this man stumbles upon we're like 12 and i still don't know i mean there's a
01:53:56 there's lore being unearthed here uh maybe in like a past life or maybe like at my core being
01:54:01 i'm like the reincarnation of a pure entity of pure utilitarianism and hydration who also wants
01:54:07 cochi that sounds about right but uh you don't sound like you've been drinking your water i've
01:54:23 i got well i got gatorade for my electrolytes with me right now which you mean in in that
01:54:27 recording in that recording it sounded like you needed a drink i need my water i need my water
01:54:34 peter the problem that's the problem the more water you drink the more you need the next time
01:54:39 to quench your thirst next true it's true best to just avoid it to begin with agree are we talking
01:54:46 about cutting down our carbs because believe me i would love
01:54:53 no we would never talk about doing such a thing keto squidward get out of here remember that time
01:55:01 the squidward bought canned bread the least keto food in existence next time yes i was upset
01:55:09 a boycott of the episode i drank the florida and you know have a large mass but okay uh let's
01:55:15 you need to drink your water need no there's no you have to drink your water everyone's
01:55:19 get a squidward pass a kidney stone and and spongebob bought it for 25 cents i okay i breathe
01:55:25 it wrong but the good news is we got poo easy rectal cleaner unit 2148 series is calling in
01:55:33 and let's get into it right now go this is a public service announcement we'll
01:55:37 let you know that you are all shit my voice modulator is bigger than your voice modulator
01:55:45 you suck balls especially fat but bag it you can die go down to the hole of anises where you
01:55:54 will be pooped on for eternity fuck you he wants to flex his voice mod I have the biggest he has
01:56:06 the biggest voice all right worst voice modulator that no like I like that because it's so over the
01:56:12 top but I could understand everything I want that voice it's true I could let me tell it too yeah
01:56:17 please email me you're probably just like six voice modulators on top of each other yeah maybe
01:56:22 that's what it is maybe we should do a bonus episode where we're all using this
01:56:27 speaking of bonus episodes possibly we recorded one recently oh there's there's a new one that
01:56:33 should be out by the time you hear it I missed it because I had my fucking kidney stone I had no
01:56:38 idea what was going on oh yeah well let's understand so if you hate then you'll love this episode
01:56:43 yeah it was uh without spoiling too much we get to the core of our personality and understand
01:56:50 things about ourselves that you know that there was there was some light spots the episode there
01:56:54 were some dark spots the episode but you know mostly dark honestly mostly dark not gonna lie
01:56:59 not gonna lie pretty dark uh okay moving on we've got a voicemail from uh voicemail housekeeping uh go
01:57:06 what happens to the old voicemails did he just get deleted is there an internet archive does Nate
01:57:10 download them all what happens also if I make a voicemail for a specific member of the podcast
01:57:16 and they're not on when I record it if my voicemail just doomed to never be played you have to spam
01:57:21 the folder that same voicemail over and over and over again or can Nate just download the voicemail
01:57:26 and then play when it's actually relevant and when the member's on the podcast also why aren't the
01:57:32 mp3s uploaded earlier doesn't think less time to just edit audio files and not edit audio and visuals
01:57:39 why not it wouldn't really hurt the viewers okay that's it all right bunch of questions there
01:57:44 so okay so they get deleted because they're on soundcloud we only got so much space uh this is
01:57:49 just this is just a utility question I happen to get back to them on uh and like so I have
01:57:54 all the voicemails downloaded right now on my computer I have them maybe maybe we should make
01:58:00 them available in the google drive we just we have the raw ones that have ever been been submitted or
01:58:04 are the ones that have ever been played they've ever been played ever been played only and they're
01:58:08 all they're in order too I think for the vast majority of them anyway so like maybe I can put
01:58:12 them on on the drive but then that'll take up space on the drive and really take up that much space
01:58:16 though you know they are really short let me see how much is a file not big it's not big I mean
01:58:23 you could make like a video that houses all of them and unlist it so they they'd be around
01:58:30 like if you made a super long video with all of the voicemails in them and just have it on the
01:58:34 on the channel unlisted and then link people to it if they really want it you have to keep
01:58:37 making more though right I mean yeah we have that's that's uh adding a lot of extra work well you
01:58:41 know you could just do like one for 2018 one for 2019 make a disposable or a straight email account
01:58:47 that says a separate google drive or something indeed well here's the I think I think they
01:58:51 could just go in their own file on the drive since they're small that's a reasonable idea
01:58:55 yeah I like that they will stuck up eventually though yeah but like I mean one pack of them
01:59:01 is maybe one megabyte is like one megabyte for like all all 10 or 12 for a thing yeah so we got
01:59:07 we got space and um uh to the other question the the last one about like uh what if I have a voicemail
01:59:15 that's first specific person like why doesn't Nate just like hang on to it until I got fucking I don't
01:59:20 make any extra money for doing this shit with the voicemails uh I'm sorry but if it's part of your
01:59:25 admin fee my money did not go up when I started doing this extra work so explain to me again why I
01:59:33 should continue to do this when I get nothing for it because you want to it well it is the admin fee
01:59:38 but the admin fee did not rise when this extra responsibility it's the admin fee didn't I'm
01:59:43 saying that it didn't I'm saying that it didn't go up and you didn't make any more money did the
01:59:47 show notes get rolled into the editor fee I mean they like they just get given to the editors but
01:59:52 there's a separate payment for uh doing the show notes that people get when they edit so I don't
01:59:57 want to hear any of this fucking Nate needs to do more work shit I mean if you want me to propose
02:00:02 me extra money and then I'll put more effort into it all right well then I guess the voicemails are
02:00:06 dead and we all know who to blame it's been yeah I'll take it all right yeah just nail me to that
02:00:11 cross Tom so to the practice for you less humble listeners out there submitting your voicemails
02:00:18 sorry but you just got to keep submitting shit uh you know if you got a if you want one you want
02:00:22 people to hear honestly it's amazing that the voicemails are still working because we're not
02:00:25 paying anything for the voicemails we're only supposed to get like 20 a month on the free account
02:00:29 and for some reason it just doesn't enforce yeah it just keeps working so I'm pretty thrilled about
02:00:34 that hey okay anyway moving on from that so sorry guys but the burden's on you you gotta you gotta
02:00:40 keep submitting shit and we do not what was the last thing about the mp3 is going up late was that
02:00:44 the mp3 for the voicemails oh I think I think that was about I think he's talking about the mp3 of
02:00:48 the podcast um if you're talking about like the itunes feed the reason it goes up hours later
02:00:53 than the video is because when I make them go live at the at the same time that the episode goes up
02:00:58 but then google and like itunes they have to do like a check and it takes like a couple hours for
02:01:03 it to get like approved yeah yeah I could do it earlier but if I do it earlier it risks it'll go
02:01:09 up before the actual episode yeah I think I think maybe the last several episodes the uh the mp3
02:01:15 link has not worked I don't know if that got fixed at any point but I think there were a bunch of
02:01:19 episodes there yeah where the mp3 download link was not I usually check it but uh I mean if anybody
02:01:26 has an issue with that for a while I was seeing comments being like the mp3 link doesn't work I
02:01:29 know there were two episodes that had the same work because it wasn't changed and I did go back
02:01:33 and fix that uh all right but people keep an eye out basically maybe it's maybe it's anytime there's
02:01:37 a problem like there are tons of people who just bitch at me I'll be out on Twitter and I go and
02:01:41 fix them so oh okay well great I don't get paid for that either Nate that's not true you literally
02:01:47 do get paid for that that is your job that you get a fee for so no no I get I get paid to to upload
02:01:53 the stuff to iTunes but I mean like when there's things in the description people come bitch at me
02:01:57 and I fix those as well I don't get paid oh well I mean yeah I mean you have no responsibility to
02:02:01 do that yeah but I do it because I'm why do they bitch to you of all people uh because I've just
02:02:06 become that guy I guess uh well okay I mean you don't have to it's it's fine I don't like it's the
02:02:12 editor's responsibility to do that shit so who's the editor for the last like two months I mean
02:02:16 well okay so it is your responsibility is the point but because you're the editor that I don't
02:02:21 do well then it's not you okay whatever it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what I'm saying is I
02:02:26 get no ground on this point I suffer just as much as you that's what I'm trying to say even
02:02:30 it's not it's not true at all but I'm sticking to that's a hill I'm dying on for no reason
02:02:34 other than I feel like it well good news uh we've got a mail from best baby ever
02:02:40 and this is gonna be good I can already tell I can't wait here we go well this is the best baby
02:02:45 area and I just wanted to say that food is too fucking hard to make I'm tired of I'm too weak
02:02:50 for to follow instructions I want self cooking food I want to cook to be caught I want a baby
02:02:56 mode I want an easier than easy mode food should respect me as a consumer and give me an easier
02:03:02 than easy mode I I can't follow a youtube recipe I just it's too fucking hard I can't I can't
02:03:10 don't even find the the ingredients in the supermarket but I cannot do a shit I want
02:03:15 that a self cooking food I'm entitled to that if I pay for my ingredients I should have a good
02:03:21 a good meal in my head I this is a straw man I just shot myself oh he shat himself he shat
02:03:29 okay okay you know what I'm I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna say it guys based on popular
02:03:34 opinion which is the only measure of truth yeah I definitely won the hello fresh debate
02:03:39 you definitely did I don't everyone is everyone is on board with me I am the king I am the reigning
02:03:44 champion because everyone who listens to our podcast is poor and can't afford a service yeah
02:03:49 exactly everyone but no I think that our viewers are are intelligent capable human beings who are
02:03:55 more than able to fucking google a recipe and when we get a fucking flower at the supermarket
02:04:00 except when they shoot down political discussion then they're fucking retarded that's right then
02:04:03 they're fucking stupid okay as long as I always I found I found listening to that quite interesting
02:04:09 especially specifically with Nate saying that like yeah organizing ingredients and making a
02:04:16 meal is like so much of an extra hassle that you can't deal with and you want to be a baby and
02:04:21 you know spoon fan right no no no you were saying you were saying that words to that effect right
02:04:28 you're saying that sort of like you're phrasing in a very critical way but I mean I'm just saying
02:04:33 I'm just saying you don't want to have to think about it right you don't want to have to think
02:04:37 about it yeah but then at the same time you are like a calorie counting gain guy that like does
02:04:44 all of that other stuff that which pertains to food which is like why couldn't you also do that
02:04:50 when buying ingredients well okay but I mean to me that sounds like like uh you know a person
02:04:56 you're carrying you know 10 stones like what's the big just carry 11 stones and I mean like okay I
02:05:02 get it's not that much extra work but you don't want more stones to carry you want the least amount
02:05:08 possible I mean I think it's just that you have like the capability to to like regiment yourself
02:05:14 in that way already it's like a skill you already have you just don't want to apply it to this other
02:05:20 thing which is very very similar I I mean I guess so I've never been a cooking guy I mean let's be
02:05:25 fair though if there was something that Nate could just like use to just automatically count his
02:05:30 calories he would just do it like it wouldn't do it if he didn't have to that's true like there was
02:05:34 like some service I could sign up to that like scan whatever food I ate and just added it I mean
02:05:39 that'd be fantastic that'd be uh you know that'd be what I want just put an implant in your cheek
02:05:44 that scans everything that goes in your mouth and automatically you fucking counts all the calories
02:05:48 that'd be great that being said though you kind of want to you want to the point of some of the
02:05:51 point of counting calories is to like like not choose the things that are bad because you know
02:05:56 they're gonna be bad so it's a little bit of it'd be like by the time the food hits your lips it's
02:05:59 kind of too late sometimes but the thing about cooking for yourself is that it's modular in
02:06:03 that you can you can tune it to be whatever you want it to be like I've been making I've been
02:06:08 making a lot I've been using Arlo's crust recipe and I've been making a lot of keto pizzas lately
02:06:13 and you know I know I know exactly what goes in them you have wait you have two
02:06:17 I have no I want to get it on it sounds good oh it's it's great I made a I made like a pesto
02:06:23 with like I made like a pesto pizza with tomatoes and onions a while ago I ate that and then the other
02:06:28 day I made one with a salami onion mushroom and more sliced tomatoes with like a red sauce it was
02:06:33 really good it's really delicious it's really great okay I and and and but the point is I know
02:06:39 exactly what goes in them and I can make exactly how much I want and I can do if I want to not
02:06:45 cook for a while I can just make a much bigger one and it's it's it's it's convenient I I find
02:06:50 it more convenient like getting like that even even if Hello Fresh was like okay we'll deliver
02:06:55 three meals a day to you for like you know every day for like the rest of your life it's like yeah
02:07:00 well you'd still have to cook each one of them individually you know and that and da da da da
02:07:04 I got you the only thing is I've never operated that way in my in my life where like I've like
02:07:11 even when I was at my best calorie counting and you know most regimented with my diet and all that
02:07:15 stuff counting every single day and counting every calorie eight and stuff um like even then I would
02:07:20 like I had like designated meals that were just designed to meet the macronutrient goals of the
02:07:26 day and and that was by far the most important thing I was never I never like I just don't think
02:07:32 in a modular way when it comes to cooking I mean maybe I should that would be better but like I've
02:07:37 always been like ingredient like calorie first and then everything else is far secondary and so I
02:07:42 just like found you know recipes that allow me to you know mix those calories in a you know palatable
02:07:47 way for the day or whatever so just different way of thinking yeah but you can't you can't do that
02:07:51 with Hello Fresh though uh you get whatever they send you that's true that's true uh those those are
02:07:56 I I hate this topic more than life itself because I have such a non-point but I'm forced to play
02:08:02 devil's advocate about it all the time I don't recommend Hello Fresh I think it could be good
02:08:09 if you know if the things that we've talked about on the podcast seem like they're attractive to you
02:08:14 I don't think that if like if someone came to me and said I want to learn how to cook I would not
02:08:19 say get Hello Fresh I wouldn't say that I will say that the like I enjoyed Hello Fresh because
02:08:28 with stuff like that when you have you wouldn't like Nate you've never like branched out or tried
02:08:34 to have that creative spark and learn new recipes on your own the most appealing thing about Hello
02:08:41 Fresh is that it forces you into these boxes that they have like meticulously made to be fast
02:08:48 and easy and even though it's easy in the sense that it's not hard to do it will still help you
02:08:54 branch out because they're varied meals and they have various different ways that you can prepare
02:08:58 it with various different you know cuisines and and genres of food so the point of Hello Fresh in
02:09:04 my eyes was to be a a bomb in a way a bomb that would go off in my fridge if I did not cook Hello
02:09:12 Fresh well then that was wasted money and I didn't want to waste money you know buying Hello Fresh and
02:09:17 then just not even cooking it so it right the purpose of it was to force myself to do things
02:09:23 that I would not normally do that that was the benefit for me that was probably the sole benefit
02:09:30 and after I was like okay you know what I feel good that I've branched out I don't need to do
02:09:35 this anymore because I just want to do these things because I've realized that they're not that hard
02:09:41 to do and I can do them reliably on my own that's the point I that's the only thing I that's the
02:09:46 only goodwill I have towards Hello Fresh is that it's easy and it forces you to do stuff that you
02:09:51 would not you know would not normally do that's the convenience and that's the service that I want
02:09:55 I don't think that it's the best thing that you could do with your money it's not economical all
02:10:01 right it's not the best you could do for the price I don't agree with this before not to rush
02:10:06 I just want to say that I mean we're not that different Ben we're not that different I hate
02:10:10 being on the other side of this argument I don't like yeah yeah yeah I agree I just wanted to say
02:10:15 that I won and I beat you okay that's fine I have the mind I have the mind of a child is my point
02:10:21 but let's let's move on to uh oh chilling chocolate chilling chocolate has a message for us uh let me
02:10:28 say okay we got two left uh okay and oh shit I'm in the wrong chat I don't want to mean this one up
