00:00:00 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:03 I'm your host, the best guy ever, Guy, here with my bunch of friends once again.
00:00:09 First up is Digibro.
00:00:10 Hey everybody, let's get sleazy.
00:00:14 And Hippocrit.
00:00:16 I didn't think of a thing, a penis.
00:00:19 There you go.
00:00:21 And we have a special guest today, our good friend Cotton Candy.
00:00:25 Hi everyone.
00:00:26 I am the Assygnated vagina haver for this evening.
00:00:30 There's much more to it than that.
00:00:31 That's so short because among us, you are by far.
00:00:35 No, it is, it is.
00:00:36 You are by far the biggest expert on porn.
00:00:38 Because not only have I witnessed your sincere passion for the medium,
00:00:43 but you in fact created for money much of the time.
00:00:47 I saw your Megarene Luca body pillow, which was awesome.
00:00:51 I'm drawn porn.
00:00:52 We should clarify.
00:00:53 She creates drawn porn for money.
00:00:56 She does not star in porn for money.
00:00:58 As far as we know.
00:00:59 As far as we see you guys know.
00:01:00 As far as we know.
00:01:01 That's true.
00:01:02 Yes.
00:01:03 So can, just for that, can people buy that body pillow somewhere?
00:01:07 Is there like a link we could put in?
00:01:08 It's not finished yet because I want to do different outfits
00:01:11 so everyone can choose which version of Luca to buy.
00:01:15 Awesome.
00:01:16 That's great.
00:01:17 Luca is by far the best Megaloid, Vocaloid.
00:01:21 Vocaloid, yeah.
00:01:22 I like Moogie.
00:01:25 Which one's Moogie?
00:01:26 Is that the green haired one?
00:01:27 Yes.
00:01:28 But that's not.
00:01:29 Wait, isn't her name Goomi?
00:01:30 No.
00:01:31 I just forgot it.
00:01:32 Okay.
00:01:33 So today, in case you hadn't already guessed, we're talking about pornography.
00:01:40 Porno.
00:01:41 Yes.
00:01:42 We talked about all kinds of porno.
00:01:44 It was just, just drawn stuff.
00:01:46 Pretty, just all kinds.
00:01:48 Really the concept of porn in general.
00:01:50 And there's some other topics that branch off of it.
00:01:52 But in the meantime, I thought we'd just start off by just, just airing our general thoughts
00:01:58 on the matter.
00:01:59 So let me start off by just saying anyone who thinks porn is bad for anyone.
00:02:04 I don't care how young you are.
00:02:06 I think porn, I think sex really in general is a healthy thing for everyone to have a
00:02:11 pretty thorough understanding of no matter what your age.
00:02:15 I think a lot of the resentment to it in America at least comes from Christianity, which is
00:02:20 retarded.
00:02:21 And I wish that everyone who didn't like it and didn't support it all the time would
00:02:26 go away forever.
00:02:27 That's my sense.
00:02:28 I think that's getting a little broad because you're kind of equating sex and porn.
00:02:35 And porn is not exactly a good representation of sex.
00:02:40 Okay.
00:02:41 You want to get into that?
00:02:42 Sure.
00:02:43 Sure.
00:02:44 Yeah.
00:02:45 I'm sure we have to at some point if we're going to discuss porn.
00:02:46 Like, you know, porn gives you very skewed expectations of what sex is, especially if
00:02:53 you watch a lot of porn before you ever have sex, especially if you watch a lot of live
00:02:59 action porn.
00:03:00 I actually think live action porn is worse maybe at educating you than anime porn can
00:03:05 be.
00:03:06 At least there's that veneer of, you know, this is not legit.
00:03:08 So, you know, it's not, well, the funny thing is, and this is going to come up at some point
00:03:13 anyways, but because I feel like we should, we're all, we all watch a lot of anime porn,
00:03:18 right?
00:03:19 Yep.
00:03:20 And cotton candy obviously creates it.
00:03:21 Yeah.
00:03:22 So, to start off by like getting the audience on the same page as us in case anyone's listening
00:03:27 to this who doesn't look at that kind of stuff, like to explain what the appeal is.
00:03:33 Because the funny thing about live action porn is that you know it's not real sex.
00:03:40 Like you know it's not these two people really met and did, like especially if there's like
00:03:44 a story, the story's obviously scripted.
00:03:46 What do you mean?
00:03:47 That pizza delivery guy really needed some form of payment for that.
00:03:50 And it's always, you know, the people are often, which not as much anymore because we
00:03:55 have so much amateur porn now, but it used to be, you know, it's always like fake titties,
00:03:58 big insane looking dicks, you know, like just people who are bred for porn, you know, and
00:04:05 the way that they have sex can be so crazy that it's not like real life.
00:04:09 And so the funny thing is that I think especially for our generation, what sort of attracts
00:04:15 them to anime porn is that it is paradoxically more authentic because while the characters
00:04:22 aren't real people, they are actually having sex because they love each other most of the
00:04:28 time.
00:04:29 Okay.
00:04:30 Because they're really in the situations.
00:04:31 I don't know.
00:04:32 Wait, why are you making that comparison?
00:04:34 I think that.
00:04:35 I mean, now go on Cece.
00:04:36 What do you have to say?
00:04:38 I have very different variations of the kind of content that I got.
00:04:43 I didn't mean to say that they always are in love with each other.
00:04:46 I just meant that the situations are real.
00:04:48 Like even if it's rape, it's real rape in the context of the story.
00:04:54 That is true.
00:04:55 That is true.
00:04:56 And like when you watch that one arrow gay, like, yeah, a guy comes to work at an arrow
00:04:59 gay making company and they just, they needed miles.
00:05:02 They needed sexual experience to know how to drive that shit.
00:05:05 They're never going to watch a live action porn where there's a real rape scene or there's
00:05:11 characters who really love each other or there's anything real.
00:05:15 None of it's ever real.
00:05:16 You know it's stage.
00:05:17 I guess that's true.
00:05:18 But in the context of the anime, for the characters, like in the most common one, and this is,
00:05:22 to me, I think this is the biggest reason that anime porn is so big, especially in Japan,
00:05:27 because in Japan they value purity a lot.
00:05:31 Sure.
00:05:32 Sure.
00:05:33 And in anime, it's actually a virgin.
00:05:34 That's true.
00:05:35 If a girl is losing her virginity, which is almost always the case, then she is really
00:05:40 a virgin in the context of the story, because it's a character you made up, you know.
00:05:45 Incidentally, Japan not into the whole bleeding during sex to prove their a virgin thing.
00:05:50 Not a big fan.
00:05:51 I'll turn their word for it.
00:05:52 You know?
00:05:53 I know too much about how that's like, because in anime it's always like, you're not supposed
00:05:56 to tear the hymen.
00:05:57 That is not how it's supposed to work.
00:05:59 Right.
00:06:00 In anime it's always like, they have sex while they're a virgin and then they start bleeding
00:06:05 but then within 10 seconds she's like, now I'm getting used to it.
00:06:08 Oh, it starts to feel good now.
00:06:09 Yeah.
00:06:10 Yeah.
00:06:11 Got to love that.
00:06:12 It's not often like that in real life.
00:06:14 It can be possibly, but it's not usually.
00:06:17 This is a serious question, though.
00:06:19 Isn't your point about it being authentic undermined by the fact that it is clearly fake, because
00:06:24 they're animated?
00:06:25 I mean, is that...
00:06:26 Well, yeah, but it's more emotionally authentic.
00:06:28 It's like when you're...
00:06:30 For instance, I think this is why Yuri stuff is so popular, and this was true for me when
00:06:38 I was younger, because I was only interested in lesbian stuff for a long time.
00:06:43 In live action, you almost never get real lesbian sex.
00:06:48 It's always made for guys, it's always girls doing all this stuff that they wouldn't necessarily
00:06:54 usually do in real life, whereas in anime, if you read a lot of Yuri porn, it's always
00:07:02 extremely sensual.
00:07:03 There's usually a fucking ton of story and dialogue and very little actual fucking, and
00:07:09 it's usually pretty quick.
00:07:12 The girls are always the hottest ever.
00:07:14 It's always like the cutest girls in history are always in Yuri porn, but they only fuck
00:07:20 for two pages, and I always get real pissed off.
00:07:25 That's interesting, because I've been trying to figure this out for a long time.
00:07:30 I have never, ever, at any point in my life, been particularly stimulated at all by Yuri.
00:07:36 I pretty much always need there to be a guy there for me to get at all interested.
00:07:41 Perhaps that's just a weakness of mine.
00:07:42 I need to self-insert into the situation, but when I'm looking at porn, that's more
00:07:48 the stuff that I'm interested in.
00:07:50 Well, maybe it's the lack of a dick.
00:07:52 Have you tried food and airies?
00:07:54 Bible black?
00:07:55 Yes, actually, my favorite, I was going to say my favorite, hence I have all time, is
00:07:59 Bible black, without a doubt, because really, you've got the best of both worlds there.
00:08:03 You've got two sets of tits flopping around, and you've got the dick action that you can
00:08:06 project onto.
00:08:08 Everyone's a winner.
00:08:09 Everyone's a winner in that situation.
00:08:10 So, it's not that you don't like lesbian porn, as you need the dick somewhere in there.
00:08:16 Yes, because that's the focal point of the scene.
00:08:19 You need that going on, so that you have an investment that you can jack off properly.
00:08:23 There's two girls schlicking, it's like, okay, how am I, how is my fapping right now related
00:08:29 to this situation?
00:08:30 It's not.
00:08:31 It's like I'm an alien observing.
00:08:32 I feel like I took a weird backwards trajectory with this, because when I was younger, I would
00:08:36 only look at like, eerie stuff, because I just didn't want to see dicks, I just didn't
00:08:40 want them around, I thought they were ugly and terrible, and I hated them.
00:08:44 And also just like, when you don't understand sex that much, it seems more violent, and
00:08:50 like it's just like, to me like, male on female sex felt more violent, especially, I suppose
00:08:57 you could use that word.
00:08:59 Well, okay, let me take you back to, we're talking about like 2005, 2006, and I didn't
00:09:04 like know how to find porn very much.
00:09:08 Wait, 2005, how old were you?
00:09:11 2006, I'd be 15, I think, yeah, I'm turning 25 this year.
00:09:17 I started young then.
00:09:19 Well no, this is when I started, I just like, I didn't have like, I didn't start using
00:09:25 the internet to find porn until later, like when I was really young, like I found my dad's
00:09:31 porn magazines under the bed, you know, and I was always terrified of like viruses and
00:09:38 stuff like that, you know, because like, because that was common back then.
00:09:41 If you went on porn sites, you had porn and stuff.
00:09:44 Yeah, that's actually how my fucking cousin ruined my computer, like in 2003, I had gotten
00:09:50 a new computer, and then my cousin like was using Livewire to download all this music and
00:09:55 porn and stuff, and he totally ruined my computer with viruses, and I had no idea.
00:09:59 Let me share my first story ever getting this, because I love telling people about this.
00:10:03 I was playing StarCraft, doing like Frogger Mode, you know, like the online Battle.net
00:10:08 stuff, and one of the banner ads, I remember it so well, was this Asian chick, like riding
00:10:13 a dildo or something, I had no idea what it was, I clicked that link, and discovered
00:10:18 a whole new world, man, I remember it like it was fucking yesterday, yeah, exactly.
00:10:24 That's funny, because I remember being in Newgrounds the first time that I discovered
00:10:28 Zone, so I didn't know what it was, I really loved my life as a teenage robot, and I saw
00:10:35 the thumbnail, and I thought it was just like a cute animated clip of it, and it wasn't.
00:10:41 Yeah, that's a good one.
00:10:43 Shout out to ZoneSama, legendary animator.
00:10:45 How long has Zone been around?
00:10:46 Jesus Christ.
00:10:47 Oh god, 15, 20 years, at least 15.
00:10:50 It's a lot of time to be drawing cartoon porn.
00:10:53 Yeah, I think he works for Hentai Key, like on a contractual basis or something, whatever.
00:10:58 So yeah, I discovered, I started trying to use the internet for porn, but it was like
00:11:03 I would just Google search and stuff, or I gradually found out about the image boards,
00:11:09 like, do you guys know Danboru or Gelboru, any of those?
00:11:14 Yes, of course.
00:11:15 So I had discovered Gelboru, and the thing is that I didn't know search terms or anything
00:11:21 I was looking for, so it was just random stuff, so you're treated to everything, every fetish
00:11:28 is all right there on the page.
00:11:30 So most of it, I was just like, I don't want to see any of this, so I would just look at
00:11:34 the Yuri stuff, you know?
00:11:36 And then it's funny because over time, I think the official moment when it became difficult
00:11:43 to go back to, I still love Yuri conceptually, I love when it's girls together, it's adorable,
00:11:48 I think it's the cutest thing ever, but once I had actually had sex and appreciated how
00:11:56 it works, it became harder for me to understand how girls get off when they have sex with
00:12:01 each other, because there's no real lesbian porn out there, and I've always thought I
00:12:11 want to ask, just go around the internet asking real lesbians, but you never know who's a
00:12:15 real lesbian online, because everyone wants to say they're real lesbians.
00:12:17 Why couldn't you just ask a girl in general, I mean, they're experts in getting themselves
00:12:21 off, I assume.
00:12:23 There's a huge difference between getting yourself off and getting another person off,
00:12:27 like are you just doing the same things to them you would do to yourself, because that
00:12:31 seems like it could be boring or awkward, I've always found the concept of the reach
00:12:36 around or the reach over to just like, it seems awkward to me.
00:12:40 That's pretty awkward.
00:12:41 Just ask.
00:12:42 Jesus.
00:12:43 Well, I don't know any lesbians, so.
00:12:45 Talk to the person.
00:12:47 Oh, she's saying during sex, yeah, okay.
00:12:50 Well, I'm not having sex with any lesbians for sure.
00:12:53 You're missing out, you're totally missing out.
00:12:56 I don't know how I'm going to get into that.
00:12:58 How would you ever arrange that situation?
00:13:00 You'd have to set up a threesome situation, that's the only way.
00:13:02 Yeah, you need.
00:13:03 One of them would have to be bi even then.
00:13:05 That's true, that's true.
00:13:06 Well, you could get a unicorn.
00:13:09 I want to know what it's like for girls who have no interest in dick at all to have sex
00:13:15 with each other, and what exactly they do, and of course it's going to be different
00:13:17 for everybody.
00:13:18 There's to some extent to which I can say, because anime sex is weird, but then to some
00:13:24 extent you can look at it and go, well, even if it's one in a million, it could still happen.
00:13:31 Even if the whole popping the cherry and then she enjoys it 10 seconds later.
00:13:35 It could happen.
00:13:36 Very over-represented in anime, but that doesn't mean it never happens.
00:13:40 That's the thing.
00:13:41 These things happen.
00:13:42 Okay.
00:13:43 I know that there are sites that are dedicated to doing real porn quotation marks, but all
00:13:50 of the ones that I know, if you have to pay for subscriptions, I can't really think of
00:13:54 any names right now, but I think the easiest way to find it is going to the comic Ojoisextoi.
00:14:01 Every other time they'll mention a website that does specifically that.
00:14:06 Ojoisextoi, cool.
00:14:08 Over time I came to realize that I think I can tell the difference between Yuri that's
00:14:13 written by women and Yuri that's written by men.
00:14:18 The way it's targeted is going to be pretty clear probably.
00:14:20 It's like a matter of a trend changed because I think a lot more women got into writing
00:14:25 it in the last five years, because I was really into Yuri in the late 2000s.
00:14:31 Most of it was pretty much the same.
00:14:35 It all had the same kind of tone.
00:14:37 It was all very much in this Marimite and Maihime style, where it's usually like an
00:14:43 older girl and a younger girl.
00:14:47 What's it called?
00:14:48 Sono Hanabira ni Kuchizuke, or what the fuck is the English name for that?
00:14:53 Something about Skye.
00:14:56 In Sono Hanabira, which is a very popular series of Yuri Edoge, those are really hardcore.
00:15:03 They just fuck all the time.
00:15:04 The whole thing is just nothing but girls having sex, and often it gets a little fetishy
00:15:09 and stuff.
00:15:10 Those are clearly meant for guys, not to say that women can't enjoy them.
00:15:15 I'm sure plenty of lesbians do, especially because it was the best thing you had for
00:15:19 a long time.
00:15:21 Once there was what's Yuri caught on in 2010 area, and then suddenly there's Yuri manga
00:15:28 everywhere, and suddenly a lot of it's being written by women, and suddenly a lot of it
00:15:32 is really, really adorable, really low-key sex, and much more story.
00:15:41 Kind of like the greatest lesbian hero of all time, what's her face who makes Hitamari
00:15:45 sketch?
00:15:46 She doesn't make porn, but her passion for the female porn is truly inspiring.
00:15:51 It's the best.
00:15:52 She loves girls.
00:15:53 It's great.
00:15:54 I was reading, I loved this, there was some lesbian porn I was reading recently, and
00:16:01 the author had a little omake at the end, where she was talking about how she went to
00:16:05 this meet-up with all these other Yuri authors.
00:16:08 She was trying to explain that she's not gay, but when she sees a woman, a beautiful woman,
00:16:16 she feels really glad, she feels like she's been rewarded or something.
00:16:21 She's trying to explain this at the meeting, and they go, man, that's pretty gay, and she's
00:16:26 walking home thinking, I guess it is pretty gay, but they just don't get it.
00:16:31 No, no, no.
00:16:32 My intense appreciation for the male form is like the ancient Greeks.
00:16:36 It's the highest form of artistic beauty that there is.
00:16:39 It's meant to be appreciated and studied, and if you get a stiffy sometimes, well, that's
00:16:43 just nature taking its course.
00:16:45 It doesn't mean a damn thing.
00:16:46 I don't need your labels, people.
00:16:48 I don't know.
00:16:50 I've never been the...
00:16:51 I know a lot of guys who feel that way.
00:16:54 Like Jimmy is always talking about how he loves free, because he loves the chiseled male
00:16:59 body aesthetic and everything.
00:17:01 I've never really felt that.
00:17:02 I just like things to be cute and adorable.
00:17:05 But free is like porn for animators too, because you know that they did the muscles perfect
00:17:12 for every style of swimming.
00:17:14 Yeah.
00:17:15 And I was a professional swimmer too, so I just stare at it.
00:17:18 Wait, you were a professional swimmer?
00:17:20 Yes.
00:17:21 That's right.
00:17:22 You've told me that before.
00:17:23 Man, that's crazy.
00:17:24 Professional swimmer, professional porn maker.
00:17:25 Yeah.
00:17:26 What a crazy ride you've had.
00:17:28 And I've also done wrestling and cheerleader and stand-up comedy and all this other shit.
00:17:34 Holy shit.
00:17:35 Globetrotter, multi-linguist.
00:17:38 What else can we add to your insane list of acolytes?
00:17:41 Aren't you like a straight A student too?
00:17:43 Yeah, podcasting.
00:17:44 Podcasting, yep.
00:17:45 This is really your highest achievement.
00:17:48 Might as well say now, this is our first time doing one, so this is the virginal experience.
00:17:54 Yes, we are popping CC's cherry here.
00:17:57 Yep.
00:17:58 Yep.
00:17:59 No blood on the dance floor.
00:18:00 No blood, yes.
00:18:01 Oh, please be gentle, Senpai.
00:18:05 Well, I guess now might be a good time to perhaps talk about the other...
00:18:11 You know what, actually, Digi, what was that topic you said at the very beginning?
00:18:14 Because I've got something else that's totally a left turn from this.
00:18:17 Let's move on to...
00:18:18 About porn being unrealistic and weird?
00:18:22 Yeah.
00:18:23 Yeah.
00:18:24 Or it being bad for people.
00:18:25 I want to talk about people's perception of it and the whole negative backlash people have.
00:18:29 I mean, sometimes, all of us seem like we're pretty much on the same page, but...
00:18:33 Well, but maybe every one of us has come to that conclusion from different paths, so...
00:18:38 That's probably true.
00:18:39 That would be cool to hear.
00:18:42 Where to start with that?
00:18:44 Well, CC, you obviously are...
00:18:46 You do this with a great passion.
00:18:48 You create these things.
00:18:50 So, I mean, where did your interest in this start?
00:18:52 How did you get into this?
00:18:54 Well, I know, for a fact, having been here in North America for a while,
00:18:58 that you guys are way more sexually repressed.
00:19:01 Absolutely.
00:19:02 Absolutely.
00:19:03 Like, every way.
00:19:04 Yeah.
00:19:05 All of the dances in Colombia and everything is way much more open to sex and sex education and all of these stuff.
00:19:11 That sounds awesome.
00:19:12 It was never a weird thing to me.
00:19:14 It was never a tabloid thing.
00:19:15 Like, I was in a religious school, but the government forces every school to allow honest, open, sex eddy stuff.
00:19:23 And also, my parents have a bunch of friends who are sexologists and stuff.
00:19:28 So, it's never been...
00:19:29 What does that mean?
00:19:30 I don't know what they do.
00:19:31 What does it sound like it means?
00:19:33 It means they have sex all the time.
00:19:35 Yes.
00:19:36 In an expert way.
00:19:38 That's awesome.
00:19:39 Like, I don't usually tell people this, but I find it funny.
00:19:42 My first professional job ever, like I was like 12, was to make Valentine's cards for one of them.
00:19:50 It's just penises doing Valentine's cards.
00:19:53 That's awesome.
00:19:54 So, it's always been an open topic for me.
00:19:57 It's never been taboo, which can backfire because I know it can take people as a surprise if I just mention it like gloss over it.
00:20:05 Here in North America, it's so taboo that half our fucking panel didn't show up today.
00:20:09 I know.
00:20:10 I know.
00:20:11 Jesse and...
00:20:12 Well, actually, Davout didn't come on because he was afraid of intimidating people with his unusual sexual preferences.
00:20:17 Yes.
00:20:18 He's not even that weird, though.
00:20:20 Didn't want to talk about it.
00:20:22 Okay, that's not fair.
00:20:24 He is pretty weird, but like...
00:20:26 He's only got like one or two things that are weirder than what I like.
00:20:29 Yeah.
00:20:30 Well, yeah, but we're all like...
00:20:32 That's like comparing like a 9 out of 10 to a 10 out of 10.
00:20:36 We're all pretty weird about what we are willing to look at.
00:20:39 Yes.
00:20:40 You know, I want to dispel the notion that we are weird because I think we are in fact totally normal.
00:20:45 I want to put in the description, this video, that everyone needs to see that some...
00:20:50 You know, it's that famous scene from Not Welcome to the NHK.
00:20:54 What's the other one with the...
00:20:56 Genshiken.
00:20:57 Genshiken.
00:20:58 Where the guy is describing, you know, why he's attracted...
00:21:00 Oh, yeah, you gotta put that in.
00:21:01 That is the quintessential explanation for why, I mean, among other things, a hentai is attractive or whatever.
00:21:07 Because people to this fucking day say they don't understand why you can be attracted to animation or any of that shit.
00:21:14 Do you people not understand the concept of like human interpretation of symbols?
00:21:19 And like, how could you just read a book?
00:21:21 The fact that you can relate to art at all.
00:21:23 That doesn't make any sense.
00:21:24 It just squiggles on a page.
00:21:25 What's up with that?
00:21:26 Fucking idiots.
00:21:27 Go kill yourself.
00:21:28 Yeah, that's the point of it is to represent something that is real.
00:21:31 And yeah, although if you intro with that, you can't intro with the internet disforbored, which I had imagined as the intro.
00:21:39 We'll have to make up.
00:21:40 That's the more cliche one, so I guess we could just go with the...
00:21:43 I made my own suggestions too.
00:21:44 She did.
00:21:45 Yes.
00:21:46 She gave me a...
00:21:47 I put a few songs.
00:21:48 I said Digmatized by Jenny McGovern.
00:21:52 Smell Your Dick.
00:21:53 All of those are particularly about porn so much.
00:21:58 So intense.
00:21:59 I'd like to teach the world to fap.
00:22:01 That's good.
00:22:02 That one's related.
00:22:03 Yeah.
00:22:04 Yeah.
00:22:05 I don't know.
00:22:06 Is there anything else to say on this?
00:22:07 I'll fuck everyone who says porn is bad.
00:22:09 I think watching porn definitely needs to be destigmatized, although I don't think that...
00:22:15 There's kind of a double-edged sword here, because if you've ever seen any documentaries or heard behind-the-scenes stuff about how porn is made,
00:22:24 it's definitely a sausage you don't want to know the story behind.
00:22:28 That's true.
00:22:29 There's a lot of drug use, a lot of suicide, a lot of rape.
00:22:36 A lot of people get into porn because they're kind of at the rock bottom.
00:22:41 Yes.
00:22:42 But you have to ask a very serious question, which we probably don't know the answer to,
00:22:46 but these people do do it out of their own free will, and perhaps it's a trap.
00:22:50 Maybe it's a vicious cycle where they can't escape, but there is free agency at work.
00:22:55 If you're into free agency, I am, so I think it's up to them.
00:23:01 I don't know about most people, but I'm really picky about when it comes to really any porn.
00:23:07 I kind of have this sense where I have a harder time watching it if it seems particularly skeevy,
00:23:17 or the people seem like they're really not into it.
00:23:20 If it looks especially fake, the girl looks like she's putting on a show and looks tired.
00:23:27 That's a big reason why I prefer 2D a lot of the time, because there is nothing more attractive to me
00:23:32 about a scene than two people just having the best fucking time.
00:23:36 I am all about that.
00:23:37 I want people to have so much fun while they're having sex.
00:23:40 I've seen live action porn where it looks like they're just having a lot of fun,
00:23:44 where it's funny and kind of cute in a way, and they seem to be pretty into it.
00:23:49 Have you seen the new porn that came out?
00:23:51 There's times where I'm like, that girl seems like she's drugged.
00:23:55 There's times where the girl would just be completely out of it, her pupils are all dilated,
00:24:00 and she's just like, ah, or that.
00:24:02 I'm like, yeah.
00:24:03 Dude, have you seen the new porn that I think Brazzers came out with?
00:24:06 It's like the meme fuck or something.
00:24:08 All they do is they spout TV, from the board on, unfortunately, on TV,
00:24:13 they just spout TV memes the whole time.
00:24:15 This guy takes this girl back home to his house.
00:24:17 The whole family is wearing Bane masks.
00:24:20 This is what they do.
00:24:21 They're doing this the entire time.
00:24:24 Every line of dialogue is just another meme.
00:24:27 Why?
00:24:28 I don't know, dude.
00:24:29 Honestly, people love it.
00:24:31 People, I love it.
00:24:32 I need to plug in this particular moment that you're mentioning.
00:24:35 If anyone can find the professional Scooby-Doo XXX parody, watch it.
00:24:40 It's so, oh my god, it's so funny.
00:24:42 Okay.
00:24:43 Do you know who made it?
00:24:45 No, because he, I had this theory because he's really hard to track down,
00:24:49 because of course I did.
00:24:50 And we had a theory with a friend that maybe it's like a real director in Hollywood,
00:24:54 and that's why it's so good, but they don't want people to know.
00:24:57 Right.
00:24:58 That sounds awesome.
00:24:59 I want to find that.
00:25:00 And they even have like this chase scene where they go through the doors,
00:25:03 but it's like sexy and stuff.
00:25:05 It's so funny.
00:25:06 That sounds amazing.
00:25:07 Oh man, I want to see that shit.
00:25:09 And I feel like the cast that they chose for that one is like even better than the one
00:25:13 that they chose for the live action movie, so.
00:25:15 All right, so I got to get down to this because you're bringing this up.
00:25:18 So are you guys more into porn with a story or concept,
00:25:22 or do you just want to watch people fuck?
00:25:24 To be honest, it depends on the mood.
00:25:26 That's exactly right.
00:25:27 It's exactly right.
00:25:28 Because personally, I have never liked like the story concept porn.
00:25:33 Like it just doesn't do it for me.
00:25:35 There's no way that it's bad all the time.
00:25:37 You probably just haven't seen one that worked for you because Bible Black has a great story
00:25:42 for what it's trying to do.
00:25:44 When I want to watch porn, then I just, like I'm in the mood for porn.
00:25:50 Like I just want to go, like I can see watching a story one if you're in like,
00:25:54 like, you know, if you're watching with other people or something,
00:25:57 and it's just like kind of, and it's really funny.
00:26:00 Although even then it's kind of weird because then when it gets to the porn part,
00:26:03 you're like, well, I'm clearly meant to be watching this by myself.
00:26:06 So like it feels weird.
00:26:08 But like for me, I just.
00:26:11 Just reenact it.
00:26:13 For me, it's like, I've got to be, there's basically like,
00:26:17 I'll say three and sometimes a fourth ways that I'll consume porn, right?
00:26:22 It's either go straight to Ex-Hentai and find a bunch of dojins that have art styles
00:26:27 I like and skip directly to the sex scenes.
00:26:29 I don't even care if it's translated.
00:26:31 I kind of.
00:26:34 You like the setup, Gid?
00:26:36 I like the setup.
00:26:37 I mean, a lot of the time I like the setup.
00:26:39 I kind of need the setup or I don't give a shit.
00:26:41 Yeah, it's sort of like if it's got a good setup and you like the characters are actually cool,
00:26:46 or like it's actually like a manga instead of like a one-off thing,
00:26:50 then I can actually remember it and go back to it and enjoy it again.
00:26:54 Yes, exactly. That's a great point.
00:26:57 I guess there are ones where I like the setup, but usually I sort of find that out.
00:27:02 Like, it'll be that the actual porn part is so good that I like want to now find out what the rest was like.
00:27:10 Like, I've had that experience.
00:27:12 Sure, sure.
00:27:13 Being like, man, that was really cool.
00:27:15 I really liked that. Let's see what the story was.
00:27:17 I mean, come on. Would anybody give a shit about Mega Milk?
00:27:20 About the Mega Milk porn?
00:27:21 If you didn't know that it's a little brother and he had a flat sister,
00:27:24 but then one day she got these massive tits.
00:27:26 I didn't even know that.
00:27:27 And it's like, holy, you didn't know?
00:27:29 I'm not interested in the Mega Milk.
00:27:31 Well, that's your hang-up.
00:27:33 I forgot what I was going to say.
00:27:35 No, but you got to know if the characters grow by fucking.
00:27:39 I mean, honestly, like, why do people read erotic novels?
00:27:42 Like, it's the same thing.
00:27:44 Honestly, a huge part of why...
00:27:46 I remember what I was going to say.
00:27:48 Sometimes, when I've, like, I've read one or two,
00:27:53 I kind of get bored by the sex because if, like, the sex scenes are usually,
00:27:58 the artist draws them the same way every time,
00:28:00 so they have, like, one sex scene and then they talk a bit
00:28:02 and they have another one and it's exactly the same.
00:28:05 It's just their, you know, different time of day.
00:28:07 And I kind of, like, I get it by that point.
00:28:10 So at that point, I just skip to the end to see what the last panel is
00:28:13 and what happens.
00:28:15 I know what you mean.
00:28:16 Not necessarily because, like, it was an interesting story.
00:28:20 I just want to know, like, if there's a joke or something.
00:28:23 Right. Yeah, you want resolution.
00:28:25 Sure, it's understandable.
00:28:27 Like, I think a big part of why I don't, like,
00:28:31 get into the stories and stuff, like, at first
00:28:33 is that, like, I cannot fucking stand, like, porn dialogue,
00:28:39 like, during sex.
00:28:40 I love porn dialogue during sex.
00:28:42 I hate it.
00:28:43 It's the funniest thing in the world.
00:28:44 Honestly, it's the best endogenous.
00:28:45 It ruins everything for me.
00:28:47 It's kind of funny.
00:28:49 It's all the way to my uterus.
00:28:51 Okay, to be honest, the one thing that does annoy me
00:28:53 is the clearly patronizing way.
00:28:55 Like, if someone said, like, oh, you're hitting
00:28:57 all the right spots, like, I'm just fucking flailing
00:28:59 in the dark here.
00:29:00 I don't know what I'm doing.
00:29:01 Like, this virgin guy, it's like, oh, you've got
00:29:03 the biggest dick I've ever had.
00:29:04 It's like, really?
00:29:05 Are you really going to talk like this?
00:29:07 Like, this is obviously fake.
00:29:08 That's the thing I hate as well, is when the guy doesn't
00:29:11 actually have a big dick, but she says it's hitting
00:29:13 her womb every single time.
00:29:15 Oh, like, oh, you were shaped perfectly for me.
00:29:17 This is a stupid dick.
00:29:18 I just think, like, for me, the hitting the womb thing
00:29:20 is, like, that's not, that doesn't feel good for a woman.
00:29:24 Hey, you don't know.
00:29:25 You don't know.
00:29:26 I've been told many times that that is not a pleasant
00:29:28 feeling of having your uterus to land.
00:29:30 Before I started, before I had sex, I already knew
00:29:34 about that same, like, oh my god, you're hitting
00:29:36 the womb, and it sounds terrifying.
00:29:38 And I can't, I don't know what that means,
00:29:42 but it still sounds terrifying.
00:29:44 I mean, there is only so much distance you can go
00:29:46 in a vagina before you hit the wall, right?
00:29:48 I assume if you hit that hard, it probably will hurt.
00:29:50 It's just flesh, right?
00:29:52 Yes.
00:29:53 And you have the most sensibility in the entrance,
00:29:56 anyway.
00:29:57 Right, right.
00:29:58 So, yeah, fun fact about sex.
00:30:01 So, yeah, really weird that that is always in there,
00:30:06 but like...
00:30:07 Honestly, I think that's just Japan.
00:30:09 They like to hear bitches shrieking about shit.
00:30:11 Yeah, I can't think to that.
00:30:13 So, okay, so the first one of the four I was saying
00:30:15 was ex hentai.
00:30:16 Just look at the porn, look at the pictures.
00:30:18 It's all about art style for me.
00:30:20 You want to find someone with a cool art style
00:30:22 and, you know, look at that.
00:30:23 I have a list.
00:30:24 Oh, all of your favorites?
00:30:26 I can plug some people, at least for comics.
00:30:29 Okay.
00:30:30 I want to plug Hiyoko Road,
00:30:32 which I don't know if you can access their work anymore
00:30:34 because they're like exclusive from Faku,
00:30:36 and Faku just became premium, so I'm sorry.
00:30:38 Oh, Faku, what happened, buddy?
00:30:40 Fantastic.
00:30:41 And Fish Turtle Paint,
00:30:43 especially his childhood destruction series,
00:30:45 which I mean, you can get this.
00:30:47 That sounds like a must read.
00:30:49 Okay.
00:30:50 And his Jinx C'mon shoot faster.
00:30:52 I will say if you...
00:30:53 Dude, I read that one.
00:30:54 It's fucking legendary.
00:30:55 Yeah, right?
00:30:56 That one's great.
00:30:57 The only problem with...
00:30:58 That's the one where he makes some Caitlyn and the foodies, right?
00:31:02 Yes.
00:31:03 Yeah, yep, it's the best.
00:31:04 It's the best.
00:31:05 Everyone read it.
00:31:06 But the only problem is if you like him,
00:31:08 I'm just going to put a warning.
00:31:09 He is into some extreme stuff in his original work.
00:31:11 Like, if you're not into electrocution and bestiality,
00:31:15 you might find something like that on his work.
00:31:18 Fair enough, fair enough.
00:31:20 You know what I'm leased into, I think, of all porn?
00:31:22 It's got to be mutilation.
00:31:24 You know, like when they turn a girl into a dog
00:31:26 and they put off their limbs?
00:31:27 Not the biggest fan,
00:31:29 which I only see in, like, dojins, but...
00:31:31 No.
00:31:32 I have it.
00:31:33 I'm totally a vanilla guy,
00:31:34 and I love being a vanilla guy.
00:31:36 I want people happy.
00:31:37 Don't want any piss.
00:31:39 Don't want any scat.
00:31:40 Oh, man.
00:31:41 CC, I'm looking at childhood destruction number five.
00:31:47 This art is so clearly, like, influential to you, specifically.
00:31:52 Yes, I know.
00:31:54 You definitely crib from this style.
00:31:56 And I think I've seen this before.
00:31:58 I think I've probably seen this artist,
00:31:59 because this is totally the style I like, too.
00:32:01 Well, you know, I used one of his pages for Nate's banner,
00:32:06 and he rejected it, and I was so mad,
00:32:09 because after all that work,
00:32:11 after all that cruelling work that you made me do,
00:32:14 I didn't accept my favorite porn page, like, bro.
00:32:18 Wait, what, who, me?
00:32:19 No, yes, I did.
00:32:20 You showed me, like, one...
00:32:21 I think the one picture that you linked me to
00:32:23 was, like, of a dude with their arms and legs chopped off,
00:32:25 and I was like...
00:32:26 No, okay, wait, I'm gonna link it,
00:32:28 because...
00:32:29 Okay, fine.
00:32:30 I made the whole backdrop for his banner that,
00:32:32 and he was like,
00:32:33 I don't know if YouTube is, like...
00:32:35 Oh, oh, you're talking about that.
00:32:37 Okay, yeah, fun fact, people.
00:32:38 Oh, I should have said this before.
00:32:39 Yeah, this would have shown up on a television
00:32:42 if he had, if someone went there.
00:32:44 Yeah, yeah, I'll, I don't know,
00:32:45 should I put this in the description?
00:32:46 I don't know if I'll be allowed to.
00:32:47 Probably not.
00:32:48 Okay, I won't do that.
00:32:49 Basically, CC had surrounded Guy's banner,
00:32:53 like, when you upload a banner to YouTube,
00:32:55 you have to upload, like, this insanely massive image
00:32:58 with all this part that gets cut off on YouTube,
00:33:00 and she filled it up with porn,
00:33:02 but the thing is that the reason you have to have
00:33:04 such a huge banner is that when you watch it
00:33:06 on a television, like, if you browse the site
00:33:08 on a television, it'll have that whole banner in there.
00:33:11 So...
00:33:12 It's a bonus.
00:33:13 Yeah, so anybody who had clicked on it on their TV
00:33:16 would have seen this incredible amount of porn.
00:33:18 Yeah, she was really upset that I didn't use
00:33:20 this super porn.
00:33:21 You can see on that little corner on the vagina,
00:33:23 they put a tiny, like, black brick.
00:33:26 I love when they do the tiny sensors.
00:33:29 It's, it's because in Japan,
00:33:31 you're just not allowed to clearly show...
00:33:33 Show it to your kids.
00:33:35 Yeah, I mean, how are they going to learn
00:33:36 if you censor all their hentai?
00:33:38 Anyway, yeah, this...
00:33:41 Although he draws, like, much bigger titties
00:33:44 that I'm usually into, like, I should,
00:33:46 I want to actually say that, like, this style,
00:33:49 this guy's style is the kind of stuff I really like,
00:33:52 and that's why I like CeCe's art so much
00:33:55 and got her to do the banner for me.
00:33:57 Like, because when CeCe started showing me art,
00:34:00 I was like, this reminds me of the porn I like, and...
00:34:03 Oh, that's a good reason.
00:34:05 Yeah, like, when you drew Shiro holding my pony
00:34:08 and everything, I was like, I would read a dojin
00:34:10 that looked like this, you know, and so...
00:34:12 Yeah, and your banner was pretty much the reason
00:34:14 I wanted her to do mine as well, because I know she's awesome.
00:34:16 Yeah, I guess we should have introduced CeCe as the person
00:34:18 who drew both of our channel banners.
00:34:20 Yes, and did a fantastic job.
00:34:22 And I do a lot of work in the background,
00:34:24 and my commissions are open.
00:34:26 Hey, there you go, we'll put a link in the thing.
00:34:28 Yeah, give me enough money and I will do anything
00:34:30 you ask me to link with.
00:34:32 Damn.
00:34:34 You don't even have to pay.
00:34:36 Well, she did for you just for fun, right?
00:34:38 Yeah, that's true, but don't say that.
00:34:40 No, you have to cut that off, because I don't want that out there.
00:34:42 Nate had to pay, so I always have to.
00:34:44 Yes, but here's the difference.
00:34:46 Your commission didn't almost kill me.
00:34:49 Yeah.
00:34:51 Nate's commission was the worst thing I've ever gone through
00:34:54 in my life.
00:34:56 Really? Was it? Excellent.
00:34:58 I'm glad that I have that reputation for an iron will.
00:35:00 I swear, if I wasn't a masochist...
00:35:04 I've got a guy actually doing another commission
00:35:07 for me right now for an upcoming thing.
00:35:09 I didn't even realize you had said, like,
00:35:11 with me and C.C., it was like,
00:35:13 do whatever you want and send it to me.
00:35:15 Oh, I was very specific.
00:35:17 Oh, I was very specific.
00:35:19 The only problem was that it was too small,
00:35:21 because I gave her the wrong size on accident.
00:35:23 Dude, even now, I notice little things
00:35:25 that I wish that she would correct, but it's past.
00:35:27 Shut the fuck up, shut up, shut the fuck up.
00:35:29 No, shut up.
00:35:31 I'm gonna be a little more red.
00:35:33 Nate, I will leave this podcast right now.
00:35:36 I have thought about a...
00:35:38 I will draw porn of you getting fucked in the ass.
00:35:41 I would love that.
00:35:43 Feel free, that would be all worth it.
00:35:45 I have considered, like,
00:35:47 now that I'm realizing I could just throw money at this
00:35:50 to make it happen,
00:35:52 switching the characters in
00:35:54 and the names out on my banner
00:35:56 because of Gintoki getting cut off by my face
00:35:59 on all of them.
00:36:01 And it's occurred to me over time
00:36:03 that it was funny that we just kind of added
00:36:05 the extra characters on as opposed to moving them inward.
00:36:07 That would have been a good idea.
00:36:09 Although I don't know if you can do that.
00:36:11 I don't know how many...
00:36:13 That's the thing, I don't know how many layers this was drawn on.
00:36:15 Like, is every character their own layer
00:36:17 or is it all just, like, drawn?
00:36:19 No, painter doesn't work that way.
00:36:21 The final version's just one layer.
00:36:23 And it's...
00:36:25 Yeah, so it'd be a pain in the ass to change anything, right?
00:36:27 I would rather just do the whole thing over.
00:36:31 Really?
00:36:33 How much would that cost me, though?
00:36:35 Guys, can we talk business after the podcast?
00:36:37 Sure, why not?
00:36:39 I just sent another link.
00:36:41 I don't know if I ever showed you that, did you?
00:36:43 But I got bored while doing your thing.
00:36:45 Yeah, I remember this.
00:36:47 It's covered in dicks.
00:36:49 It's covered in dicks, for any reason.
00:36:51 Let's move on because I want to talk about something else
00:36:53 related to porn real quick.
00:36:55 I wrote a little...
00:36:57 I wrote a little thing in my notebook
00:36:59 because I wanted to make a point earlier
00:37:01 when did you was talking about how the porn industry
00:37:03 is really dangerous for people.
00:37:05 And I wanted to make a point that that's why it's important
00:37:07 that it stops being taboo because the more recognized it gets,
00:37:09 it's an actual job as an industry,
00:37:11 it gets more regulated,
00:37:13 and then there won't be as much cases
00:37:15 because people won't feel like they're doing something wrong.
00:37:17 They won't feel like it's their last chance,
00:37:19 just like, hey, if you like getting fucked,
00:37:21 here's an option for a job and it's okay.
00:37:23 And I'm just throwing it out there.
00:37:25 I've got expendable income.
00:37:27 I would happily throw down 100 bucks
00:37:29 to just have sex with someone one time.
00:37:31 But, you know, that's impossible. It can't be done.
00:37:33 We need to legalize that too.
00:37:35 Honestly, it should all be legalized.
00:37:37 I don't see any reason why I could...
00:37:39 Decriminalize it and then it won't be...
00:37:41 people won't be criminals while doing it.
00:37:43 And we won't end up with a country full of
00:37:45 extremely sexually repressed men
00:37:47 who have no choice but to shut up schools.
00:37:49 The saddest thing about that
00:37:51 is, like, even on anyone's
00:37:53 political ticket,
00:37:55 you know, like, marijuana
00:37:57 and everything is, like, on everyone's
00:37:59 has to have a stance on it.
00:38:01 But, like, no one has a stance on a prostitution.
00:38:03 It's kind of hard.
00:38:05 The reason it's not a stunt
00:38:07 is because you can't talk about it
00:38:09 because it's taboo, so you can't have that
00:38:11 as a selling point in the first place.
00:38:13 So, this podcast is the first step
00:38:15 in correcting this problem.
00:38:17 Everyone call up your local politician
00:38:19 and tell them to make prostitution legal.
00:38:21 Hey, Bernie, you gotta add to the ticket.
00:38:23 We gotta legalize prostitution.
00:38:25 Give me the horse, Bernie.
00:38:27 Okay, let's move on
00:38:29 to something else that
00:38:31 I bet nobody was expecting us to talk about,
00:38:33 and that is
00:38:35 the end of civilization due to porn.
00:38:37 Okay, so let me
00:38:39 hear what you guys think about this.
00:38:41 So, I see porn
00:38:43 as just one symptom.
00:38:45 The rise of porn, the increase in porn,
00:38:47 I don't think it's the cause of
00:38:49 an increasingly,
00:38:51 what's the word?
00:38:53 isolationist society.
00:38:55 You know that episode
00:38:57 of Futurama where they had the sex robots
00:38:59 and it caused the destruction of all of humanity
00:39:01 because everyone was too busy fucking their sex robots
00:39:03 to do anything?
00:39:05 That's what you're talking about, right?
00:39:07 Okay, that's true, but I'm a little more optimistic
00:39:09 slash realistic where I think that
00:39:11 as long as shit needs to be done
00:39:13 people will be around and get to do it.
00:39:15 But that is only until
00:39:17 we hit the AI
00:39:19 singularity. And by the way, this is what I wanted
00:39:21 the movie her to be about. I was hoping
00:39:23 her would be about a society where people
00:39:25 like become isolated
00:39:27 by getting these AIs
00:39:29 that will just interact with them and give them all
00:39:31 the social interaction they need, and as well as
00:39:33 you know sexual gratification or whatever else they need
00:39:35 we will have the technology to do that
00:39:37 that does not involve any other human beings
00:39:39 fairly soon, and when that happens
00:39:41 as well as the singularity
00:39:43 happens, AIs will become more competent than
00:39:45 human beings at everything, and humans
00:39:47 will have all of our needs already met
00:39:49 we won't need to do anything ourselves
00:39:51 so when that happens, I think it's only
00:39:53 a matter of time before humans are basically
00:39:55 just weaned out and AIs
00:39:57 take over, but really
00:39:59 to get not even about that, I'm just more interested
00:40:01 in whether or not you think
00:40:03 porn itself is a destructive element
00:40:05 only in the sense that
00:40:07 it's dooming humanity because
00:40:09 it's forcing us, or it's allowing us
00:40:11 to not take responsibility
00:40:13 to kind of force ourselves to have
00:40:15 social interactions anymore, because honestly
00:40:17 sex is the driving force of
00:40:19 everything that a human being has probably ever done
00:40:21 at least for guys, that's the major one
00:40:23 yes, that's the whole
00:40:25 saying that vagina is the highest
00:40:27 priced thing on the market
00:40:29 and without
00:40:31 a, you know, porn
00:40:33 with porn and like sex robots that are coming
00:40:35 and all of that stuff, by the way, Oculus Rift
00:40:37 I'm gonna get that, gonna get that a fuck machine
00:40:39 gonna get one of those installed
00:40:41 that's gonna be great
00:40:43 I will have fun
00:40:45 what incentive will anyone have
00:40:47 to pursue any kind of actual
00:40:49 you know, romantic
00:40:51 inclination, because
00:40:53 marriage itself is kind of going away
00:40:55 which
00:40:57 does in fact have, I mean
00:40:59 whether you agree with like getting divorced or not
00:41:01 I'm not talking about that, I'm just saying that
00:41:03 children are worse off when they don't have
00:41:05 parents who are married
00:41:07 I'm not in favor of it at all
00:41:09 but children do better when their parents
00:41:11 are kind of forced to stay together
00:41:13 and forced to have a stable relationship
00:41:15 and without all that shit and with all this other stuff
00:41:17 I'm just saying, it's not looking too good
00:41:19 what are your thoughts?
00:41:21 my thoughts are, I don't give a shit
00:41:23 about any of the things you just said
00:41:25 because I'm gonna go get a wife
00:41:27 and have a daughter and then
00:41:29 I'm gonna be a cool dad and that's all I care about
00:41:31 so you want to have like a real family
00:41:33 yeah, and the whole
00:41:35 me too actually
00:41:37 the whole idea that everything will be
00:41:39 ruined
00:41:41 it's a bit
00:41:43 too cynical
00:41:45 I don't think you can get rid of
00:41:47 well, I don't know
00:41:49 maybe a few generations down the line
00:41:51 but it really depends on what humans value
00:41:53 because for us
00:41:55 we have grown up in an era where
00:41:57 it's not there yet and we
00:41:59 grew up idolizing
00:42:01 our parents who raised
00:42:03 children
00:42:05 I think for us it's more
00:42:07 natural to be like
00:42:09 even though
00:42:11 things are very different for our generation
00:42:13 because the age that people
00:42:15 A should be having
00:42:17 and B do have kids
00:42:19 keeps getting older
00:42:21 I think for all of us, I don't know about CC
00:42:23 but for the three of us
00:42:25 probably none of us envision ourselves having a kid before age 30
00:42:27 at all
00:42:29 I don't want to have kids
00:42:31 not at all
00:42:33 and that's another thing, I don't know any women who want to have kids
00:42:35 all the women I know are like
00:42:37 completely against it
00:42:39 have you seen it?
00:42:41 do you know what goes on?
00:42:43 oh my god, it's awful
00:42:45 yeah, it's pretty fucked up
00:42:47 everything about it
00:42:49 it's a super selfless act
00:42:51 I mean, you're trading your
00:42:53 body, at least for a while
00:42:55 just to have this baby
00:42:57 honestly, that's kind of too long term
00:42:59 for most people, I think of our generation
00:43:01 to be that interested in when they're young
00:43:03 the fact that you get like
00:43:05 a drug released in your brain to love
00:43:07 the baby
00:43:09 and it permanently changes your brain chemistry
00:43:11 you become a different person
00:43:13 that's basically like a fucking
00:43:15 Kafka book, that's awesome
00:43:17 but that is like you being physically changed
00:43:19 from the person you used to be into a mom
00:43:21 and you know, I bet a lot of like
00:43:23 22, 25 year olds
00:43:25 who are you know, just hanging out
00:43:27 sorry I'm late for the podcast
00:43:29 I was busy
00:43:31 masturbating to porn
00:43:35 Jesse, we're talking about the air singularity
00:43:37 and the doom of humanity
00:43:39 the sad thing is Jesse came in for porncast
00:43:41 at a moment when we were talking about childbirth
00:43:43 like the exact opposite of what anyone was hoping for
00:43:45 in a porn cast
00:43:49 he inserted himself
00:43:51 into the podcast
00:43:53 I raped a woman
00:44:01 so Nate is talking about
00:44:03 this insane theory that
00:44:05 humankind is going to die
00:44:07 because of porn
00:44:09 I guess it is a theory in the sense that I don't think
00:44:11 it's definitely going to happen
00:44:13 but it's something that I think about sometimes
00:44:15 I think what I was trying to say is
00:44:17 the reason that
00:44:19 people are you know, porn is on the rise
00:44:21 is because people are so sexually repressed
00:44:23 and if we ever
00:44:25 solve that whole problem
00:44:27 of people being all repressed
00:44:29 then I don't think sex will ruin
00:44:31 the world like that
00:44:33 that's actually a good point
00:44:35 sex could become less valuable
00:44:37 and we turn our eyes to just making progress
00:44:39 because we want to
00:44:41 people just need to stop putting that pussy up on a pedestal
00:44:43 you know what I'm saying
00:44:45 well that's the thing like if
00:44:47 there's two different kinds of theories
00:44:49 there's the theory that
00:44:51 once our sexual needs are met
00:44:53 we feel no need to do anything
00:44:55 because we don't have to prove anything
00:44:57 but then I think
00:44:59 in my mind the opposite would happen
00:45:01 which is that we're sexually satisfied
00:45:03 so now we can just work
00:45:05 on the things we actually want to do
00:45:07 because like why do most people work
00:45:09 jobs they don't like
00:45:11 because they need more money
00:45:13 and you need more money because
00:45:15 you have to impress women
00:45:17 you want more influence in the world
00:45:19 imagine yourself
00:45:21 if you never had
00:45:23 the problem
00:45:25 Nate if you never need
00:45:27 I'm telling you specifically because
00:45:29 you're in this sort of boat
00:45:31 you're more of a classical stand up comedian
00:45:33 guy who he's talking about type
00:45:35 person
00:45:37 if you had
00:45:39 all of your sexual appetite
00:45:41 solved
00:45:43 you never had to worry about women
00:45:45 then all the money that you would need
00:45:47 to make is just for yourself
00:45:49 and what you want to do
00:45:51 so would you not live a far more
00:45:53 austere lifestyle
00:45:55 because like you're just like
00:45:57 oh all I need is like
00:45:59 I need the clothes on my back and a nice
00:46:01 computer and then I could do like
00:46:03 follow my dreams and just do what I want to do
00:46:05 that's pretty much how I live right now
00:46:07 I spend all my money
00:46:09 that's how I live right now
00:46:11 to honestly make my channel better
00:46:13 there's some extent
00:46:15 you wouldn't even have to worry about
00:46:17 your image that much because
00:46:19 he gets ex regardless
00:46:21 if anyone looks
00:46:23 at me in my lifestyle
00:46:25 you'll see I'm not putting any effort
00:46:27 into trying to like get women
00:46:29 but what I do always concern myself with is like
00:46:31 how do I make
00:46:33 my how do I make more money
00:46:35 through my channel because eventually
00:46:37 in the long run I want financial
00:46:39 stability so I can have my own
00:46:41 place so I could have a wife
00:46:43 and a kid you know like in the long
00:46:45 run I would like that to happen but
00:46:47 if those weren't concerns
00:46:49 it was like sex is always
00:46:51 fine and like I can just adopt a brat
00:46:53 or something like it's like I only need to make
00:46:55 enough money to impress myself
00:46:57 or whatever
00:46:59 so yeah
00:47:01 maybe if sex
00:47:03 was no longer the reward
00:47:05 we were all seeking for doing good work
00:47:07 then we would all do work that we like
00:47:09 you know what I call this
00:47:11 something I always bring up
00:47:13 it's the Star Trek
00:47:15 method it's like in Star Trek
00:47:17 you have everything
00:47:19 they say want they have eliminated want
00:47:21 you have everything you could ever need
00:47:23 and what happens in Star Trek they just decide
00:47:25 you know what we're just going to like figure
00:47:27 shit out that's just what we're gonna do
00:47:29 with our lives as human beings
00:47:31 that's my dream
00:47:33 that that is what happens when we're liberated
00:47:35 from our beastly instincts
00:47:37 I mean how many times have you
00:47:39 this happens to me a lot right
00:47:41 this happens mostly with like working out
00:47:43 type stuff but I'm gonna use a more concrete example
00:47:45 to make sense like let's say that
00:47:47 I broke a table
00:47:49 in my room right
00:47:51 and I know that
00:47:53 because I have obligations
00:47:55 to my job and my work
00:47:57 and I have to do certain things and I have stress
00:47:59 limits you know like I can't
00:48:01 I can't constantly be learning new things
00:48:03 and doing new things right
00:48:05 and if a table broke in my house I'd be like
00:48:07 man I really
00:48:09 wish that I knew how to be a carpenter
00:48:11 and I could fix it myself
00:48:13 because it sounds like it could be cool and fun
00:48:15 and it would be a great way to spend my time
00:48:17 but I have to go through all this practice
00:48:19 and all this other shit and I got work tomorrow
00:48:21 and I just want to go to bed you know
00:48:23 I'll hire somebody who already does that
00:48:25 but imagine if I didn't have to worry about that
00:48:27 if like work was just something I did for fun
00:48:29 and like my whole life is just whatever I want to do
00:48:31 and a table breaks and I'm like I'm gonna learn
00:48:33 and like put it back together
00:48:35 I'm with you but to play devil's advocate I'm just afraid
00:48:37 my fear in this situation is that
00:48:39 we won't have the Star Trek mentality
00:48:41 instead we'll have the oh I don't need to do that
00:48:43 oh I don't need to make food
00:48:45 I don't need to learn how to cook
00:48:47 I don't need to learn how to get girls to have sex
00:48:49 I don't need to learn how to do anything
00:48:51 and then as a result everyone is just a worthless
00:48:53 I'm gonna say that as the most
00:48:55 pampered person I know
00:48:57 I still have a very strong desire to better myself
00:48:59 so well I'm glad to hear that
00:49:01 yeah
00:49:03 alright we've gotten like way off the actual
00:49:05 subject of porn itself
00:49:07 exactly what I wanted to say
00:49:09 everyone just go to your local
00:49:11 king community
00:49:13 right and meet them
00:49:15 outside of it and they're just really happy
00:49:17 so there's your answer Nate
00:49:19 everyone you can ever meet
00:49:21 to your king community that go to like
00:49:23 orgy parties and stuff and their weekends
00:49:25 and just go back to work
00:49:27 wait you can just say it like it's just that simple
00:49:29 where can I find an orgy party
00:49:31 for like 10 years
00:49:33 I don't know where they live
00:49:35 where do the orgy people live
00:49:37 CC comes from a vastly superior community
00:49:39 than we do
00:49:41 so please share with us your knowledge on this
00:49:43 where can I find my orgy community
00:49:45 I don't know
00:49:47 every city or so
00:49:49 they have something that they call their king community
00:49:51 so you should just have to look it up
00:49:53 and you'll get like a little organization
00:49:55 they usually like townhouses and stuff
00:49:57 the problem with that
00:49:59 is that you're talking to us
00:50:01 and we all hate people
00:50:03 we hate like
00:50:05 99% of all people
00:50:07 I would love a woman who let me have sex with her
00:50:09 well the thing about
00:50:11 that's the thing an orgy party
00:50:13 that's not even a guarantee for me
00:50:15 I don't think I can even say that
00:50:17 and an orgy party
00:50:19 involves being around
00:50:21 a lot of people
00:50:23 in a situation where you have to deal with them
00:50:25 you don't have to talk
00:50:27 well you'll probably have your mouth full anyway
00:50:29 now hang on CC
00:50:31 but if we're in one of these situations
00:50:33 and we're not getting verbal consent at every step
00:50:35 then you've just committed rape
00:50:37 so how are we supposed to
00:50:39 everyone signs off usually
00:50:41 before going in whatever room
00:50:43 what if I revoke my permission
00:50:45 like they sign a release
00:50:47 well no one's the fucking monster
00:50:49 like you guys
00:50:51 as an expert on rape
00:50:53 this is America we have to be aware of these things
00:50:55 that most people don't report it
00:50:59 are you willing to take that risk
00:51:01 you want to go to jail forever be a rapist forever
00:51:03 in the eyes of the public
00:51:05 in the eyes of Reddit
00:51:07 that's a two part question
00:51:09 I don't want to go to jail but I do want to be a rapist forever
00:51:11 I want to
00:51:13 I think if I go to an orgy
00:51:15 and there's a release form
00:51:17 I'm gonna have like talismans and shit on me
00:51:19 like
00:51:21 I don't know
00:51:23 I just feel like
00:51:25 when she said they're not Yo-Kai and I was like
00:51:27 are they not
00:51:29 well you don't have to
00:51:31 orgy party was just an example
00:51:33 it can be anything else
00:51:35 like the BDSM convention
00:51:37 sometimes it's just people looking at you and your partner
00:51:39 or whatever it is
00:51:41 but what if I don't want to have like kinky sex
00:51:43 I just want to have normal sex
00:51:45 is there like a community for normal sex people
00:51:47 I bet there is
00:51:49 I'm sure there is
00:51:51 Jesse has gone on record of saying
00:51:53 that his fetish is the missionary position
00:51:55 yeah
00:51:57 I like fucking
00:51:59 me on top, eyes locked
00:52:01 socks off a fucking woman
00:52:03 socks off
00:52:05 no stockings on that's the correct
00:52:07 lights off
00:52:09 I don't want to see her
00:52:11 I'm sure there's places for normal people
00:52:13 but
00:52:15 I don't look for them
00:52:17 so
00:52:19 right
00:52:21 you can ask a normal person
00:52:23 you can ask me about
00:52:25 where to look for animals
00:52:27 where titties get fucked
00:52:29 where you get normal sex
00:52:31 it's hard to find communities of people
00:52:33 who share my perversion
00:52:35 but also share my hatred for weirdos
00:52:37 right
00:52:39 yeah
00:52:41 like I said you're talking to us
00:52:43 we hate 99%
00:52:45 of all people
00:52:47 the hardest thing
00:52:49 I think all of us could probably get laid
00:52:51 pretty easily if we were willing to
00:52:53 have sex with normal average people
00:52:55 and we didn't have
00:52:57 strangeness averages
00:52:59 it's not looking good
00:53:01 we all have like really weird
00:53:03 not like I don't want to say high standards
00:53:05 because I don't think it's necessarily that we all demand
00:53:07 that we have sex with someone attractive
00:53:09 honestly I want a girl who's not fat
00:53:11 I'm in America
00:53:13 is that too much to ask
00:53:15 it is
00:53:17 my only standard
00:53:19 I hate fat girls
00:53:21 I hate them
00:53:23 I don't respect them as human beings
00:53:25 I want them to go away from America
00:53:27 they're the real witches
00:53:29 we need to deport them out of our country
00:53:31 have Donald Trump build a wall
00:53:33 I guess I can't pretend my personality standards
00:53:35 are that high
00:53:37 because the girl I did have sex with
00:53:39 had the exact ideological
00:53:41 opposite of me in every conceivable way
00:53:43 and not in a way where
00:53:45 that was like hot
00:53:47 it was just weird
00:53:49 for a girl
00:53:51 if you want to go have normal sex
00:53:53 you have to go to a bar or dance
00:53:55 or talk to people
00:53:57 wait how is that different for a guy
00:53:59 you can walk in a room and someone will fuck you
00:54:01 then I'll take that option
00:54:03 over talking to someone
00:54:05 in small talk about their
00:54:07 what their profession is
00:54:09 torture
00:54:11 I'd rather put a bullet in my dick
00:54:13 than be at a fucking party
00:54:15 and there's like a girl who's hot
00:54:17 and I have to fucking come up with some retarded
00:54:19 conversation topic
00:54:21 and come up to her like hey
00:54:23 I like this band
00:54:25 that is currently playing
00:54:27 the fucking Avril's
00:54:29 Avril Lavigne's my favorite new punk rock band
00:54:31 yeah
00:54:33 exactly
00:54:35 so I'll take communities
00:54:37 over
00:54:39 I think Cece has taught us all a valuable lesson today
00:54:41 fuck the normies
00:54:43 fuck the normies
00:54:45 that's always it
00:54:47 that's nothing new but
00:54:49 it's good to be reinforced
00:54:51 I hate people so much because
00:54:53 I was actually recently
00:54:55 with a woman for like a week
00:54:57 and he means recently
00:54:59 as in like yesterday
00:55:01 cause like
00:55:03 I hate people so much
00:55:05 that like even when you're like having
00:55:07 like Cece is a good thing
00:55:09 generally for me
00:55:11 I'm fond of it
00:55:13 it's one of my favorite hobbies
00:55:15 I like it as Donatello likes stuff
00:55:17 yes
00:55:19 the stuff that I like
00:55:29 I love stuff
00:55:31 I love munching rug
00:55:35 however
00:55:37 yeah
00:55:39 it's like
00:55:41 having a girl
00:55:43 I'm gonna find the Donatello in my local kink community
00:55:45 how do we get into that
00:55:47 is it just a club of guys with like purple
00:55:49 me?
00:55:51 I'm like in unison
00:55:53 yeah it's a pizza party
00:55:55 I love stuff
00:55:57 I'm eternal and I can't get up
00:55:59 I stepped on a frog
00:56:01 I hope it will
00:56:03 okay what was your point Jesse?
00:56:05 trying to figure out what you're getting to
00:56:07 I think a girl here for a couple days
00:56:09 fucking her 10 times a day
00:56:11 in every one of us is awesome and great
00:56:13 the sweat glands
00:56:15 are the little known best hole
00:56:17 but there are times when I question
00:56:19 if even that is worth it
00:56:21 when a girl is here for days at a time
00:56:23 like I hate people so much
00:56:25 it's not even like an aggressive
00:56:27 like a bitter hatred
00:56:29 like I'm fine with it
00:56:31 but having a person
00:56:33 around me
00:56:35 is like psychological torture
00:56:37 dude let me tell you, whenever I've stayed over
00:56:39 with any of my girlfriends
00:56:41 even two days
00:56:43 with the same person trapped with them
00:56:45 is a complete nightmare
00:56:47 and honestly I think one of the reasons we all get along so well
00:56:49 is because this is a purely opt-in community
00:56:51 we've got here, we've got this Skype group
00:56:53 and we only talk when we feel like it
00:56:55 if you don't want to talk, you just leave
00:56:57 but it's not like anything
00:56:59 it's the worst with how I tend to see
00:57:01 I meet girls online
00:57:03 with those kind of relationships
00:57:05 because with an online relationship
00:57:07 she comes over to visit for a fucking week
00:57:09 and you have to spend that whole time together
00:57:11 if you're in a real relationship
00:57:13 eventually you get to the point where you know
00:57:15 when to leave each other the fuck alone
00:57:17 and then from there it's smooth sailing
00:57:19 that's where the online shit man
00:57:21 so to tie what is rapidly becoming
00:57:23 a discussion about sex
00:57:25 back into porn
00:57:27 I want to clarify that I don't think
00:57:29 that sex is a replacement
00:57:31 for jacking off
00:57:33 I agree
00:57:35 because sometimes it's just not feasible
00:57:37 I think they both have very different appeals
00:57:39 and that doing one immediately
00:57:41 after the other is often
00:57:43 necessary for me
00:57:45 we're all guys here right
00:57:47 so we know
00:57:49 not all
00:57:51 I can't speak to the female
00:57:53 sex drive, maybe it's exactly the same
00:57:55 I don't know
00:57:57 but I pretty much have a compulsion
00:57:59 to fap every single day of my life
00:58:01 and if I don't do it
00:58:03 that's just me punishing myself for no reason
00:58:05 so why would I do that
00:58:07 I'm not going to arrange sex every day
00:58:09 even if I was married
00:58:11 you don't want to have sex every single day with you
00:58:13 they don't
00:58:15 well CC you're an angel
00:58:17 you're one of the good ones
00:58:19 at least in America
00:58:21 I guess I can only talk about America
00:58:23 fapping is
00:58:25 a lot of fun
00:58:27 and I think it's kind of underrated
00:58:29 I think part of the reason
00:58:31 people don't like to talk about jacking off
00:58:33 is that it makes it sound like they don't get laid
00:58:35 people don't want to say
00:58:37 oh I just jack off by myself
00:58:39 all the time
00:58:41 because they want to think
00:58:43 when I want to get off I have sex
00:58:45 with a woman because I'm awesome
00:58:47 I jack off now when I'm having sex with a woman
00:58:49 yeah I've done that as well
00:58:51 yeah one of the ones who has
00:58:53 I will stop sex to jack off
00:58:55 it's like
00:58:57 on the other room
00:58:59 there's no chance
00:59:01 that another person you're having sex with
00:59:03 for the first time is going to know what you want
00:59:05 honestly I'm not sure after 50 years
00:59:07 unless you're very specific that's true
00:59:09 she's right about that but even then there's a lot of fumbling
00:59:11 there's a lot of figuring shit out
00:59:13 I never realized how much better I understood
00:59:15 my dick than someone else
00:59:17 until my girlfriend tried to give me a
00:59:19 handjob and I was like
00:59:21 what are you doing
00:59:23 people don't talk at all during sex
00:59:25 give instructions during it
00:59:27 it's fine
00:59:29 every girl was like
00:59:31 oh I know how to give the best
00:59:33 just listen to the guy
00:59:35 this conversation kind of during sex needs to be thrown
00:59:37 in the trash and die about yesterday
00:59:39 I've talked about this before
00:59:41 I've done stand-up bits about it
00:59:43 people who think that
00:59:45 dirty talk should ever be a thing
00:59:47 we're not talking about dirty talk
00:59:49 this is not dirty talk
00:59:51 she's talking about having sex that works
00:59:55 but I will say
00:59:57 don't expect it to necessarily solve anything
00:59:59 because they don't know what the fuck you're talking about
01:00:01 because when my ex is trying to give a handjob
01:00:03 the conversation would be like this
01:00:05 no like
01:00:07 do you like with this?
01:00:09 do it
01:00:11 please stop
01:00:13 first of all there's an art form to it
01:00:15 you got to do it the right way
01:00:17 second of all it's obviously worth doing
01:00:19 because
01:00:21 if you want any
01:00:23 you should never have sex with a person once
01:00:25 it's just retarded to have a one night stand
01:00:27 you might as well work that for a few times
01:00:29 so why not cultivate a little bit of understanding
01:00:31 of what you want out of the person
01:00:33 that's just the smart way to go
01:00:35 that's why it's like
01:00:37 everyone has to talk about it
01:00:39 I'm not at all implying it's bad to have a one night stand
01:00:41 lord knows I have a few of my own
01:00:43 I'm a big believer
01:00:45 in getting notches on the belt
01:00:47 that's my main priority in life
01:00:49 beyond actually pleasuring someone
01:00:51 I mean if you want to bring home someone from a bar
01:00:53 who's just some trashy whore
01:00:55 that's great more power to you could not
01:00:57 be more in favor of it but
01:00:59 I'm just saying I think it's
01:01:01 an inefficient use of your time
01:01:03 to only bang someone once
01:01:05 because you have to put all that work and getting to know them
01:01:07 and doing all that shit
01:01:09 I mean if they're just drunk and they want to have sex
01:01:11 that's totally fine but
01:01:13 it's more practical to make it work
01:01:15 at least for a couple times
01:01:17 I generally think that sex is better when there's
01:01:19 a friendship or something there
01:01:21 yeah and like how first time sloppy sex is boring
01:01:23 the second, third, fourth time
01:01:25 when you start to figure each other out that's the best
01:01:27 there's always going to be something that you do on a one night stand
01:01:29 that the other prince is like oh my god
01:01:31 I want to tell them to stop
01:01:33 because this is awful and it's the worst
01:01:35 and I will tell everyone I know about it but you know I can't
01:01:37 because I don't know this person
01:01:39 but to get back to fapping man
01:01:41 you can make a whole
01:01:43 you know it's just because it's you by yourself
01:01:45 and you can really like you know they say
01:01:47 it's self indulgence you can truly
01:01:49 indulge yourself
01:01:51 you can go all out
01:01:53 what?
01:01:55 I was just saying like so is like eating
01:01:57 an ice cream cone but that's not like
01:01:59 something to be ashamed of exactly
01:02:01 it's just something you do
01:02:03 but mate if you masturbate you will go blind
01:02:05 no you're right
01:02:07 vitamin deficiency what was I thinking
01:02:09 I'm never doing it I'm swearing it off
01:02:11 I'm swearing it off
01:02:13 I have to ask like
01:02:15 so do you guys when you look at porn
01:02:17 is it pretty consistent
01:02:19 or do you randomly get
01:02:21 into the mood for weird fucking
01:02:23 like fucked up shit
01:02:25 yeah I definitely go through like
01:02:27 it will escalate
01:02:29 yeah
01:02:31 I want to watch porn and it's like oh my god
01:02:33 now I need to like watch this one video
01:02:35 that I watched two years ago with the clown
01:02:37 and the puppy
01:02:39 I had something of a renaissance in my days
01:02:41 nothing gets me hotter these days than flat girls
01:02:43 I'm into flat girls right now
01:02:45 I don't know it's a complete about
01:02:47 it's a 180 for my entire life
01:02:49 you know what we need to do an entire
01:02:51 podcast about flat girls because they're
01:02:53 I am down they are underappreciated
01:02:55 I think everybody knows that I am more
01:02:57 into
01:02:59 I think it's pretty widely known
01:03:01 that I'm not that into big titties
01:03:03 or big ages
01:03:05 you know into those
01:03:07 I want to get to that
01:03:09 in a second
01:03:11 but like
01:03:13 I have an interesting question
01:03:15 do you find that
01:03:17 your sexual preference are always
01:03:19 the same as your porn preferences
01:03:21 you mean like in real life
01:03:23 not at all honestly there's nowhere near
01:03:25 the choice
01:03:27 there's no way I could achieve my preferences
01:03:29 in real life
01:03:31 I could but if you could do you like
01:03:33 who wears purple all the time but I can't do that
01:03:35 I mean like if you could
01:03:37 do you like fantasize about doing those things
01:03:39 yourself or is it like completely different
01:03:41 Niko Robin would be the greatest sex that any human
01:03:43 being would ever have in their entire lifetime
01:03:45 there is no doubt about it she can generate infinite body parts
01:03:47 you just have to use a little bit of imagination
01:03:49 to think about what she could do sexually
01:03:51 and she can make clones of herself
01:03:53 Niko Robin is the best woman of all time just putting that out there
01:03:55 okay let's move on
01:03:57 what you're asking is like
01:03:59 if I'm not looking at porn am I fantasizing
01:04:01 about the same kind of things that I saw
01:04:03 in porn then the answer is yes
01:04:05 but if you're talking about like
01:04:07 what am I attracted to in a human being
01:04:09 then no
01:04:11 and usually I don't go
01:04:13 like if I look at like women
01:04:15 I'm not comparing them to
01:04:17 like a standard I already have
01:04:19 it's more like I see a girl and I go
01:04:21 oh she's cute in that way
01:04:23 like I didn't expect that
01:04:25 like in porn I have almost exclusively
01:04:27 been into shorter smaller women
01:04:29 but then my first girlfriend was like
01:04:31 6 foot 3 or something
01:04:33 when she towered over me
01:04:35 but I was still attracted to her for her own reasons
01:04:37 yeah go on Suzy
01:04:39 I feel like it's an important message to get out
01:04:41 like everyone has that same opinion but people are still like
01:04:43 no if you watch like this kind of porn
01:04:45 that will like make you into degenerate
01:04:47 which I'm not necessarily
01:04:49 I'm staunchly opposed to the idea
01:04:51 that anything you
01:04:53 watch has any effect on the way
01:04:55 you act
01:04:57 the way you act is entirely determined by
01:04:59 your worldview what kind of person you are
01:05:01 if you are someone
01:05:03 by the way you know I've read a lot of
01:05:05 stuff about psychology and one of the
01:05:07 number one things that comes up
01:05:09 in a mental disorder
01:05:11 look no
01:05:13 I'm just saying this isn't a bragging thing
01:05:15 this is a fucking pointing it out to people
01:05:17 thing alright
01:05:19 the number one thing
01:05:21 that is a sign of mental disorder is if you
01:05:23 tell the difference between fantasy and reality
01:05:25 oh shit
01:05:27 that is always a sign of mental disorder
01:05:29 dropping the bomb
01:05:31 so if you think that porn is going to cause
01:05:33 people to not be able to tell the difference
01:05:35 between it just means those people are fucking
01:05:37 crazy right so let's just say right now
01:05:39 let me say every
01:05:41 even all the porn I don't like
01:05:43 I'm still totally in favor of it existing
01:05:45 I'm just going to tell you I faptololi
01:05:47 all the time what are you going to do about it
01:05:49 tell me what you're going to do about it
01:05:51 baby girls what are you going to do about it
01:05:53 it's really funny to me
01:05:55 because the procrastinators chat
01:05:57 this is not why
01:05:59 we became friends because
01:06:01 I guess we were all into my little pony
01:06:03 so maybe we're all psychopaths
01:06:05 the procrastinators is essentially
01:06:07 a support group for
01:06:09 former brony celebrities
01:06:11 the funny thing about the
01:06:13 procrastinators podcast is
01:06:15 this is the place I've never been
01:06:17 anywhere where
01:06:19 everyone so unanimously
01:06:21 like to lolly
01:06:23 stuff with no
01:06:25 with no one having come in there with that intention
01:06:27 like everywhere I've ever been
01:06:29 there's at least someone who's like
01:06:31 that's funny get me out of here that's disgusting
01:06:33 wait a minute
01:06:35 you're making it sound like we're all
01:06:37 way into
01:06:39 lolly's like
01:06:41 I'm just saying that we managed to make
01:06:43 more jokes about pedophilia
01:06:45 in the procrastinators chat
01:06:47 anyone has probably ever made
01:06:49 in history
01:06:51 and none of us have a there's no guy
01:06:53 in the chat who's like
01:06:55 you gross like there's no one like that
01:06:57 in there
01:07:01 we wouldn't keep someone like that around
01:07:03 I guess but it's just funny to me that
01:07:05 even when we added like the DeVoo
01:07:07 he's the same way
01:07:09 and he brought his own barrel of laps
01:07:11 to that equation
01:07:13 his own smorgasbord of bizarre fetishes
01:07:15 yeah honestly he's the weirdest of us all
01:07:17 when it comes to this stuff
01:07:19 he should be here
01:07:21 he didn't want to come in because he didn't want to share
01:07:23 how weird his fetishes are
01:07:25 that's why I was scared of coming here
01:07:27 so I would be safer if I had someone else
01:07:29 don't worry CC
01:07:31 we'll defend you to use the earth
01:07:33 that fucking bizarre
01:07:35 see that's the thing
01:07:37 this is why I was bringing up like getting into moods
01:07:39 if I was to say
01:07:41 what is perfect for me
01:07:43 something kind of romantic
01:07:45 and cute
01:07:47 the anime series
01:07:49 I can't understand what my husband is saying
01:07:51 not only is that my favorite romance
01:07:53 but if there was a porn of that
01:07:55 it would be the best porn ever
01:07:57 but isn't that because of the story
01:07:59 the stories kind of involved in that
01:08:01 I'd say it's the
01:08:03 the story, the context
01:08:05 nailed him
01:08:07 but sometimes
01:08:09 I want to watch
01:08:11 a little girl get torn to shreds by demons
01:08:13 while they rape her in every hole
01:08:15 and then I go lip that up and fathom it
01:08:17 and it's great
01:08:19 if the art style is great that's all that matters to me
01:08:21 if I'm going through X Hentai
01:08:23 and I see a really cool art style
01:08:25 and I click on it and it turns out to be some really insane shit
01:08:27 if the art style is cool
01:08:29 then it's still gonna be like well alright
01:08:31 I guess this is what we're in for today
01:08:33 can we talk about the prices
01:08:35 that we're having right now in Hentai
01:08:37 having way better covers than their actual anime
01:08:39 like I feel so betrayed
01:08:41 when that happens and it's
01:08:43 getting out of control right now
01:08:45 someone needs to talk about this
01:08:47 you wanna talk about a crisis
01:08:49 there is an epidemic
01:08:51 of Hentai dojins
01:08:53 of famous anime
01:08:55 where the girls are way out of character
01:08:57 and that drives me insane
01:08:59 if I fucking
01:09:01 well I mean some circles like
01:09:03 to make stuff where they like
01:09:05 reinterpret characters and as long as that's like
01:09:07 clearly what it is
01:09:09 reinterpretation is one thing but the personality
01:09:11 there's people who
01:09:13 are just like this is popular right now
01:09:15 and I need money so I'm just gonna make it
01:09:17 I'm not gonna watch the anime or whatever
01:09:19 I just I know how they look
01:09:21 no thought kills a boner faster
01:09:23 than Misada would never fucking say this
01:09:25 yeah that's pretty
01:09:27 well that's why I don't read the dialogue in my porn
01:09:29 well you're missing out dude
01:09:31 there's some good stuff in there honestly
01:09:33 you'll get more out of it
01:09:35 so it's all about the mind
01:09:37 I gotta read the dialogue I gotta be invested in a scenario
01:09:39 as a rule I only watch
01:09:41 Hentai subtitled and read dojin
01:09:43 she's it up and down
01:09:45 when it comes to anime porn
01:09:47 I turn off the audio
01:09:49 I hopefully can find one without subtitles
01:09:51 what are the noises
01:09:53 because their voices are fucking terrible
01:09:57 you gotta have the noises
01:09:59 I can't stand the fake ass noises
01:10:01 the girls going
01:10:03 the girls do generally sound retarded
01:10:05 if you do
01:10:07 your job correctly you will hear those
01:10:09 noises in real life
01:10:11 I will actually
01:10:13 I will actually master baiting which I do often
01:10:15 I imagine him
01:10:17 go on
01:10:19 I imagine him turning off
01:10:21 the audio
01:10:23 turning off the lights lighting a bunch of candles
01:10:25 playing some death grips over it
01:10:27 that's not inaccurate
01:10:29 pulling up a big tarp
01:10:31 of MC ride
01:10:33 talking to himself in that cockney voice
01:10:35 talking to himself in that cockney voice
01:10:37 alright
01:10:39 she's a nasty guy
01:10:41 you're a white fucking wanker
01:10:43 you are
01:10:45 you're talking to his dick when you say that
01:10:47 I usually do have my own music playing because I always have music playing
01:10:49 I can't be without music
01:10:51 you got in the mood
01:10:53 you can't be playing just any kind of music when you're jacking off
01:10:55 well actually I can
01:10:57 and I'll ask shit sometimes I'll just be like
01:10:59 I'm listening to game grumps
01:11:01 and I just start fucking watching porn while listening to game grumps
01:11:03 I don't even care
01:11:05 yeah
01:11:07 but if I do want to be like
01:11:09 if I want it to be like special
01:11:11 I'm in the mood
01:11:13 you gotta play enigma dude
01:11:15 you gotta listen to MCMXCAD
01:11:17 the sexiest album of all time
01:11:19 you gotta just find
01:11:21 a well audio mixed
01:11:23 pentai like resort bowen has pretty good audio mixing
01:11:25 in terms of the music
01:11:27 jazz shit but like that's just one example
01:11:29 I just mute it and I play my own shit
01:11:31 there's no bad music that should sacrifice the moans
01:11:33 I agree
01:11:35 if I do keep the audio on
01:11:37 I turn it really low in the mix
01:11:39 so I just barely hear it
01:11:41 like underneath my music
01:11:43 like I can hear it somewhere in the background
01:11:45 but what I'll also do is
01:11:47 when I go to look at porn I'll open up like six different tabs
01:11:49 and have them all running at the same time
01:11:51 and then whichever one
01:11:53 whichever one has the least obnoxious voices
01:11:55 I'll leave the audio on
01:11:57 in that tab
01:11:59 and then even when I'm looking at the other stuff
01:12:01 I'll just be listening to the other audio
01:12:03 so like whichever girl
01:12:05 has the hot voice
01:12:07 her voice is coming out of all the other girls
01:12:09 and that makes a lot of sense
01:12:11 nothing worse than coming on the first tab
01:12:13 and having to in shame
01:12:15 tell me about it
01:12:17 you gotta make it all the way through
01:12:19 well it's sad because
01:12:21 when I go on a porn excursion
01:12:23 I don't like save my progress
01:12:25 or anything right
01:12:27 you open up 17 fucking tabs
01:12:29 on X Hentai
01:12:31 and all of them looked like they were probably good
01:12:33 but then if you find one that's so
01:12:35 amazing early on
01:12:37 that you end up coming to that one
01:12:39 and then you're like I will never know
01:12:41 what the other 16 were like
01:12:43 every porn excursion is like a playthrough of Dark Souls
01:12:45 whatever happens happens
01:12:47 you just gotta live with it
01:12:49 but with Dark Souls you can eventually learn it
01:12:51 it's just gone forever
01:12:53 it's more like a roguelike
01:12:55 that's why fapping has endured
01:12:57 as an activity because it's
01:12:59 procedurally generated
01:13:01 it might as well be
01:13:03 I don't know I'm pretty organized
01:13:05 I think I keep track of most things
01:13:07 that I look at new releases
01:13:09 consume it the same way I do anime
01:13:11 I know some people like
01:13:13 and those are the people I call the porn experts
01:13:15 cause the funny thing is
01:13:17 definitely a porn expert
01:13:19 there are a few friends who are like that
01:13:21 who can like name actresses
01:13:23 or name artists and stuff like that
01:13:25 I'm the guy who every single time
01:13:27 it's just completely new
01:13:29 it's never the same thing
01:13:31 did CC just say hi mom?
01:13:33 are you talking to your mom right now?
01:13:35 no I just found it funny that
01:13:37 they might find this
01:13:39 oh okay
01:13:41 the thing is like
01:13:43 I feel like I probably
01:13:45 if you see this
01:13:47 that like total amount
01:13:49 I feel like I look at more porn
01:13:51 than a lot of the people I would consider porn
01:13:53 experts because
01:13:55 I just look at everything and then throw it all away
01:13:57 and like the only stuff I save
01:13:59 I would challenge you on that
01:14:01 the only stuff I keep around is
01:14:03 if I find something that I
01:14:05 cause if I'm on like X-Hentai and I find something
01:14:07 I really love the art
01:14:09 I'll go look at the artist, I'll look at all their other stuff
01:14:11 and then I'll just favorite one of their things
01:14:13 so that I can get back to that artist in the future
01:14:15 and like keep up with them
01:14:17 you know what I've been doing lately?
01:14:19 I just go to Hentai Gasm
01:14:21 and then just all on the bottom
01:14:23 it's a great Hentai site
01:14:25 on the bottom they've got tons of links for more stuff
01:14:27 that have pretty great looking
01:14:29 little preview windows
01:14:31 and I just open up a bunch of tabs of those
01:14:33 let them play and see which one's the best
01:14:35 and then just focus on that one
01:14:37 honestly it's the best system I've ever had for this shit
01:14:39 we should all name drop some websites
01:14:41 Hentai Gasm for sure
01:14:43 and cause well most of the Hentai that I watch
01:14:45 is subtitled in Spanish
01:14:47 and you know
01:14:49 most of the websites I frequent are deep
01:14:51 websites with no real names
01:14:55 alright I'm into that dark web shit
01:14:57 if you're just into like porn in general
01:14:59 this is not a great resource for anime stuff
01:15:01 or Hentai but the big list of porn
01:15:03 is an index of
01:15:05 virtually every worthwhile porn site
01:15:07 ever they have like
01:15:09 thousands of reddits listed
01:15:11 of like all of the
01:15:13 streaming sites that are worthwhile
01:15:15 they're all ranked by the way
01:15:17 it's a ranked list of every worthwhile porn site
01:15:19 the only thing they're really missing out
01:15:21 like they have an adult art section
01:15:23 but it's not that in depth
01:15:25 personally for anime stuff
01:15:27 I usually just go to
01:15:29 Hentai.animestigma
01:15:31 but they like half the fucking shit's broken there
01:15:33 so it's really not a good right
01:15:35 the great thing about them is that
01:15:37 they bring out stuff when it's new
01:15:39 you know you actually can't keep up with new releases
01:15:41 there to some extent but like
01:15:43 all their old shit's broken so you gotta go find it somewhere else
01:15:45 but uh
01:15:47 and then X Hentai is the
01:15:49 ultimate like manga and
01:15:51 dojin resource like you'll never find
01:15:53 something with more shit than that
01:15:55 except for like a torrent site
01:15:59 what happened to Faka, they were my favorite
01:16:01 oh by the way, quick, end them to previously
01:16:03 you know when I said I fapped to little girls
01:16:05 just to be clear I was talking about the animated ones
01:16:07 just wanted to throw that out there
01:16:09 just for any FBI agents
01:16:11 listening to this podcast
01:16:13 who are big fans of ours
01:16:15 I forgot I was gonna make sure we had an 18 plus
01:16:17 warning at the top of this show
01:16:19 but do we need one? I don't know
01:16:21 I don't think we've said anything
01:16:23 it's called porn
01:16:25 well I think porn is something that everyone of every age
01:16:27 can appreciate
01:16:29 I just raped the woman
01:16:31 I don't think there's an age high enough
01:16:33 for this to be appropriate
01:16:35 we talked about rape
01:16:37 about attacking people killing things
01:16:39 why is it that porn is the one that gives us that
01:16:41 18 rating?
01:16:43 because sex is way more taboo
01:16:45 than violence
01:16:47 it's not so much that we're talking about sex
01:16:49 as it is that we're talking about
01:16:51 decapitation sex
01:16:53 so sex plus
01:16:55 violence is like extra bad
01:16:57 versus like normally we could talk about sex
01:16:59 or normally we could talk about
01:17:01 we never talked about violence on this show
01:17:03 we've described a violent scenario
01:17:05 I've threatened to burn down people's houses before
01:17:07 that's pretty violent
01:17:09 so who here has seen
01:17:11 shade base?
01:17:13 I fucking hate that guy
01:17:15 who's that?
01:17:17 he's this hentai artist
01:17:19 he draws a lot of western cartoons
01:17:21 and anime, like comics
01:17:23 but he's one of those guys who
01:17:25 never stops inserting
01:17:27 his weird fetish into everything he fucking draws
01:17:29 so sometimes I'll just be going down
01:17:31 looking for porn
01:17:33 of a certain show
01:17:35 that I'm into
01:17:37 I want to look at a porn of Teen Titans today
01:17:39 and you find one
01:17:41 and inevitably
01:17:43 his stuff comes up because for some fucking reason
01:17:45 it's really popular
01:17:47 well he's been around forever
01:17:49 and you can tell that he has the skills
01:17:51 to be a decent
01:17:53 illustrator
01:17:55 but everything he draws is like
01:17:57 all the girls have g-cups
01:17:59 these massive floppy
01:18:01 drooping titties with lactating
01:18:03 shooting blood and semen out of their butts
01:18:05 and it's all butt sex
01:18:07 there's never any actual
01:18:09 he's against vaginal sex
01:18:11 there's this one here I'm enjoying
01:18:13 that's of a Gestapo chick
01:18:15 she's puckering her asshole and says
01:18:17 get in there you filthy Jew rats
01:18:19 I can get into this
01:18:21 every shade base comic is like
01:18:23 licking someone else's butthole
01:18:25 let me tell you from experience
01:18:27 licking buttholes gets old real quick
01:18:29 oh my god it's actually Wednesday Adams
01:18:31 doing this dressed up like a Gestapo
01:18:33 yes it is
01:18:35 awesome
01:18:37 okay well Nazi Wednesday Adams is in fact my fetish
01:18:39 so he gets a pass on that one
01:18:41 pardon
01:18:43 but yeah he's very like
01:18:45 he's the center of
01:18:47 what I think is on the internet
01:18:49 that kind of torture porn
01:18:51 especially for cartoons and childhood ruining
01:18:53 and controversial
01:18:55 like he'll draw Nazis and stuff
01:18:57 and mutilation
01:18:59 hey I want to do two quick shout outs real quick
01:19:01 first of all to this guy
01:19:03 probably my favorite animator of porn stuff right now
01:19:05 this guy Pinoy toons
01:19:07 you guys seen this guy he makes by far
01:19:09 it's kind of like a realistic
01:19:11 style he's on new grounds he's on like
01:19:13 I don't know whatever google Pinoy toons
01:19:15 he makes some of the best he's got this
01:19:17 fantastic Nico Robin scene
01:19:19 the one thing about this guy though is he
01:19:21 is always the guy in the scene
01:19:23 it's kind of weird he animates himself
01:19:25 being the one I just
01:19:27 you gotta look past that
01:19:29 but if he's basically a more talented Chris Chan
01:19:31 I assume that like
01:19:33 his purpose is to like
01:19:35 give Filipino guys like an outlet
01:19:37 to put themselves in porn or something
01:19:39 well let me recommend
01:19:41 Salty Ice Cream
01:19:43 as my favorite animator
01:19:45 she only does gifts
01:19:47 but I love it whenever she
01:19:49 updates and she's just a lot of different
01:19:51 characters and they're really cool
01:19:53 and the animation show
01:19:55 this is the person who did
01:19:57 the Pokemon ones right
01:19:59 probably like she's
01:20:01 like started with I don't know
01:20:03 well this is like the same art style
01:20:05 it must be
01:20:07 these are kind of beautiful in a non-sexable way
01:20:09 yeah exactly so
01:20:11 they're all commissioned right yeah
01:20:13 cause this person like there were these couple of
01:20:15 he does raffles and patreon
01:20:17 there were a couple of animations
01:20:19 of like
01:20:21 white from Pokemon White
01:20:23 going like a
01:20:25 like what's the word
01:20:27 not ass to ass but they were doing that
01:20:29 that motion but with a
01:20:31 like a double sided dildo with the
01:20:33 the other girl from that
01:20:35 from white and like the fun head ones
01:20:37 yeah there were like two gifts of that
01:20:39 that were like unbelievably well animated
01:20:41 and everyone was like where the fuck did these come from
01:20:43 cause there was nothing else by him on the internet
01:20:45 at the time and then started doing commission work
01:20:47 and I guess this is where it's come
01:20:49 I assume this is the same person cause it looks
01:20:51 exactly like it that really smooth animation
01:20:53 I'm just like
01:20:55 I'm just like hypnotized right now watching this
01:20:57 are you watching the tatsumaki gift
01:20:59 the girl from one punch man
01:21:01 just like yeah tatsumaki come on
01:21:03 step it up I haven't fucking
01:21:05 and my favorite not say for
01:21:07 regardless in general has to
01:21:09 be pow foo but he mostly does
01:21:11 like he works
01:21:13 he's a contract working in hard blood
01:21:15 so he mostly does gay stuff
01:21:17 so I don't know if you guys
01:21:19 he's posing it so good
01:21:21 I also use him a lot as reference
01:21:23 pow foo
01:21:25 man I'm excited to know that this
01:21:27 this salty ice cream person has done more
01:21:29 work now
01:21:31 yeah this is awesome cause
01:21:33 for a long time there wasn't a lot
01:21:35 you know I'm gonna this is one
01:21:37 another shout out that I am really a big
01:21:39 fan of but kind of is always the exact same
01:21:41 thing it's just this circle
01:21:43 naruhou
01:21:45 that basically does mostly
01:21:47 I know it's very clever
01:21:49 it's mostly naruto stuff
01:21:51 but like it's just the specific art style
01:21:53 he's got everyone's very round everyone's
01:21:55 super thick and they've got it's just
01:21:57 it's very like it's very like
01:21:59 in your face pussy and like in your face
01:22:01 this is what's happening they're not really focused
01:22:03 on the other shit google naruhou
01:22:05 he's got a bunch of them there's like some one piece ones
01:22:07 it's great stuff great stuff
01:22:09 well also acid head no
01:22:11 also does acid head
01:22:13 acid heads awesome as well
01:22:15 two favorite dojin guys
01:22:17 so I uh
01:22:19 I don't want to like
01:22:21 share any of my favorite
01:22:23 porn manga artists because I'm like
01:22:25 weirdly possesses of them
01:22:27 cause I feel like if I recommend them to people
01:22:29 no one will appreciate them as much as I do
01:22:31 or for the same reasons
01:22:33 do you ever have that feeling
01:22:35 only about my wifos
01:22:37 like if you don't find it as hot as I do
01:22:39 so instead
01:22:41 I'm just gonna recommend what I would consider to be
01:22:43 the best anime
01:22:45 sex scene ever
01:22:47 which is uh which you can
01:22:49 if you want to you can pretend
01:22:51 retroactively that this is a sex scene
01:22:53 between ruby and sapphire from steven
01:22:55 universe cause it's a girl with blue hair
01:22:57 and a girl with red hair and they have about that stature
01:22:59 but it's uh from the
01:23:01 classic anime
01:23:03 uh cream lemon
01:23:05 I believe is the name
01:23:07 pop chaser this episode is mostly
01:23:09 famous for the fact that like a lot of big name
01:23:11 animators worked on it but they mostly
01:23:13 worked on like action scenes and stuff
01:23:15 what people don't talk about is how it also has
01:23:17 the best lesbian sex scene
01:23:19 and possibly best sex scene ever in anime
01:23:21 history it is like
01:23:23 six minutes long
01:23:25 really beautifully animated really sensual
01:23:27 feels like totally
01:23:29 it's like emotional like I
01:23:31 like I was fapping and crying
01:23:33 at the same time watching this thing
01:23:35 often brings us up as his favorite
01:23:37 yeah no it's incredible and there's
01:23:39 other porn anime that
01:23:41 has great animation and weirdly it's usually
01:23:43 lesbian like uh
01:23:45 stainless night has like really
01:23:47 beautiful animation but it's
01:23:49 not expressive the way that
01:23:51 pop chaser is like that pop chaser scene
01:23:53 is so detailed and there's so much
01:23:55 movement and stuff that it's like whoa
01:23:57 like it almost feels like it was
01:23:59 rotoscoping a real sex
01:24:01 scene but like an actually intimate one
01:24:03 I don't know it's really great and you should all check it out
01:24:05 it's easy to find just google like
01:24:07 pop chaser lesbian sex scene on google
01:24:09 and you'll like you'll get a video of it
01:24:11 on some porn site but like uh
01:24:13 uh yeah that stainless night is great animation
01:24:15 there's a few
01:24:17 there's a few weird ones oh you were you were
01:24:19 mentioning earlier like like a real
01:24:21 Hollywood director that you thought had done
01:24:23 that Scooby-Doo porn parody
01:24:25 um yes great example
01:24:27 in anime is the famous director
01:24:29 Akiyuki Shinbo
01:24:31 who did like Madoka and
01:24:33 Bakemonogatari and like all these
01:24:35 you know other popular shows
01:24:37 there was a like a period of
01:24:39 three years where he just did porn
01:24:41 under a pseudonym
01:24:43 I don't remember the pseudonym but like everyone knows
01:24:45 it's him because his fucking visual style is so
01:24:47 distinct that it couldn't possibly be anyone else
01:24:49 but he did one called Temptation
01:24:51 one called Swallowtail in
01:24:53 one called uh
01:24:55 something to do with nurses it wasn't
01:24:57 night shift nurses but a different one
01:24:59 and then uh also
01:25:01 was it called sibling secret
01:25:03 all of them are like really
01:25:05 fucked up like the
01:25:07 art style is tricky and
01:25:09 in esoteric oh and Blood Royale was the other one
01:25:11 he did they're all like uh
01:25:13 like just like a lot of rape
01:25:15 lots of like humiliation
01:25:17 one of Blood Royale has
01:25:19 scat in it and there's just like
01:25:21 all kinds of like you know it's just like
01:25:23 really out there and the visuals are so intense
01:25:25 that it just makes it that much crazier
01:25:27 but uh but Temptation in particular
01:25:29 or you Aku as it's known
01:25:31 in Japanese like even though it's all
01:25:33 like rape and and like
01:25:35 stuff like that it's really
01:25:37 well animated like it's
01:25:39 it's really kind of like Bible Black
01:25:41 where it's just like wow they put a lot of effort
01:25:43 into this hang on hang on I'm looking
01:25:45 at Salty Ice Cream's Tumble here and I notice
01:25:47 on the top right it says not safe for work blog
01:25:49 all characters depicted
01:25:51 are 18 plus can we just
01:25:53 tell you how Wednesday Adams is not 18
01:25:55 plus
01:25:57 you have to say that
01:25:59 you always have to say that
01:26:01 no but you have to say legally
01:26:03 speaking if you're getting money for them
01:26:05 even if it's patron you have to say
01:26:07 even if it's like oh
01:26:09 yes you have to
01:26:11 because if you ever looked at any dojin
01:26:13 ever they all say
01:26:15 all characters are 18
01:26:17 you have to say that legally
01:26:19 but it's literally not true
01:26:21 they can just say all characters depicted are not
01:26:23 being real
01:26:25 why don't they just say that
01:26:27 it's not necessarily not true
01:26:29 the character in the context of their story
01:26:31 isn't 18 but in the context of yours
01:26:33 you still have to say it
01:26:35 I don't want them to be 18
01:26:37 I want them to be 9
01:26:39 there is a hilarious amount of dojins I've
01:26:41 read where it starts off by saying
01:26:43 the characters in this are 18 and over
01:26:45 and then during the sex scene the guy will
01:26:47 literally be screaming I'm fucking an elementary school
01:26:49 student
01:26:51 yeah that's it
01:26:53 that's true
01:26:55 and has dwarfism just coincidentally
01:26:57 and all of her friends also have dwarfism
01:26:59 and have all been held back
01:27:01 I hate that more than anything in the world
01:27:03 I want to burn it with a thousand suns
01:27:05 by the way I have to shout out another beautifully
01:27:07 animated porn stuff from
01:27:09 Mezzo Forte and Kite
01:27:11 especially Mezzo Forte has
01:27:13 Mezzo Forte in particular
01:27:15 has like
01:27:17 an extremely fappable cutscene
01:27:19 in the middle of this otherwise completely
01:27:21 it's actually a dream sequence
01:27:23 or no it's not a dream scene it's something else
01:27:25 the guy who did
01:27:27 both of those like he
01:27:29 what's his face he's interesting
01:27:31 he has like a very distinct art style he also did
01:27:33 most recently he did wizard
01:27:35 barristers and
01:27:37 I don't remember what else he did designs for
01:27:39 I think maybe not witch hunter
01:27:41 robin something like that
01:27:43 kitty grade he did the designs
01:27:45 for kitty grade all of his art is like
01:27:47 very really great
01:27:49 really great hot character designs
01:27:51 and then he would do stuff like yeah
01:27:53 Mezzo Forte where it's like otherwise just a normal
01:27:55 action show but then there's just a random
01:27:57 sexy in it but I'm shouting that way
01:27:59 as like the closest approximation
01:28:01 to what like real life porn would be
01:28:03 if it was animated because it's
01:28:05 it's detailed and fantastic
01:28:07 everyone should watch it
01:28:09 is that it are we
01:28:11 wrapping this up now
01:28:13 are you gonna recommend anything
01:28:15 are you still there
01:28:17 I've been here I just I don't know how to
01:28:19 I'm not really like knowledgeable
01:28:21 about particular artists and things
01:28:23 I just look at what I look at stuff and I'd
01:28:25 say was there anything that you've seen
01:28:27 that is so impressive there was one thing
01:28:29 I yeah the one thing I
01:28:31 linked in the chat is probably my favorite
01:28:33 dojin because the
01:28:35 story is really good and
01:28:37 the art is really good and it doesn't the sex
01:28:39 doesn't start until like page
01:28:41 it's you linked it on dojin
01:28:43 moe and it's called nudist beach
01:28:45 ni shugakuro
01:28:47 chugakuryoko
01:28:49 the I don't read that who's that
01:28:51 between it's got a lot of big-ass titties
01:28:53 that's all I know oh the nudist beach
01:28:55 when I remember like a class goes to a nudist beach
01:28:57 yeah okay yeah it's cool
01:28:59 the whole beginning
01:29:01 but where they're all just sort of this is
01:29:03 being embarrassed looking at each other
01:29:05 involved it is actually
01:29:07 I should uh we're gonna
01:29:09 like recommend specific ones hold on
01:29:11 I'm gonna go into my favorites here because there's one
01:29:13 that I think everyone will like
01:29:15 like no matter what it's
01:29:17 called lingua franca
01:29:19 on ex hentai
01:29:21 lingua franca
01:29:23 I don't know anyone who's played megasol 5
01:29:25 will know what that means yeah by an artist
01:29:27 named akatsuki miuto
01:29:29 it's like basically like
01:29:31 this guy and this girl are
01:29:33 like in a biplane and it crash lands on an island
01:29:35 and it's all like these
01:29:37 like a basically I'm guessing they can't speak
01:29:39 to each other they speak different languages
01:29:41 well the whole island
01:29:43 is full of beautiful women
01:29:45 and they yeah they don't speak his language
01:29:47 and they seem to be like sort of primitive or something
01:29:49 like they live in like a tree and shit
01:29:51 and they're just like we need him to fuck all of us
01:29:53 we can all get pregnant and propagate
01:29:55 our you know it's like an amazon thing
01:29:57 like a guy shows up and they all need to
01:29:59 get pregnant by them and it's just like every
01:30:01 possible body type of women
01:30:03 woman all drawn very beautifully
01:30:05 like very detailed
01:30:07 I don't like it when they're like yes
01:30:09 get me pregnant please
01:30:11 I can understand why that would not be
01:30:13 it's not a way to kill the mood
01:30:15 I like it when it's like a breeding colony
01:30:17 why mix sex with pregnancy
01:30:19 you know I mean what do they have to do with each other
01:30:21 it's you know
01:30:23 I'm definitely into the fantasy
01:30:25 of showing up at some place
01:30:27 and then like literally impregnating the entire
01:30:29 populace and being the godfather
01:30:31 of their whole tribe
01:30:33 I find nothing as sexually attractive about
01:30:35 people specifically but the idea of the sex involved
01:30:37 that's cool
01:30:39 well it's cool because they're like an amazon tribe
01:30:41 so it wouldn't be like raising a kid
01:30:43 normally it'd be like having like all these
01:30:45 cool fucking Spartan kids
01:30:47 I feel some responsibility I wouldn't just like abandon it
01:30:49 you have kids with everyone in the tribe
01:30:51 it's a male thing
01:30:53 it's like the idea of being a father
01:30:55 to like hundreds of children
01:30:57 it's like a it's a naturally
01:30:59 ingrained thing
01:31:01 that's cool I think
01:31:03 yes but it will dry your shit quick
01:31:05 is what I'm saying
01:31:07 alright we have to defer to her
01:31:09 okay alright I think we've been here long enough
01:31:11 wait a minute I didn't tell
01:31:13 my favorite porn
01:31:15 shoot
01:31:17 I don't have one
01:31:19 no I do
01:31:21 so I don't really know any porn people
01:31:23 like by name or anything
01:31:25 except like zone I guess had a lot of great ones
01:31:27 yeah
01:31:29 except cc
01:31:31 first of all
01:31:33 but I'm like
01:31:35 the hottest thing
01:31:37 that I ever ever saw on the internet
01:31:39 was like
01:31:41 it wasn't meant to be hot
01:31:43 it was meant to be like kind of horrifying
01:31:45 like it was
01:31:47 it was an Evangelion fan fiction
01:31:49 of course
01:31:51 and uh
01:31:53 it was really well written and played really straight
01:31:55 and like it continued like the really psychological
01:31:57 horror aspects of the series
01:31:59 I'm sure
01:32:01 and in the context of this fan fiction
01:32:03 like instead of how in the series
01:32:05 there was 18 angels and then the world ended
01:32:07 in this story
01:32:09 in the context of the story the angels just never
01:32:11 stopped coming so things just got worse
01:32:13 and worse and the characters went more
01:32:15 and more mental so it picks up like two years
01:32:17 after
01:32:19 and Asuka and Shinji have been fighting like angels
01:32:21 for two years and there's been like 60 of them
01:32:23 which makes them 16
01:32:25 now so it's legal
01:32:27 right we did it
01:32:29 and like it gets to a point where like
01:32:31 Asuka is so mentally fucked up
01:32:33 that you find out that
01:32:35 she's been raping Shinji
01:32:37 like
01:32:39 sure that's fine
01:32:41 she just like
01:32:43 like Misato leaves or whatever for the night
01:32:45 and she'll like come up to him and she just like grabs his junk
01:32:47 and leads him into the bedroom and he doesn't resist because he's Shinji
01:32:49 he doesn't fucking do anything
01:32:51 right
01:32:53 and she just puts him in the bed
01:32:55 and she just gets on top of him
01:32:57 and it's like this really creepy
01:32:59 loveless, passionless
01:33:01 I mean is that really rape?
01:33:03 well it is
01:33:05 it's like kind of from his perspective
01:33:07 and it's like he really doesn't want this to be happening
01:33:09 but he doesn't fight back
01:33:11 I just like to point out that that's definitely not rape
01:33:13 if he's allowing it to happen
01:33:15 but just like you know if I said something maybe
01:33:17 it would be
01:33:19 I think that's still rape
01:33:21 how is that rape?
01:33:23 it's just because he's sheepish
01:33:25 it's like if I picked my nose
01:33:27 and flicked a booger on you and you didn't want it there
01:33:29 but you didn't want to start a scene with me
01:33:31 because I looked like I could kick your ass
01:33:33 if I put you up at your house
01:33:35 and take you to a restaurant and then bring you home after
01:33:37 and you ate the food and then you're like
01:33:39 god that was horrible why did I do that
01:33:41 if the person is fucking afraid to say no
01:33:43 then it's rape
01:33:45 okay well you didn't say that you just said that he was kind of not
01:33:47 Shinji Akari
01:33:49 that would be afraid of having sex with Asuka
01:33:51 I thought that was implied
01:33:53 that's a good thing
01:33:55 well okay he's scared of to death
01:33:57 because if he doesn't do it she'll kill him
01:33:59 okay fine that's rape
01:34:01 so the point is it was meant to be really creepy
01:34:03 and horrifying but I whacked to it furiously
01:34:05 because it was the hottest thing I ever read in my life
01:34:07 I can't believe I forgot to mention
01:34:09 that I used to write porn
01:34:11 I think it's been brought up maybe before
01:34:13 but yeah I used to write Tills of Symphonia porn
01:34:15 way back in the day
01:34:17 was that about Zellos
01:34:19 Zellos was in some of the chapters
01:34:21 there was one where
01:34:23 just to give you an idea
01:34:25 of the kind of porn this was
01:34:27 I was 14 and I
01:34:29 never read
01:34:31 no I wasn't into Lolli back then
01:34:33 I was just into everything
01:34:35 because she's already like a mind broken girl
01:34:37 that was before your enlightenment
01:34:39 well I was just into all
01:34:41 I was 14
01:34:43 before age meant nothing to me
01:34:45 they were like a 14 year old anime character
01:34:47 shit I hope
01:34:49 look I wrote a lot of chapters
01:34:51 okay like every possible
01:34:53 character combination was covered
01:34:55 but I had never like really
01:34:57 looked at porn that much
01:34:59 so I didn't really know exactly what it was like
01:35:01 so the scenarios I created
01:35:03 were just weird
01:35:05 so like the one with Zellos that I remember
01:35:07 was like they had
01:35:09 it was Colette and Zellos
01:35:11 and they had sex in a pool
01:35:13 and it was that like
01:35:15 one of them probably Zellos had like
01:35:17 cause they both had angel wings or whatever
01:35:19 and he was using them to float on the pool
01:35:21 while she was fucking
01:35:23 like riding his dick while he was floating on the pool
01:35:25 okay okay
01:35:27 that was like chapter 2 there's one where
01:35:29 by the way
01:35:31 no concept of rape at the time
01:35:33 so I didn't realize that this was
01:35:35 rape but um
01:35:37 it was the what did you say your name was
01:35:39 the pink haired girl
01:35:41 Prasea
01:35:43 she like went up to Sheena while she was asleep
01:35:45 and took her sword
01:35:47 and like it was like in the sheath
01:35:49 and she like put the sheath in her veg
01:35:51 and then put the hilt in her own
01:35:53 and like raped her in her sleep
01:35:55 whoa
01:35:57 yeah I was like 14
01:35:59 this is like what I thought sex was like
01:36:01 well that is very
01:36:03 cutting in
01:36:07 oh baby
01:36:09 I love
01:36:11 oh man the best part
01:36:13 is when I was writing that
01:36:15 in asterisk war sucks
01:36:17 part 11 there's a part where I say like
01:36:19 this makes about as much sense as the fan fiction I wrote
01:36:21 when I was 14 right
01:36:23 so we tracked down my
01:36:25 fanfiction.net profile so we could
01:36:27 show it on screen now mind you like
01:36:29 most of the porn I wrote back then was deleted
01:36:31 cause they expunged all of
01:36:33 like the porn at one point but
01:36:35 they left up this one thing I'd
01:36:37 written that was like supposed to be like
01:36:39 this dark gritty sin city
01:36:41 esque like take on
01:36:43 Tales of Symphonia called the Mel Tokio
01:36:45 Slums and I was reading it
01:36:47 and it's just like all rape
01:36:49 like all it is is like characters
01:36:51 going down dark alleys and getting
01:36:53 raped and then like
01:36:55 like trying like killing rapists
01:36:57 basically it was like there was like a rape hunter
01:36:59 guild or whatever
01:37:01 and like it just starts off with like
01:37:03 like Sheena wakes up and she's
01:37:05 like all sore from some sexual
01:37:07 incursion she had the night before that she goes into an alley
01:37:09 gets into a fight gets raped by all these
01:37:11 guys like wakes up gets
01:37:13 raped again then all the rapists get killed
01:37:15 by Colette and she takes her to this play game
01:37:17 I feel like these are a lot of enemies
01:37:19 yeah I mean
01:37:21 rape is a very easy way to make a
01:37:23 situation sexual you just write it in right
01:37:25 has anyone ever played Violated Heroin
01:37:27 it's basically a game where you play as the girl getting
01:37:29 raped all the time I'd highly recommend it
01:37:31 I've seen a few of those yeah I like
01:37:33 the one there's one where
01:37:35 I don't actually play any of those because again I'm
01:37:37 impatient I just want to see sex scenes
01:37:39 there's one where it's like a you know every
01:37:41 time you die it's like a like a
01:37:43 monster's oh dude I played a ton
01:37:45 of those yeah those are like
01:37:47 those are kind of annoying because you're incentivized
01:37:49 to play badly which doesn't really work
01:37:51 let me think about this one is that like a lot of those
01:37:53 will be like you you lose
01:37:55 by like the the monster like rapes you
01:37:57 but in this one it would have like your character
01:37:59 was dead like
01:38:01 was getting raped after being dead it was
01:38:03 really bizarre zombie thing or oh no it was
01:38:05 like like there's one for instance
01:38:07 I just remember the like the death
01:38:09 screen that I saw on
01:38:11 like Elboru but like there's one where
01:38:13 it's like this giant like mosquito creature
01:38:15 and it's got like it's like
01:38:17 stuff through your chest and it's got
01:38:19 it like it's thing like fucking her and
01:38:21 she's like just dead like blood coming from the mouth
01:38:23 that everything else like okay but it was
01:38:25 animated so it's really cool
01:38:27 alright let me say one last thing
01:38:29 I forgot to say this before and it was just
01:38:31 that when it comes to porn I know you said
01:38:33 you're not into this digi but I absolutely
01:38:35 am crazy for porn
01:38:37 games because I love working
01:38:39 for it I love working for my reward
01:38:41 and then I achieve it when I get it it is the most
01:38:43 rewarding thing ever that's why I love games
01:38:45 like Sengoku Rants because that game is hard
01:38:47 as shit so when you finally achieve
01:38:49 something it feels so good I would have
01:38:51 disagreed with you on that a couple
01:38:53 weeks ago oh shit I
01:38:55 discovered a little game a magical
01:38:57 game called honey pop
01:38:59 and oh yes my life yes
01:39:01 perfect example
01:39:03 oh god honey pop fucking
01:39:05 rules the only uh
01:39:07 oh my god I would
01:39:09 I will do my own version of honey pop
01:39:11 redrawing every one of the girls because
01:39:13 just thank you I think they're all ugly
01:39:15 the boobs oh my god what's wrong with
01:39:17 the boobs they look great awful like you
01:39:19 thank you someone thank you
01:39:21 you get it
01:39:23 they're all ugly and badly drawn
01:39:25 you're fucking ugly
01:39:27 calling them ugly is hurtful
01:39:29 and misogynistic and I won't stand
01:39:31 for it on this right this fucking
01:39:33 podcast the art work is
01:39:35 terrible Clinton's future America I will
01:39:37 not stand for that kind of misogynistic
01:39:39 the artwork is terrible and the act is
01:39:41 terrible and we've both
01:39:43 tried to recreate some of the
01:39:45 poses that they do like their boobs
01:39:47 and stuff it's not possible
01:39:49 can we can we at least agree that honey
01:39:51 cam studio the sequel looks like a literal
01:39:53 abortion it looks like the worst thing
01:39:55 ever about that
01:39:57 well the only uh the only um
01:39:59 eroge games I've ever managed to play
01:40:01 like any amount of is
01:40:03 sonohanabira and
01:40:05 a game called
01:40:07 wankoto kurasou which is about like
01:40:09 a world where there's dog girls
01:40:11 like who like
01:40:13 they are dogs but they are also
01:40:15 dog girls it's very strange
01:40:17 like the cat
01:40:19 so you can have sex with them yeah what's great about it
01:40:21 is that well like you can
01:40:23 but it's usually for like because
01:40:25 they're in heat and they need someone to take
01:40:27 care of that that's just to give you an excuse it's like
01:40:29 they write that into the story so it's like oh I have to have sex with my dog
01:40:31 it goes like way too in
01:40:33 like it goes really in depth about like world
01:40:35 building to try to make all of it make sense
01:40:37 and it's really funny you know what I'm not into
01:40:39 I'm not into big excuses written into stories
01:40:41 that are like oh I just I have to have sex
01:40:43 with you because well I mean it's cleverly
01:40:45 done and it's a pretty funny
01:40:47 I guess it's a pretty funny
01:40:49 meme thing pretty standard but
01:40:51 if you fucking read it then it's
01:40:53 I'm saying it's cleverly done I'm not saying
01:40:55 the fact that it's heat it's clever
01:40:57 I'm saying that if you read the thing the way
01:40:59 they handle the concept it's cleverly done
01:41:01 I'll be the judge of that
01:41:03 I haven't read it in like five years
01:41:05 but like my point is simply that I played
01:41:07 both of those games because the sex was
01:41:09 constant like the game is like
01:41:11 like a like a ten minute dialogue
01:41:13 scene and then a ten minute sex scene and it's
01:41:15 just that back and forth basically and that's
01:41:17 actually like readable and I read
01:41:19 Sayano Uta because there's only like four
01:41:21 hours long and it's great it's Urobuchi
01:41:23 again and I love him right
01:41:25 the only
01:41:27 creepy as fuck it's cool though
01:41:29 and Sai is hot what's that game
01:41:31 the only a sex game
01:41:33 well it's not really even sex in it
01:41:35 I think but it's
01:41:37 this thing called Simgo which is a really old flash
01:41:39 yeah that I found when I was like
01:41:41 I don't know 13 or something
01:41:43 it was the coolest thing
01:41:45 it was one of the first
01:41:47 things I've ever seen
01:41:49 sort of like
01:41:51 actual
01:41:53 stuff one of these things
01:41:55 okay it's like a dress up thing
01:41:57 yeah well no it's not a dress up thing
01:41:59 it's a dating sim
01:42:01 ganguro girls
01:42:03 back in the day or anyone remember that
01:42:05 I was on limewire for a while well whatever
