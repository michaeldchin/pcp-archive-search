00:00:00 Panel number one, a demon fox?
00:00:05 Hello everybody and welcome to the Nauru Cast. I am your host, Mumkey Jones.
00:00:12 But I'm Mage, I guess.
00:00:14 And me and Mage right now, we decided, evidently, there is an opening slot here on the PCP for a new podcast.
00:00:22 I guess there is some other podcast on this channel that has moved to a different one, I don't know.
00:00:26 But Mage and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to start our own manga, anime book reviewing podcast.
00:00:34 But, you know, instead of doing it chapter by chapter or something stupid like that, we decided it would be better
00:00:40 to enrich our Naruto reading experience, to dissect this, to analyze this beautiful piece of art.
00:00:47 Panel by panel. So each week we're gonna review a new panel of the Naruto manga. How does that sound to you, Mage?
00:00:55 That's great because when you review it like by chapter, you miss out on all the wonderful art and detail that goes into each every panel.
00:01:03 So we're gonna go into very detailed stuff.
00:01:08 Yeah, because when you're doing it by chapter, you're gonna be more focused on like the plot and the characters.
00:01:12 And you really do miss out like the showmanship that goes into each panel. You know, how big should this individual panel be?
00:01:18 What will be happening? What is the art style we want to go for here? Where do we put the words? Are the words in Japanese?
00:01:23 I don't know. There's so many decisions that go into every little intricate detail of manga that people don't appreciate when you review it on a grand scale.
00:01:32 Yeah, they just take it for granted. Like, have you ever tried making a manga? You know how hard it is to make panels? That's an actual problem.
00:01:40 Yes. And we are blessed because the first panel of the Naruto manga is an entire page.
00:01:47 It's a full page. So we're gonna review the first panel and the first page at the same time.
00:01:54 Now up at the top, we have the introduction. You know, it's chapter one.
00:01:57 And what's interesting is that before the one, instead of like a number sign or something, they have this this ominous looking paw print.
00:02:05 Do you do you see what I'm looking at here? Yeah, yeah, I see it.
00:02:09 Now we don't know starting off because we're only looking at the the chapter number right now.
00:02:14 We don't know if this is the paw of like a wolf of a dog of a cat.
00:02:19 You know, we don't know what this is going to be, but I think having read this first panel,
00:02:24 I think this might be foreshadowing to what the first paragraph of the panel is going to tell us. Very subtle of them.
00:02:31 And then we have we have a colon and then it tells us the name of the chapter, which is Uzumaki Naruto.
00:02:38 With two exclamation points. Not three. It's very exciting. Not one. It's two.
00:02:43 Now, why do you now you're a bit of an artist, right, Mage?
00:02:47 Why do you think that the artist chose to do two
00:02:50 exclamation points instead of one or three? See, because one would not be enough and three just makes it like
00:02:57 it's kind of a bit too much.
00:02:59 So I'm guessing it seems like they're trying too hard.
00:03:02 Yeah, so I think like to find that perfect unique balance because you don't see people use two exclamation points.
00:03:08 If people always just kind of go between one or three or like infinity, but never two.
00:03:15 And you know, that's a pretty good angle because I think from the very beginning Naruto is trying to be original.
00:03:20 So even the number of exclamation points, you know, it the originality shines through even in something like the first chapter title.
00:03:28 Very interesting.
00:03:30 So now we move into there were
00:03:32 Four sentences on this page one in each corner and the center image is
00:03:38 Should we talk about the art first before we dive into the exposition?
00:03:42 We should we should read the text first because oh, okay. Yeah
00:03:46 Yeah, go ahead
00:03:47 Okay, so should I read out the first?
00:03:50 Oh, yeah, I think we should I think we should always read what's on the page since these are short enough
00:03:55 Yeah, okay. So like any manga we start reading from the right side rather than the left side
00:04:01 Now that always confused me as a kid because they always teach you you know with you know, English books
00:04:06 You read left to right. So I'm a kid. I'm sitting there holding this what I assume is a comic book
00:04:10 I don't know what Japan is. I don't know what a manga is or an anime as far as I know
00:04:15 Everything is just a cartoon or a comic book. So when I'm start reading this shit as a kid
00:04:20 It starts off, you know on the left. I'm like, well, that doesn't make any sense
00:04:24 It'd make more sense to start on the right. So
00:04:26 It's like a big cultural gap
00:04:28 And that's another thing that that I appreciate about this is that it stays true to Japanese culture to Japanese customs
00:04:34 And it teaches American kids our English kids
00:04:37 What have you about how cultures can have even something simple like reading can be completely
00:04:43 Backwards and different and I really like that. Yeah, I remember when in Latviania manga became a thing
00:04:49 Um, they had this sort of old warning that like, oh, you're supposed to read it that way not that way
00:04:54 But I think they only did it on popular manga like Dragon Ball Z and Naruto
00:05:00 The other mangas that I bought
00:05:02 They didn't have that warning but luckily for me. I already knew what manga was. So I knew how to read it. Yeah
00:05:08 You were a cultured child
00:05:11 Well, manga came in pretty late in telephony. So I was already a teen by that time
00:05:17 No longer. Oh, that's so unfortunate. You didn't get to grow up with Naruto
00:05:22 Uh
00:05:23 Kind of like I I discovered Naruto in my early teens when I discovered internet and it was actually one of the first
00:05:29 Animes I've watched
00:05:32 So I think it's the ideal gateway anime because it it opens you up to this wonderful world of Japanese cartoon
00:05:39 I absolutely loved Naruto when I was younger
00:05:43 Okay, so should we read this first sentence? Okay, you want to start?
00:05:48 Okay, I can it says once appeared a nine-tailed demon fox
00:05:54 Now this is interesting because and I know we don't want to dive into the art yet, but it looks like
00:05:59 It's it's kind of an abstract depiction of what I think this fox would be like
00:06:04 And it has these weird spirals coming off and if I count them one two three four
00:06:10 There's nine. Okay. So it's consistent with the words on the page. That's good. Yep
00:06:15 Uh, it it's mighty tails could crumble mountains and cause tsunamis
00:06:21 Well, okay, so
00:06:23 So it's setting up this concept of a giant evil demon fox now
00:06:27 Do you think that this is kind of
00:06:29 Ostracizing to a new viewer if they if they pick up a Naruto book and they see like this orange ninja
00:06:34 Who looks like he's having crazy adventures?
00:06:36 And then you open it up in the first panel is like talking about some weird mythology stuff with like a magic demon fox
00:06:43 Do you think that was kind of a risky move on the part of the artist?
00:06:46 Or do you think it's a good way to introduce us to the world of Naruto?
00:06:50 The art probably is confusing because when I first saw the the whole page
00:06:54 I I couldn't make heads or tails of what it was
00:06:56 But after reading the words and looking into the picture. I was like, oh, I see now
00:07:01 I see what they're what they're saying and
00:07:05 Like
00:07:06 It's it's a 50 50
00:07:08 I think on a lot of people it depends on how interested they are if they're just flipping through and they're
00:07:13 Probably just going to see
00:07:14 Like a mess and they're just going to you know skip it not bother to look into it
00:07:19 But those who stop and smell the roses so to speak will get treated to the nice little
00:07:25 imagery of the actual words on so
00:07:29 I don't know um
00:07:33 Do you want to move on to the next? Yeah
00:07:36 Okay, should I read it?
00:07:38 Yeah, yeah, go ahead to fight the demon the people assembled all the shinobi from the village
00:07:43 Now I don't know about you and this might be an issue with just the translation
00:07:47 But I think the word assembled is spelled wrong on this page. Is it spelled wrong for you too?
00:07:52 Oh, I I yeah now that you mentioned it it might be spelled wrong
00:07:57 They have it spelled a s s e n m b l e d
00:08:02 Now do you think that in the original japanese kanji that they spelled it wrong as well as some sort of symbolic reference to the people
00:08:08 Assembling although later on in the show and this will probably be a good
00:08:13 Since we're doing this panel by panel we'll probably get to this in about 80 years
00:08:17 But there's a great ninja war from all the different clans
00:08:20 And so this might be foreshadowing to how the people didn't actually assemble and that's why they spelled it wrong on purpose
00:08:26 as sort of you know
00:08:27 A symbolic way of saying these people might be assembling but as we all know that's not actually going to happen
00:08:34 Hmm
00:08:35 No, I think it might be just a spelling error on the translators part
00:08:41 You know, I think I think both of our hypotheses are equally possible. Well, yes, but at the same time, I'd like to believe that you know, um
00:08:51 It's kind of like you're going like you're giving too much stuff to it at least
00:08:57 How I see it made me
00:08:59 because
00:09:00 um
00:09:01 By the time they get to that part where this little hint makes sense, I think people would have forgotten that misspelling
00:09:09 That's a good point. That's a good point
00:09:11 All right, I'll move on to the third sentence. It says
00:09:14 One brave shinobi was able to seal up the demon but because of that he lost his life
00:09:21 Tragedy on the very first page. We have somebody dying
00:09:25 It it tells you that this is going to be a series of fights and death
00:09:29 And sorrow and sadness and violence and in the third sentence of the entire
00:09:34 Manga, we have we have a brave shinobi dying. What do you make of this?
00:09:39 Well, it is certainly tragic and once we get to the fourth sentence
00:09:44 I might talk a little bit more not about the tragedy but about the
00:09:49 All the whole thing. Um, I would just like to say that
00:09:52 The word shinobi first time comers would probably not know what it means
00:09:57 And no, no, I don't think do do the ever explain it. Um
00:10:02 Meet me. I think you you just kind of have to
00:10:05 Figure out on your own that kind of role looks like warrior ninja that kind of thing
00:10:10 Yeah, I think like
00:10:12 Now it's popular to say oh Naruto's a ninja and stuff like that
00:10:15 But in the manga they use the word shinobi
00:10:18 Which is I'm guessing that Japanese word for it or something like it or you know
00:10:23 Uh, but yeah for newcomers it might be confusing. Um, to
00:10:29 Uh be be uh assaulted right on the first page with unknown words with all this weird terminology
00:10:34 In the vernacular that you might not be accustomed to but again, that's just it's introducing us to a different culture
00:10:40 And I think it's an important thing
00:10:41 That's the second time on this page that Japanese culture has been you know thrust upon
00:10:46 non-Japanese
00:10:48 Readers but in a good way. Yes
00:10:51 And the final sentence in the bottom left corner says
00:10:55 That shinobi was called
00:10:58 The fourth hokage again
00:11:01 We're not only do we have the word shinobi again, but now we have something called a hokage, which you know as a reader
00:11:06 I don't have any idea what hokage is supposed to be let alone being the fourth
00:11:11 Yeah, but I think they actually do explain later on what a hokage is or what a kage is but
00:11:18 Unlike shinobi, which I'm not sure if they do or not
00:11:21 Right, but yeah, there's now there's two words right on the first page that the readers might not be familiar with
00:11:29 Right, it's opening them up to this whole new world where even the words are different
00:11:33 It's quite risky though a risky action for the translator because a lot of people might drop things if they feel like they can't
00:11:40 Understand what's going on and usually that's a result of using unknown words
00:11:45 It's what a lot of creative people suffer from when they try to explain the mechanics of their world
00:11:51 And right off the bat
00:11:53 But because people don't know the setting or the story or the characters or anything
00:11:57 They have no one or nothing to relate it to so this is just a big blurb
00:12:01 They can't really picture it in their heads and they don't understand what's going on
00:12:05 So yeah, at least it's only two words rather than like, you know four or five on the first page
00:12:13 And speaking of of setting up, you know the world of your fiction at the beginning
00:12:18 This you know panel this page consists of four sentences, but already we have so much lore
00:12:24 We have so much backstory so much exposition just from these four not that long sentences
00:12:28 We know that there's a magical demon fuck
00:12:31 So now we know we're thrust into a world where magic and demons exist and that there are
00:12:36 You know, there are different villages full of shinobi. We don't know what a shinobi is necessarily
00:12:40 But we can assume if they're gathering to fight there's some sort of warrior or fighter or something like that
00:12:46 We know that
00:12:47 You can seal demons with magic spells and that there is something called a hokage
00:12:52 And evidently there have been four of them and we can assume because the shinobi
00:12:56 Who sealed the demon became hokage that in some way being a hokage means you're very powerful or you're some sort of
00:13:04 Tragic hero something like that. So I think it's astonishing how
00:13:08 Miyamoto when he wrote this was able to
00:13:11 Have so much lore within four short sentences
00:13:15 Another thing the fourth sentence that I quite like is that instead of giving the character a name like, uh, you know
00:13:22 Bob or whatever
00:13:24 They specifically said this person was called the four of hokage
00:13:27 Which sounds like, you know a title the fourth something like the fourth president or something
00:13:32 So it means that this person's status is more important than this person's actual person
00:13:39 It's more important to the story to the plot to know what he is rather than who he is
00:13:45 And it's probably a good thing that they that they do that for two reasons one
00:13:50 You're right. It does establish that you know a hokage is a it's a title
00:13:53 That's more important than your name
00:13:54 But two and this might be spoilers for for 800,000 panels in the future
00:14:00 But when we find out who the fourth hokage actually was that's a huge turning point for naruto
00:14:06 So I think it's good that we keep this a secret all the way back from panel one. Yes
00:14:11 Now ready to talk a bit about the artwork now. Yes. I have quite a few things to say
00:14:16 Sheer go ahead
00:14:17 Okay, so like at the very bottom under the fox thing that we already established has nine tails and stuff like that
00:14:24 There's a there's a circle and within that circle
00:14:27 We can see an inches star that not a lot of people at least not first comers would be familiar with if they're not familiar with
00:14:34 Japanese culture and whatnot right but within that
00:14:38 Star you can see a figure standing on top of a frog that has a symbol on its belly. You see that
00:14:46 Yeah, yeah, do you do read japanese? Do you know what that symbol means?
00:14:49 Sadly, no, uh, I used to be familiar with a few
00:14:52 Symbols, but this is not a symbol unfamiliar with no
00:14:56 That's too bad. Somebody in the comments will have to let us know. Yes
00:15:00 And he is surrounded by little fire things which usually
00:15:05 Denotes like magic because they're floating fire things like wisps or whatever
00:15:09 So I'm assuming it's you know referencing how he sealed demon
00:15:14 And if you go back up to see right behind the the demon fox you can almost make out like a little
00:15:22 Sigil the word may be like a kind of not a circle
00:15:27 um
00:15:28 How many corners I can't really tell how many corners it is, but it's like uh
00:15:32 Well, it kind of looks like an alchemy circle
00:15:34 Yeah, it kind of almost looks like a seal which makes sense because this person is sealing up the demon
00:15:42 And the whole picture is connected like that
00:15:45 And basically now it's a go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, and it's basically just illustrating
00:15:50 Illustrating the force the four sentences we just read. That's why I wanted to read the sentences first rather than analyzing the image
00:15:59 Uh, I think it's a good thing that we're analyzing this one panel at a time because there's so many little details to the art that you know
00:16:05 I never would have even thought of before unless I was doing a show like this
00:16:09 But your description was pretty apt of you have the big ninja star and then the guy on the frog is standing in front of it
00:16:16 But what i'm noticing now is a bit of jesus imagery because the the shinobi
00:16:22 Ninja star is is sitting up in a way that it resembles, you know, the cross
00:16:26 You know, it's like, you know up and then across, you know, yeah
00:16:29 And it can also resemble, you know, the death of the person
00:16:34 Exactly because
00:16:35 The whole point of the cross is that jesus is making the ultimate sacrifice for the good of the people around him
00:16:41 And this shinobi is standing in front of this ninja star that is in the shape of a cross
00:16:45 So it's like he is sacrificing his life to save the people around him, which is exactly what he's doing
00:16:50 According to the text exactly. So that's crazy. He died to save others
00:16:57 That's just it's phenomenal. I never would have observed something like that
00:17:00 So do we have anything else we should talk about on this panel or should we should we save it for next time?
00:17:05 um
00:17:06 I think we're done here. I I just wanted to point out that um, I quite like the sort of messy inky look of this
00:17:13 It looks tattered and kind of old
00:17:17 Of like you're reading an old ninja scroll that is telling you stories of the past. Yes, it's very very messy very
00:17:23 Uh, maybe almost rushed in a way, but at the same time you can still make out the important details
00:17:31 And and also it's rather than written. It's illustrated. So anyone at any point any time from anywhere could
00:17:40 Try and understand what's going on
00:17:42 Yeah, it's kind of like when somebody messes up their hair on purpose to make it seem like they don't care about how their hair looks
00:17:49 You know, this art is kind of wacky and crazy and sloppy on purpose to resemble something greater
00:17:55 Maybe the chaos that the demon had brought upon the land
00:17:59 That's brilliant
00:18:00 All right. Well, everybody. Thank you for joining us for the naru cast where we review the naruto manga one panel at a time
00:18:08 I'm looking forward to the next one made. Should we do this daily?
00:18:11 Should we put these up once a day once a week once a month once an hour?
00:18:15 What do you think how often should we put these up? Let's keep it a surprise
00:18:20 Okay, okay. We'll keep it a surprise. We'll see you guys next time for panel two of chapter one
00:18:26 Of page two of naruto. I've been monkey jones and this has been mage
