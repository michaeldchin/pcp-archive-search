00:00:00 Hey everybody, welcome to Episode 2 of the Bustercast, the only podcast where we've ever
00:00:09 me and Ben have done something by ourselves.
00:00:10 Is that true?
00:00:11 I think it is.
00:00:12 Is the Bustercast the only other one?
00:00:16 That could be true.
00:00:17 Yeah.
00:00:18 I think we've done other things, not PCP related, but when it's just us two, I think Bustercast
00:00:22 was the only thing.
00:00:24 I think you're right, actually.
00:00:25 We did have the little D&D back and forth at one time, but they were two separate videos
00:00:29 so it doesn't count.
00:00:31 Nothing counts.
00:00:34 So what is it?
00:00:35 It's July 5th, and what is it going to be like a month now, since YouTube deleted our
00:00:42 videos for no reason, and has just told us, like, no, we'll fix it.
00:00:47 No, we'll fix it.
00:00:48 No, our internal team is going to take care of it.
00:00:50 No, don't worry about it.
00:00:53 Much like the government responding to COVID, saying everything is fine, and then doing
00:00:57 nothing and letting it get worse.
00:00:59 YouTube is modeling that style for success quite well, unfortunately, and here we are.
00:01:08 If they were going to fix it, they could just do it.
00:01:11 And if they don't care and aren't going to do it, they could just not answer our emails.
00:01:16 Right.
00:01:17 I don't understand this weird middle ground, and I don't know why it should take this long.
00:01:22 This is how they keep the peons in their place.
00:01:24 They pretend to care.
00:01:25 There's just some algorithm that just is appeasement.exe and just sends out those emails.
00:01:31 Just why even pretend?
00:01:33 Why even pretend?
00:01:34 It's just making me matter.
00:01:36 It's just making me matter.
00:01:37 But we're not, we're not rebelling.
00:01:38 We're not going to YouTube HQ and shooting it up like someone else did, because we have
00:01:44 this tiny thread of hope, keeping us from going on a riot.
00:01:49 I mean, there will come a time when words will no longer be sufficient.
00:01:54 That's true.
00:01:55 An action will have to prevail.
00:01:57 I guess we're not there yet.
00:01:59 Like they're just delaying the inevitable.
00:02:03 They, they, it's so bizarre.
00:02:07 The way this whole thing has transpired is so bizarre.
00:02:10 Like there was no need, there was no need for any of this to happen.
00:02:15 They just like someone like read an email wrong or something that was like, oh, this
00:02:20 channel was hacked, better delete all their content.
00:02:22 It's like, no, this was solved already.
00:02:25 You solved it.
00:02:26 And then you came back and unsolved it.
00:02:28 It's very incredible how like, oh, we're going to delete this entire channel.
00:02:33 Then we're going to bring it back.
00:02:34 Then we're going to delete a quarter of an entire year's worth of uploads because like
00:02:41 that seems like it would be more effort.
00:02:43 Like it seems like something you'd have to go out of your way to do as opposed to be
00:02:46 like a, a consequence of some automated system.
00:02:50 It seems something so fucked that automation couldn't be responsible for it.
00:02:56 And yet here we are.
00:02:57 I just don't know.
00:02:58 I do.
00:02:59 You think it is automate?
00:03:00 You don't think like a human being sat down and was like, let me decide which of these
00:03:03 things need to be deleted.
00:03:05 Yeah.
00:03:06 I think if it was by a human, there would be like patches in between those two dates
00:03:09 where things stayed, right?
00:03:12 Cause like it's just like everything from 195 forward was deleted.
00:03:17 Except for that one stream inexplicably, that one, the radcon opening ceremony stream
00:03:22 escaped it.
00:03:25 No reason why.
00:03:27 So I think one exception.
00:03:29 I think unfortunately it's, it's after four weeks of time, I think it might be time to
00:03:34 finally bring up the question.
00:03:37 What do we do?
00:03:38 Yeah.
00:03:39 If they don't come back, not going to be solved.
00:03:42 It seems as if, but they, but they keep telling, okay, like I understand, but they keep telling
00:03:48 us through email, they keep saying, no, no, we're going to fix it.
00:03:52 No, no, we're going to fix it.
00:03:54 Well, I mean, corporate CEOs keep telling me that if I work hard, I'll be rewarded.
00:04:00 And yet I'm still poor and not rich yet.
00:04:04 I, yeah, but I understand the motivation for keeping you poor, Tom, that makes perfect
00:04:10 sense to me.
00:04:11 And if I were in their position, I would do the same.
00:04:14 But this, their motive, I don't understand their motivation for just telling us they're
00:04:18 going to solve the problem if they don't intend to, I guess it's just part of their
00:04:21 long game to keep me poor.
00:04:24 I guess it's all my fault.
00:04:26 I think if they really just weren't going to do anything, they would just say we can't
00:04:32 do anything.
00:04:34 I don't understand why they wouldn't just do that.
00:04:36 Do we just need to yell more?
00:04:38 Like if we just not yelled enough, I do think that it's like, I was going to yell on Twitter
00:04:43 some more, but then I saw that like Nate had been like emailing them like fairly, you know,
00:04:50 somewhat regularly, and he had gotten a bunch of responses from them.
00:04:54 And so I was like, okay, I guess they are still talking.
00:04:56 I guess they're still communicating with us.
00:04:59 We don't really need to raise a stink on social media, but like a month is a long time.
00:05:04 And I just don't believe that it takes this long.
00:05:07 Yeah.
00:05:09 I'm so confused.
00:05:10 I'm so confused why they're going to, why would they make any promises?
00:05:15 And then just ignore, why not just ignore us completely if that's what they want?
00:05:19 Like, I don't know, man.
00:05:23 It's a mystery, my dude.
00:05:26 Hmm.
00:05:28 I mean, if the day comes when we are like, okay, the videos are never coming back.
00:05:36 I think, I don't know, maybe all, but at the very least, most of the content, people have
00:05:47 it like saved.
00:05:48 Like, like I've heard, I have had people on Twitter and there have been people in the
00:05:52 YouTube comments saying, hey, I have some of the Radcon stuff saved, or I have some
00:05:58 of the streams saved or whatever.
00:06:00 So worst case scenario would be, yeah, we lose the initial videos, we lose the initial
00:06:07 views and comments and stuff and all that, but we can re-upload it.
00:06:11 I really don't want to do that.
00:06:13 No, I do not either.
00:06:14 Yeah.
00:06:15 I mean, you in particular, right, the Animorphs lecture, if it, like, it would get like 200,000
00:06:20 views more.
00:06:21 I don't think it hit 200 yet, but it was getting there.
00:06:23 It was like 180 something, I think.
00:06:25 Yeah.
00:06:26 It was going on 200,000 views and without that, you know, it's a big loss.
00:06:31 Yeah.
00:06:32 Which is why I'm willing to just kind of hold off and be like, let's see, let's wait and
00:06:36 see what happens.
00:06:37 Let's wait and see what happens.
00:06:38 It took them forever for us to, for them to fix the hack the first time.
00:06:43 And by the time they finally did it, I was convinced they weren't going to.
00:06:46 So I guess maybe I'm a little more hopeful this time because I was proved too pessimistic
00:06:53 in the past.
00:06:56 But that is, you know, we have that option.
00:07:00 And I think that probably, so if you're listening to this and you've got some shit saved, you
00:07:04 know, hang on to it, there is a real possibility we'll have to put out a fucking call to be
00:07:09 like, hey, everyone, if we have anyone who's got our old shit saved, we'd really appreciate
00:07:15 it.
00:07:16 That's all we can do.
00:07:17 We, I mean, I have some stuff saved, but not most of it.
00:07:22 Yeah.
00:07:23 You know?
00:07:24 Yeah.
00:07:25 Like I have some of my own stuff.
00:07:29 Coconut milk.
00:07:30 Excellent.
00:07:31 Yeah.
00:07:32 Um, boy, it's frustrating though, boy, it makes me fucking mad.
00:07:40 It's pretty, pretty bullshit.
00:07:42 Pretty lame.
00:07:43 Pretty lame and gay.
00:07:44 Not cool.
00:07:46 So that's the situation with that.
00:07:49 How's, how's your week been?
00:07:50 Were you, were you on last week?
00:07:52 It was you, me, hippo, right?
00:07:53 Yep.
00:07:54 Yeah.
00:07:55 So how's your, how's your week been in the time since then?
00:07:58 It's been, it's been chill.
00:08:00 Just kind of working, grinding, doing a bunch of projects that I'm playing close to the
00:08:05 chest right now, trying to learn things and get smarter and cooler and better.
00:08:12 Are they a zoomie related?
00:08:13 Are they not a zoomie related?
00:08:15 A little bit of both, a little bit of both, assuming and not assuming related.
00:08:18 Okay.
00:08:19 Um, yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:08:22 Pretty neat.
00:08:23 Hopefully someday they'll see the light of day.
00:08:25 That's kind of the idea.
00:08:26 Did you finally said she's going to mail me all the posters so we can get those out to
00:08:32 the rad con backers.
00:08:33 I can't wait to do more grindy work.
00:08:36 Right.
00:08:37 She said she, she said she mailed them, right?
00:08:40 Yeah.
00:08:41 They'll probably be here in a few days.
00:08:43 Cool.
00:08:44 Cool.
00:08:45 Cool.
00:08:46 Boy.
00:08:47 Um, that's pretty sick.
00:08:48 Yeah.
00:08:49 It's nice to see that the patron shit or not the patron shit, the Kickstarter rewards are
00:08:53 going out.
00:08:54 Very exciting.
00:08:55 Um, from, uh, on my, on my side of the aisle, uh, my, my Kickstarter is, is also, I'm getting
00:09:03 ready to send that because I have all the vaporettes, Tom.
00:09:06 I have all the vaporettes.
00:09:07 My God.
00:09:08 I have all six of them.
00:09:09 Yes.
00:09:10 So last night Jade sent me hers and she was the last one.
00:09:15 Now I got it.
00:09:16 Uh, I have to like just put the pages together and like decide if I want to put in some like
00:09:21 bumper pages to like keep things like even like keep the left pages versus right page
00:09:26 alignments or whatever.
00:09:28 What's like, what's like the page count?
00:09:30 What's like the, the final page count is it depends on whether I want to put any of those
00:09:35 in, but it's going to like, like 55 to 60 or so, which is, um, it's funny because like
00:09:42 Vapors two is only 15 pages long.
00:09:46 So it's like mostly guest content, uh, which is kind of how I hoped it would be.
00:09:51 Uh, I'm very happy.
00:09:54 A lot of the, a lot of the vaporettes are long.
00:09:56 A lot of them are like six, seven, eight pages.
00:09:58 Um, pretty cool.
00:10:00 That's how you do it in value.
00:10:02 Yeah.
00:10:03 It's going to be like 55 pages.
00:10:05 I sent, I've sent all the guest artists their, their money.
00:10:08 They're fat stacks of that Vapors cash.
00:10:12 Uh, fuck yeah, um, it's a, it's a, I don't know, like if I can finish, if I can finish
00:10:20 doing the layout stuff today, I will send out for a test copy to be printed, get that
00:10:25 in the mail, look it over, be like, yeah, it looks good.
00:10:28 Then I will send out for them to make like 500 of them and then I want to be fucking
00:10:33 in time to do all that shit.
00:10:35 Time to fucking address envelopes and start like doing doodles and people's copies and
00:10:39 stuff.
00:10:40 I can't believe it.
00:10:45 You gotta, you gotta do everything through stamps.com so much easier.
00:10:50 Stamps.com.
00:10:51 You've told me about this.
00:10:52 Yeah.
00:10:53 That's what I use for all the rad con stuff instead of like handwriting all the labels.
00:10:56 I just, cause you can imp, you can export a CSV file of all the patron information and
00:11:02 the stamps.com file, then import it and then you just kind of go through and you, for each
00:11:07 one you say this is the package weight and then it'll just print out labels for you.
00:11:10 If you print them out on the label paper, you just slap them on there and have a good
00:11:15 time.
00:11:16 I, I understand why that would be an efficient way of doing things, but I just kind of like
00:11:21 labeling things by hand.
00:11:23 Just like that personal touch.
00:11:25 I like to give it the little personal touch.
00:11:26 Yeah.
00:11:27 I don't know.
00:11:28 You like, like, did you see the envelopes I sent for the first one?
00:11:31 They were like black with like silver sharpie, right?
00:11:34 They were, they were written in white out on a black envelope.
00:11:38 They're using like a white out pen and they, and they looked sick and I'm going to do that
00:11:42 again.
00:11:43 So, you know, no shortcuts for me, Dab, I'm going to do, I'm going to try and do a similar
00:11:49 thing with the, the RFCK Kickstarter.
00:11:51 I'm going to try and, I have green envelopes.
00:11:53 I'm going to try and make them fancy.
00:11:55 You're juggling multiple Kickstarter's.
00:11:58 Well that one I won't have to ship out for a little bit.
00:12:02 They are still in the process of like actually making the like tests, like the sample items.
00:12:09 So I'll have to get those made, approve them, and then say like, yes, make hundreds, please.
00:12:17 So yeah, like they will probably be shipping out at around the same time, more or less.
00:12:22 But I don't mind.
00:12:23 So like addressing envelopes is like thoughtless busy work that's kind of relaxing to do.
00:12:28 I'm not even like, I'm not dreading it at all.
00:12:31 I'm kind of looking forward to it.
00:12:33 Yeah.
00:12:34 Like, I like that shit.
00:12:35 It's easy.
00:12:36 The label stuff is pretty, pretty Zen.
00:12:37 You just kind of like put on like some music or a podcast, just get it done.
00:12:41 Exactly.
00:12:42 The only thing that sucked is that for the rewards for GradCon, you had to like match
00:12:48 up shirt sizes.
00:12:49 So it wasn't just like put label on, toss out of the way, you had to like go and sift
00:12:52 through them all.
00:12:53 Just a little bit annoying, but yeah, it's fine, whatever.
00:12:58 This time, because like the first time I sent out the Vapors Kickstarter books, not like
00:13:05 a lot, but like a significant number, like maybe like a dozen different envelopes ripped,
00:13:11 like the envelopes just ripped.
00:13:13 Maybe it was because they had a pin in them or something.
00:13:16 And like a lot of just people's like stuff got damaged and transit.
00:13:20 This time, I bought bubble wrap.
00:13:23 So I'm going to put, I'm going to tuck bubble wrap in there.
00:13:25 I'm going to wrap the little pin in it just so it doesn't like prick its way through the
00:13:28 paper.
00:13:30 It's going to be, it's going to be fucking great.
00:13:33 I have big rolls of it over here next to my bed.
00:13:36 It's probably not enough.
00:13:36 I'll have to get more, but that's fine.
00:13:39 No, it's going to be plush.
00:13:41 It's going to send it in plush.
00:13:43 It's going to travel in comfort and style.
00:13:47 Yes, yes.
00:13:51 Hey, I've been working on, I think I mentioned this last week, but I have I've kept working
00:13:55 on, um, slime and punishment finale.
00:13:57 That's going pretty good.
00:13:58 It's probably about half done.
00:14:00 I think last time I said it was not quite half done.
00:14:02 I've probably passed the halfway mark.
00:14:06 It's going to be exciting.
00:14:08 What's, what's the ETA on that?
00:14:09 Do you think?
00:14:11 Uh, definitely before the end of the month.
00:14:15 Um, yeah.
00:14:17 Um, I should probably do a bunch of work on it tonight.
00:14:21 Maybe after I do the vapors layout stuff, it will.
00:14:26 When I get like, when I get into the zone with it, it actually goes pretty fast.
00:14:30 Um, when, but it's getting into the zone is hard and takes like time.
00:14:35 I have to like block out time to like sit down and be like, okay, I'm going to make
00:14:40 this shot.
00:14:41 I'm going to, I'm going to make this scene or whatever.
00:14:44 Uh, there was a particular, there was one shot that required making it goes really
00:14:50 fast when there's not, when it's about like video editing, but when I have to like draw
00:14:54 something to put into the scenes, that's what takes a lot of time.
00:14:57 I had one shot that took me forever to draw because it was all these figures that
00:15:02 had to do two different frames and they all sort of move together.
00:15:06 And that took me like four days to just draw this, draw all, draw these figures
00:15:11 all out in both different poses.
00:15:13 Well, mostly it was actually putting them into the scene and having the move easy
00:15:17 took like less than an hour, but the actual drawing was like, oh, I got to fill
00:15:21 the scene with bullshit.
00:15:24 The labor scenes are always a pain in the ass.
00:15:27 They, they are, they are.
00:15:29 I hate them.
00:15:30 Man, why can't I just, they look cool.
00:15:32 Yeah, but like, man, why can't I just have a bunch of like close up on a face
00:15:37 and shot reverse shot?
00:15:38 That shit's like, that's, it's easy.
00:15:41 George Lucas did it and made millions of dollars.
00:15:43 What the fuck?
00:15:44 Yeah.
00:15:44 Yeah.
00:15:44 He had the right idea.
00:15:45 He invented, he literally invented it.
00:15:48 Okay.
00:15:48 Oh, he pioneered shot reverse shot in Star Wars episode one.
00:15:52 He copyrighted it.
00:15:53 So now I can't use it.
00:15:54 I have to pay him royalties.
00:15:56 That's why that's why I have to do work.
00:15:59 That's why he's not making them anymore.
00:16:01 Disney bought them and they bought shot reverse shot.
00:16:03 So he's just like, I don't even know how to make movies anymore.
00:16:06 Like I, I copyrighted movies.
00:16:09 I copyrighted editing.
00:16:11 I can't do it anymore.
00:16:12 Shit.
00:16:13 I wouldn't put it past Disney.
00:16:14 They're working on it.
00:16:15 They got their lawyers chipping away.
00:16:17 And like, can we just like own the movie format?
00:16:20 We should probably abolish copyright.
00:16:26 I just think, I just think laws should only apply to people that have more
00:16:32 and they should never be used against like people should be allowed.
00:16:36 Like I was about to say abolish copyright.
00:16:38 But I was like, no, no, no, no, no, don't abolish copyright,
00:16:40 but just only make it apply to Disney.
00:16:42 Like Disney can't steal from anyone, but anyone can steal from Disney.
00:16:46 I think that's fair.
00:16:47 There's I think that's completely fair.
00:16:49 Laws are more strict, the more successful you are.
00:16:52 Yeah, yeah, one hundred percent.
00:16:54 That should be how it works.
00:16:57 If you're already making like billions of dollars from your intellectual
00:17:00 properties, there should be a there should be a gradient.
00:17:04 It's sort of progressive intellectual property ownership where,
00:17:07 where and it's like, OK, you've made a certain amount on your property.
00:17:10 Like you can't own it anymore.
00:17:12 It's fucked up.
00:17:14 Like, isn't California kind of like doing that with like stealing and shit?
00:17:17 Isn't like if you like steal something under nine hundred dollars in value,
00:17:21 it's just a misdemeanor and they they can't do anything about it.
00:17:26 Isn't stealing.
00:17:28 I mean, that sounds like it would be a misdemeanor anyway.
00:17:31 God, what was it?
00:17:31 There was like they changed something in California with stealing.
00:17:35 And it's just like if it's under nine hundred dollars,
00:17:37 like they can't prosecute you or anything or you can't be arrested.
00:17:42 That sounds like something.
00:17:44 I mean, that totally sounds believable.
00:17:47 I feel like there's already places that have laws like that.
00:17:50 Well, like what you're talking about, like shoplifters, right?
00:17:52 I guess I just know that there was like a big stink about it a few months back
00:17:56 as people are just like going into stores and just like walking out with shit.
00:18:00 And there was nothing anybody in the store could do about it because it was like.
00:18:03 Yeah, the thing about that is that it's a totally victimless crime
00:18:08 and everyone should do it, whether it's legal or not.
00:18:10 I feel like that law should apply to big box retailers,
00:18:16 but like you shouldn't go to a mom and pop shop and like steal all their shit.
00:18:19 But you can go to Walmart and like it's all free and less than a thousand dollars
00:18:24 or more, basically. Yeah.
00:18:27 And even then, if you're like, if you if if you'll like promise you'll be good,
00:18:31 they should just let you off with a warning.
00:18:34 You see, everybody should get one. Everybody should get one.
00:18:37 Yeah, everybody gets one freebie where they can go in and steal
00:18:40 like a like a hundred inch flat screen TV or whatever.
00:18:44 Sick is that in California, the PlayStation five will be free, fucking base.
00:18:50 Wait, what?
00:18:52 Think about it. If it's under nine hundred dollars,
00:18:54 the PlayStation five will be under nine hundred dollars.
00:18:56 You can just walk in there and fucking take one.
00:18:58 I see. OK.
00:19:00 Wait, hold on.
00:19:01 It's not. Is it law or is it just like company?
00:19:04 Because I know that a lot of stores have have like don't know chase company policies
00:19:09 where like technically you're supposed to like stop a shoplifter.
00:19:14 But company policy is like you don't actually like follow them.
00:19:17 Like if someone just picks up some stuff and walks out with it,
00:19:22 you don't do anything. You say, hey, sir, stop.
00:19:25 And that's it.
00:19:25 Like that's the only thing you're expected to do
00:19:28 because it's like a it's like a bad idea to do anything.
00:19:31 You're not a law enforcement officer.
00:19:33 You don't have the legal authority to like tackle someone.
00:19:35 And even if you did, you wouldn't want your employees doing that
00:19:38 because you don't want your employees getting fucking injured on the job.
00:19:41 Like that's just going to that's like leads to more problems for the employer.
00:19:46 I'm looking. I'm looking at it.
00:19:48 I don't know. Maybe this is a different thing because this is from 2014
00:19:52 that must be older.
00:19:54 It says California Proposition 47 is what they were talking about.
00:19:57 Some of these articles, but maybe that's not.
00:20:00 I don't know.
00:20:02 I'm not in California.
00:20:04 We're in the other liberal bastion, you know, on the other side of the country.
00:20:08 Yeah, hell, yeah, dude.
00:20:10 We haven't done it yet.
00:20:13 Shoplifting is good.
00:20:16 Well, we know you have a personal vested interest in history with the subject.
00:20:21 We looting is good.
00:20:26 Antifa is the good guys.
00:20:28 I mean, whatever.
00:20:30 You guys all know what I think at this point.
00:20:32 What I don't even need to show.
00:20:33 I don't even need to show up or say anything.
00:20:35 It can all just be my opinions can all just be taken for granted.
00:20:38 Eleazar can just insert like quotes from past episodes.
00:20:41 Eleazar, just just just just paste in a bunch of times when I said that,
00:20:45 like, we should eat the rich and then it's fine.
00:20:48 That's you get the idea.
00:20:50 No problem.
00:20:53 We just added, like, another 45 minutes of the podcast, just with that one edit.
00:20:57 Yeah, yeah, it's like every time to go to voicemails.
00:21:01 Finally, I feel like what's the thing?
00:21:05 Was there anything like that in the news this week?
00:21:08 I mean, like, bullshit happened.
00:21:10 Oh, I went to a fucking I went to like a protest yesterday.
00:21:15 I broke I broke it.
00:21:17 Yes, I broke out of quarantine and I went and I did a march through Boston.
00:21:22 I quit being a pussy.
00:21:25 It was pretty funny.
00:21:26 I actually got there really early because I had been out with
00:21:31 Munchie and Kazi the night before and I had, like, stayed over it.
00:21:35 Like, like, slept on, like, their, like, dad's couch or something.
00:21:39 Oh, God.
00:21:41 As in Kazi's dad, not Kazi and Munchie's dad.
00:21:43 They don't they don't share a dad, as a matter of fact.
00:21:46 Not yet.
00:21:47 Lamal.
00:21:49 But I have, like, stayed over there and I so I had to go through the city
00:21:53 and it was the fourth and I knew that there was there was an event going on.
00:21:57 I was like, well, since I have to fucking risk infection to travel anyway,
00:22:02 I might as well stop in the middle and like do this thing.
00:22:06 So I got there really early and I had to just walk around
00:22:10 and wait for like several hours.
00:22:12 And I ended up getting I bought I bought a big bottle of hand sanitizer
00:22:15 to keep hands, you know, disinfecting myself with.
00:22:18 But I forgot to get sunscreen.
00:22:20 So I was out all day in the sun and I forgot to sunscreen and I.
00:22:24 And I'm all red and it hurts really bad today.
00:22:28 But that's but that's fine.
00:22:30 It was worth it.
00:22:32 And the march was very it was pretty fun.
00:22:35 It wasn't it was like three or four hours, which is like, OK, whatever.
00:22:39 It was kind of long, but not like unbearably long.
00:22:42 And it was a little bit.
00:22:45 It was a little annoying because they slipped in a bunch of
00:22:48 they slipped in a little bit of some like hippie dippy spiritual nonsense.
00:22:53 You know what I mean?
00:22:54 Oh, no.
00:22:56 There was.
00:22:57 I mean, they did some like did some like African chanting,
00:23:01 which like that's fine. That's cool. I get that.
00:23:04 But the the ladies that led it, they called them.
00:23:07 They called them the healers, which is like, OK, that's fine.
00:23:13 And like and for the most part, you know, they they invoked
00:23:15 some kind of like spiritual sounding stuff, which is like, yeah, fine, fine, fine.
00:23:20 But there was a part when we stopped at the Harriet Tubman Memorial.
00:23:25 This was like near like a house that I guess she lived in.
00:23:28 I don't know the fucking history of my own city now.
00:23:32 But this was a Harriet Tubman Memorial.
00:23:34 And we stopped and they sort of had like a moment of silence
00:23:37 and like some deep breathing exercises and like a like we want to honor.
00:23:41 They were they're going to honor the spirit of Harriet Tubman,
00:23:43 which like got it makes perfect sense.
00:23:46 But then they added these a little bit more.
00:23:48 They were like, we want to honor the spirit of water
00:23:54 because water is such a powerful elephant in the elephant,
00:23:58 such a powerful element in our tradition.
00:24:00 As you like, you know, these water spirits, these merfolk,
00:24:04 you know, followed our people across the sea.
00:24:07 If they slave ships.
00:24:09 Whoa, whoa.
00:24:10 Like whoa.
00:24:11 Do you want to honor their merfolk?
00:24:13 Clearly they didn't do much to help.
00:24:15 Yeah, yeah, they just were they just watched.
00:24:17 They were fucking centrists.
00:24:19 They were like, hmm, slave slave owners.
00:24:21 I can't tell the difference between these people.
00:24:23 Maybe they're both a little wrong.
00:24:26 So I don't know.
00:24:28 So there was there were a couple of little bits like that.
00:24:30 But, you know, whatever is fine.
00:24:34 It was very cool.
00:24:35 We went in front of we went in front of the police department.
00:24:39 I think it was the police department headquarters.
00:24:41 It was near Ruggles and it's this big.
00:24:44 It kind of it's like a big blue, like sort of semi-futuristic box.
00:24:49 It kind of reminds me of the IDPD headquarters from Nuclear Throne.
00:24:53 It looks a little bit like a prison and a little bit like a car dealership.
00:24:58 That sums up the police pretty well.
00:25:01 Yeah, I thought so.
00:25:02 We went right in front of it and we chanted, we chanted, you know,
00:25:07 no justice, no peace, abolish the police.
00:25:10 It was pretty cool.
00:25:11 They didn't do anything.
00:25:12 It was perfectly peaceful protest, which means that it accomplished nothing.
00:25:16 Nobody cared.
00:25:17 But whatever, we made our statement.
00:25:19 Unfortunately, nobody broke any windows.
00:25:22 Cy, nothing was set on fire.
00:25:24 Maybe next time.
00:25:26 Well, next time we get to get some of the Murfolk involved.
00:25:29 That'll that'll rile things up.
00:25:32 We got it.
00:25:33 We didn't invoke them hard enough.
00:25:34 I guess not.
00:25:35 The Murspirits or whatever the fuck they called them.
00:25:39 I don't know.
00:25:40 I get it's hard.
00:25:41 It's harmless enough, but it's a little it's a little
00:25:43 feels like a little bit of a waste of time, like I don't give a shit.
00:25:46 I don't give a shit about spirituals and I'm not here to fucking
00:25:50 I'm not here to fucking worship the elements.
00:25:52 I'm here to fucking defund the police and get the issues and get killer cops
00:25:57 put in jail. That's all I want.
00:25:59 And you're fucking it up.
00:26:01 But it's fine.
00:26:02 Cop killers, not killer cops.
00:26:04 Exactly. Exactly.
00:26:05 Thank you. That's that's going to be your fucking sign you bring out next time.
00:26:10 I somebody gave someone was handing out signs and I kind of wanted.
00:26:15 I don't know.
00:26:16 So I was holding up a sign, but it wasn't one that I made.
00:26:18 And then I ended up just picking a kind of generic, just like BLM one.
00:26:23 I was like, OK, this is fine.
00:26:25 I kind of wish that I had made my own and I could have made it a little more
00:26:28 pointed, you know, about specifically about like defunding the police or something.
00:26:33 But I don't want to get confused with the Murfolk.
00:26:37 No, I'm not with them.
00:26:38 There's like there's there's the defund the police people and there's the
00:26:42 Murspirits followed us from African people and we have nothing to do with each other.
00:26:47 That's that's interesting.
00:26:50 I don't know.
00:26:51 These these healers are a little whatever, they were fine.
00:26:56 You know, you know, they they went to all the trouble to organize this.
00:27:00 I'm sure it was a lot of work.
00:27:02 Do I if I if I had been making the speeches,
00:27:06 would I have said the exact all the same things?
00:27:08 Maybe not. But that's OK.
00:27:10 The doer is it is the doer of deeds, you know, who matters, not not the man
00:27:15 who stands aside and says how they do or could have done them better,
00:27:19 whatever that Teddy Roosevelt quote is.
00:27:22 Are we allowed to quote him?
00:27:23 Isn't he a bad person?
00:27:24 Isn't everybody a bad person who wasn't born like 10 years ago?
00:27:28 Um, Teddy Roosevelt is like you can he's, you know, everybody's problematic.
00:27:34 Everybody's got their issues.
00:27:36 I think Teddy is like pretty good for the time.
00:27:39 Like, is he a little racist?
00:27:40 Like, yeah, sure.
00:27:42 But he wasn't like a slave owner or anything, you know?
00:27:45 He wasn't like, like, I mean, there's like that Edward Colton guy
00:27:49 who they pulled down the statue of in London that one time.
00:27:52 And like, he like literally owned like a slave trading empire.
00:27:56 And then there's like Ulysses S. Grant, who owned one slave,
00:27:59 but only because like his wife already owned the slave and he just married her
00:28:04 while she owned it. So it's like he technically did.
00:28:06 But like, you know, there are there are degrees.
00:28:09 There are degrees. That's a little that's a little that's a little.
00:28:13 Am I am I being a little problematic here?
00:28:15 Just a tiny bit. You might want to.
00:28:17 Oh, oh, he only owned that out.
00:28:18 Oh, oh, he only owned one slave.
00:28:20 Like, oh, die, Ben St.
00:28:22 canceled like, no, but come on, but come on. All right.
00:28:25 Like, yeah, Teddy Roosevelt was a little bit racist,
00:28:27 but he was like that like paternalistic kind of racism that's like, ah, you know,
00:28:32 he was he was wasn't perfect.
00:28:35 But, you know, most most people were worse, you know?
00:28:38 He was pretty he was pretty progressive in his own way for his own time.
00:28:42 So I think that you can only be as progressive as the culture you were born into,
00:28:47 you know, 20 years from now, the fucking post zoomers will be talking
00:28:52 about all the problematic shit we did without realizing it.
00:28:55 I think you're right. I think that's true and untrue.
00:28:57 Like, I think I think that anyone probably,
00:29:02 if they really cared to like take a long, hard look,
00:29:05 probably should have known that slavery was always wrong.
00:29:08 But on the same time, you know,
00:29:12 if everyone's doing it, it does make it harder.
00:29:14 It does make it harder to be like to take a stand and be like, you know what?
00:29:18 I won't own people. I'm going to buck this trend.
00:29:21 Yeah. So I guess so I guess I see it both ways.
00:29:23 I guess if it's like that deeply ingrained, you know, it's kind of like us here,
00:29:27 like money pretty bad, probably should get rid of it. Federal Reserve die.
00:29:31 But it's like, what are you going to do?
00:29:32 Just stop using money like you can't really.
00:29:34 So I guess I'll just keep taking my hand out from the government.
00:29:39 Like, like, um, yeah, I don't know.
00:29:43 But slavery is bad, though.
00:29:45 Slavery was definitely in case in case I'm making this podcast going on the record.
00:29:50 To say it's official position, bad.
00:29:53 The official position of the PCP is that the slavery cringe, pretty cringe.
00:29:59 Not at all.
00:29:59 Based where we map slavery on our three dimensional chart.
00:30:05 Yeah, it'd be cringe, smoothbrained.
00:30:08 Oh, that one.
00:30:10 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:11 Cringe, smoothbrained and what's was the other axis?
00:30:14 Virgin, very virgin, definitely virgin.
00:30:16 Super virgin.
00:30:18 Mm hmm. The worst corner.
00:30:21 Yeah. But.
00:30:24 So that's me. I'm no longer a pussy.
00:30:27 I did the thing.
00:30:28 I did an activism and I feel good about it.
00:30:31 You risked the Rona, which you you were worried you had for a while.
00:30:34 But clearly that that doesn't seem to be in the case.
00:30:37 Did I talk about the Rona on last episode?
00:30:40 Did I talk about that ice cream?
00:30:42 I don't think so.
00:30:43 Well, in brief, I bought a tub of ice cream and I ate it.
00:30:48 And then I was real, realized, like, wait a minute, the seal was broken.
00:30:51 Oh, my God.
00:30:52 Somebody opened my ice cream and licked it to give it the Rona and put it back.
00:30:56 And I have been I am the victim of terrorism.
00:31:00 However, I don't think that's true.
00:31:02 I think it was just a factory defect.
00:31:03 I went back to that same store and I looked at the same flavor of ice cream
00:31:07 and they all have a broken seal.
00:31:09 And in fact, and in fact, the next one I bought not only had a broken seal,
00:31:14 it was like half empty.
00:31:15 So now not only was I exposed to the Rona, I was also ripped off.
00:31:19 So I need to go back and be like, excuse me, I want to talk to your manager.
00:31:23 This tub of keto ice cream was only like half full.
00:31:27 And I would like a replacement, please.
00:31:29 Thank you very much, essential worker risking your life to serve me.
00:31:33 But please, but please fix this immediately.
00:31:36 I mean, if you're if you have the Rona and you want to spread it to the most people,
00:31:39 you're not going to go for the keto ice cream.
00:31:41 That's definitely, you know, you're not maxing your potential damage.
00:31:46 You're right.
00:31:46 I would want to I would want to lick something that was like guaranteed to sell
00:31:51 that day, like because because if you let it sit, it's, you know,
00:31:55 the Rona only only lives for so long.
00:31:58 Although I do think it lives longer in the cold.
00:32:01 I would assume so.
00:32:02 So well, I would have assumed that like sub freezing temperatures would kill it.
00:32:07 But I don't think that's the case because it's not like it's not like a living
00:32:11 organism, it's like a virus, which is basically just like a glorified molecule.
00:32:16 So I do think it can survive sub freezing temperatures.
00:32:20 But I think it just kind of naturally decays and like heat speeds that process along.
00:32:25 So like living in the freezer is probably where it would be the worst
00:32:29 and where it would last the longest.
00:32:31 So, you know, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous stuff.
00:32:35 Although I don't think there's any cases of it having been spread in that way.
00:32:39 I don't think I was looking it up because I was afraid.
00:32:42 And I think there's like no confirmed cases of it being spread through food at all.
00:32:48 And like also cases in Massachusetts are like way down now.
00:32:52 Like we are one of I think we're one of only two states that is like
00:32:56 still decreasing, has not fucking fucked themselves with like a poorly planned
00:33:03 reopening. The Commonwealth works, I guess.
00:33:07 Commonwealth fucking works.
00:33:08 Wait, let me let me check right now.
00:33:11 Massachusetts coronavirus cases.
00:33:15 Are we still are we still in the decline?
00:33:17 Are we still in the decline?
00:33:19 It's like, oh, we were doing great until some crazy people started protesting
00:33:23 about merfolk yesterday.
00:33:24 Now it's a huge spike again.
00:33:26 Wait, I don't see the fucking I don't see the fucking graph.
00:33:32 No, Massachusetts.
00:33:33 If there's no graph, it didn't happen.
00:33:36 Did I misspell Massachusetts?
00:33:38 Mast Massachusetts coronavirus cases.
00:33:42 I just want I just OK.
00:33:45 Here we go. Confirmed cases.
00:33:48 110,000 Lamal.
00:33:51 Um, deaths, 8000 Lamal base.
00:33:59 OK, OK, Massachusetts new cases in the last 60 days.
00:34:04 Oh, my God, show me the graph.
00:34:05 Show me the fucking graph.
00:34:07 My viewers are not allowed.
00:34:09 Oh, here we are. Here we are.
00:34:10 OK, we've actually ticked up a little bit.
00:34:15 But at the lowest, we were getting like 100 cases a day.
00:34:19 Now we're kind of up to like two to three hundred socialists and confirmed
00:34:23 not working, but I mean, at the worst, we were getting like thousands of days.
00:34:27 So, you know, it could be could be worse.
00:34:29 I guess it's all right.
00:34:31 It's OK. It's going to be fine.
00:34:35 It's going to be fine.
00:34:36 We're going to make it.
00:34:37 Maybe someday.
00:34:39 Dude, I was reading, I saw something on Twitter about apparently in Florida,
00:34:43 there's like new cases of this like amoeba
00:34:47 that like goes in through your nasal cavity and like starts breaking down your
00:34:51 brain and there's been like 163 cases ever since it was discovered.
00:34:56 And only four of them weren't fatal.
00:34:58 And it's like happening.
00:34:59 And if you go in the water, this amoeba can go up your nose
00:35:03 and start breaking down your brain to ease your brain.
00:35:07 Oh, oh, no.
00:35:09 Yeah. I was just like, well, it's a good thing I never go to the beach.
00:35:12 And now I definitely never will ever in my life.
00:35:16 Oh, no, that sucks so bad.
00:35:19 Dude, it was like the worst.
00:35:21 It's like, oh, man, like, please, no, let's not do that ever.
00:35:27 I'll see if I can find the link and put it in the show notes.
00:35:29 But it was it was pretty fucking bad.
00:35:33 That's pretty cringe, dude.
00:35:35 Yikes. OK.
00:35:37 I mean, a little bit more Chad than slavery,
00:35:39 but it definitely is pretty close to the bottom of our.
00:35:42 It's it's it's yeah, it's a little more Chad and a little less Virgin,
00:35:47 but it's still pretty cringe. Yeah, that's definitely not good.
00:35:50 Definitely not good.
00:35:53 I'm that I've watched like some shitty YouTube video one time.
00:35:58 It's like, oh, top 10, like stupid deaths.
00:36:01 And one of them was like a guy bet his friend to eat a slug.
00:36:06 And the guy ate the slug.
00:36:08 But the slug had like, oops, the slug had a brain parasite in it.
00:36:11 And he got a brain parasite and it ate his brain.
00:36:14 What a fool. What a nerd.
00:36:16 Like, he really fucking lost the the Darwin award.
00:36:20 Won the Darwin awards that and I'm like, oh, my God, a brain parasite.
00:36:23 I'm going to cry.
00:36:24 I'm going to cry just thinking about it.
00:36:26 I'm so upsetting.
00:36:27 I found the thing I never ate a slug.
00:36:29 Yeah, probably not a good idea.
00:36:32 At the very least, if you have to eat a slug, at the very least cook it.
00:36:38 Cook your food, God damn it.
00:36:41 Yeah. Also, don't and don't make slugs your food.
00:36:45 I would recommend I was looking through.
00:36:49 I was I was trolling through Twitter a little bit last night trying to see
00:36:53 if like there were any pictures of the march yesterday that I was in.
00:36:55 I didn't find any, but I might go through again today
00:36:59 and see if anyone posted any like late pictures that have me in them.
00:37:04 I did take a few of my own, but like it's a little cringe.
00:37:07 You're like, haha, I took a selfie. Like, haha.
00:37:09 No, no, I need to let I need to let someone else do it for.
00:37:11 Yeah, if you do it, you're just like, you know, trying to get attention.
00:37:16 But if someone else did it, it's just evidence that you were powerful.
00:37:20 That's right.
00:37:21 But I stood up for justice. Exactly.
00:37:24 Oh, man.
00:37:28 J.K. Rowling's back.
00:37:30 Oh, back with she's back with more turf shit.
00:37:33 Really? Yeah.
00:37:35 Just doubling down, just doubling down her old shit.
00:37:38 That's really the only move you have to make once you're in her position, I suppose.
00:37:42 It's it's that or apologize and, you know,
00:37:47 I think it's just like at this point,
00:37:49 there's just so much bad blood that apologizing would lead to nothing.
00:37:52 Like no one no one would care.
00:37:54 They would still be mad.
00:37:55 So she's probably just like, you know, well, I don't really feel sorry.
00:37:58 So I'm just going to double down.
00:37:59 You know what? No, I don't agree.
00:38:01 I think if at this point J.K. Rowling like really like
00:38:06 looked into matters, decided she was wrong.
00:38:10 Like like like understood, like understood the point,
00:38:15 like understood why being a turf is bad and then came out and was like,
00:38:19 hey, guys, I was really messed up.
00:38:21 The stuff I said was wrong.
00:38:23 I got bad information and I had some like, you know, bad ideas
00:38:28 that I needed to like get over and understand why they were wrong.
00:38:31 But now I've done it and I've completely changed my tune
00:38:34 and I renounce everything.
00:38:35 I think she'd be a fucking hero.
00:38:37 I think everyone would be people would be like dancing in the streets with
00:38:41 that people like, oh, we.
00:38:42 Yeah, I do.
00:38:43 Like people would people wouldn't have to like people were so upset about
00:38:47 they're like, oh, we millennials sure do love Harry Potter.
00:38:51 And oh, but now our now our fave is problematic.
00:38:54 Like, oh, I guess that I guess people our age would definitely
00:38:57 cut her some slack just because of Harry Potter.
00:39:01 The millennia.
00:39:02 Oh, the Zoomers probably would.
00:39:04 The Zoomers would not.
00:39:04 They don't give a shit.
00:39:06 They would. That's true.
00:39:07 That's true.
00:39:10 OK, like obviously some people would never forgive it,
00:39:13 but I think a lot of people would and I think a lot of people want to forgive Joe
00:39:17 and would take any opportunity they could.
00:39:21 But, you know, she's just she's not interested in that.
00:39:26 Kanye West is running for president.
00:39:28 Incredible.
00:39:29 You see that?
00:39:30 Yeah.
00:39:32 That sucks.
00:39:35 Well, it's pretty amazing.
00:39:36 I don't know. I don't know.
00:39:37 Twenty twenty year that just keeps giving, you know,
00:39:40 there's always something new to look forward to.
00:39:42 I don't know if I think that like more if that's is that going to split
00:39:47 the Biden vote or the Trump vote more?
00:39:51 I don't really know.
00:39:52 I think it'll probably it'll probably affect them both relatively equally,
00:39:56 I would assume, right, because nobody really knows where Kanye stands at this
00:40:00 point, because he was like on Trump's dick for a while.
00:40:03 And then it was like, ha, ha, I deceived all of you.
00:40:06 So it's like, that's so fucking stupid.
00:40:08 Do you know what's true?
00:40:09 What's false?
00:40:10 Nobody knows.
00:40:12 I was only pretending to like, is he really like, you know,
00:40:16 like a Bible thumper kind of guy?
00:40:17 Is he really into God or is that a lie, too?
00:40:20 We just don't know.
00:40:21 Well, the conservative Christians want to go with the guy
00:40:25 who's talking about God, but it also, you know, not white.
00:40:29 Like we just, it's there's so many questions.
00:40:33 I don't know.
00:40:33 I don't know.
00:40:34 I I I think it'll probably cut pretty hard both ways, but also probably
00:40:39 not very much at all.
00:40:42 And it won't matter.
00:40:44 It's fine.
00:40:45 It's fine.
00:40:46 It's fine.
00:40:46 It's fine.
00:40:47 I'm just saying, I don't give a shit.
00:40:49 Kanye versus Trump would be.
00:40:51 Did you?
00:40:52 I mean, would would you not like, I feel like, OK, if Biden, if something
00:40:57 happens and Biden can't like be on the ticket or whatever, or just like
00:41:00 becomes irrelevant and it just ends up being endgame Kanye West versus
00:41:05 Donald Trump 2020, like 50 years from now in the history.exe tablet
00:41:10 because books will be destroyed with this point.
00:41:12 It'll just be like the end of politics in America.
00:41:14 This is when it'll happen.
00:41:15 Like this is when like politics literally just died and reality TV is politics
00:41:20 because it's just like the system has completely broken down at that point.
00:41:24 Yeah.
00:41:26 Yeah, being a little bit.
00:41:28 I mean, it would just kind of be a continuation.
00:41:31 It wouldn't even be that shocking anymore.
00:41:34 No, that's the whole thing.
00:41:35 That's kind of like reinforces the point.
00:41:37 It's like, if Kanye West versus Donald Trump, like would you be surprised?
00:41:40 You'd be like, mm-hmm.
00:41:42 Did did you see did you see Kanye?
00:41:45 I think it was this week tweet out like this like emotional tweet.
00:41:50 It's like, I'm so proud of, you know, my beautiful, gorgeous wife.
00:41:58 Cart Kim or what it right?
00:42:00 I'm so proud.
00:42:01 I'm so proud of my wife, Kim.
00:42:03 She's officially a billionaire.
00:42:05 I love her.
00:42:06 And, you know, I knew she could do it, right?
00:42:08 And like, and there was like a little like artsy little photo.
00:42:11 He made a little collage for whatever.
00:42:14 And it's like, dude, you fucking monster.
00:42:18 I hate you.
00:42:20 I hate your wife.
00:42:21 Read the fucking room.
00:42:22 You miserable piece of shit.
00:42:24 You are a fucking moron and I cannot fucking stand you in the slightest.
00:42:29 You are a blight.
00:42:30 Oh, it made me so it made me so fucking mad.
00:42:33 Like it would make me mad.
00:42:35 Like if that were true, it would make me mad.
00:42:37 And I'm sure it is true.
00:42:38 That fact alone makes me true.
00:42:40 But the fact that he like thinks that he should tweet it and be like, yes,
00:42:44 this is a cause for celebration.
00:42:46 It's like, just kill yourself.
00:42:47 Like just die.
00:42:48 That's just like the bourgeois version of getting a million subscribers.
00:42:52 You know, they're just that's the kind of excitement of the lists.
00:42:55 I feel like even under normal circumstances, it's gauche to be like,
00:42:59 guys, my wife's officially a billionaire.
00:43:01 Like fuck off.
00:43:03 Like I've seen I've seen YouTube channels be like, hey, guys, listen,
00:43:07 like I've seen them embarrassed to make the announcement that they have like
00:43:12 paid off their student loans, right?
00:43:14 But like they're not poor anymore, right?
00:43:16 Like that's embarrassing for some people to ask.
00:43:18 Like like that's the kind of situation we're in.
00:43:21 And then you take your con and you're like, dude, I gotta let everyone know
00:43:24 I'm already a billionaire, but now I don't know.
00:43:27 My wife is one, too.
00:43:28 This is they're all going to be so fucking happy for me.
00:43:31 It's so gross.
00:43:32 If your wife is so fucking gross, if you're a billionaire and you're married
00:43:36 to your wife, isn't she automatically a billionaire by like default?
00:43:40 Um, I think, um, I mean, I think some people don't have joint accounts, right?
00:43:47 Connie is like, I got to keep my shit safe.
00:43:49 I don't even trust her.
00:43:50 I mean, maybe I guess, I guess like generally it's considered that
00:43:54 when you, if you get divorced, like you split your ass, you split assets 50 50.
00:43:58 But if like maybe they have a prenup where that's not the case or maybe they
00:44:02 just have like split accounts.
00:44:04 So like, even though that is the case, like, I guess it's probably just
00:44:07 to her business, they're not, they're not evaluated at a billion dollars,
00:44:10 like they're not, they're not technically her assets yet or something or whatever.
00:44:16 These are questions that I've never had to contemplate and never will.
00:44:20 It's, it doesn't matter.
00:44:22 Like, uh, I saw, I saw a tweet from this guy.
00:44:29 Um, I think his name is Benjamin Dixon, sort of like a political guy.
00:44:34 He shows up on CBS sometimes.
00:44:37 He shows up on the news every once in a while.
00:44:39 He's a fucking good socialist boy and he made like a tweet.
00:44:42 It was like crying emoji.
00:44:43 And it was like that face when you got it, that face when you got it.
00:44:47 Oh, what was it?
00:44:48 Like you, you got to like, I'm going to misquote it.
00:44:53 But it was like when you, you got to criticize hip hop because hip hop is
00:44:57 like all about that grind and hip hop idolizes capitalism and just says,
00:45:01 if you're poor, you're just not working hard enough.
00:45:04 And I was like, yeah, that sounds about right.
00:45:06 That sounds about right.
00:45:07 And Kanye is also like that.
00:45:10 Kanye is all about the brag rap.
00:45:13 I mean, not exclusively.
00:45:14 He does sad raps too.
00:45:16 I mean, he's kind of his own beast, I guess, but he does, but he brags about
00:45:20 his money like a lot of people do.
00:45:22 And I hate that shit.
00:45:23 I hate it so much.
00:45:25 Uh, uh, uh, I hate, I hate that, uh, I hate that there's a certain segment
00:45:30 of the population that doesn't think you should be embarrassed to be a billionaire.
00:45:33 Those people are cringe.
00:45:35 They are the problem.
00:45:37 They are, uh, uh, uh, I hate them.
00:45:39 I hate them.
00:45:40 I just hate them.
00:45:41 It sucks.
00:45:41 It just seems like even if you are proud to be a billionaire, not something
00:45:45 you should probably be saying right now, considering the social political climate.
00:45:50 You might want to keep that in the back pocket for now.
00:45:52 What is it?
00:45:53 Like, like, um, you know, like form, like, is it four million people are
00:45:57 unemployed right now?
00:45:58 And like something it's saying like that, but, and that the, like, there's
00:46:01 another statistic, like it's like, like the top, like the top 1% has like
00:46:06 increased its wealth by like, uh, you know, 25%.
00:46:11 Like, like, like some, like some vast amount of money has moved itself from
00:46:16 ownership of like the proletariat to like the hyper elite bourgeoisie.
00:46:21 Like this is, this is just a fact.
00:46:23 The nor the normal flow of capital has only increased the normal flow of
00:46:27 capitalism, which like, you know, they did the cares act, which like did all the
00:46:31 like extra, um, um, uh, unemployment benefits for people losing their jobs,
00:46:35 which was good, but like a much bigger part of the cares act was just bailouts
00:46:40 for corporations and, and stuff reverse the bunch of tax laws.
00:46:44 So like all the, the tax money they would normally lose, they'd get back.
00:46:48 Yeah.
00:46:48 So, you know, that, that happens.
00:46:53 Yeah.
00:46:54 It's just the system doing what it does best.
00:46:56 And it's like, Oh, but like all this money is going to the poor.
00:46:58 It's like, yeah, but the federal reserve just creating this money.
00:47:01 So it's not like it's anything's being redistributed.
00:47:04 They're just making new money, giving it to you, but they're also making
00:47:07 your money less valuable because of the natural result of inflation of adding
00:47:11 trillions of dollars to the economy.
00:47:13 And so longterm, you're, it's just the billionaires making out like bandits
00:47:19 again, and it's like your pittance is worth less with every dollar they
00:47:23 print every month to keep you substantiate you.
00:47:26 They threw us a bone, but they threw the people that own your asses away
00:47:31 bigger bone.
00:47:32 So like you appreciate the bone, but like understand that they are fucking us.
00:47:38 A lot.
00:47:39 It's like they serve, they serve the bourgeois, they're, they're a silver
00:47:42 platter dinner and then threw us the scrap once it was done.
00:47:45 Yeah, that's exactly, that's exactly it.
00:47:47 That's exactly what they did.
00:47:49 Most of it went to them.
00:47:50 They try to obfuscate it so you don't realize that you're just getting
00:47:54 table scraps.
00:47:55 It's like, Oh, Donald Trump cares about me.
00:47:57 He personally signed my check.
00:47:58 He's $1,200.
00:47:59 Dude, what a piece of shit.
00:48:01 He personally signed the check.
00:48:02 I can't, that's fucking funny.
00:48:04 That's just fucking funny.
00:48:05 Donald Trump, funny guy.
00:48:07 Kind of like him, honestly.
00:48:08 Four more years, MAGA.
00:48:11 Clip that, clip that, put it everywhere.
00:48:13 Hashtag canceled and saying it's happening.
00:48:17 Hey, I actually have to pee all of a sudden.
00:48:20 I've been drinking coconut milk and coffee.
00:48:22 Do you want to spit, do you want to ad lib for a minute?
00:48:25 Sure, I'll try.
00:48:26 Freestyle, lay down a beat.
00:48:28 All right, I'm not doing that.
00:48:30 Not, not in these sensitive times with race relations, am I going to try
00:48:34 and appropriate black culture?
00:48:36 No, this is going to be a perfect time for an ad segment.
00:48:39 Hey, guys, you're listening to this on Spotify or some podcast platform.
00:48:44 And you're like, man, the procrastinators are not uploading on YouTube anymore.
00:48:47 And since the procrastinators aren't uploaded on YouTube, I literally
00:48:50 have no reason to go on YouTube.
00:48:52 Well, worry not, because I have continued the hyperbolic wine chamber,
00:48:56 my own personal podcast that I used to do on the procrastinators channel,
00:49:00 on its own channel, and it uploads three times a week.
00:49:05 So if you are just like, man, I really wish I could get the best PCP member
00:49:09 me to be more active and do more things and be on YouTube.
00:49:13 So I don't have to tab over to Spotify or wherever, because it's just so much
00:49:17 fucking work and I'm a lazy zoomer and I've just been conditioned by easy
00:49:21 fucking internet culture.
00:49:23 We'll just go on over to search hyperbolic wine chamber on YouTube
00:49:27 and you'll get podcasts three times a week.
00:49:29 And do it.
00:49:30 Do it. It'll be fun.
00:49:31 It'll be a good time.
00:49:32 And if you're a patron, you get early access a week early and you can get
00:49:36 the 50 episodes of the bonus podcast where you get to decide what the topics
00:49:39 are every week.
00:49:41 Do it.
00:49:42 Wait, Tom, did I just leave to go pee and I come back and you've
00:49:46 taken the opportunity to plug yourself?
00:49:48 Yeah, it was an ad segment.
00:49:49 Why don't you go plug your yourself?
00:49:54 When you shove it up your asshole is what I'm saying.
00:49:57 Sure.
00:49:58 That's OK.
00:49:59 That's fair.
00:50:00 OK, cool.
00:50:01 All right.
00:50:01 That's fair.
00:50:01 Considering pretty bad.
00:50:05 Hey, funny story.
00:50:08 I was we were taught.
00:50:08 OK, about the unemployment thing and the cares act, right?
00:50:12 It was called the cares act cute acronym.
00:50:15 They're doing they're doing like another one that I guess they're still
00:50:18 debating the like the minutiae of and this one is called the heroes act.
00:50:24 Very cute acronym cringe.
00:50:26 I saw I saw another one.
00:50:29 This was a story about like, oh, I might be misremembering the details.
00:50:33 I think it was that like a law was passed.
00:50:38 Criminalizing hair discrimination in the sense of like.
00:50:45 You can't discriminate in some place in their hairstyle.
00:50:47 The idea being that like black people wear their hair differently and you
00:50:50 can't like you can't discriminate for jobs based on that, right?
00:50:54 OK, which is fine.
00:50:56 But this this act, it was called the crown act, as in like the crown of the head.
00:51:02 And I'm like, how are all these fucking pieces of legislation have these cute
00:51:06 ass acronyms like they fucking get away with it?
00:51:10 I think they're just like like 90 percent of the time and effort is put
00:51:15 into thinking up a cute little acronym for it, because they know that's how
00:51:18 like people will read it in headlines and it's like the name's really important.
00:51:21 That's how we get public support.
00:51:23 I do think that maybe there is a there is a certain amount of effort
00:51:26 that you have to spend.
00:51:27 It's like, yeah, you can write up a really good piece of legislation,
00:51:31 you know, and like maybe make it, you know, work on like, oh, is it bipartisan enough?
00:51:35 Like, will it pass the Senate and Congress or whatever?
00:51:38 Like, OK, it was a good, good, good.
00:51:39 But also, does it have a really catchy nickname so that people will know what it is
00:51:44 and remember it and it'll like get people talking about it, right?
00:51:47 It'll make it sound better, you know, like, yeah, if it was just like
00:51:51 government stimulus four, seven, six, three, that's like cold and uncaring.
00:51:55 But if it's the CARES Act, I cared about the HEROES Act.
00:52:00 I'm a hero.
00:52:01 I'm working hard out in covid and I'm not getting paid any extra money.
00:52:06 Nobody cares, but but I'm a hero.
00:52:09 And that's what this bill says.
00:52:10 So I'm OK with it.
00:52:12 I will vote yes for the HEROES Act.
00:52:13 I will vote yes for Donald Trump in 2020, CAG.
00:52:18 I just love it.
00:52:20 You know, I just love just MAGA and CAG.
00:52:23 They're just fun to say, you know, they got that marketing down.
00:52:26 Yeah. Yeah. CARES Act, HEROES Act, Crown Act.
00:52:30 Yes, please. How could you vote no on any of these things?
00:52:34 Names are important. Names are important.
00:52:37 At the very least, I wouldn't have even remembered that that hair thing,
00:52:41 except that it was called the Crown Act.
00:52:44 And I just thought that was so that was so funny.
00:52:47 Tisk, tisk. Mm hmm.
00:52:49 Mm hmm.
00:52:50 Um, what else?
00:52:53 What else is going on? What else is going on in the world today?
00:52:56 Oh, God, the world is just a fucked up, weird place right now.
00:53:01 Sure, sure. It's good, good, good times.
00:53:06 I don't know about that.
00:53:06 I don't know if I can agree with you on that much.
00:53:09 You know, being a little facetious, a little facetious there, but it's OK.
00:53:16 I'm still trying to do 3D printing.
00:53:17 3D printed a couple more things. It's pretty cool.
00:53:21 I can't wait to make a model that I'll actually be able to 3D print.
00:53:23 I have this great idea for this cool, like diorama print
00:53:26 I want to make with all my characters based off a splash page of a comic
00:53:30 that I'm thinking of also doing. Oh, it'll be cool.
00:53:32 What do you mean a diorama print? What does that mean?
00:53:35 Well, basically, the idea is like there's like I'm working on an Izumi project
00:53:40 and like the last page is like this big single illustration
00:53:43 of like these two characters facing each other down.
00:53:46 And I'm thinking like if I take that and like print it,
00:53:49 you could have like a full like a little diorama of this,
00:53:51 because it's just going to be a 3D environment and two 3D characters.
00:53:54 So you just put that in a little slicer, then I can print that page out in 3D
00:53:59 and then have a full like 3D physical version of the last page of a comic book.
00:54:04 And I just think that's pretty cool.
00:54:06 And I want to try and do that. Hold on.
00:54:08 What do you mean by 3D exactly?
00:54:11 So like I'm going to I do like 3D models, right?
00:54:14 Yeah, that's like my art now. I do like 3D.
00:54:17 Yeah. So if I'm doing a, do you mean it's like Magic Eye?
00:54:21 No, no, I mean, like literally 3D print it.
00:54:23 So it's like a three dimensional sculpture.
00:54:26 Oh, God. Wait, how big would it be?
00:54:29 The printer doesn't print super big.
00:54:31 I think it can print up to like an eight by eight cube.
00:54:37 OK, it would be really funny if you were like,
00:54:39 it's going to be a Magic Eye, you can hang it up.
00:54:44 Well, now you've given me the idea.
00:54:46 I wasn't sure if you meant that it was like that 90s kid money.
00:54:48 I wasn't sure if you meant that it was like stereoscopic 3D, like red and blue,
00:54:52 you know, or if it was like, you know, 3D, as in like it's 3D sculptures, right?
00:54:57 As in it's like rendered, like rendered.
00:55:00 3D is used in so many variations now, you can never be sure.
00:55:04 Right. Right. People do that on Twitter.
00:55:06 Like there are guys like you can you can do stereoscopic 3D renders.
00:55:10 So like it'll render the thing twice.
00:55:14 And then if you like squint your eyes, it'll make it look like popping out at you
00:55:18 because of the way like your eyes work and how like there's a slight bit of separation.
00:55:22 And so there are people who are like, we'll just upload to Twitter,
00:55:24 like 3D models, like a turnaround.
00:55:27 But like two of them slightly off center from each other.
00:55:30 So if you so you like cross your eyes and yeah, it merges into one thing
00:55:34 and it pops out of the screen at you.
00:55:36 And I'm like, whoa, space age tech right there.
00:55:39 The future is now permanently fucking up my eyesight
00:55:42 just to have this pseudo 3D effect on Twitter.com.
00:55:45 Hell yeah.
00:55:46 Ah, man.
00:55:49 It's cool. Too bad.
00:55:51 Too bad the world is broken.
00:55:52 Arts. Art sucks, dude. Art sucks.
00:55:55 What a waste of time. No, no.
00:55:57 What a fucking boring. I mean, it is a waste of time
00:55:59 and it is boring and it is gay, but it's still pretty. Thank you.
00:56:02 Thank you. You're right.
00:56:04 No, I agree with everything, but not that.
00:56:06 That's not cool. Nothing is cool.
00:56:08 Everything's fringe.
00:56:09 It's boring and it's gay and being cool is impossible.
00:56:12 So therefore, boring and gay is all that's left.
00:56:14 See, if you put if you put art on our cube grid, you know, our chart,
00:56:19 it is it is all the way in the cringe.
00:56:20 It's cringe, virgin and smooth brain.
00:56:26 It's smooth. I don't know if it's smooth brain.
00:56:28 It's not smooth brain. You have to get smooth brain.
00:56:31 No, I think caring about art is smooth brain,
00:56:34 but being able to do art itself,
00:56:36 you got to be kind of not smooth brain to do it.
00:56:38 It takes like effort, you know?
00:56:41 But like it's in that corner so much in like the cringe corner
00:56:44 that it like punctures through until like, you know,
00:56:46 a parallel universe Mario 64 style and now it starts becoming based.
00:56:51 No, that's just that's that's the
00:56:54 that's like the death rattle of someone who's so cringe
00:56:59 that they can't that they know they're never coming back.
00:57:01 Oh, no, I'm actually so cringy that I circle around and being basic again.
00:57:05 No, no, you're just an idiot.
00:57:07 You're just a fucking nerd and you can't escape from that.
00:57:10 You're in the fucking cringe basement and I've locked the door
00:57:13 and you'll never come out to the people.
00:57:16 It's leave a comment below.
00:57:17 Oh, wait, you can't.
00:57:18 We're not uploading this to YouTube.
00:57:21 And absolutely pathetic.
00:57:24 I bet they look to you.
00:57:25 I bet they. Oh, can I can I can I scroll down the.
00:57:27 Oh, oh, no, because I'm listening to this on.
00:57:31 Wait, is it on Spotify?
00:57:34 Because I'm listening to this on the procrastinators podcast dot com.
00:57:37 And such a thing is impossible.
00:57:40 Yes. Alas, someday the site will be worth going to.
00:57:44 Maybe. I mean, it's worth going to.
00:57:47 It's worth going to right now because it's where the podcast.
00:57:49 It's worth going to if you just want to see a list of the fucking things
00:57:55 and also see, oh, I see that.
00:57:58 Wait. Oh, I see that this is like this is something
00:58:03 that I would not have noticed in the description before.
00:58:07 But there's a link here to a video by Oblivion Fall
00:58:11 saying like how to like have good audio quality for.
00:58:14 I forgot that was there.
00:58:15 Yeah, I forgot that was the thing.
00:58:17 But I see it pop up on the website because like of the way it like handles links or whatever.
00:58:22 We also have this really aesthetic plant.
00:58:25 With a nice bouquet background.
00:58:29 Where you go to the website, it's right there.
00:58:31 Did I like the header image for some reason.
00:58:33 Did I did I tell you about the aloe?
00:58:35 Did I mention the aloe about about how I got sunburn yesterday and my
00:58:40 and I needed like aloe to rub on it and my roommate has an aloe plant.
00:58:44 And he just like cut one of the leaves off and gave it to me.
00:58:47 And I just had to like squeeze the leaf and like squeeze all the goo out of it
00:58:51 and just like rub it on my body.
00:58:54 Just raw.
00:58:55 And, you know, I was disappointed.
00:58:57 Is a little slime adjacent, do you think?
00:59:00 Aloe is aloe is just full of slime.
00:59:03 It's just full of slime.
00:59:06 It's kind of true.
00:59:07 But here's the thing.
00:59:08 Have you ever had like an aloe drink?
00:59:12 A few times.
00:59:13 Not exactly my favorite thing, but I like this.
00:59:16 I like them a lot.
00:59:17 So I was like, well, I'm going to taste with this raw aloe taste like.
00:59:20 And I was like, maybe it'll be a little sweet, but probably not.
00:59:23 It'll probably just kind of taste like grass, because I know that like,
00:59:27 you know, they add sugar and stuff to an aloe drink.
00:59:29 I didn't think it would taste like the drink.
00:59:30 Turns out it tastes so bad.
00:59:33 It actually it actually tastes like you're like biting
00:59:37 into like an aspirin pill or something.
00:59:40 It's that bad and bitter legendary person known for
00:59:47 not endorsing eating slugs, but consumes aloe of his own volition.
00:59:52 It's a plant. Yeah, it's a fucking plant.
00:59:54 Yeah, it's like, oh, boy, what wacky.
00:59:57 Like, oh, what did you what did you find?
00:59:59 Like a we just plucked a fruit off a tree and ate it.
01:00:02 Like, boy, what a what a crazy thing to do.
01:00:05 It could. It could have a fucking brain.
01:00:07 You know, Miba in a dude you never know.
01:00:08 You're you're right. You're technically right.
01:00:12 Look, I just wanted to taste it.
01:00:14 And you know what? I did. And I'm not sorry.
01:00:17 But aloe is very much slime adjacent.
01:00:19 It is an extremely slimy plant.
01:00:23 And you know what? I think it might have worked.
01:00:25 I think rubbing its blood all over me actually helps
01:00:27 because I don't feel too sunburny.
01:00:30 It's pretty killer. It's pretty killer.
01:00:32 Yeah, cutting something open and rubbing its medicinal blood all over you.
01:00:36 It was just like, you know, it had it was slime time,
01:00:38 like just like in slime and punishment, you know, the cop killer
01:00:41 has got to have his slime time and I had it and it was based.
01:00:47 Do you want to go to voice? Do you want to go voicemails?
01:00:49 Yeah, we've we've done an hour.
01:00:51 We've done our due diligence.
01:00:52 I think so. I think so.
01:00:54 Speakpipe.com, my friends, if you want to stick it to the man
01:00:58 and leave a voicemail, even though we should be paying for it, but aren't.
01:01:02 Speakpipe.com slash PCP voicemail.
01:01:07 And hey, maybe go to the procrastinatorspodcast.com
01:01:09 and check out that informational video by Oblivionfall
01:01:12 about how to get good audio quality if you want to impress us.
01:01:18 All right. So first one we got this week is from Send Ducking Help Motherfuckers.
01:01:25 That's a big ask.
01:01:26 Yeah, I wouldn't count on it, frankly.
01:01:30 But let's see what he has to say. All right.
01:01:32 Three, two, one, go.
01:01:36 I did a blunt, two dabs, a round of pipes,
01:01:40 Jameson, whiskey, bourbon, beer.
01:01:45 I did everything under the fucking sun except the toad.
01:01:48 And now I'm out of work, motherfuckers.
01:01:51 Send fucking help.
01:01:54 Send fucking help, motherfucker.
01:02:00 Oh, OK.
01:02:02 So that's just starting out strong today.
01:02:05 Was that riddle my ass?
01:02:07 That sounds like riddle my ass.
01:02:08 I think that was just riddle my ass, Batman being drunk at work
01:02:12 and calling it just miss messaging the voicemail.
01:02:16 You know, sorry, I think it's too late.
01:02:19 This was sent six days ago.
01:02:20 Sticking to the band, though, I appreciate.
01:02:22 I respect the the effort, you know, absolutely.
01:02:26 We need to unionize and get ever when everyone
01:02:29 the the constitutional right to be drunk at work, I think, you know,
01:02:32 that's construction workers, you know, truckers, Uber drivers.
01:02:39 I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
01:02:41 What's the worst that could happen?
01:02:42 Why it it's a human right.
01:02:44 I just think it's a human right. That's all.
01:02:46 All right. Another one for riddle my ass, Batman, halfway sober this time.
01:02:51 This one's 50 seconds long, so I might get bored.
01:02:53 But let's let's find out three, two, one, go.
01:02:58 Hey, PCP, two things.
01:03:01 One, if you played the help me, motherfucker, I need help kind of video.
01:03:07 That was not a joke.
01:03:09 I really was fucking obliterated.
01:03:13 We could tell.
01:03:15 We know. And second.
01:03:20 I'm still lying over.
01:03:21 And second, I'm thinking about doing a comic
01:03:25 like in a comic.
01:03:26 So for the drawboys out there, I have a question.
01:03:30 Yeah, like, would a.
01:03:33 Comic about the riddle my ass Batman series be a good idea?
01:03:38 And so where do I post it?
01:03:40 How do I go about that?
01:03:42 This question is too long.
01:03:44 Sorry. Awesome. It's fine.
01:03:45 It's thank you. All right.
01:03:48 Well, we just had a long discussion about how art is gay and the worst thing ever.
01:03:52 So my answer is definitely yes, do it.
01:03:54 If you, I mean, if you want to do it, then that means you should do it.
01:04:00 So like, that's it.
01:04:01 Like, that's the beginning and the end of answering the question for me.
01:04:04 Do it if you want.
01:04:06 Wanting to do it is all the reason you need room where to post it.
01:04:11 I mean, what do you think?
01:04:15 Where do I mean?
01:04:16 You know, there's a you can post it on like to pass web web web web
01:04:21 tune, tapas, posts, I would definitely put it on Twitter and at
01:04:26 yeah, people. Yeah.
01:04:28 So that's a good way of discovery.
01:04:29 And then you can have the full thing on something like to pass or web
01:04:32 tune or shit. Yeah. Yeah.
01:04:33 Post it and all posted like on every platform you can
01:04:37 and on everywhere you post it link to all the other ones, right?
01:04:41 Yep. Like that's that's how you.
01:04:44 You got it. You got to break.
01:04:45 You got to break your way in somehow and you might as well
01:04:48 just do the biggest all out like social media blitz you can.
01:04:52 There's no reason not to.
01:04:55 Yeah, post it everywhere.
01:04:56 That's the answer.
01:04:57 OK, next one is from a new bit.
01:05:01 Three, two, one, go.
01:05:05 What's up, game?
01:05:06 It's just got back from the gym.
01:05:07 Ready for another Daily Q&A first question this week.
01:05:12 Fuck yeah.
01:05:13 If podcasts only come out every week, how will you do a Daily Q&A?
01:05:19 What's something about like dog?
01:05:23 God, this lost all its momentum.
01:05:25 Wow. You can tell these new with this.
01:05:27 That's OK. It wasn't very funny.
01:05:29 Come back next day for another Daily Q&A.
01:05:34 God, fuck. Oh, God, you had me.
01:05:36 You had me so high.
01:05:37 Damn, that was it.
01:05:39 It was like that was a huge drop off.
01:05:41 It was like a vertical drop.
01:05:43 This video this this voicemail was designed to be like, dude,
01:05:46 we're in for a treat now.
01:05:47 I like, oh, where's it coming?
01:05:48 What's going to be the punchline? Oh, nothing.
01:05:50 Oh, I lost the thread. Oh, what am I?
01:05:52 Sorry, I made this voicemail, guys. Goodbye.
01:05:55 Close, though, close.
01:05:56 He had he had it.
01:05:57 All he had to do was ride that wave to the end.
01:06:00 He couldn't he couldn't stick the landing as the person who invented the Q&A.
01:06:05 My potential.
01:06:06 But you got to you got to spend more time in the gym,
01:06:09 both working out and working on your bit.
01:06:11 Tom invented the Q&A like George Lucas invented shot reverse shot.
01:06:16 Exactly. Every time you use it.
01:06:17 You have to pay for our time.
01:06:21 Speaking of the gym.
01:06:23 Well, today, you know, I got walking around Boston yesterday, marching.
01:06:28 I got more exercise than I got than I've gotten in months.
01:06:32 Maybe I wonder if now is the time to capitalize on my like
01:06:36 on my on my on my on my and crew of energy.
01:06:38 Yeah, because like you say you can't wait to go back to the gym.
01:06:42 I have no excuse because my gym is in my basement.
01:06:45 Will today be the day?
01:06:47 Probably not today.
01:06:48 Maybe tomorrow will tomorrow be the day.
01:06:50 It's not a good sign.
01:06:51 No next week.
01:06:52 Everybody. I know my feet hurt.
01:06:54 No, my feet hurt.
01:06:55 Oh, when I'm sunburned.
01:06:57 It hurts.
01:06:58 It's hot.
01:06:59 Oh, God, you're dropping rungs back into the cringe.
01:07:02 No, that's not true.
01:07:03 No, if I go down deep enough, I can circle back around and be based again.
01:07:07 No, I just get impossible, physically impossible,
01:07:10 conserving the law.
01:07:12 This universe operates according to a certain law,
01:07:15 and that law is known as the conservation of cringe or of base.
01:07:19 And and and and one one thing can only become cringe as something else become base.
01:07:25 You can't just you can't create baseness out of nothing.
01:07:29 Therefore, therefore, there's no such thing like like there must be a gradient.
01:07:32 You must follow an gradient.
01:07:34 OK, there's no fraction of reserve cringing in our system.
01:07:38 I don't think so.
01:07:39 How unfortunate.
01:07:40 I think if there was, we would have seen it by now, and they just we just don't
01:07:42 have the evidence. It's fair enough.
01:07:44 So next one is from Toa.
01:07:47 Three, two, one, go.
01:07:52 Hey, can I see your feet?
01:08:00 Can I see your feet?
01:08:05 You know, I was really hoping this is going to be a bionicle thing.
01:08:08 Totally let down completely couldn't be a bigger disappointment.
01:08:15 Toa, buddy.
01:08:18 Yeah, DM me restraining order is in the mail.
01:08:22 Also that OK, next one is from a message to Ben.
01:08:26 So this is going to be this is going to be a difficult boy.
01:08:30 This is going to be emotionally challenging.
01:08:32 So shame Ben's on on the podcast three, two, one, go.
01:08:37 Hey, Ben, three things.
01:08:39 Please stop using Twitter like Twitter is cringe, bro.
01:08:43 It only makes people sad or angry.
01:08:45 Second, it's not wrong.
01:08:47 You keep asking, what's the point?
01:08:49 There is no point.
01:08:50 There's no point to anything.
01:08:52 And that's a hundred percent base.
01:08:55 I know, man.
01:08:56 I stop saying so much.
01:08:58 You say like 20 times an episode, like every five minutes you make.
01:09:03 Oh, yeah.
01:09:09 And that's true.
01:09:12 Thank you. Love you.
01:09:13 But damn, right on all points, he absolutely demolished you.
01:09:16 In fact, I think he is right on all points.
01:09:21 Well, what was the first one?
01:09:23 Oh, stop using Twitter.
01:09:25 I know. Absolutely true.
01:09:27 I actually have kind of stopped using Twitter.
01:09:29 I haven't I've barely posted the last three days.
01:09:33 I've like made a couple of retweets, and that's about it.
01:09:40 I know. Yeah, whatever.
01:09:43 OK, yeah, he get he wins. He wins.
01:09:45 I lose. He wins.
01:09:46 OK, message to Ben, more like a message to base.
01:09:49 All right. Message received.
01:09:50 Message received episode of Steven Universe.
01:09:53 Next one is from Darren the Rad.
01:09:56 Three, two, one, go.
01:10:00 So I'm going to say something super controversial,
01:10:03 but video games are the worst hobby, fucking build shit.
01:10:10 Um, agreed, hard to agree.
01:10:15 I don't know.
01:10:16 They're the worst hobby, but they're definitely not productive.
01:10:19 I'll give you that for sure.
01:10:20 What does he mean by build shit?
01:10:23 Because like you could you could be technically building shit
01:10:25 if you're like building like model trains or something.
01:10:28 And like that's equally unproductive.
01:10:30 Like that also doesn't accomplish anything.
01:10:33 I guess I guess you could say you're you're kind of like
01:10:36 learning how to like, you know, construct things.
01:10:39 And I wouldn't say it's like super valuable.
01:10:43 I would say in terms of if like video games have zero percent value,
01:10:46 that's like one percent value.
01:10:48 If you wanted to, you could go and be like,
01:10:51 oh, video games improve your and hand-eye coordination.
01:10:53 That seems like a myth to me.
01:10:57 Well, that's how I feel about the, oh,
01:10:58 well, like you're learning to do construction
01:11:00 or you're learning how to push it together.
01:11:03 I think if you say build things, you mean like create something.
01:11:07 That makes more sense to me.
01:11:09 Like build like a business or a side hustle
01:11:11 or something like that, do something productive.
01:11:13 Even then, I wouldn't go so far as to say the video games are the worst.
01:11:18 I think there are plenty of equally pointless hobbies.
01:11:20 Oh, for sure. For sure.
01:11:22 But in essence, I agree.
01:11:26 The video games are the worst thing in the world.
01:11:29 And nobody and you shouldn't touch some of the ten foot pole.
01:11:31 They ruin my life.
01:11:33 Yeah.
01:11:36 Except a Pokemon showdown.
01:11:39 Fight me on Pokemon showdown.
01:11:40 There's exceptions to every rule. Of course, of course.
01:11:44 Next one is from lack of Ben solo cast makes Araylo sad.
01:11:49 Oh, I see what they're doing here.
01:11:50 I see. I get it. I get it.
01:11:53 Three, two, one, go.
01:11:55 Where is the Ben solo cast?
01:11:58 Ben St promised it.
01:12:00 He even said at one point it was a semi Ben solo cast.
01:12:02 But here we are without any conversation about the best Star Wars character.
01:12:07 Ben solo, please help us, Ben St.
01:12:10 You're our only hope.
01:12:12 Disney has left Ben solo out in the cold, only selling bad guy,
01:12:16 Kylo Ren merch, and yet we only have fans stuff to turn to.
01:12:21 And the promised Ben solo cast
01:12:24 still isn't even here.
01:12:29 Little like a little like Giggle at the end.
01:12:33 Yeah, I get it.
01:12:34 Funny, funny joke, funny pun.
01:12:37 The Ben solo cast was about it was going to happen today,
01:12:40 but then Tom joined at the last minute and ruined everything.
01:12:43 So I'm sorry.
01:12:44 Ralo is crying right now because of you, Tom.
01:12:47 You know, I'm proud.
01:12:48 It feels great. Fuck the Ralo's.
01:12:52 OK, there you go. I said it.
01:12:53 Cool. Well, there you have it, folks.
01:12:58 All right. Next one is PCP
01:13:01 diss track from Do Not Play
01:13:05 if there are less than three people on call at fuck you dot com.
01:13:11 Anyway, I'm going to play it three to one go.
01:13:16 I don't think you guys are ready for this.
01:13:19 OK, there's a link. There is a link.
01:13:23 I don't think. OK, I opened the link earlier
01:13:26 and it is it is like a four minute long song.
01:13:29 It is a it is an anti PCP diss track.
01:13:32 It is a it is, you know, it's laying the smack down on our asses.
01:13:37 I didn't listen to the whole thing
01:13:39 because this was like a minute before the podcast started.
01:13:41 But I will put the fucking link in the description
01:13:45 if you want to go and check it out.
01:13:46 This is this is from the this is from the the procrastinators anonymous.
01:13:52 The pro and on cast.
01:13:55 So it's on their channel.
01:13:56 They guess they wrote it.
01:13:58 They are criminals.
01:14:01 But I'm looking at it now.
01:14:04 My my face is not in the thumbnail,
01:14:06 so I would just have to assume that I am not being dissed.
01:14:09 The thumbnail is give give Nate, Jesse,
01:14:13 Munchie, me and Digi, and you're not in it.
01:14:16 So get fucked.
01:14:18 It just means I'm not.
01:14:19 They don't hate me.
01:14:21 Maybe that's that's how I'm going to that's stupid.
01:14:25 That's so fucking stupid.
01:14:28 From what from a little I've heard of the pro and on cast.
01:14:30 They stand me pretty hard over there.
01:14:32 Really? Yeah. Amazing.
01:14:36 Feels good. Why? Why?
01:14:37 I can't know why I don't get it.
01:14:40 Look a gift horse in the mouth.
01:14:41 What reason could they possibly have?
01:14:43 OK, whatever. As good as mine.
01:14:45 Stupid.
01:14:47 The next one is from Cool Skellon.
01:14:53 OK, this is this is a minute 30.
01:14:55 We're in for a long call on this one.
01:14:57 All right.
01:14:58 Well, we'll see. We'll see if it's worth the time.
01:15:00 All right. Three, two, one, go.
01:15:04 Hey, the progress, natives.
01:15:06 I just did a bit of a science experiment last night,
01:15:08 and I wanted y'all to know about it.
01:15:10 So I was just listening to a PCP episode 123.
01:15:16 I'm a bit behind, I know, but I'm getting there.
01:15:19 And I heard about, you know, when you're talking about,
01:15:24 oh, your phone just listens to you, right?
01:15:28 And it picks up advertising data that way, as opposed to I know this.
01:15:32 I know what he's going to say.
01:15:34 Gay and shitty and bad.
01:15:36 We use them and they're good.
01:15:38 But I last night for like 30 minutes, I was high as fuck, right?
01:15:43 And I was just I was monologuing at my phone about how much I want to see.
01:15:52 Cool skeletons, cool skeletons, skeletons with sunglasses,
01:15:59 skeletons on the beach with a margarita or perhaps one of those fucking
01:16:06 seagrams fruit, like beverages with alcohol, like a tiny, tiny,
01:16:11 like five percent alcohol, not even that kind of thing.
01:16:14 And we'll like a skeleton in a Hawaiian shirt, a skeleton in Ray Bands,
01:16:18 a cool fucking skeleton.
01:16:21 And I got it.
01:16:22 I got the skeleton.
01:16:25 I opened up Facebook the next day and it's a bunch of those personalized shirts.
01:16:31 But is it up like a like a.
01:16:35 Was that it?
01:16:36 Oh, I guess he got cut off.
01:16:39 Damn.
01:16:41 Sounds like the experiment was a success.
01:16:43 This happened to me recently as well.
01:16:44 I was congratulations on your cool skeleton.
01:16:47 Yeah, yeah, go on.
01:16:48 I was talking about how I was just talking to my sister about how I was like
01:16:52 having like a shitty time sleeping because she was kind of come over.
01:16:55 I had something I had to give her and my phone just immediately popped up
01:16:59 like 10 minutes later.
01:17:00 It's like five apps to help you sleep.
01:17:01 I'm like, oh, please never do that again.
01:17:04 Five, five, what?
01:17:05 Five apps to help you sleep better like a personalized.
01:17:08 So I immediately went in and turned off microphone access to all the apps.
01:17:12 I'm sure it doesn't actually work.
01:17:16 It makes me feel a little better.
01:17:18 Um, somebody.
01:17:19 Wait, it was someone on Twitter, someone on Twitter messaged me.
01:17:25 Oh, this guy, nobunty on Twitter said that listening to the PCP and hearing
01:17:31 me talk about gummies infected his Amazon recommendations.
01:17:35 And now he gets and now he gets his Amazon recommendations are full
01:17:39 of like Xanthan gum and stuff.
01:17:41 This is some fucked up shit.
01:17:43 Yeah, world gone mad.
01:17:45 Wait, wait, hold on.
01:17:46 Hold the phone.
01:17:47 Pause. Pause the podcast.
01:17:49 Wait, really? News.
01:17:50 OK. Oh my God.
01:17:51 Uh, before this podcast started, I put it up something on Twitter saying
01:17:55 I had a new T-shirt available, the Pixel Sunset T-shirt, because everyone
01:17:58 thought the background from Ninja Suffering was really cool.
01:18:01 So I made it an all over print T-shirt.
01:18:02 Two copies have already been sold.
01:18:04 Two shirts confirmed sold in the time this podcast has been recorded.
01:18:09 Oh, amazing.
01:18:11 Incredible. They're on Teespring.
01:18:13 These are Teespring all over prints. Teespring.com.
01:18:16 I am merch. There it is.
01:18:18 And it looks great.
01:18:18 It's aesthetic.
01:18:19 It took a long time to make the design because the way the template is
01:18:22 designed is really weird, but it's there.
01:18:24 It's cool. It's dope.
01:18:26 Success, dude.
01:18:27 Fucking sick.
01:18:29 Capitalism, I'm part of the problem.
01:18:31 Have you have you purchased a T from Teespring before?
01:18:35 I got a free sample from Teespring of one of my own items.
01:18:38 What did you think of it?
01:18:40 It was OK.
01:18:41 It wasn't like the best thing in the world, but I don't know.
01:18:44 I feel like everybody tells me that they think that Teespring's T-shirts are bad.
01:18:49 I have gotten like four T-shirts from them and I like them all.
01:18:54 I think they're actually pretty good.
01:18:56 I do. I do get I get like the the V-neck.
01:19:00 I get like the clap.
01:19:02 I get like the premium V-necks.
01:19:03 So maybe I'm getting like, you know, the choice, the choice cuts or whatever.
01:19:07 Well, they say they're bad.
01:19:08 Do they mean the quality of the print or the quality of the shirt?
01:19:13 I mean, I think.
01:19:15 Generally, I've heard people complain about the quality of the shirt.
01:19:20 More than the more than the print.
01:19:22 But I might have heard both.
01:19:23 I don't know.
01:19:25 Because I thought the print quality of what I got was not great.
01:19:28 It was good, but not great.
01:19:30 But I got I got a I got a hoodie and the hoodie was pretty comfortable.
01:19:34 I have not really had any big.
01:19:36 I think I think there was one shirt that I ordered for them with a print quality
01:19:40 was not great and the colors didn't come out quite as like vibrant as I hoped for.
01:19:45 But mostly it's been fine.
01:19:47 So I don't know.
01:19:48 I I still use for not using CMYK funds.
01:19:52 Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
01:19:54 I never do CMYK, even though I should.
01:19:57 Does that help?
01:19:59 I mean, CMYK is formatted specifically to be printed out in physical items
01:20:04 as opposed to being on screen.
01:20:06 That's why it exists, huh?
01:20:08 Interesting, neat, curious, very curious.
01:20:12 I went to college for graphic design.
01:20:15 That's how I know that.
01:20:17 Forty thousand dollars well spent for knowing about CMYK
01:20:21 and choosing not to use it anyway.
01:20:23 Yeah, cool.
01:20:25 Interesting, interesting.
01:20:26 OK, good to know.
01:20:27 I'm going to make a mental note of that.
01:20:31 So wait, we got we got one more.
01:20:34 This is another one from Margar, who called last week.
01:20:38 And I forget what they said.
01:20:39 But here, let's let's fucking do it.
01:20:41 They closed out the show last week, too.
01:20:42 They did. They did.
01:20:45 Weird.
01:20:46 I this was I think maybe this is their this is their M.O.
01:20:50 Maybe they just listened to the episode like a long time into the week
01:20:53 or they must just listen to the episodes at the right time on like a Saturday night.
01:20:57 That just must be their schedule and it lines up.
01:20:59 It's true. But OK, so here we go.
01:21:01 Three, two, one.
01:21:05 Either PCP.
01:21:07 I have a question about the state of the lectures that are yet to come out.
01:21:14 Because I know there are a few lectures that haven't been released yet.
01:21:18 And with the state of your YouTube channel and other circumstances,
01:21:23 do you plan to still release those on your YouTube channel?
01:21:27 If not, what's the plan for going into the future with the lectures?
01:21:36 I would assume they would all be continuing to be going off
01:21:39 by everyone's individual channels.
01:21:40 The only one who didn't do that was me, because a hippo.
01:21:44 Oh, yeah, hippo did, too, with the risk of lecture.
01:21:46 Fuck yeah, because like collectively those brought in like over two thousand
01:21:50 new subscribers to the PCP.
01:21:52 Um, I would assume that.
01:21:59 We were like, I think Digi was going to upload hers on the PCP channel.
01:22:05 I think that was the plan.
01:22:06 And so I would assume that, like.
01:22:11 I mean, best best case scenario, our videos get restored.
01:22:15 We post all the content that we have not been posting there, you know,
01:22:18 retroactively, and then we continue posting there.
01:22:22 And, you know, that lecture, for instance, goes up there.
01:22:25 I think Munchie was going to post his on the channel, too.
01:22:27 I'm not sure about that.
01:22:29 I'm not. I'm not a team player.
01:22:32 I'm I'm an asshole.
01:22:34 I'm I'm bow guarding mine.
01:22:36 I'm keeping it on my channel.
01:22:39 And the the OK, so that's the best case scenario.
01:22:45 Worst case scenario, I guess, would be that the videos never get restored.
01:22:49 But I think even in that case, we're still planning on, like, at some point,
01:22:53 just calling it a loss, calling in as many of the lost videos as we can from,
01:22:57 you know, people that might have them saved, reposting them and then,
01:23:01 you know, continuing to post anyway.
01:23:03 So I think in either case, yeah, the videos that we're going to go up
01:23:06 on the PCP channel will still be going up there.
01:23:11 So, yeah, that's the plan.
01:23:13 And it's mostly just a question of, like, when will we know?
01:23:17 What the plan is for the channel?
01:23:20 And the answer is whenever YouTube decides to do the thing,
01:23:26 it's been saying for a month that it's going to do and that they could do
01:23:30 in minutes, but there's the guy that it doesn't matter.
01:23:35 Dude, it makes me OK.
01:23:37 Let's let's close out this fucking episode of the roundabout YouTube.
01:23:40 It makes me so fucking mad that on Twitter,
01:23:44 they, like, answered me saying the channel has been terminated or,
01:23:48 like, no, they answered me saying, hey, the channel came back,
01:23:52 but the videos are still gone.
01:23:53 All our Radcon stuff is gone.
01:23:55 And they were like, give it give it 48 hours.
01:23:59 We already see the Radcon content back because of that one stream.
01:24:03 They saw that the one stream was was there and that it had the same word
01:24:07 in the name just assumed that that was what I was talking about.
01:24:10 And we're like, oh, no, no, no, OK, he's already wrong.
01:24:13 No, this idiot just doesn't know what's going on with his own channel.
01:24:16 Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the problem is fixed.
01:24:19 He just has to figure out that we already fix the problem.
01:24:21 This fucking idiot, like, no, no, they didn't fucking fix the problem.
01:24:25 And they don't care.
01:24:26 And and I. Oh, my fuck.
01:24:30 Like the fact that the fact that I know exactly and they had a little
01:24:33 fucking smiley face, I'm like, haha, silly, that's not real.
01:24:36 You just imagine that there's a problem.
01:24:38 We fixed everything. We haven't handled.
01:24:40 You fucking didn't.
01:24:41 You fucking ruined it for no reason.
01:24:43 There was no reason at all.
01:24:45 The case was solved.
01:24:46 You you fucked up the first time, right?
01:24:48 Well, we fucked up and then you kind of fucked up.
01:24:51 You took a while to fix it, but you fixed it.
01:24:53 OK, and then you came and you were like, hmm, uh, hmm.
01:24:58 Why don't I just ruin it again for no reason?
01:25:00 And that's what they fucking did.
01:25:01 And now they're like, all being all tweet about like, uh, no, no, no,
01:25:04 no, we understand the urgency of fixing this problem.
01:25:07 We understand that you want your content back.
01:25:09 Don't worry, our internal team is handling it.
01:25:13 Oh, so we already see the video back.
01:25:15 Like, no, it's going to be finally.
01:25:16 Haha. Oh, I hate it, Tom.
01:25:19 I hate them so fucking much.
01:25:21 Yeah, YouTube is a goddamn nightmare.
01:25:24 I mean, it's like I've said it before, but as soon as as soon
01:25:28 as the videos come back, if they do, I'm immediately setting up a library
01:25:31 account, everything will be mirrored on there.
01:25:34 And this won't happen again.
01:25:36 And God in heaven, please stop YouTube is shit.
01:25:40 They can't keep getting away with this.
01:25:42 Like, people's entire livelihoods are on this website and there's
01:25:45 just no communication at all.
01:25:47 It's like, seems impossible, yet here we are.
01:25:50 Yeah, I.
01:25:56 Part of me wishes they would part of me wishes they would just say, like,
01:26:00 now we're just not going to restore it.
01:26:02 Like, stop emailing us just just so we would know.
01:26:04 Like, just so we could be over and we could, like, move forward.
01:26:07 You know, I do think.
01:26:12 The fact that they're they're continuing to correspond
01:26:15 does make me think that they at least intend to fix it.
01:26:20 I think it's giving them a lot of credit.
01:26:23 Well, but when I say that intend, I mean that whoever is sending these emails
01:26:28 probably has faith or at least is paid to present as though they have faith
01:26:33 that the system will work itself out.
01:26:36 You know, it's just appeasement.exe sending emails.
01:26:40 I do think they are written by a person.
01:26:44 I don't I don't I don't think they are fully algorithmic.
01:26:48 There are algorithms are pretty advanced.
01:26:50 They can make reservations over the phone with a real voice
01:26:54 that sounds like a human being doesn't seem out of the out of the realm
01:26:58 of possibility to be able to write emails algorithmically.
01:27:04 I guess, especially when they said there's like basically nobody working
01:27:08 at YouTube right now because of covid.
01:27:13 God, what a fucking dystopian nightmare that would be
01:27:16 if like it has just been a robot auto responding the whole time.
01:27:21 Do you think that's likely?
01:27:23 It's possible. I mean, this is if any company was going to do it,
01:27:26 would be Google, right? They're the ones.
01:27:27 Yeah, algorithmic ties, everything.
01:27:30 Yeah, and now would be the time when like people aren't work.
01:27:32 They don't have as many employees.
01:27:34 Like now would be the time for them to roll out those algorithms
01:27:37 to cover up the work shortages happening, right?
01:27:40 Because like you would think they probably have a thing set up where like
01:27:42 an algorithm is responding to all these emails and mask and then flagging.
01:27:46 And then they have staff that goes through those flags and makes changes.
01:27:49 But if nobody working there, it would explain why nothing is happening.
01:27:53 Yeah, it's just sending flags and there's nobody in the office
01:27:56 to actually examine the problem.
01:27:58 Meanwhile, the robots just like, we're working on it.
01:28:00 We're working on it. We're working on it.
01:28:02 And no one's actually there to do the work.
01:28:04 The. OK, the the weird part or a weird part about that is like,
01:28:10 I don't want to read the whole thing, but like there was a point in the emails
01:28:15 where it claimed to change identity.
01:28:21 This is OK. There was one.
01:28:23 OK, all the correspondence has been with someone calling themselves Martin,
01:28:28 except for one email two days ago, which claimed to be from April,
01:28:32 filling in for my colleague.
01:28:34 This is April filling in for my colleague.
01:28:36 The colleague is presumably Martin.
01:28:39 And they both they both have like a little Google YouTube team logo
01:28:44 at the end of the email, but Martin has a little extra blurb
01:28:48 with like links to like protect your YouTube channel with two step verification or whatever.
01:28:53 It's all very weird, you know, and like that seems like a person thing
01:28:58 that could be true.
01:28:59 But then like you watch their presentation of that like voice thing
01:29:03 I'm talking about, and they purposely add in like they go out of their way.
01:29:07 But yeah, we want to make it sound more human.
01:29:09 So we have it say, um, and stutter sometimes to sound like a human speaking
01:29:13 so you don't get clued in that it's a robot.
01:29:15 So it's like they're thinking about these things.
01:29:17 There's there's there's no way to know.
01:29:19 Like, yeah, I I think it's a person.
01:29:23 But I can't.
01:29:25 I don't know.
01:29:26 I can't pretend like I'm super confident that it is.
01:29:32 We're getting fucking Turing tests.
01:29:34 Yeah, seriously.
01:29:36 That's what they've used this entire code as a baby test their AI message to Ben.
01:29:41 I'm sorry, I keep sighing.
01:29:42 I just caught myself doing it.
01:29:43 I apologize.
01:29:45 It seems it seems worth it in this particular context.
01:29:49 This is a sigh worthy conversation.
01:29:51 What can I say?
01:29:52 I'm just I'm listless.
01:29:53 This is this is this is removing all my lists.
01:29:59 No complaints about me burping, which I also do all the time.
01:30:02 Well, that's funny.
01:30:03 Yeah, sometimes.
01:30:05 And they're and it's based and it's and it's it's Chad.
01:30:10 Mm hmm.
01:30:11 Oh, OK.
01:30:14 Well, I don't know, man.
01:30:15 And we've come to the end of the voicemails.
01:30:17 Indeed.
01:30:18 You got anything else you wanted to any of the grievances you wanted to air
01:30:23 a live on YouTube and by live, I mean, prerecorded,
01:30:27 prerecorded, not on YouTube.
01:30:29 Right.
01:30:30 Correct.
01:30:32 So that's it.
01:30:33 That's exactly what I meant.
01:30:34 I think I think I'm good.
01:30:38 Everything is fucking weird and just taking a day by day as are we all.
01:30:43 Just do the best you can out there, everybody.
01:30:46 Yeah, yeah.
01:30:48 And try not to sigh too much, you know, it's annoying.
01:30:52 Give yourself a sigh every now and then.
01:30:53 Don't bother it all up.
01:30:54 It's unhealthy.
01:30:55 Sure, sure.
01:30:56 There's a health.
01:30:57 There's a healthy medium to be struck here.
01:31:00 And, you know, thanks for thanks for tuning in.

01:31:42 But it's still up on.
01:31:44 Wait, is that up on like iTunes?
