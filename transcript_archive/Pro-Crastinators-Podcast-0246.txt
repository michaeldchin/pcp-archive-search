00:00:00 Hello, welcome to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. It's just me. It's
00:00:11 just me again. Just Ben Saint, your host. Except, I've also got a guest today, Minerva
00:00:20 from Eldina Doublecast. Is that right?
00:00:23 Eldina.
00:00:24 Eldina.
00:00:25 Eldina.
00:00:26 It is I, Minerva P. Kelly, and today the P stands for Pro Crastinators. You can find
00:00:32 me on both Twitter and Tumblr at Doublecast, spelled with a 5 instead of an S. I have an
00:00:38 award-winning YouTube channel where I make bad content that gives you brain damage and
00:00:44 only makes sense if you read too much fan fiction.
00:00:47 Eldina.
00:00:48 It's true. It's true. I know. I know that it's true. I know you. I know. I'm going to admit
00:00:56 I haven't watched most of your videos, but I have, but I have seen the, I have seen and
00:01:04 would highly recommend it's the three videos, the when, when posting goes wrong, or maybe
00:01:09 they're not all when posting goes wrong, the one about the witch with the bones, the one
00:01:13 about the Hamilton with HIV, and the one about miscribed Harry Potter.
00:01:20 Everyone, everyone listening who has not seen this series or doesn't know about these dramas
00:01:24 is incredibly confused right now, but yes, those are the videos. Those are all when posting
00:01:29 goes wrong. Also, forgot to say this earlier. Pronouns, she, her, get it right.
00:01:36 True.
00:01:37 Ben was nice enough to invite an early transition trans woman on his podcast, so please watch.
00:01:44 Well, we have like, well, we have like five of those in our fucking, in our ranks now.
00:01:50 Beautiful.
00:01:52 Yeah, this is just, this is just par for the course. We used to be, we used to be a boys
00:01:57 club. We used to be a real sausage, sausage party here at the PCP, but it's all, it's
00:02:03 all got flip turned upside down now. It's all fucked up.
00:02:06 That's a, that's what it's, it's what Biden getting elected did. It's like buying it selected
00:02:13 and then you hear like the FBI knock on your door, they burst in, put on the cat ears.
00:02:20 And then they, and they erased the memories that don't even know. They don't know that's
00:02:23 what did it. That's what happened.
00:02:25 Never, never realized it was the coronavirus vaccine. I don't know.
00:02:30 It's five G. There's like five different angles we can take with this joke. I think the unironic
00:02:36 like non joke answer is that being inside all day and not being able to like, not having
00:02:43 to be out in society forces you to like do more self reflection and like turn inward.
00:02:52 And that like, I think that it like accelerates the process where it's like, if just like
00:02:59 more time for reflection, yeah, it's like, if coming out as trans for someone who's like
00:03:05 just starting to question their gender would normally take like three to five years, I
00:03:09 feel like you can do it in like six months if you can't go outside because it's just
00:03:14 all you can think about.
00:03:16 It's, it's, it's, I mean, I've definitely noticed the, a sudden, you know, just like
00:03:22 the price of Bitcoin suddenly this year, the rate of transitioning just, just skyrocketed.
00:03:29 Oh God, I want to, I should, last episode I was talking about my Bitcoin adventures.
00:03:37 Oh God.
00:03:38 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I don't have much to say about that because I've, it's come to
00:03:43 an end. It came to a sad and ignominious end. I, the, the, the, the long and short of it
00:03:49 of my, of my, of my Bitcoin speculation was I invested way too much. I invested like way
00:03:56 too much of my personal savings in it. And then, and this was as it was like going up
00:04:02 and I'm watching it go up and I'm like, yes, yes, I'm fucking rich. I'm fucking rich. And
00:04:07 then it immediately, but I'm spending like 24 hours a day just staring at the fucking
00:04:12 ticker, just watching the lines go up and down. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm ready. If
00:04:16 it starts to go down, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sell. I'm gonna sell. Of course that's not
00:04:20 what happened. It started, it started to plummet. It started to plummet and I have weak hands.
00:04:26 So once it went down, once it went down far enough, I'm like, it's too scary. I can't
00:04:30 do it. I can't do it anymore. I sold it all. I ended up, I would, for a minute there, I
00:04:35 had made like $1,000, but when I sold, I had lost like 200. So, you know, it's fine.
00:04:42 It's fine. It's all, you know, easy come, easy go.
00:04:45 That's a, I mean, Bitcoin has always just been a casino. So that's pretty par for the
00:04:49 course I feel like. True. I mean, yeah.
00:04:53 I remember back in like 2012, when Bitcoin was first getting started, or maybe it was
00:04:59 like a little earlier, but that's when it came to my attention. I tried buying Bitcoin
00:05:03 or like setting up like a Bitcoin mine because it's. Imagine buying Bitcoin in 2012. Yeah.
00:05:08 That's the thing. It's like, I couldn't, because here's the thing, despite like making, I wouldn't
00:05:13 call it a career because I'm not like, this isn't my job. It's like a hobby that pays
00:05:18 well for some reason. But like despite, you know, doing all this stuff online, I'm not
00:05:23 actually tech savvy. Like I don't really understand how most of the stuff works. So I could not
00:05:29 get the Bitcoin mine up and running. Oh God, you were trying to mine it? Or I don't know.
00:05:36 Well, I didn't know like how to, it was, I couldn't figure out either a, how to buy it
00:05:42 because I was in like high school. So I didn't have like enough disposable income to just
00:05:46 go around buying Bitcoin. So I was like, what if I, but I heard like the way that you get
00:05:52 Bitcoins is you like generate them with like the algorithms or whatever. I was like, I wonder
00:05:56 if I can like set that up on my, you know, 2010 MacBook, which I think even if I had figured
00:06:05 out how to do it, it probably wouldn't have worked. But man, it's thinking back like, I
00:06:12 would be a very, very rich woman right now. I bought Bitcoin in 2012.
00:06:18 I mean, I don't really, I have no idea how one would mine for it. I haven't even looked
00:06:25 into it. I know I don't have what it takes to do that shit. In fact, I made a huge fool
00:06:29 of myself last episode trying to explain what I thought Bitcoin was. And I said at the time,
00:06:36 I'm probably completely wrong. Turns out, yes, I was completely wrong about like what a Bitcoin is.
00:06:41 A Twitter user actually underscore Dio, helpfully called me an idiot and sent me a DM. Got called
00:06:50 by Dio himself with a link to a video explaining more or less what Bitcoin is. So now I understand
00:06:57 it a lot better. The only reason I was able to buy it is just because like this like like two months
00:07:03 ago PayPal just rolled out a feature where you can just you can just buy it on PayPal. You can
00:07:08 just invest through PayPal. That's the only reason why I couldn't do it in the first place. It's
00:07:12 because it's because they made it. It's because they made it so convenient, even a fucking ignoramus
00:07:17 like myself could ruin could ruin their life watching the fucking ticker going up and down 24
00:07:23 hours a day. It was the worst thing. The worst thing about it is that I'm not even free. I'm not
00:07:29 even free just because I sold because now I watch it and obsess over it and look at like, oh, how
00:07:34 much could I have made? Oh, how much would I have lost? I sold it all, but it's still inside me.
00:07:40 You need to do like a clean break. You need to just go cold turkey off Bitcoin. You can't let
00:07:45 this dominate your life anymore. You're right. You're right. I can't I can't let it keep gaslighting
00:07:52 me. I gotta say I'm kind of glad that like I am not more drawn to like Wall Street bets and like
00:07:59 crypto investing and shit like that because like I am like infamously bad at making bets.
00:08:06 Um, my audience has been repeatedly mocking me lately because in basically
00:08:15 from the period of time after Bernie Sanders lost the primary up until like October,
00:08:23 I was making a long series of bets formatted as if Joe Biden actually wins the election this
00:08:30 November, I will blank. And it was always something really like embarrassing and ridiculous.
00:08:38 It seemed like a long shot for a while. It seemed incredibly unlikely. So here's what I ended up with
00:08:45 after my blind, unflinching confidence in democratic incompetence.
00:08:54 If Biden wins by the most expensive dildo on baddragon.com and display it prominently in
00:09:00 my home, subsist entirely off jack in the box tacos for a week, eat a whole lemon like an apple,
00:09:08 live stream myself cooking and then eating a tortilla filled with goldfish and Totino's pizza
00:09:16 rolls, get into get into Bandori. Uh, what I don't know what that is. It's a it's a anime like it's
00:09:25 it's like a it's like a gotcha game. It's one of those. It's the one one of the ones with like a
00:09:32 lot of girls by by a mug that says, don't talk to me until I've come in my wife and then film
00:09:39 myself drinking Mountain Dew gamer fuel out of it. Stick a bunch of Reese's minis on a slice of
00:09:46 cheese pizza and eat it. It goes on like this for a while. These are these are just like honestly
00:09:52 the only one of those that I think is that bad is the is the by the expensive dildo one because
00:09:57 I gotta imagine the most expensive one on bad dragon is like in the four digits. It's definitely
00:10:02 a few hundred. I haven't done the full map the way that it I was kind of uh uh what was I trying
00:10:10 to say I didn't quite understand how it worked because it's they don't have like oh hello someone
00:10:15 else just joined. Oh who's who's that? Who just joined? Hello. Gib. Hey. Hey Gib. Hi. Hello. Hey.
00:10:23 Welcome to the podcast. Hey. Well we're doing a surprise. We have two hosts now.
00:10:29 Yay. Woo. Ah it's a real podcast. No it can't be true. It's true. It's sad but true. I just wondered
00:10:39 in here. Don't don't give me that host job. Don't give me that that lady. Hey whoa introduce yourself.
00:10:47 Hello everyone. I'm Gib and take. I make art. She made it. Congratulations.
00:10:59 I don't know if you watched any of Minerva's videos that I told everyone to watch because
00:11:04 I like them a lot. I had a I had a five second like what a clicked link and I saw Pokemon
00:11:11 let's plays. I was like oh cool. I didn't have time. Oh my god you watched the let's play.
00:11:16 Oh I clicked I clicked on it for a few seconds. I was like okay cool it's Pokemon. I was about to
00:11:20 be very impressed because that's my LD. Elden a double cast famous a poke tuber just like just like
00:11:27 me. I well I was about to say I would have been uh hilariously surprised if you had watched the
00:11:33 Pokemon let's plays because that's my least popular content. It was just the first thing I saw.
00:11:40 Yeah I got you. Um where were we? Where were we? We were talking about Joe Biden.
00:11:48 Right let's let's get back to it. I made a bunch of basically that was a very long tangent I probably
00:11:54 didn't need to go on but the the short version of this is I'm glad I don't bet like actual money
00:12:00 because I would have lost a lot of money on the election. Right right um
00:12:11 you know what why are we talking about politics? Ah you know the pro cre- ah pee this podcast
00:12:15 gone too political lately. Well speaking of politics out of my podcast. Thank you thank you.
00:12:23 Out of you. You gotta keep me in line. Um speaking of speaking of uh gambling or whatever the fuck
00:12:29 betting betting on things. Nice nice. Uh my bit my bitcoin update I've lost six pennies. Fuck you.
00:12:36 Six pennies have gone down. Good good good. Since I invested it's gone up and down um I've like the
00:12:43 maximum like I invested one whole pound British sterling pound uh to the bitcoin craze so I'm
00:12:51 cashing in when it gets when it gets big I'm just waiting just waiting it out. It's just kind of
00:12:56 it's just kind of been wobbling like it peaked and then it dropped and then I got scared and I
00:13:00 sold and since then it's just kind of been wobbling like up and down around where I sold it at so
00:13:06 you know who knows who knows what could happen you know they say the market's bullish they say
00:13:12 the they say we're nowhere near the market cap so you know just keep holding on to it it'll go up
00:13:18 eventually just just keep holding just keep holding either it goes to absolute zero like zero of my
00:13:25 investment is is remained and then I will invest again because that means it's gone down or I'll
00:13:29 become the new Elon Musk you know. Yeah Christ true really the greatest accomplishment anyone
00:13:37 can have is being the new Elon Musk. He was on the Simpsons. No that can't be that's not that's not
00:13:46 possible. No you know the way it's true it's it's true and Lisa Lisa calls him like the
00:13:52 most important living inventor. Jesus Christ. That's how you know that's how you know Simpsons
00:13:57 is fucking over that's how you know it should have ended a long time ago that's the moment. The
00:14:00 nature of the Simpsons is that okay the Simpsons is kind of like supernatural for me and that you
00:14:05 can tell me literally anything happened on it I'll be like sure all right. Well sure because I mean
00:14:13 it's it's had like 40 40 thousand episodes. Yeah exactly. It's just like eventually they
00:14:19 exhaust all possible ideas. There is there is a clip or a series of images from the Simpsons
00:14:27 to express any idea that a human can conceive and hold in their mind. I saw one I saw one
00:14:35 one of the guys uh one of the two guys who host Anamorph in Time the leftist Anamorph's
00:14:41 podcast which I have been which I have been I have been binging this week posted a reaction
00:14:49 get to some shit about the like coronavirus vaccine you know like rising cases in the United
00:14:55 States and it was the scene it was the scene when Homer owns the bowling alley of when first he's
00:15:01 reading like advanced like business and then he goes down to basic like business guide and then
00:15:07 he finally just goes down to just like staring at a bowling ball and it was that with epidemiology.
00:15:14 Oh my god. And I was like the Simpsons is the truly the greatest the greatest cultural monument
00:15:20 that humanity has yet has ever erected or ever will erect. It's like there's there's a Simpsons
00:15:25 reference for everything and there's a SpongeBob reference for everything. I who who do you think
00:15:32 okay who who wins in a fight uh Homer Simpson or SpongeBob they're both yellow so that doesn't
00:15:39 give either of them an advantage. I feel like SpongeBob has more powers of like cartoon invincibility
00:15:47 like you can you can do basically anything to SpongeBob and he'll be basically okay where I
00:15:53 feel like Homer still obeys like some of the laws of like actual human anatomy and that if like
00:16:01 you kill you do something to him that would kill a normal person it would actually kill him.
00:16:07 That's true. Yeah it's just SpongeBob's harder to kill but he's so weak and he's also tiny.
00:16:13 He's weak and tiny. That's a good point oh right because in the the what is it in like the movie
00:16:19 when he's riding on David Hasselhoff yeah he's like really oh because he's the size of like an actual
00:16:24 sea sponge. He's the size of an yeah or not he's the size of like a table like a sink sponge.
00:16:28 All right because he he's he's a sea sponge but that just means he's a kitchen sponge that
00:16:33 lives in the sea. That lives in the sea yes exactly. It's self hilarious. I was thinking like if there's
00:16:39 like character archetypes you can match with the Simpsons and SpongeBob I'm sure there are but like
00:16:44 my first thought was like oh Homer would be Patrick though but then also SpongeBob I think he would
00:16:51 be both I think SpongeBob and Patrick combined would be Homer. He kind of is the shape of
00:16:58 Patrick but the color of SpongeBob. He combines both of their best qualities. Yes it's like it's like
00:17:05 main character like plot driving instincts from SpongeBob with the sort of raw like unfiltered
00:17:14 dumbassery of Patrick. Dude dude Squidward versus Moe. Squidward versus Moe. Oh god.
00:17:26 Oh well I mean is it a physical battle or is it a clarinet playing contest? That determines
00:17:32 everything. I mean Moe has a gun. Moe has a fucking gun. He would literally just blow
00:17:39 no no no no Squidward could like leap like splash out of the water and like like face crab attack
00:17:44 Moe and he'd be like ah I can't see. The most fucked up thing about SpongeBob is that Squidward
00:17:51 is an octopus. He's not a squid. That is but he's only got six legs. Does he? Because yeah he's got
00:18:00 his four he's got his four like leg legs and his two arm tentacles. I'm pretty sure every time
00:18:07 they do like a thing where they're out of the water and they show them as actual animals. Squidward
00:18:12 is an octopus not a squid. Also I believe that because they have actual squids in the show and
00:18:19 they have the pointy heads and his head is round like an octopus. Like he doesn't have the right
00:18:25 number of legs but I am like pretty sure this is a real thing and it's really fucked up. When he
00:18:29 when he moves to that like gated community with only other with all the other Squidward's yes
00:18:36 does it say that like there's their octopuses octopi or does it even like specify I mean it might not
00:18:42 even like say what they are it's just like assume that like yes these people are all just like him
00:18:47 whatever that means yeah I don't think they ever might be how they do it I don't think they ever
00:18:51 explain that we're just supposed to like infer uh everything about that location oh hang on
00:18:59 Steven Hillenberg designed Squidward with six arms because of convenience for simpler
00:19:03 animations Squidward was designed to have a large bulbous head like an octopus the creator
00:19:08 liked the way the creator liked the way the bulbous head on Squidward signified him as a
00:19:13 grumpy next door neighbor blah blah blah however due to the inconvenience of the original name
00:19:17 octoword the original name was octoword the name Squidward was used instead just because it sounded
00:19:25 better basically um that's a octoword isn't octoword yeah yeah yeah high five
00:19:34 ow well now we know uh you high five yourself and hurt yourself we've learned yeah I did
00:19:43 yeah I did it's exactly what happened pro gamer move get Gibb did you see did you see what uh did
00:19:49 you see what Christine Weston Chandler tweeted today I would never go to twitter.com oh Jesus Christ
00:19:58 she she retweeted the picture of your your picture of the slime coin with diamond tiara
00:20:06 and she she did and then she and she's said some stuff about coins and then she
00:20:13 and then she literally plugged my comic oh yeah you guys have like talked to her before right
00:20:20 yes yeah yeah a bunch of times she she messaged me she messaged me on twitter did I say this last
00:20:27 episode I hope I'm not repeating myself I don't think so I always get confused okay well she messaged
00:20:32 me like earlier this week or last week with just a picture of like a cool crystal that she bought
00:20:37 on some crystal website and said like hey look it's just like in Arizona uh uh you know and I
00:20:45 said ha it looks it looks just like the powder and that Christine turned blue and that gave
00:20:50 alternate timeline phantom horn his phantom his titular phantom horn and she said ha ha yes that's
00:20:56 correct and then she today she tweeted a picture of that crystal and then a bunch of like stuff about
00:21:01 slime and punishment and a link to my uh tapas page which I just this is what I thought was really
00:21:08 funny and then of course and then of course 50 people responded with like uh you know like uh uh
00:21:13 some pictures of like uh chris you're a fucking piece of shit and these are these are embarrassing
00:21:18 these are gross drawings people did of you ha ha you you fuck what a what a nightmare people just need
00:21:25 to I I propose we all just stop caring about Christine Weston Chandler like no I like her
00:21:34 though I mean I get I mean like the whole like how do I put this that I think she's funny the the
00:21:41 whole christorian thing and like all the people who like obsess over her in like the like stalkery
00:21:49 way that has to have too much in yeah there's a definitely a group of people who are far too
00:21:55 invested in the life and times of some stranger on the internet that happens to have written so much
00:22:00 you exactly like I uh christine is like one of those people where it's like because my series
00:22:11 that's like popular now in my youtube channel is when posting goes wrong which is about times when
00:22:16 people made posts that went wrong and like on one hand sonichu is like the perfect example of this
00:22:26 because it really was just someone posting some shit that got way out of hand and escalated to
00:22:33 like this insane internet phenomenon but on the other hand I so don't want to make a fucking video
00:22:39 about christian like there's already so many of them yeah a lot of them including yours are really
00:22:48 good yeah and then yeah on top of that I gotta see I've got a sequel coming out but ooh that's
00:22:53 exciting I've I've had a sequel like almost ready to go for like a year now but I'm just I have some
00:23:00 specific criteria that I want to meet before I release it but I mean but anyway right uh uh
00:23:06 yeah I got you um never but then the last never forget I said anything no it's it's cool
00:23:14 editor editor edit out everything no don't cut it cut all of it um one of my favorite uh gags on
00:23:22 a podcast is somebody says something like that and then follows it with editor cut that out but
00:23:26 you like hear the whole thing um so we we yeah I'm our we no our our editor never we he's not
00:23:36 allowed actually to cut anything out there's no editing in this podcast anything that he does cut
00:23:40 out anything that he does cut out goes to our secret bonus episode we say to him we say to him
00:23:44 please edit out the embarrassing parts and but but a previous message says whatever you do don't
00:23:50 listen to us when we say that and we've been cursed with constantly being embarrassing online
00:23:56 all are all are seeing all those embarrassing moments that were too embarrassing for the main
00:24:00 podcast are going in the collected a cut content bonus episode on patreon wow for subscribers only
00:24:08 yeah wow I had a dream I had a dream that our patreon had gone up and what a dream it was
00:24:17 yeah it was only a dream though oh okay well uh uh sorry I interrupted your oh no it's fine I was
00:24:28 just gonna say like that's like one half of his there's already too many videos about chris chan
00:24:33 and the other thing is that like um I heard a quote once from I think it was the down the rabbit hole
00:24:40 guy uh fred frederick frederick nudesan yeah frederick nudesan where he's who I was on a stream
00:24:46 with one time that does not exist anywhere on the internet anymore because it was deleted mysterious
00:24:53 um bummer but he said something to the effect of once you make a video about chris chan that
00:25:00 does well that's all people will talk to you about ever and yeah I would prefer that not to be my fate
00:25:10 um it yeah I mean it doesn't necessarily I think that's somewhat in my experience that gets you
00:25:17 big and noticed in the first place um maybe but I mean I mean I mean more I mean more people know
00:25:24 me from the the sonichu lecture than from anything else that's true but it's not like I'm inundated
00:25:30 with like it's not like I'm inundated with with people wanting to talk to me about it all the time
00:25:36 it doesn't it's not like annoying I don't find it that annoying uh I mean some I don't know maybe
00:25:44 sometimes someone will when I when someone knows me and I like I find that it's from that I'm usually
00:25:50 like oh that's fine I don't know I guess I would there are other things I would like think it was
00:25:56 cooler if people knew me for than that but like it's not a problem it's not a problem that people
00:26:00 know me from that that's my two cents on the on the subject I got you uh I don't know um
00:26:07 I don't know uh uh I just I just thought it was neat I just thought it was neat that uh she was
00:26:13 that she just felt like tweeting about my fucking uh uh slime comic and stuff today I think that's
00:26:20 fucking neat oh yeah I've seen the the the retweet of my diamond tiara slime corp slime coin pick
00:26:29 I really like that photo it's strange I mean I know she follows me but she very rarely interacts
00:26:36 with anything I post mm-hmm wait I will post I will post the picture in the in the chat uh because uh
00:26:46 because uh there it is bam oh it's loading sorry my internet's bad that's fine it's fine okay there
00:26:55 we go very nice gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous um okay okay so so uh I heard a thing uh Minerva are you
00:27:11 familiar with homestuck you ever heard of a homestuck oh christ you ever heard about this wacky
00:27:18 thing on the internet call homestuck it's kind of like undertale but better oh unfortunately
00:27:25 fuck you I don't I don't I don't I don't know I don't know what your problem is uh me me and Gibber
00:27:32 unironic homestuck uh uh uh stands home stand from from way back oh wow homestands are you are you uh
00:27:40 are you uh I don't know what are you I'm more of a spatula myself what's your what's your relationship
00:27:46 with homestuck um Minerva my situation was that I had a bunch of friends who were really into it
00:27:55 when it was first getting big and I like purposely avoided it because it seemed it was like I think
00:28:04 the length of it intimidated me but also yeah I it just didn't speak to me in that way where it
00:28:12 would justify me reading through that much and then years later I started my uh main series
00:28:21 what your favorite ship says about you and at some point I was like well I have to do a
00:28:26 homestuck video eventually because everyone kept joking like oh if you did a homestuck video it'd
00:28:31 be like an hour you can't do a home like that would be insane and so I was like well that's a
00:28:36 challenge um I ended up reading about half of homestuck I got about halfway through it before
00:28:45 I got sick of it and couldn't read anymore which when you say half do you know the actual whole
00:28:51 length of the thing do you know where the halfway point is yeah I oh god what how many acts are
00:28:58 there again there's six but the sixth one is so big technically seven seven is just a video
00:29:07 I think if you read to the end of act five I would say you you did it correctly yeah I think I got
00:29:13 a little bit into act six is where I end up okay that honestly honestly good place to quit I
00:29:19 specifically remember the point where I quit was uh what fucking character was it is Dirk the second
00:29:27 one Dirk is the the alt brother of Dave Dirk's autoresponder I couldn't stand the autoresponder
00:29:36 I was just like every time this thing shows up it wastes like a huge amount of my time and says
00:29:42 nothing I'm so like more so than car cat like I've had enough I felt that way I just felt that way
00:29:50 about a lot of stuff in act six Jen I felt that way about like most characters in in act six even
00:29:55 the ones that had been good before um yeah I like I don't I never like had any confirmation one
00:30:03 where the other but it always felt like act six was hussy like getting bored of the story he was
00:30:09 telling and wanting to tell a completely different story but still needing to finish home stuck so
00:30:14 he's changed focus a little bit made it much more about these new characters with their teen drama
00:30:21 and less about the adventure that had been happening up to that point and then he just
00:30:26 sort of finished it with a big fight scene okay but I bring it up because I found I saw posted
00:30:34 maybe on twitter or somewhere this thing this this blog post you remember the whole thing about how
00:30:41 they crowdfunded hiveswap and then they gave it to that development studio and the development studio
00:30:47 basically like took the money and ran and made some other thing oh yeah I remember hearing about this
00:30:51 I think that was only ever a rumor I don't think it was ever like
00:30:56 completely confirmed but I'm I feel like it's like it seems like it would be the case
00:31:02 but well that seemed to be the narrative and that's what I had thought happened this whole time
00:31:08 I don't know I came upon this blog post saying that like no actually it was hussy actually it was
00:31:14 hussy that like fucked them over in various ways and I didn't actually I admit I didn't actually
00:31:21 read through this whole thing because it's really long but um I don't know it made me I I hope it's
00:31:28 not true I hope that uh I hope that hussy is a good boy but uh I don't know maybe he's I mean it
00:31:36 wouldn't it wouldn't like be like shocking to hear that he's bad at managing things based on
00:31:43 like even after the the whole odd gentleman thing and like the creation of what pumpkin studios
00:31:48 or whatever it was called hiveswap still took a billion years and yeah I don't know there's a
00:31:57 lot of little things maybe hussy isn't that good at organizing a business maybe he's better just
00:32:02 making little comics and when it blew up the way the homestuck did he was like shit I don't
00:32:07 fucking know what I'm doing maybe he's still like that I don't know I would perhaps I would not at
00:32:13 all be surprised if hussy was kind of an asshole just based off of like how he came across in the
00:32:19 comic I kind of got the sense that he was like he was self aware about having a big ego but not
00:32:26 enough to actually do anything about it um which is not a great combination
00:32:34 yeah I can kind of I can kind of see that oh no it's impossible anyone that makes a thing that I
00:32:42 like must be only good uh but what if but what if when I'm making a big comic and I want to be
00:32:49 best friends with Andrew hussy and he says uh fuck you that sucks I don't want that it can't
00:32:54 happen no it can't be it will never happen hey hussy would never screw me over like he
00:33:00 screwed the odd gentleman allegedly he's good still don't know you're right I'll have to read this
00:33:06 it's it seems like it seems like the the major allegation here is that like hussy like paid them
00:33:13 the money and then like and instead of having them make the game they were supposed to make he told
00:33:20 them like do stuff for the act seven finale instead and then basically tried to tell them like okay
00:33:28 now that you've done that like like do the game as well seemed like he was maybe trying to like
00:33:33 double dip with his money on them or something that's sounds like what they're saying was wrong
00:33:40 and why like the project fell through and they didn't complete it for him that's how it seems I
00:33:46 don't know it's it's really long and I'm sure there's more here uh I don't know I thought that was
00:33:52 interesting and a little troubling uh because uh I haven't even played hiveswab have you played
00:34:00 hiveswab give yeah I did I did a review of it back when I was still doing those and I said in the
00:34:06 review I would eventually play the second one when it came out and have you played have you
00:34:11 played the second one is the second one out it's out now it's been so long that my of my
00:34:17 review channel career crumbled and I gave up in that time span well um owned indeed uh I don't
00:34:26 know the owned by the time the first one was like it had a few nice references and it was
00:34:31 decent uh looking and playing uh like point and click game but it didn't it wasn't like amazing
00:34:39 it was just sort of like oh yeah cool like kick started point and click adventure
00:34:45 somewhat interesting puzzles but yeah it was all right yeah the the best thing I could say about
00:34:51 it was that it could get more people interested in homestuck which is a better thing which is what
00:34:56 I ended up saying which would similarly the best thing about homestuck is that it can get people
00:35:01 to read problem sleuth which is a better thing valid no um no I would say I would say it's very
00:35:10 very good like more more consistently good and and easier to get through I'm I'm I joke I joke a
00:35:18 little bit I think it I think it's in some ways it's better uh but uh in in exploring all of the
00:35:23 little ideas that it comes up with and um neatly wrapping everything up at the end with a really
00:35:29 cool set of of events that like everything leads up to that point even though it seems to be going
00:35:36 in random directions the entire time like it's really clever I really like the the the structure
00:35:43 of problem sleuth how it manages to and he did it in just one year which is like incredible for sure
00:35:51 for sure did you do either of you see did either of you see the the drama the drama that happened
00:36:01 this week on twitter with um uh Lindsay Ellis and Sarah Zed who's I have I have Lindsay Ellis blocked
00:36:11 I'm mutuals with Sarah Zed so I'm surprised I didn't see at least some of this Lindsay Ellis
00:36:17 has me blocked even though we've never interacted we've never interacted I don't know why that's
00:36:21 super funny but I'm blocked by Lindsay Ellis for some reason you're on you're on the list Ben
00:36:27 I guess I guess I'm on the list uh um but uh okay all right so the the the drama with those two
00:36:37 and a third party who I will I won't I won't mention them oh anyway uh I don't know they were just uh
00:36:47 Sarah Zed I think tweeted that like don't do this like don't interact with creators in this way like
00:36:54 I'm getting like weird messages from someone and then Lindsay Ellis replied to that saying like
00:37:00 I think I think she showed screenshots of them and Lindsay Ellis replied saying I think I think
00:37:05 we both are like having the same problem with the same person I'm getting inappropriate messages
00:37:11 from someone that da da da da and then she posted screenshots and it had the the icon in the name
00:37:16 blurred out almost blurred out there was a little bit of the icon showing and people um people like
00:37:23 looked at the icon and looked at what it was saying and it seems like the person in question might
00:37:27 have been Quinton reviews oh my god yeah and and like the the basic gist of it I should I'm not
00:37:36 gonna go and find them but maybe I'll post like screenshots these particular screenshots in the
00:37:41 chat you're saying I kind of Quinton potentially Quinton reviews was messaging Lindsay Ellis and
00:37:48 this other person in a creepy way yes well the thing is the the way they were talking about it
00:37:54 it sounded like oh this it's creepy it's it's inappropriate but like the content of the messages
00:38:01 it's inappropriate in the sense that like it's a little too familiar and sort of comes off as a
00:38:05 little like desperate but it's not like it's not like it's not like creep shit like sexual
00:38:11 shit it's just like hey how you doing you know uh uh you know uh I really like you and I like
00:38:18 your work and stuff and then like months later like hey you never replied to my message haha
00:38:22 like what's going on I'd really love to connect sometime haha months later hey you know I don't
00:38:26 know if I ever burn this bridge at some point that's why you're not responding to me haha okay
00:38:30 but if you ever want to like okay and then months later okay well I guess sorry sorry for this I
00:38:36 apologize you know just like lame see that's not even just lame it's just sad it's not good
00:38:40 they they didn't call it creepy yeah it's it's just it's just a bad look like I was just like a
00:38:45 sad look just because he got back at him almost subscribers doesn't mean you're actually hot
00:38:50 shit no no you know I don't know I just they were the way they were talking about it made it sound
00:38:59 like this person was like being really I don't know when I actually saw the messages it didn't
00:39:04 it didn't seem I didn't it didn't think it was as bad as they kind of made it out to be and I kind
00:39:09 of thought then the whole thing like Quentin looks like a loser but both of them just kind of look
00:39:13 like they're catty and like they're just like gossiping about someone and I don't think it's a
00:39:17 good look for anyone involved uh I thought it was I think the whole thing was gross well I haven't
00:39:23 seen any of this stuff I'm trying to find it but um the idea of the idea of like highlighting an
00:39:30 anonymous message saying hey guys don't do this in their defense to their credit they didn't they
00:39:37 didn't like deliberately try and out this person yeah but yeah so that's that's good that's I'm
00:39:43 glad that they didn't but I don't know if they wanted to if they wanted to talk about this this
00:39:49 person who like they both don't like in their DMs like I don't know they could have done it in
00:39:53 private if they wanted to if they wanted to they didn't have to do it in a public twitter thread
00:40:00 yeah I don't know yeah I I think that's valid I mean I get it I get why she'd tweet that because
00:40:07 like yeah like people on the internet do not understand boundaries and sometimes you just
00:40:15 want to let people know like hey don't interact with your faves this way it's really weird and
00:40:21 uncomfortable because it's like some of these people like maybe you actually like could talk to
00:40:27 them in like a reasonable way but just because of the way they approach you it makes it really
00:40:31 weird and awkward and like okay this is someone who clearly like is gonna be like they're they're
00:40:37 like if not a stan just someone who like has me on a pedestal and I don't want to like deal with that
00:40:44 so I think it's like it's reasonable to like ask people to like have boundaries and like understand
00:40:50 this shit it's just unfortunate that you know they didn't fully take the icon out and the dude got
00:40:57 exposed yeah and like it's yeah it's it's funny it's funny that it was between I don't know it's
00:41:05 funny that it was Sarah and Quinton because Quinton's bigger than Sarah Quinton has more
00:41:09 subscribers and yet apparently he was the one doing the messaging and she was like hey you know
00:41:15 lay off just because you're a fan that doesn't mean I'm your friend or whatever well I mean that's
00:41:21 the funny thing about YouTube or like web content in general is that um you can have a fave who
00:41:29 actually because this is something I discovered when I got like YouTube clout is that you can have
00:41:35 a fave who has like way less engagement with you and is way less popular than you but you can still
00:41:41 have that weird dynamic of like looking up to them and wanting to like like get in with them as if you
00:41:47 were like you know um as if they had some sort of like um yeah edge over you in terms of like
00:41:54 popularity because like all of you mean yeah like all of the people who I was like a huge fan of
00:42:01 prior to getting my YouTube channel were just like people in the ruby fandom which is like a big
00:42:08 fandom but it's not the kind of thing where you get like capital C clout like no one has like
00:42:14 very few people have like multiple thousands of twitter followers because of that or whatever
00:42:19 so it's weird like being a fan of people who like technically have like fewer followers than me but
00:42:28 it's just like the dynamic still feels like it's there I gotta say this this whole thing
00:42:36 I don't know even if I would class it as drama it's just it's so I don't know mild
00:42:44 is this what passes for like news on twitter these days just like a little bit of a social
00:42:49 profile like some people looking not so great I don't know when when two when two kind of when
00:42:56 two big like YouTube people are like talking shit about someone and it turns out to be a third
00:43:01 like big person and that I don't know that seems like that I think that's gossip worthy it does
00:43:07 appeal to like the um fuck you it does appeal to like the tabloid sensibility of like ooh look
00:43:12 at what your favorite like youtubers are saying about each other behind their back like exactly
00:43:18 exactly just burn them all all the youtubers get them in a room get them in a tuba room yeah kill
00:43:26 them just anyone over anyone anyone over a hundred k subs uh hang them hang them from the gallons I
00:43:33 would say in my opinion and yes yes in a video game in minecraft I guess oh if I have to minecraft
00:43:44 I was just so boring it sucks it's the lamest thing you could ever even think about
00:43:52 I can't think of a lame or though you know what's good you know what's better content oh no no that's
00:43:59 even worse I love I love content I love filling my face with content I'm seeing that my I'm seeing
00:44:07 that my fave krogsmash I didn't realize he had passed a hundred k subs he's up to 119 subs
00:44:15 have I talked about krogsmash you know krogsmash you know krogsmash I have never heard of krogsmash
00:44:20 what's he do I think you may have do you know dwarf fortress I do you know the game dwarf fortress
00:44:26 I have heard of dwarf fortress well krogsmash is a dwarf fortress youtuber uh a a a dwoo
00:44:35 I don't know you'd call it sure um he does um you know he he builds fortresses and he'll like
00:44:41 he does like I don't know he'll like narrate the the games that he plays on the fortresses
00:44:46 that he builds and he'll like pick out little dwarf individual dwarves and like give them
00:44:50 little character arcs and do like art of them and stuff uh he's doing um he just concluded the second
00:44:57 annual uh splatter face tournament where he picks like random people from around his like
00:45:03 generated world to like come and uh fight in gladiatorial combat uh they two days ago the
00:45:13 championship bout came out and it was the greatest thing I've ever seen uh I literally teared up at
00:45:19 the end uh it's so fucking good I can't even believe it uh don't watch splatter face too go back and
00:45:27 watch the first this is my recommendation watch the first splatter face because the characters
00:45:33 in the second splatter face are like you know the ones that survived the first one come back and
00:45:37 you have you have to know you have to know all the lore you have to know like where the where
00:45:43 the battle beetle got his steel helmet and stuff like this is all this is all so crucial critical
00:45:49 dwarf fortress lore oh it's so some of the some of the some of the fighters in the second round
00:45:55 are so cool I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say who my favorites are because that'd be spoilery um
00:46:03 I'm always impressed when youtube channels develop lore that's more complicated than like
00:46:09 actual published properties like yeah did you ever look into siva gunner lore um I I've heard
00:46:19 about it I know I don't know anything about I didn't know that was lore I know that there's like a big
00:46:24 it's a big group effort to make funny video game rip music yeah what happened was when they first
00:46:31 started it it was just like posting high quality rips as they called it which were all very funny
00:46:38 mashups but what happened was over time to like mix things up I guess they started introducing
00:46:47 like plot lines to it where there would be like characters who like quote unquote run the channel
00:46:54 or take over the channel or something like that they kept adding like more and more of them it
00:47:00 got incredibly complicated and involved like I'm pretty sure like multiple universes and time travel
00:47:06 and like a a key element was smashing the motherfucking like button among other things it got like
00:47:15 complicated to the point where I could not even try to keep track of it and it's like on the one hand
00:47:21 is that like the best storytelling maybe not is it impressive as hell yes yeah there was what did
00:47:28 they do king for a day it was like a tournament they held yeah the public would vote on who would
00:47:34 take over the channel for a certain amount of time afterwards that was like one of the less
00:47:40 complicated things they did yeah I heard of that people I know were like involved with that
00:47:46 um I saw um I saw a new video from that channel that makes the knives you know oh yeah the knife
00:47:53 shines out of weird shit well I saw a new video I didn't actually make it out of smoke did he make
00:47:58 it out of feelings no he made it out of bismuth but the um isn't that an old video but the the the
00:48:06 video well maybe but the video was called making a knife out of bismuth to correct an injustice
00:48:15 and I I don't know what that means I assume it has to do with like the lore because I know I
00:48:20 watched like a more recent one recently and like there's like a story to them now like there's like
00:48:26 aliens and stuff and people in masks oh my god and uh yeah there's like a hot like a the main
00:48:32 character got like taken hostage or whatever knife channel is turning and it didn't even have anything
00:48:38 to do with the knife he was making knife channels like yeah turning into a shown in anime yeah
00:48:45 it does it has like plot lines now it's like an abstract
00:48:49 shit people love getting creative with stuff like it's it's difficult to like make the exact same
00:48:54 type of thing over and over again and so I'm sure like youtubers like that where they're known for
00:48:59 exactly one thing they're like I don't just want to make another knife I want to make another knife
00:49:04 and also this and then people get into it it's so silly that's definitely a real thing with
00:49:12 YouTube is that when your channel is like you make one kind of video and you make it over and over
00:49:19 again for like some people can do that indefinitely and I have a lot of respect for that but a lot
00:49:26 of people it's like you either get tired of doing the same thing or you have to find some way to
00:49:31 make it interesting for yourself by adding new elements or you just have to like move on to
00:49:36 something else entirely and people tend to not like that a lot of people on YouTube just want
00:49:42 you to make the same content over and over again forever it's I mean it does every every concept
00:49:50 seems to wear out as welcome I was like a subscriber of the hydraulic press channel
00:49:55 which is like oh yeah it spearheaded the whole like crushing things and seeing what happens
00:50:00 they were like the first one but they also one of the biggest and they kept doing those videos and
00:50:05 it they like iterate a little bit with like the types of things they they try to do but at the end
00:50:12 of the day you turn on the video like oh what is what is it this time okay let's skip to the part
00:50:18 where it explodes watch that five second clip and be like hey well that was satisfying I guess and
00:50:23 then I don't know it's just like I keep seeing them in my my subscription feed and I'm like it's the
00:50:29 same thing I know it's just gonna be another one of these explosion things under pressure
00:50:34 I don't care anymore on sub like they didn't do anything wrong I just got tired of the concept
00:50:39 and I I I know that they're not like changing it up enough you know it's different from like an
00:50:46 educational channel but would you want but would you want to watch it if it had like weird story
00:50:52 lines about like I don't know like a villain shows up with like a different press and like
00:50:58 it becomes like a contest about which one can crush things better it's not about one of them
00:51:02 steals the press and they have to go on a trip to Europe to retrieve it hey I think it's it's not
00:51:07 really like my job to figure out how to continually make that one concept interesting it's just that
00:51:16 I am tired of that concept and because there's nothing else to it I'm done I don't know how long
00:51:23 those sorts of things can last like either the creator burns out or the audience loses interest
00:51:28 and you need something more timeless more like rewatchable once you've seen something explode
00:51:34 you don't really need to see it again unless it was incredible
00:51:39 yeah I think uh that's true like some concepts just have a longer shelf life than others like
00:51:46 you know if you're just crushing things with a hydraulic press over and over again like you said
00:51:50 eventually it's like okay I've seen enough things get crushed by a hydraulic press to
00:51:57 know what all of the other things will look like getting crushed by a hydraulic press
00:52:03 just the nature of these concepts Krug smash has said that he has no plans to ever make any
00:52:10 non-dwarf fortress related content because like dwarf fortress has like such a massive possibility
00:52:18 space uh within it that being said he does like I mean the whole the whole splatter face like
00:52:25 tournament thing was probably was him like experimenting with like what else can I do
00:52:29 with dwarf fortress aside from just like building and running a fort and like his his new the new
00:52:35 fort that he's that he took a break from to do splatter face it's called um the watchful eyes I
00:52:40 think and it's like it's totally different from his other forts because it's not like a big uh
00:52:45 industrial complex it's just like a a group of like six dudes like trying to like for it be a little
00:52:51 like a a band of rogues out in the woods in a shack somewhere uh so you know he he there's there's
00:53:00 you can mix it up you can mix it up in in many different ways there's many different strategies
00:53:05 one can employ I suppose yes very wise I find it to be like especially punk to to have like a list
00:53:16 of concepts that you want to make videos about making all of the videos and then stopping
00:53:23 like um like uh what was it every frame of painting they stopped once they had enough
00:53:29 of their ideas out there in video form and because of that they are like a complete package
00:53:35 and I occasionally go back and rewatch all of their videos because it's like ah it's just like a
00:53:39 series it's a box set those were very good videos they were very good videos but how can it be that
00:53:45 that person doesn't have any more like ideas of like here's a concept from film that I could
00:53:51 you know explain or or or dive into and discuss I ate no film so I don't know but um I mean
00:54:00 I I I know what you mean about it's cool to just like have a start and a stop you know it's like
00:54:05 it's like in bakuman you know they start making the fucking the fucking athello or the black versus
00:54:11 white the angel of manga like yeah yeah whatever it is it's yeah and then they're like and they try
00:54:17 to keep going they're like no we we had a story want to tell we just got to fucking get in tell it
00:54:23 and get out and when it's done it's done and that's how you make a fucking masterpiece and everyone was
00:54:27 like oh that's true yeah that's true but it's weird to do that about every frame of painting just
00:54:33 because that doesn't seem like the kind of thing that is like oh yep I've said all I have to say
00:54:37 about film I have run out of opinions on film it's it's not like opinions it's like the the
00:54:45 different methods of I think it's sort of the purpose that they had was to like give people
00:54:55 like a a a like a an easy to digest snapshot of like as many different film techniques and
00:55:03 ways to think about film as possible in easy to digest like videos and in that sense like they could
00:55:12 come back and like technically talk way more in more depth for hours about other things I don't
00:55:18 know that that was their mission statement as far as I understand I just like that it was a mission
00:55:21 statement and they finished it I will say I think a factor we're thinking about there is that like
00:55:28 the guy who made those videos was like a professional film editor and as a youtuber who has a day job
00:55:37 and likes my day job and doesn't want to quit it when you're in that situation the motivation
00:55:44 to make more videos is dramatically lower it's like I can it's like I can just quit this whenever
00:55:52 like I don't need this it's nice it's fun but like I'm under no pressure which is like a good
00:55:58 position to be in because like youtubers complain about burnout constantly but the flip side of
00:56:04 that is that you can be comfortable to the point where it's like I lose nothing by quitting this I
00:56:10 can just stop whenever I want I want I want I want youtubers to be so economically you know
00:56:19 distressed that they are just forced to churn out content the same the same content that I know
00:56:26 and love with with as little variation as possible please this the safest path to financial stability
00:56:32 should be their only path to survival that's that's the optimal ecosystem for me a consumer of content
00:56:39 just keep making the same content until you die that you're not allowed to have other jobs
00:56:45 all the good videos already exist there's no there's no point there's no reason
00:56:50 that's true that's true nothing will ever oh wait I've just had a great idea actually forget it
00:56:57 then I'm gonna come I'm gonna come back to making videos I'm nothing I'm gonna I'm gonna
00:57:02 ever top splatterface 2 championship bout I'm sorry but we peaked exactly two days ago as a society
00:57:09 what was that what splatterhouse thing the thing he was just talking about the entire yeah the
00:57:18 crumb smash tournament oh yeah you know sorry it was I wasn't listening and I will never listen to
00:57:23 you ever I know yeah yeah oh very nice oh cool give just her drip or fortress and immediately
00:57:30 zoned out look I know what they started there's small people and they're in a fortress and it
00:57:35 sucks to be them because they die constantly shut up they have a great time they love they love
00:57:41 drink and they love industry and if you run your fort well they get plenty of both all right if war
00:57:47 fortress will probably die in like a in like a werewolf attack would they be one block tall
00:57:52 in minecraft yes definitely um yeah because everything is a grid so everything would be
00:57:59 equally like wide and tall and deep everything is a cube um I do want to say I think I mentioned
00:58:06 before that my my roommates and I started a fort a couple weeks ago and it was called fern relics
00:58:14 and fern relics had a terribly just this week actually fern relics officially died several
00:58:20 weeks ago yeah okay fern relics was beautiful it was like it was built into the sides of this canyon
00:58:26 that these like that these two rivers converged in right so there was like cliff walls facing each
00:58:31 other well um you know we were just going about our business trying to like build and then but
00:58:38 there was a main bridge went over the top of the canyon uh with you know the canyon down beneath
00:58:44 it and just one day for no reason at all people are just milling about going over this bridge and
00:58:50 one dwarf just suddenly the full moon comes out and he turns into a werehorse and this werehorse
00:58:54 just goes apeshit on this bridge and slaughters like half the the population like 50 dwarves out of
00:59:00 like a hundred are just like bashed in with his hooves or like hurled off the bridge and fall
00:59:05 to their deaths and and because we live in an evil biome the the bodies of like all these slain
00:59:13 dwarves and animals like start coming back and they come back down in the river underneath the bridge
00:59:19 and the other dwarves find them so scary to see these like these like crawling undead like like
00:59:25 living that now like are just hanging out down in the bottom of the river that they can't cross
00:59:29 the bridge because they'll be trying to cross it and they'll see one of these skeletons moving and
00:59:33 then they'll get scared and run away um so nothing can get done in the fortress anymore
00:59:38 and then uh my friend took it took it for his year and he sent the our military on an expedition
00:59:44 to a necromancer's tower from which they never returned
00:59:48 and then like a huge swarm of like a hundred fucking ghouls and goblins and zombies just
00:59:53 like swarmed down from the north and just devoured everyone and and and murdered them butchered us
01:00:00 butchered us wholesale so we had to abandon that fortress but we started a new one i think a little
01:00:05 bit to the east and the new one is called it's so fucking cool the new one is called steel father
01:00:12 and steel father is we're going to we're gonna build up our army we're gonna go back and we're
01:00:17 gonna reclaim fern relics we're gonna fight back the undead scourge and i'm so fucking excited
01:00:25 because all i wanted all i wanted to do when fern relics was find steel all i wanted to do
01:00:29 was get up a steel smithing operation and we just didn't have the minerals for it we didn't have iron
01:00:34 we didn't have flux stones so i'm it would be so sad and tragic if steel father doesn't have them
01:00:39 either but my fingers are crossed it should be okay hey it should be okay hey ben if if i were to
01:00:45 like buy i don't know where to get i guess on steam dwarf fortress um how how come you don't have to
01:00:51 buy it oh is it just a free i think you can buy it on steam but like it's just free also oh okay well
01:00:59 then there's no reason to not try it but um how like difficult is it to learn is it like like you
01:01:07 need to study up or is it just to jump in and see what happens okay there there's a lot to learn
01:01:14 but like basically it's basically you just basically have to get familiar with it and like
01:01:19 there are guides like the wiki just has a guide that will like walk you through like the the first
01:01:26 uh actually krug smash has a video called your first fortress which just walks you through
01:01:30 building a basic fortress and introduces you to like the basic mechanics it basically dwarf
01:01:35 fortress is just a series of menus that you just have to like navigate to do the things you want
01:01:40 to do and if you don't know how to do something you literally just like go to the wiki and look it up
01:01:45 and like find out how to access that menu and like that's how you do it um so you just kind of have
01:01:50 to play for a while with like the wiki open so you can like know how to do things uh and it takes a
01:01:56 little while like probably your first like fortress will just be a complete wash and end up like a
01:02:01 hideous monstrosity and you'll die but that's fine yeah that's just the way it is yeah i do like
01:02:09 yeah like base building roguelite type of things oh you should give it a try give you should give
01:02:15 it a try like kenshi if it was if it feels like kenshi even a little bit i'd probably enjoy it
01:02:22 our our our fern relics fern relics had a thriving mug industry like all of our best
01:02:29 stone crafters were making these like masterwork mugs and and and trading them with the other
01:02:35 groups and one of the relics that someone made was a bone scepter that was topped with a golden mug
01:02:43 and uh our our mayor was our our mayor was named muggin melville we gave him the name uh muggin
01:02:51 could he drink out of it i i like to think that you could yeah i like to think that you could um
01:02:56 and then like yeah mayor mayor muggin melville i think she like i think in the werehorse attack
01:03:02 she got injured and went into a coma and then like she was still in a coma when the undead
01:03:08 attacked and killed everyone and i think they killed her in the coma but then she like was
01:03:14 risen from the dead as a zombie and like her and the other zombies just started like beating the
01:03:18 shit out of each other and uh my friend john the for like one of the first things he did in the new
01:03:23 fortress steel father was he built over the well he built a statue of uh uh of muggin melville as
01:03:31 like a menacing undead as like a warning as like a warning against like this is this is what we're
01:03:36 fighting against you know never forget the tragedy that befell fern relics oh what a fucking game
01:03:45 the epic highs and lows of dwarf fortress it's almost as exciting as watching the bitcoin ticker
01:03:53 it all just comes back to bitcoin eventually i'm almost as invested ben have you have you mentioned
01:04:00 that you sold it all i did yeah at the at the beat that was like the first thing i think i
01:04:06 mentioned this episode sold it all lost 200 bucks uh sad sad times in literally like one day i went
01:04:15 from being up by a thousand to down by 200 it was that bad easy come easy go
01:04:23 shit i've exhausted all the items on my list oh wow already yeah already uh what i know somebody
01:04:31 somebody else take over somebody tell somebody tell me what to think um uh well uh i mean the
01:04:41 only thing i've been doing the past week is my secret project my my secret mysterious construction
01:04:47 which is going along swimmingly same um same aside from that uh i've been oh i did a minecraft
01:04:55 hardcore right um but with the biome set to one biome desert so the entire map is desert
01:05:03 and it's hardcore so i have to try and fend for myself without the ability to easily collect wood
01:05:10 and it's actually really fun um because it involves a lot of uh figuring out how like you
01:05:16 have to find a village so that you can get food from them and then you have to trade and it's more
01:05:21 about like surviving than it is um just you know because minecraft is so easy you can easily become
01:05:29 super powerful and indestructible in a normal map but in a big desert uh it's it's scary you know
01:05:38 i've actually been i've actually been going into the pcp minecraft server once in a while
01:05:45 and just mining more marble just because it's fun i don't know oh uh give a hat next time next
01:05:52 time we do a shekels for heckles i have a present for you oh oh in the game wow cool i uh i won't i
01:06:00 won't say what it is uh i said a diamond maron pan is going to be very mad uh but uh i'm gonna i
01:06:09 don't care but you're gonna like it you're gonna like it a lot all right no it's not a diamond
01:06:17 it's better believe it or not it's better than a single two diamonds yes exactly uh i've also
01:06:27 been playing a lot of noita i think i talked about noita before the like road the dungeon roguelike
01:06:34 that is also like a sand simulator yeah that one's weird yeah i think i think we talked about it last
01:06:42 time because oh yeah because you or was it on the stream that you said that it was that was the game
01:06:46 he was germa was playing when that thing happened when the when the debt was accrued yeah yeah it's
01:06:53 you ever um you ever play one of those like sand simulators like the falling sand games
01:07:00 uh oh no it'll be like a it'll be like a black screen and you can is lemmings one of those no
01:07:08 what am i thinking of no it's like you it's like you can like build up piles of sand and then lemmings
01:07:14 walk around no you fuck what do you mean said like you draw like you draw like you draw like a
01:07:23 metal like a line like a bowl or something and you can like drop sand and the sand falls and it's
01:07:27 like pixelated particle effects and you can drop like other kinds of sand like gunpowder or something
01:07:32 and then you can take fire and you can put the fire next to the gunpowder and the pieces of
01:07:36 gunpowder will start going and there's you can have like weird gases and stuff oh wait i think i
01:07:42 i played one of these when i was in like high school or something like that like a long time ago
01:07:50 i mean they're they're fun to like fuck around with yeah noita noita is like it's like that
01:07:55 physics system but it's built like these dungeons that you like have these magic wands that you
01:07:59 like shoot bullets out of and you like are going around killing monsters and stuff and collecting
01:08:04 gold uh noita is so fucking hard i thought i was like getting pretty far into it but i wasn't
01:08:10 i got to like the fourth stage like a couple of times but there's like there's so many like
01:08:15 hidden zones and like there's like there's like levels beyond my wildest dreams i have like barely
01:08:20 even scratched the surface of it i suck at video games so fucking bad it's so embarrassing i always
01:08:27 joke that it's so cool though i growing up i was like pretty much exclusively like an rpg kid like
01:08:35 i played final fantasy and pokemon and like a few other similar jrpgs and uh now my joke is like
01:08:44 final fantasy are video games for people who are bad at video games and that also applies to kingdom
01:08:51 hearts yeah yeah i mean i played i played after like i got the playstation i think i was mostly
01:09:01 like an rpg guy you know i hadn't i hadn't nes uh as a little baby so i was you know i played like
01:09:09 you know platformers a bit i like platformers and stuff uh i'm best at like turn-based things like
01:09:15 pokemon i'm a pokemon master because i'm just like i'm just you know i'm just so intelligent
01:09:22 just so i have it's didn't think so many steps ahead of the average the average person it's just
01:09:27 like you know invincible huge brain individual uh yeah i mean i i've always been like a proponent
01:09:38 of like it's okay to be shit at video games it's okay to enjoy games in a casual way and be an
01:09:43 actual casual like straight up because that's me i don't like games that are difficult it is okay
01:09:51 but i really like noida and it is like frustrating to me that i'm like bad at it because i want to
01:09:58 win it because i like it well of course there's always going to be frustration when you lose
01:10:03 and you want to get good at things that's that's not the same as like and i mean it um like
01:10:09 feeling compulsion to be good otherwise well i feel i feel like i should be able to do it
01:10:15 because i've i've beaten hard games before like i've beaten i've beaten down well and i've like
01:10:20 you know i beat the old like hell binding of isek and stuff and i've beaten i've gotten pretty far
01:10:25 in like uh i think i've i've looped a few times in uh uh what's that one uh nuclear throne you know
01:10:33 is it safe i'm not like a complete shit game i'm not a complete shit game well hang on those those
01:10:38 all three of those so i expect better of myself all three of those games rely heavily on good
01:10:43 drops for like upgrades or whatever in between rounds or and stuff like that's heavily luck-based
01:10:49 all three of those noita kind of is too like that's that's why those games are fun and frustrating
01:10:56 because it's it's not it's not entirely just your skill it's also what you happen to come across
01:11:02 if you if you're good if you're good though you can you can do well in most games like that even
01:11:09 unless you get like the absolute shittiest of drops like most most games like that and like
01:11:15 even shitty drops like a good player can still like make that that's the thing i think i think
01:11:19 those games they they feel compelling to get good at quote-unquote to get far in them because in
01:11:26 the back of your mind you're always thinking well i could have got luckier if i played exactly
01:11:30 at that skill level but i got better drops i would have got further so there's still chance to get
01:11:36 further and it's like ah i didn't get as far as i could have if i got the right things
01:11:40 and but that you don't have any control over that so you just keep playing over and over
01:11:44 hoping to get the the perfect the lucky yeah it's yeah it's a bit of a slot machine yeah that way
01:11:53 sure but i think you were right in the sense of like if you play through these games enough
01:11:57 eventually like some of that luck sort of gets evened out by the fact that like you always
01:12:02 you're you're you've just learned all the mechanics so well that you can sort of make do even if your
01:12:07 drops aren't ideal so it does getting it does still have that getting sorry sorry it does still
01:12:13 have that um element of like challenging but rewarding like very much the uh dark souls of
01:12:19 video games getting good at binding of isaac was not about like you know being like really like
01:12:27 twitchy with my fucking finger movements or whatever like shooting bullets and just like
01:12:32 getting good at binding of isaac was about learning like where and under what conditions
01:12:38 rooms spawn and like how to use like keys and like what what like the most net benefit you're
01:12:45 likely to get from the way you use your early like keys and bombs and stuff to like uh true there's
01:12:52 like which which yeah yeah but um so what's my point my point is that it's um i don't know i've
01:13:01 been like looking up guides noida feels like like i have learned about noida and like how
01:13:08 like its wand system works and stuff like that and like various like material interactions like how
01:13:13 you can if you put water in it in toxic waste the water will purify it and turn it into water
01:13:18 which is very helpful to know but even though i've learned a bunch i have not made it that much
01:13:23 further and it's i feel like i feel like noida is genuinely a like is maybe more luck based than
01:13:30 something else like binding of isaac but you can kind of like strategize around i don't know uh uh
01:13:35 noida's frustrating noida's really frustrating it feels i yeah you can you can die you can die
01:13:42 with like no warning in noida if you get if you fuck up your toast and then i get mad and i pound
01:13:48 my desk and my roommates say ben why are you pounding your desk and i say shut up
01:13:52 told you never to ask about what i do i i've been uh fixated actually on a specific puzzle game
01:14:02 um pit cross or nonogram or whatever it's called um on this website because uh pit cross
01:14:09 it's like a grid and there's numbers on columns and rows and the the numbers correspond to
01:14:17 filled in squares uh that are like in groups so if there's a one three one that means you
01:14:23 know on that column or row there is one on its own three together and then one on its own in that
01:14:28 order and so you have to try and use uh the numbers on the on the on the rows and columns to figure
01:14:35 out which squares are like colored in and which ones are blank and it's so it's so like this is
01:14:43 my favorite kind of of like puzzle game where it's like a lot of deduction it's like a charlotte
01:14:48 homes which parts are like like guarantee that this block is colored in and then once i know
01:14:56 that information what does that tell me about the rest of the board and you can slowly get all of it
01:15:02 but this this particular site it like it randomizes the board uh like random number
01:15:09 generation just like comes up with things like pit uh pick two what did i call it pictogram
01:15:17 whatever that sometimes that they're made of like pictures so they they they like pixelated
01:15:22 pictures and if you know what the picture is you can kind of guess which is something i hate
01:15:27 i don't like being able to guess i like to be able to deduce everything so i do this random version
01:15:33 and it's it's so satisfying getting so far in this thing but every single time i get right to
01:15:42 the end there are a few squares which are like absolutely 50 50 coin flips as to whether they're
01:15:48 blank or not and i have to like roll the dice right at the end and if i get it wrong um i it says
01:15:59 mistake one like one mistake you fucked up you chose the wrong devastation it's like and and if you
01:16:06 completely game without getting any mistakes you get a big like oh wow amazing perfect and i want
01:16:12 that perfect so bad but the fact is it's like i hate luck based games i hate any game that has
01:16:20 a luck aspect to it and this game is so good except for the final little bit there's always a
01:16:27 fucking coin flip sucks i used to be super into uh hearthstone which is obviously a very different
01:16:39 kind of game but it's another one of those things where it's like because it's a card game there's
01:16:44 a lot of skill involved but there is also a tremendous amount of luck um and people
01:16:50 bitched constantly about the luck element because everyone is a salty bitch about losing and it's
01:16:57 always the developer's fault um naturally i i kind of feel hearthstone was all right it it like when
01:17:04 you lose in hearthstone it feels a little different from other games because it's like you build your
01:17:11 own deck most the time at least yeah and um you know you can stack your deck to be filled with
01:17:18 things that would make it more easily more easy for you to win if you get the right cards or like
01:17:24 you can you can have a safer deck that has less cool things well i'm saying this there's an element
01:17:29 of skill that goes into the luck of the draw which makes it less annoying than like uh some like
01:17:37 card games that use packs of cards where it's just like oh i have nothing fold can't fucking do it
01:17:42 um yeah i mean it like isn't it isn't in the sense that like that's true but what usually happened
01:17:50 was from my memory it was basically you'd get a like list of decks that basically everyone was
01:17:58 playing and oh yeah the meta was terrible yeah and so you'd always encounter like the same
01:18:04 shit over and over again and like eventually people got to the point where they're like if we're
01:18:09 all playing the same fucking decks like at what point is this just like luck of the draw um the
01:18:15 actual answer there is like none of you are actually that good so yeah a lot of it does come down to
01:18:20 that but like you know everyone thinks they're a 140 IQ genius so when you're really good at a game
01:18:27 like that you're not even just like it's not even about the cards entirely it's about building your
01:18:33 deck in response to like what decks everyone else is using yeah and like knowing what their what options
01:18:41 they have based off of what they've played already basically like being able to calculate okay if i
01:18:46 put this out where the odds gets a counter to me um yeah like yeah i i i remember certain points
01:18:53 where i would be watching like creperion videos about stuff just because it was fun and he would
01:18:58 play so many matches and i would see so many strategies that when i played it i was like
01:19:03 okay the meta for hunter right now is this and i'm fighting a hunter what is the likelihood he's
01:19:09 going to do these things hmm how should i play this sometimes it works sometimes i can actually
01:19:15 outsmart them because i know that they're trying to do a certain thing and i'm just not going to
01:19:19 let them do that one thing even if it means i'm not doing as much damage as i could otherwise
01:19:24 so it's a bit of strategy with that but yeah i don't know when i when i lost control of what
01:19:30 the meta was and i started losing everything i was just like whatever fuck it never again
01:19:37 i don't want to buy hundreds of thousands of packs to get all these new cards
01:19:42 i have i have avoided my my friends play uh magic and i have since like last year or so i
01:19:50 i have i have i think i made up my mind like i'm never playing another card game ever again
01:19:54 i i don't have the fucking mental energy to the vote i look to like a whole new side hobby like
01:20:00 that i just i just i don't want it i don't want it in my life i love card games but extremely
01:20:05 valid like they do consume a lot of mental like brain space and uh that's not something that
01:20:13 you necessarily want to commit to especially because you also end up like dumping a lot of money into
01:20:19 it it's like yeah uh yeah i mean there's that too mo it's it's the it's the it's the mental
01:20:25 energy though that's the real killer because i know you can build like you can build like a
01:20:30 pretty decent magic deck for like not too much money yeah they have like and if you want it to
01:20:34 be like good then it like takes exponentially more and more money there's like a whole format
01:20:38 to get it past being pretty good in mtg that's just based around using cheap cards i'm pretty sure
01:20:44 yeah yeah there are i mean there are uh i mean most of my most of my friends play uh uh what is it
01:20:51 the Highlander or the Elder Dragon EDM EDM EDH no ED yeah that's it EDH yeah they probably listen
01:21:01 to EDM Highlander right uh no they listen to like fucking they listen to uh like fucking
01:21:11 some i don't know i was maybe they didn't that's the soundtrack in my living room has been a lot
01:21:16 of like old uh uh like snes rpg uh soundtracks which is good and i like oh yeah that's the other
01:21:22 kind i always think of like when like music that like nerds listen to it's like a specific
01:21:28 kind of EDM i'm not sure like what the technical name is for it but it's discord i'm howlin yeah
01:21:35 yeah i always i always think of it as i always think of it as the EDM that furries listen to
01:21:41 um fuck yeah i don't know if there's a specific name for that genre it's that like electroswing
01:21:49 which oh swing music that's been put a funny beat on it you know like caravan palaces
01:21:56 no there are the people who did that music video with the furries getting into a bar fight oh
01:22:02 i i've seen that that there's a lot of blood and and a gazelle with tits yes yes yes yes
01:22:08 that's the one yeah caravan palaces is like that their genre electroswing which is like EDM
01:22:15 with swing influence um but like the double bass but sped up or something yeah yeah i think i
01:22:23 remember okay i might be off bass here but i think like last week vosh tweeted that like
01:22:31 he likes electroswing like that's all he's just said hey guys i kind of like electroswing
01:22:37 and i guess there was a big backlash people got upset that he said that no that makes sense i mean
01:22:43 just like i i watch a lot of anthony fantano and he has said on numerous occasions that
01:22:49 electroswing is like the only genre of music that is just bad like there is nothing he can
01:22:56 find about it that is any good and so it's so funny i'm pretty sure i mean okay okay but people
01:23:03 would have said that people must have said that about new metal back in the day and now it has
01:23:07 its defenders right i mean i don't you know he can't he can't seriously mean that new metal has like
01:23:14 i mean here new metal has like a couple of good songs like i don't know the alien ant farm
01:23:22 cover of smooth criminal and i think i think there's a case to be made for break stuff
01:23:29 i don't know that that's that's a limp biscuit to this it's like okay i i hate learning about that
01:23:35 song because now when i uh use the phrase it's just one of those days the first thing that
01:23:42 it's just one of those days yeah that's what pops into my head i'm like damn it fred durst okay
01:23:49 well i've i've never heard i don't know what electroswing sounds like but i i know that i have
01:23:53 like some real basic bitch taste in music um for i mean my canonically my favorite song is uh uh
01:24:03 what's the word uh what's that wake me up what's the word when you make it high pitched
01:24:08 no what's the word when you make it high course the night nightcore remix of hillary duff's come
01:24:13 clean is my my favorite song so so i probably would also like electroswing i feel yeah is there
01:24:19 is there like overlap because it's bad because it's bad yeah i would say the overlap between
01:24:24 nightcore remix um the audience for nightcore remixes is also the audience for electroswing
01:24:31 which is i knew it which is also the audience for um euro beat remixes of stuff euro beat brony
01:24:39 yeah euro yeah yeah and by extension discord um is also the audience for like vocaloid music so
01:24:50 why don't really i don't really like vocaloid stuff i've heard like a couple decent vocaloid
01:24:55 songs and then a lot of the other ones just sound like the same but worse yeah i'm with you on that
01:25:00 i cannot get into vocaloid i've heard a couple that sound good but most of the time yeah it's like
01:25:06 the the like there's a choppiness to the vocals because they're like you know computer generated
01:25:12 so it's always gonna sound a little bit off i like jazz fusion that makes me smart that makes me
01:25:21 i just need a song to have a real good like catchy like really energetic driving beat that
01:25:27 hooks me and that's all that's all i really need that's all i really need in a song uh and hillary
01:25:33 duff's got it baby do you think do you think nightcore country would improve country that's just
01:25:39 caught in ijoe it probably would it probably would yeah i mean any song is better if it's
01:25:47 nightcore because it's just faster which means like you're getting a higher density of like song
01:25:52 dude what if what if what if you do nightcore vaporwave then it would be just be normal
01:25:58 yeah that's true night nightcore um what's that what's that one vaporwave song
01:26:06 the the only one there is oh lisa frank 420 well that's the album or is that the song the album is um
01:26:16 uh fuck i don't know i always but yeah that song that song is just like a slow down album
01:26:22 is floral shop and the song is lisa frank 420 the lisa frank 420 is just like the really slowed
01:26:29 down version of whatever that that other song is so yeah if you nightcore it you just get the
01:26:34 original song back but better yeah exactly i'm like all distorted let's audio artifact it yeah
01:26:39 audio artifact yeah yeah just all fucked up it reminds me of that post that was like um
01:26:46 i've had enough of these uh lo-fi anime beats to relax and study to where are like the uh high
01:26:55 energy anime beats to dance and party to and someone was like nightcore hell oh my god i found it
01:27:03 nightcore lisa frank 420 here we go um enjoy uh uh wait wait here we go
01:27:13 somebody somebody's got me covered when you listen to this oh this sucks
01:27:20 it's not even faster it's just pitched up oh that's lame doesn't doesn't accomplish the goal at all
01:27:27 this is awful no whoever made this is a fucking hack and that's why they only got 523 views
01:27:32 down vote i disliked this no thank you disliked unsubbed i'm gonna subscribe and then
01:27:45 what a disaster devastating disappointment f got my hopes got my hopes up so high just like bitcoin
01:27:53 it got my hopes up so high only to just come crashing down really just cannot think about
01:27:57 anything other than bitcoin today i have today it's been months i have i have i have we i have
01:28:06 wean like at the beginning of this month at the beginning of this week it was literally it was
01:28:10 like i was literally like i had that on screen constantly and i was constantly looking at it
01:28:16 so i'm like i'm like i'm like i'm like asymptotically approaching you know zero bitcoin engagement
01:28:24 but like you know it's gonna take me a while it's gonna take me a while to disentangle myself
01:28:29 thank you walk thank you very much i'll get there i believe in myself
01:28:38 so what else what's uh what's what's what's what's going on what's your life what's your
01:28:43 life like um so my current project is i'm working on uh a new when posting goes wrong about sonic
01:28:52 for real justice i don't know if either of you have ever heard of this did you post a tweet
01:28:58 with some screenshot of like your file folder yeah that's the research for that okay i don't
01:29:05 know what that is at all okay so in okay so in 2015 right uh there was this blog that took over
01:29:18 tumblr for like a hot week or so and it was like an insane like fever dream of an event
01:29:26 while it was happening um basically this post went viral so the blog was called sonic for real
01:29:36 justice right um with a number four i said no no no um it was spelled out but basically like
01:29:45 at the time on tumblr there was like a backlash to the proliferation of like sjw content
01:29:56 and so you started getting blogs that were like anti sjw blank or blank for real justice and so
01:30:05 where they were like either just straight up i think some of them were just straight up like
01:30:09 right-wingers but a lot of them were like uh lgbt exclusionists so they were like sure trans people
01:30:17 who were like really like particular about who's allowed to call themselves trans or like people
01:30:23 who thought that like ace people weren't lgbt or stuff like that um i understand yeah and but the
01:30:31 thing is because it's tumblr and everyone ran like fandom blogs people started like crossing the
01:30:38 streams so you'd get like anti sjw kyogre or like naruto for real justice so like as other
01:30:48 other accounts that other people were running yeah so people would like start a blog where it was
01:30:54 like them and a bunch of their friends like um was it a was it a joke or was it like these people
01:31:00 were serious a lot of these people were serious where they were like face claiming quote unquote
01:31:07 like they were basically rp-ing as like various fictional characters talking about why like
01:31:14 neo pronouns are invalid and shit sonics the name i'll keep this short and sweet trans male gay true
01:31:21 scum anti special snowflake what you see is what you get just a guy who loves adventure sit back
01:31:27 grab some popcorn and enjoy the blog yeah so that was the original i'm looking at know your meme
01:31:33 that was the original mod sonic intro what really took off was the mod shadow intro which i'll do
01:31:38 my best yes i'm my shadow male and the atheist anti sjw anti feminist anti gun control pro logic
01:31:47 i chose shadow the hedgehog as an internet persona as i relate to him when it comes to his hatred
01:31:52 of humans or in my case social justice warriors these sjw's think that fighting fire with fire
01:32:00 will accomplish something well in the real world it won't i hope that one day these pathetic sjw's
01:32:06 will come to their senses um and unsurprisingly that post was a big hit and then people went to the
01:32:17 blog and what they discovered was like a tangled web of uh mod drama where i want i want to say
01:32:27 that it's it's tagged with like hashtag sjw hashtag anti sjw hashtag sysphobia
01:32:33 hashtag hetero phobia hashtag racism oh yeah they put like every possible tag on their intros
01:32:40 to try to get more people looking at them um yeah very nice but they'd like they because basically
01:32:48 it was like they created a bunch of rules for like what the mods are allowed to do and like what
01:32:53 they're not allowed to do and like almost immediately one of the mods broke a rule and they kicked
01:32:59 him out and then they all started going back and forth where people were like justice for mod
01:33:04 silver we got this guy who like has never said anything like they kicked him out for not posting
01:33:11 and then closing the ask box and they're like all right you're gone and then everyone immediately
01:33:15 rallied to his side people were like so invested in this drama um i think in large part because
01:33:23 of the absurdity of it all and and it was all like how how serious was it so like um so this
01:33:35 is kind of like the big twist at the end so if you don't want to be spoiled for the eventual
01:33:39 sonic for real justice video you can dip out now i i doubt anyway but um yeah basically
01:33:48 like uh they ended up after like a few a couple of weeks doing this they stopped getting as many
01:33:56 notes uh like people sort of stopped caring about the blog and so they eventually just like pulled
01:34:01 back the curtain they were like all right this was a joke like it was it was a whole time um damn
01:34:08 but the funny thing the thing i find like super funny is that after they they took off the mask
01:34:13 and told everyone what was happening they eventually brought it back um initially as a
01:34:19 danganronpa blog and then later they switched over to yugioh but they kept some of the danganronpa
01:34:26 characters and now they're back to sonic but like there's still characters from various other
01:34:31 franchises hanging out as well so it's kind of all over the place very nice but very nice
01:34:38 what we eventually but like if you kept following them after all that time which not a lot of people
01:34:43 did what you eventually learn is like the danganronpa phase ended because they brought on a bunch of
01:34:50 other mods because originally it was only like i think three people and i think they added a
01:34:55 bunch of other people who then started like actual serious drama with each other because they had
01:35:02 like a bad breakup and they tried someone tried to like accuse the other person of being like an
01:35:07 abuser which is pretty typical like tumblr material sure and then i'm glad i was never on tumblr
01:35:16 you're i dodged the bullet i feel like you both did and did not miss out there was a lot of good
01:35:23 stuff there but i mean it's like twitter in that there's like a lot of like there's funny stuff
01:35:28 on there and then there's also stuff that gives you brain damage i personally think tumblr is a lot
01:35:34 less harmful to my mental health than twitter because like on tumblr on tumblr you make a
01:35:40 bad like you'll see a bad post and you can like rest assured that it's like some 17 year old who's
01:35:47 like never left their hometown oh whereas on on twitter you see a bad post and it's some fucking
01:35:53 op-ed writer for the new york time exactly or like a fail son with like three high paying fake
01:36:01 jobs like yeah so it's just a very different vibe you know um so like um yeah but we eventually
01:36:12 learned so right very sorry um so they eventually had to like kick those people out and like reboot
01:36:19 but eventually someone they when they went back to the sonic theme they started a discord server
01:36:26 and a bunch of their fans got in it and at least one person like made a post where they
01:36:35 after talking to these people like full mask off where they were just being themselves they found
01:36:39 out that like the mods were aphobes and so yeah they they didn't think asexual people are lgbt
01:36:48 okay and so got it basically the big joke with sonic for real justice is that this was a bunch of
01:36:55 people pretending to be a group of exclusionists uh starting ridiculous drama with each other
01:37:04 while face claiming fictional characters and eventually it turned into a group of exclusionists
01:37:11 just actually starting drama with each other while face claiming fictional characters so the answer
01:37:17 to was it all a joke is yes but also no yeah i was just pretending to be smart i was yeah i was
01:37:26 just pretending to be joking essentially that's yeah that's like you you you would have to i don't
01:37:37 know you that's kind of what i expected because like like obviously this is ridiculous when you're
01:37:42 when you're being sonic and shadow but also like why would you commit to this bit like i don't know
01:37:47 you would you would have to have some level of commitment to it i don't know it's or that just
01:37:53 seems like the most likely thing like um this is a joke but it's a joke about like what they like
01:38:00 it's funny to them because it's what they actually believe i think they did exaggerate like they
01:38:05 definitely are they that's the weird thing is that they eventually said that they were like only
01:38:12 pretending to hold some of their views in that like i think originally they were like a lot more
01:38:19 arbitrary about like these specific kinds of non-binary people are like
01:38:24 trans-trenders or too cute or whatever the term is and then eventually too cute yeah it's this is
01:38:30 this is the deep uh lgbt lore right here um okay but but eventually uh they like later on in the
01:38:40 blog where they weren't like um where they were being open that they were playing characters
01:38:45 someone was like yeah we don't actually believe in that stuff we accept all non-binary people
01:38:49 but it's because the eighth the aphobia thing ended up being legit it makes you wonder how
01:38:55 many of their views were their actual views and how many of it was the character it's it's just
01:39:00 such a urban such as like playing with fire almost like you know going around oh uh i'm playing a
01:39:08 character online uh he's racist and he says racist things all the time and he hates different races
01:39:13 but you know the joke is that that's so silly like who would believe these things like why would you
01:39:19 even call out post i mean i don't know i've never watched filthy frank um but i've heard he's funny
01:39:26 and cool didn't didn't didn't filthy frank didn't he have a have a redemption didn't he turn around
01:39:32 and be like didn't didn't he quit because like he didn't like people taking seriously the stuff he
01:39:37 was trying to joke about it was a combination of things he quit in part because the like
01:39:43 filthy frank voice did like actual damage to his vocal cords and he couldn't do it anymore
01:39:52 which makes sense if you've ever heard him talk um but the but yeah i think part of it was that
01:39:59 like the problem with doing a character where the joke is this is the worst guy on the planet
01:40:06 and you're supposed to laugh at him is that the audience for that is actually just the worst guys
01:40:12 on the planet because they were the only ones who can tolerate that content long term um yeah
01:40:19 and so it was it was both things and also i think he just got sick of doing like shock content um
01:40:27 because what he did after that was he became a fucking lo-fi indie artist who is now like super
01:40:33 successful and popular and so i think he probably always wanted to do that to some extent um and
01:40:40 like i don't know good for him for like getting like a quote unquote real career but also i have
01:40:47 as a as a lo-fi like no come on no i think he was pretty successful like like in terms of
01:40:54 like all internet jobs are fake jobs that's like a no it's he's like he charts like when he puts
01:41:01 out new songs and everything he like um every music's fake music's not even real unless it's
01:41:08 every so often someone will like dig up like it's fake until you make it nightcore that's how you
01:41:13 make it real oh my god can we get someone can we get someone to uh pitch up and speed up some of
01:41:20 Filthy Frank's tracks thank you might make it more listenable only then will i listen i'm of the
01:41:26 extremely i have the extremely hot take that um the music that Filthy Frank made as pink guy when
01:41:32 he was making like dumb meme music is better than his like quote unquote serious music he's
01:41:39 made as joji because like there's a million guys making like lo-fi like sad boy indie pop but
01:41:48 there's only there was only one guy making a song about um letting a dog lick peanut butter off his
01:41:54 balls and like we're not gonna we're not gonna get that back you know it was a moment in time
01:42:01 and it's passed exactly sad uh i never uh i never watched Filthy Frank either uh i just know him
01:42:12 from wearing a pink suit and i've heard that he said funny things he had a couple of funny videos
01:42:19 but like i said the problem with playing the worst guy on the planet is that it's kind of hard to watch
01:42:25 a lot of that content sure is he like an idubbbz or was he like an idubbbz type
01:42:32 or is it yes more extreme was it in fact i'm pretty sure he was like i'm pretty sure he was
01:42:39 friends with some of those guys yeah i mean i like idubbbz he's a bit of a strange guy but he's cool
01:42:46 oh
01:42:53 i'm too busy i'm too busy getting bitches in the real world to be watching all these uh
01:42:58 all these fucking youtubers yeah based yeah it's based based on you having zero bitches
01:43:06 i collect them and then i hang them on my shelf
01:43:17 tell me more tell me tell me more no fact no give us more content more content more content
01:43:26 you don't have any more content um then we're gonna have to move on to voicemails
01:43:30 and you know what happens when you move on to voicemails she gets weird and it gets scary oh god
01:43:36 i mean i'm looking forward to getting weird and scary because i'm just curious
01:43:40 i don't know now now they're gonna be lame and stupid this is only two modes of the voicemails
01:43:46 yeah historically historically they're usually lame and stupid so
01:43:53 should we do should we do some should we do some voicemails might as well yeah
01:43:57 okay uh all right yeah not nonchalant committal to voicemails okay i'm sure i'm sure our callers
01:44:07 appreciate the lack of enthusiasm that's fine all right no they love it they get off on it
01:44:14 okay so this one is called let me just scroll back to where where was it okay this one is called
01:44:22 why star bomb is shit three two one go hey dickhead here i've been thinking uh since the one
01:44:30 gamers to after an episode where they mentioned uh star bomb why i hate star bomb so much despite
01:44:35 locking dan's uh just as an artist and i think i found out the reason is just that star bombs
01:44:41 really shitty youtube video essays put to really unfunny songs essays like game theory is mario a
01:44:49 sociopath game theory can i stick my penis in a gerudo links bussy uh game theory doesn't
01:45:00 final fantasy seven have such a wacky plot i mean it's um i just really hate it it is yeah i've
01:45:08 never it's it's vile it doesn't have like a game theory vibe it has like the it has like the reddit
01:45:14 like epic bacon yes the epic bacon video game like what if mario's real like played out like in
01:45:22 like before the the before the 90s i i've never i've never like found themselves trapped inside
01:45:28 their favorite video games i was like raging like like foaming at the mouth at people like doing
01:45:34 mario in real life things uh before i was born i hate that shit yeah that's that's valid um
01:45:43 someone once described um dany sex bang as uh a dude who's like 40 years old and his entire
01:45:50 personality is that he has sex with girls who play legend is elda and that really does play out
01:46:01 in his music and i feel like he definitely got some good girls who play legends he definitely
01:46:09 got some good songs out of that devastating like there are limits you know you can only do that
01:46:14 shtick for so long before it gets old i have i have not listened to much the first time i heard
01:46:19 unicorn wizard but the first time i heard unicorn wizard i thought it was really funny but then
01:46:23 like the more the more uh ninjas x party i heard the more i was just like okay all right that's
01:46:30 it's very one note in in terms of like i don't know what he what he feels like he can sing about
01:46:36 and starbomb was even more like just like like locked in on like well let's take a video game
01:46:44 that's uh you know a Nintendo franchise and like i don't know i mean i think starbomb was like that
01:46:49 i think starbomb was like that on purpose starbomb was like that on purpose because i
01:46:53 kind of think it was made to be marketable it's made it's made to be like lowest common denominator
01:46:57 like video game humor it's just so it's so much worse than what they say on game grumps i just
01:47:03 it's exactly the same vibe as um do you guys remember brental floss i know of him a little
01:47:11 sort of yeah same vibe is him same vibe is like all like nerd core um a genre that i think uh
01:47:22 deserves to be made fun of um wait what's nerd is it just like referencing things that are cool
01:47:30 as in it's it's rapping about nerd things it's not a very good combination my i run a patron
01:47:42 discord server for my hardcore simps and someone in that server introduced me to the world of league
01:47:48 of legends hip hop oh no um which just reinforced my joke that it's called uh lol because you gotta
01:47:58 take twice the ls when you're playing that game i i totally i i believe it is there is there like
01:48:05 um i think the problem is like fighting game hip hop the the huh what i could i could i could see
01:48:12 there being hip hop about league of legends like i could see there being hip hop about like fighting
01:48:17 games because like the fighting game i don't know like the competitive the competitive atmosphere of
01:48:23 it i don't know feels like it's something you could write fucking angry raps about yeah i think i
01:48:29 mean if they have it for league of legends i would think they would have it for like
01:48:33 street fighter but maybe not maybe i'm no you can you can do it it's just fucking stupid i think oh
01:48:40 well so is all human endeavor to get right down to it in general as a theme is usually
01:48:48 stupid and lame but there's a few examples of like have you heard of protoman i got introduced
01:48:56 to them recently they they it's a mega man um they or they made two albums protoman act one and two
01:49:03 i can't remember what i think that was what i know protoman um and they were like prog rock like um
01:49:10 epics operas right yeah like uh like rock operas and and like the production was very good and it
01:49:17 wasn't just like listing the mega man characters it was like a story was being told with these
01:49:24 characters as like a base of inspiration and i was like okay you know that's actually pretty good music
01:49:29 but it's video game um but when you when it's when it's like when it's like music video game
01:49:37 like i i don't think it's like a a guaranteed fail machine to talk about video games in in songs
01:49:43 it's just like a lot of the time what gets people hyped up is just hearing the franchise they know of
01:49:49 and then the amount of like creativity that you need to put in for something like that to be
01:49:55 successful is so low that people often don't need to try and so they don't and so they just
01:50:01 i can imagine the league of legends hip hop is just talking about a video like a like a like a
01:50:06 match and something bad happened and they got fucked up and they died and they lost hate hit points
01:50:13 and they just sing about it for a little while it's like oh yeah i love league of legends i'll
01:50:17 click on like and subscribe and pay i think you're on to something in the sense that like
01:50:22 because you're just trying to get people who like the game to click on it by virtue of liking the
01:50:28 game the song doesn't need to be as well produced yeah because i think actually because while we
01:50:35 were discussing this i remembered the one example of like a dude who makes songs that's just that's
01:50:41 everything that brony's ever made yes um but that just reminded me of like the one example of like
01:50:49 people making music about nerdy things that was actually good which is fucking uh ken ashcorp
01:50:55 who makes songs about like hentai but somehow makes it like listenable and catchy so it's like
01:51:02 you can do this um but like but it's so easy to not it's it's so easy to not bother and still
01:51:11 succeed so it's like yes it's gonna be a lot of crap of that type exactly i think that's that's
01:51:19 reasonable i've heard of ken ashcorp i've never heard their i want to i want to hear like a sudoku
01:51:26 rap oh my god a minesweeper like uh well uh wait wait who was that who was that digimon
01:51:37 youtuber who i was we were talking about a while ago and like that guy wrote original like digimon
01:51:43 i don't think he wrote raps i think he made like heavy metal songs uh maybe he rapped i don't remember
01:51:49 you could do like metal heavy rap i could actually see doing metal about video games
01:51:55 more than hip hop about video games because like a lot of metal is already like the the lyrics are all
01:52:01 like like fantasy shit like a lot of there's like a long history of of metal that's just about like
01:52:08 dragons and like um like lord of the rings shit and i feel like it's like not that much of a jump
01:52:15 you know can't find his fucking name uh that fucking guy he was he was he was my hero i wanted to
01:52:28 love anything as much as that guy loved digimon fuck okay whatever uh commenters let me know
01:52:39 um next voicemail yeah yeah let's go okay here we go here we go that one wasn't that bad
01:52:45 that one was okay okay yeah we're on it we're on it we're on a roll we're on a streak of one
01:52:51 uh this one is called wall street bets oh boy three oh god it's a minute thirty fuck you wall
01:52:57 street three three two one go all right so ben i know you're really interested in bitcoin
01:53:09 i was bitcoin sucks okay terrible investment facts shout out would not invest it myself because
01:53:15 of the high volatility uh same with you gib i know you don't invest but you should actually consider
01:53:22 investing you misinvested that one way to make money you will have to be a capitalist in order
01:53:28 to utilize the tools in your tool belt for capital appreciation so the fucking thoughts
01:53:34 that first find your portfolio etc if you want any more information about this google
01:53:42 that's your best friend for it but also consider opening a account with robin hood not a sponsor
01:53:49 but not a sponsor no i don't even know how to start this podcast i didn't thank you for us today
01:53:57 who would be paying this motherfucker and you can still buy bitcoin with that okay is robin hood a
01:54:01 if you want to buy bitcoin for cheap well not cheap but uh have no fees because i didn't know
01:54:06 paypal has fees either and i was gonna never did buy it on robin hood no commissions at all
01:54:13 easily sign up and if you guys are for each other you get a free stock so everyone wins but
01:54:19 i want you to look more into stock investments uh really look into it and actually try to
01:54:27 maximize your returns he's right he's right i know that like over the over the long run
01:54:32 over the long run he's he's best to invest in the market itself this guy has the capitalist voice
01:54:38 i'm going to want i'm gonna give legitimate advice here if you actually want to make money
01:54:45 investing the way you do it is that you invest in what's called the vfi and x which is the vanguard
01:54:52 index fund which is basically it just tracks the s and p 500 and whatever the s and p 500 is
01:55:01 worth that's how much it's worth um and that's like the only good investment because as we have
01:55:09 learned this year uh the forces that be will do literally anything they can possibly come up with
01:55:17 up to and including killing hundreds of thousands of people just to make that number keep going up
01:55:24 and so that's great if you're that's a great idea and so if you're invested in just that
01:55:30 you're going to keep making money i'm literally going to fucking fuck bitcoin i'm putting all
01:55:37 my savings in no and the better right now that's like actually a legitimate strategy and the thing
01:55:42 about it is that it's like unlike bitcoin for example the reason why it's nice is that you don't
01:55:48 have to watch it and in fact if you do watch it that's actually a bad thing because if you see it
01:55:53 like yeah go down a little bit you're like oh shit sell everything and then it just goes back up
01:55:56 like two weeks later and you're like fuck so yeah it actually like takes that burden off you that comes
01:56:03 with a lot of like day trading and other kinds of investment where you have to like constantly
01:56:07 be thinking about it it's just you set it and forget it and you get like a little return
01:56:12 every year and it's boring but like you make a little money okay do you get more than do you
01:56:17 get more than you'd get from just your typical high interest savings fund yeah yeah definitely
01:56:23 more than uh than a savings account well sounds good i was i was i was considering i was looking
01:56:31 at like which saving funds give the highest like yearly return the other day and i was like there's
01:56:35 got to be something better there's got to be something better than like 1.9 percent i'll think
01:56:40 about it later yeah i never did this is more like five to ten i think depending on the year
01:56:48 yes i love money no i love money so much it's the worst thing ever no it's thinking about
01:56:55 investments and give me give me yours i just makes me want to uh not think about it it's what it
01:57:03 makes me want to think about it makes me want to just makes me want to go just makes me want to go
01:57:08 drown myself in minecraft just makes me want to go leap off a fucking skyscraper just makes me want
01:57:15 to go climb to the top of the slime corp headquarters and die on the fucking pavement of downtown new
01:57:20 los angeles city aka neo milwaukey in minecraft which you can do on the fucking pcp minecraft server
01:57:28 link in the description so literally in minecraft yes literally in minecraft yeah that's what i want
01:57:34 to do that's what i want to do um okay next voicemail is called what is this one called this is um

01:58:27 mean um um this yeah this guy did i'm trying to find it i clicked off before the voicemail was done
01:58:32 but i think i get the gist um yeah this guy did send me a uh an application notorious revolution
01:58:41 a guest i was it like a resume yes it's literally a resume and i just i didn't i didn't respond because
01:58:50 i didn't know i didn't know how to respond i kind of feel bad i sort of don't want to like i sort of
01:58:57 don't want to rip into this guy too much because he's like very earnest you know what i mean yeah

01:59:09 resume there's his pcp resume he is a soon to graduate computer science student uh and and
01:59:17 and i mean the thing about it is that like i don't know there has there has not we have never
01:59:24 accepted a guest on the show based on a resume yeah it's the it's pure nepotism it's pure nepotism
01:59:31 it's just do we know you or if not that do we watch your videos yeah i got um when i was doing a
01:59:37 podcast a little while ago i got an email from some dude who was like hey can i be on this and i

02:00:13 if you want to be on the podcast you you can't really just ask and say like i i have opinions and i
02:00:23 i know matt and koff from rfck i mean is that what he said is that in here near the bottom
02:00:29 like i'm sure i'm sure he has his own rfck wiki page i'm sure you're cool on rfck.mirahease.org
02:00:35 but i i think wiki slash notorious revolutionary tommy j i think it would be like i don't know if
02:00:41 you wanted to be on the pcp and spout an opinion about something a better way to do it would be
02:00:46 through the voicemails i just just talk about whatever and then we could discuss it through
02:00:52 that i don't know if this is like this is this is adorable but uh yeah yeah i don't know the point

02:08:29 i mean he rewrote the lyrics to be about someone who's a wagey and working bread garlic
02:08:35 house is not a wagey bread garlic house owns the means of production so i don't know i i don't
02:08:41 know aside aside from the bread garlic house um it's it is a cool problem to have that you just
02:08:48 you're too busy to procrastinate i think that's pretty good god i wish that were me as long as
02:08:53 you're not like sad about it i was working on my secret thing yesterday and i was just like
02:08:59 i really i really got into the groove of it like the whole day went by i got all kinds of things

02:09:26 can put that on your tombstone and take that to the bank you can take that to the bank and smoke it
02:09:33 uh next voicemail is called where is it here we go it is called use your natural assets to
02:09:41 incept ideas into the common man oh no okay three two one go what's up pcp let me tell you a story
02:09:52 i am a six three blonde person living in the suburbs of japan so needless to say i stick out
02:09:58 now the other day i went to my local supermarket to do some grocery shopping and in the entrance
02:10:03 part of the store they have two hand sanitizer dispensers nice i was a fairly busy time of day
02:10:10 so we were a bunch of people entering the store at the same time in like a line with me at the back
02:10:17 as we were entering a single japanese man was exiting the store and used the hand sanitizer
02:10:21 dispenser on his way out upon entering none of the people ahead of me used the hand sanitizer
02:10:27 dispenser at all so i thought hmm now after doing my shopping the tables had turned and now i'm the
02:10:34 one exiting the store as a new batch of people enter so on my way out i use the hand sanitizer
02:10:40 dispenser in view of all the entering people so upon exiting i look back at the entrance to see
02:10:47 that everybody who just entered were now like queuing up at the hand sanitizer dispenser to
02:10:52 use it so basically i am a hero and a manipulative mastermind using my foreigners as a power to
02:11:00 do good do you all have any epic idea inception stories please tell us so until next time you
02:11:09 accepted the idea of getting all these easterners to use the hand sanitizer by using the hand
02:11:18 sanitizer that the store had put out for people to use am i reading this correctly i think which
02:11:26 is extra hilarious because the implication the implication here is that because he's white
02:11:32 they wanted to do the thing he was doing because they didn't care when the first guy did it i would
02:11:39 i would think that the fact that you are look weird would make them like less likely to just do
02:11:44 what you do i don't know i don't know if i agree with the conceit that if if if you see somebody
02:11:51 using the hand sanitizer if i do it if i see someone i'm like oh yeah i should do that because
02:11:56 it's like it's just sensible like you wouldn't if you're not thinking about it and then you see
02:12:00 someone do it you'll be reminded oh yeah that's probably a good idea yeah i i guess if you go in
02:12:05 and there's the hand sanitizer but no one is using it maybe you don't think oh i should go use it
02:12:10 yeah people just and maybe you see the first person go use it and you go oh okay everyone
02:12:14 it's like at a party you go to a party and no one's eating the food and no one wants to be the first
02:12:19 one to eat it and then but then someone eats it it's like okay i can have some nice um so i guess
02:12:25 that's true following mentality it's it's something everybody has a little bit of have i ever have i
02:12:32 ever incepted an idea into a crowd uh no i'd like to think i've i've sometimes done that but like
02:12:39 it's never been particularly like interesting just sort of i don't know i held the door open for
02:12:45 someone or whatever and that sort of made a queue behind me of people holding door open for other
02:12:50 people whereas before it was just being swung in people's phases i've seen that happen a couple
02:12:55 times but it's like you know whatever nobody wants to look like the less cool the less good person
02:13:02 so everyone gets manipulated into doing it i can't say i've had an experience like this i will say
02:13:07 though as a as a gaijin as a white person living in japan uh i appreciate this person
02:13:14 for um well wait are you a guy no no no i'm saying i'm saying like okay based on my knowledge of
02:13:19 gaijin um yeah because i have a couple of friends who live in japan um he said sayonara at the end
02:13:26 but i appreciate that other than that he did not use any gratuitous japanese throughout his message
02:13:33 where he really didn't need to use it um like he could have common he could have very well said
02:13:41 going going to my local super that's the grocery store he could he could have he could have started
02:13:48 the email with a voicemail konnichiwa yeah that's a that's a joke that's a that's a there's a there's
02:13:58 this samurai who is after me because i stole some sacred scrolls it's not a don't worry about it look
02:14:04 deep i shouldn't i i shouldn't have even brought it up honestly but yeah he could have done like
02:14:09 all according to keikaku and shit um and he chose to restrain himself he chose to contain the uh the
02:14:18 weeb instinct and i have a certain degree of respect for him even if i think this story is
02:14:25 kind of lame honestly yeah it's a little lame it's just that you did a thing and people saw you
02:14:31 doing it and we're like oh it's too bad i sometimes feel i i i know the feeling that i sometimes feel
02:14:37 a bit of pride when there's like something that people should be doing that they aren't and i'm
02:14:41 like well i'm gonna show them i'm gonna do it in view of all these people who i know are watching
02:14:45 me because i i have anxiety about that and i'm i'm certain everyone's watching me do this cool
02:14:49 thing that's good they'll think i'm so good and they never do they never they never pay any
02:14:56 attention it's all in my head uh next voicemail yes next voicemail is next voicemail is just called
02:15:05 ben three two one go
02:15:13 it's like i under water okay yeah right he just like set it through his through a blanket i don't
02:15:21 know i don't know thanks thanks for the voicemail i guess uh next one next one is called flat
02:15:29 three two one go
02:15:33 look the only way you can prove that the earth is round is you need to circumnavigate north to south
02:15:40 and you need to make sure you're going in a perfectly straight line
02:15:45 and you need to need to record how we're doing
02:15:54 this is so bad
02:15:58 i'm too lazy to look into it uh so i'm just gonna just add until until someone present evidence
02:16:04 otherwise okay i can't uh bro fix your fucking mic i can't why is sent like it felt like this guy
02:16:11 knows how to make a voicemail he's doing this on purpose um for some reason yeah i couldn't i

02:19:56 is called yes it's called why are women racist frowny face three two one go so i'm on tinder right
02:20:06 and i see this girl who says she likes cooking and working out and i'm like hey i like cooking
02:20:10 and working out and she's pretty cute okay so i'm a messenger and i'm like uh hey you want to go on
02:20:15 a date i could make you dinner you know wink and smiley face as you do and she's like ha ha
02:20:21 nah but i'm not really sure why i added you i only date black guys and i'm like oh all right you
02:20:27 know she she didn't like that cute approach time to time to be cool no it's too late let me try again
02:20:32 at that point hey girl you want me to smash that and she's like ha ha no but i am serious
02:20:39 what the fuck halisha you racist bitch why are women like this pcp wait i had a tweet about this
02:20:48 literally like a day or two ago wait wait but i think was the joke there that the girl was black
02:20:55 was her name did she have like a black name wait does that make a difference let me back what
02:21:01 what he's he said the girl's name i'm gonna have to play part of this i'm just i'm i'm curious
02:21:07 like she said i only date black guys and then he like responded as if he were a black guy was that
02:21:14 his bit no no the bit was that he just changed well let's show yeah yeah he gave her like a
02:21:22 like a stereotypical sounding like black girl name so no my tweet does not apply um yeah he's
02:21:28 just he's just making a racist joke i i thought he said Clarissa in which case your would tweet
02:21:33 your your tweet would apply yeah is that the tweet by the way was about the the genre of
02:21:41 white girls who uh who make a liking black cock a core of their personality yeah is that common
02:21:48 is that common outside of like porn it's more common than it should be that's for sure um there
02:21:55 is an entire i watched like a whole video about this the other day um they're like i've i've
02:22:02 used to back when i was uh still on tinder uh as a man no less i did encounter a few of them um
02:22:09 obviously did not actually get any messages out of that but i could tell well if they didn't like
02:22:16 black if these white girls didn't like black cock they'd be fucking dogs instead so we should
02:22:20 count our blessings jesus christ i uh one time i was at work and one of my co-workers was talking
02:22:29 like very casually about like taking a bath with her dog and i'm like why are white women like this
02:22:35 there's giving your dog a bath and then there's taking a bath yeah no no like taking a bath with
02:22:41 your dog i was like do you people have no about wait isn't that be extremely like messy and annoying
02:22:50 did the dog consent to the bath you fucking psychopath there's no reason to do that that
02:22:55 oh maybe it was a small dog maybe it was a tiny little dog because like i'm imagining like you
02:23:00 know you take a dog on a walkie get him back and then he's just like like running all over the place
02:23:07 shaking and then you try to bath him and there's like splashing everywhere it's like yeah i can't
02:23:13 imagine taking a like a bath with a dog they'd go insane they'd go all over the place if it's like
02:23:19 if it's like a little a little like chihuahua like a little doxin or something that's like handheld
02:23:26 maybe yeah but the size of a nintendo 3ds what you you just you just you just a multitask you
02:23:35 can like oh you can bathe yourself and your dog at the same time why not i mean you get my little
02:23:40 life preserve and i can splash on the in the other end even if it is convenient i still wouldn't do
02:23:46 it this is weird it's just weird i just don't want to you just gotta do that you'll get dog um stuff
02:23:52 dog dirt in your bathwater that's not good um um uh but to this guy um yeah women be racist indeed
02:24:05 women women be racist uh it's next voicemail wait what no say no no it's no come on say it no
02:24:16 it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a thing i was gonna say it was just like i was just gonna say oh it's
02:24:21 true lol but it's like who cares this is stupid wall wall lmao uh next voicemail is called uh cross
02:24:30 source material and adaptations three two wait hold on
02:24:37 is it is it is it racist to say you only date black guys because what i think what i think the fact
02:24:43 okay i actually do this on this day the fact that she did add him means that she was maybe willing
02:24:49 to date him even if he's not black but she said that after he messaged her so i think she didn't
02:24:55 like his approach changed her mind and was like i only date black guys in the same way she might be
02:25:00 like uh no i have a boyfriend or uh no i'm a lesbian which is just like oh right i don't want to talk
02:25:06 to you i don't want to say no because that's sad that makes me feel like a bad and changing your
02:25:10 approach being like hey why don't we we could make dinner together wink and then she's like ha ha
02:25:15 no and then be like okay new approach uh baby let me fucking smash that put it doesn't that's not
02:25:20 gonna work it's transparently like you're changing your like that's a really weird
02:25:25 and like you're i don't know i think i think you just put her off i think this is what happened here
02:25:30 well what we have to consider here is the fact that this is a fake story that didn't actually
02:25:36 happen that he made up for the voicemail um because that could be a scenario make way more
02:25:42 sense because the punchline it's it's just to build up to the punchline that she has like a
02:25:48 stereotypically black name like that's it's just like a dumb black i don't even know how that's a
02:25:54 joke really it's not it's because it sucks you know what you know what i am taking this
02:26:01 seriously only date black guys anyway it's it's not even a is that a i don't know whatever
02:26:09 um like like like what about her being a black girl would have been a clue for him to be like oh
02:26:15 she would only like black guys and then and him getting upset is like the joke is like ah you
02:26:22 should you shouldn't have got upset because of of course she would like black men only because
02:26:27 she's black i don't get what the is that like reality does that happen the punchline the the
02:26:33 rug is meant to be pulled out from under us when we initially agree with him like yes this girl is
02:26:40 racist for only wanting to date black guys but then aha the twist ah but she was black and black
02:26:46 people can't you see it's just such a strength i don't think i think i mean either way the joke
02:26:52 sucks so i don't think it matters yeah okay all right we should move on i've given this i've given
02:26:58 i've got we wasted a lot of time on that guy too much time this one is called cross source material
02:27:05 in adaptations three two one go so i recently watched all eight harry potter movies and did
02:27:12 not like any of them and this got me thinking about whether or not reading the books would have
02:27:17 made the movies better seeing as i have not read any of them and that got me thinking about the
02:27:21 relationship between adaptations and the source material they are adapting should an adaptation
02:27:26 assume that its audience has read the source material how much should an adaptation be compared
02:27:31 to the original versus judged on its own merits and is your opinion of an adaptation given more
02:27:37 or less validity depending on if you have also consumed the source material discuss i have the
02:27:43 second one um i have an actual hot takes on this okay as for the second question uh everything
02:27:50 should be able to stand on its own if you need to have done other reading to get the most or
02:27:56 it should be able to be like acceptable and you know at least good you know
02:28:05 with potential room for improvement if you know but it should be able to stand perfectly well
02:28:09 on its own without needing to have seen the adaptations or like the source material or
02:28:14 whatever um i don't know about like whether your opinion matters more if you've read the book and
02:28:21 watched the film i think you could make a perfectly good movie that assumes that someone
02:28:28 has read the source material and like simply doesn't give a fuck about like anyone that hasn't
02:28:35 sure but then but then i would i would like personally i would just think of that as a
02:28:40 worse movie because there's plenty of ways to make an adaptation be perfectly good on its own
02:28:47 despite source material like lacking things from the source material if we're talking about books
02:28:52 that always happens books and film all right um i'm i'm gonna come through with some hot some
02:28:58 spicy opinions on this first of all i don't think you should have have to have uh seen the source
02:29:04 material in order to consume the adaptation because quite frankly i do not want my media to come with
02:29:10 homework uh but more importantly i think every adaptation should stand on its own
02:29:17 because the best adaptations are the ones that uh fully utilize their medium to the fullest extent
02:29:26 like for example the godfather is an adaptation of a book that like critically no one cared about
02:29:35 it was just like a decently popular piece of genre fiction but like it wasn't like the greatest
02:29:42 one of the greatest books of all time but it was adapted into one of the greatest movies of all time
02:29:46 because the filmmaking took like full advantage of the medium and created a piece of entertainment
02:29:55 that only works it like works better as a film like once you like the reason it's so good is
02:30:00 because of the filmmaking and not because of the story underlying it and so similarly if you're
02:30:06 going to do like a book adaptation a really good book adaptation would take advantage of the fact
02:30:10 that it is a book and not just try to you know like recreate a movie or whatever so i think and
02:30:18 like the same goes with like video games like a video game adaptations or like video games based
02:30:24 off of like other media usually suck because they're just trying to like recreate the other media
02:30:32 like point for point and it's like always kind of underwhelming um and like the few times that
02:30:38 isn't the case is when it kind of goes off in its own direction like knights of the old republic
02:30:43 or something like that so i think adaptations should be allowed to just be their own thing
02:30:48 entirely because they're usually better um when you let them do that yeah that's probably the
02:30:55 objectively right answer but actually here's what here's my uh dissenting opinion uh not really um
02:31:06 i don't know i'm i'm really i'm struggling to justify like what's what's like what's an example
02:31:11 of like an adaptation or a sequel or something that like doesn't that is like totally inaccessible
02:31:19 that is made to be totally inaccessible to anyone who doesn't know the source material
02:31:24 but like it's still good and i i mean it's obviously it's not gonna it's not gonna stand on
02:31:30 its own it probably won't be like you know it can't become like a timeless in a way that something
02:31:35 like godfather does uh oh you know what's gonna be cool though there is actually a good example of
02:31:41 this please give me one have either of you seen revolutionary girl utena i know we've talked
02:31:51 about it on this show a bunch of times but i've never seen it oh that's funny yeah so revolutionary
02:31:56 girl utena is a very very good anime one of like the best anime of the 90s highly recommend it but
02:32:04 after it finished um they decided to do a movie of it because it was so successful
02:32:10 and rather than do like a sequel or a prequel or whatever um the neon genesis avingelian end of
02:32:19 ava you you can't you can't you can't watch that without like knowing that's the plot that's another
02:32:25 very good example is that would you really think of that as an adaptation of a source material
02:32:31 though i think that's just like a different thing as a part two like a so it is in a different
02:32:38 medium my is okay correct me if i'm wrong doesn't end of avingelian because the last few episodes
02:32:44 of avingelian take place in shinji's mind isn't end of avingelian just what's happening outside
02:32:50 his mind during those episodes it's it's not it's not i mean you can interpret it that way
02:32:57 or you could say that end of ava is basically just like they rewrote the end of of of the first
02:33:04 one and they are like competing cannons with each other gotcha uh or something but something like
02:33:10 that yeah um what were you saying about utena though yeah yeah yeah so utena is basically
02:33:17 instead of like doing a sequel or something for the movie um ikuhara the creator utena decided to
02:33:26 essentially remake the tv show and like tell the story in like a slightly different way
02:33:35 but he's telling a story that was originally spread out across like oh god like 39 episodes or
02:33:42 something like that in like an hour and a half movie um and like it is the movie is an absolute
02:33:50 god damn mess it includes a lot of callbacks to the show that make no sense unless you've seen
02:33:56 the original um a lot of like dumb in jokes and shit there's like so many parts of it that are
02:34:03 just complete gibberish if you haven't seen the series but if you have like it's still a mess
02:34:13 but it's like a really fun ride and you can still like get a lot out of it but i feel like if you
02:34:18 haven't seen the original it's just kind of frustrating because you never have any idea
02:34:22 what's going on because it doesn't take the time to explain anything to you right and and but that
02:34:29 in that way then if you you haven't seen the original or rather the yeah the show it's bad
02:34:38 then like does it suck as a standalone piece okay but yeah i think the fact that it's bad
02:34:46 it's okay the fact that it's bad to one audience and good to another like like neither of those is
02:34:51 correct but i think this is like the closest we can get to the thing you were talking about of
02:34:56 like a thing that is good but also requires you to have seen the original because if you if you
02:35:03 haven't seen the original then the natural consequences that you're not gonna get whatever
02:35:08 you're supposed to get out of it and so therefore for you it will be bad i'm i'm sad that this question
02:35:15 wasn't really about harry potter because i like talking about harry potter i thought that's where
02:35:19 it was going uh i'm uh i'm uh more and more ashamed to be to have been a potterhead with each
02:35:28 passing day it was fine it was good it was good it was good it was kind of good it was kind of good
02:35:37 it was pretty good come on come on everybody everybody everybody knows everybody knows it was
02:35:42 good everybody knows that it was it was pretty good at least except like the weird the weird
02:35:47 ending was kind of done when you think about it for the the what am i thinking of age demographic
02:35:54 like for that sort of audience it was great it's a bit weird to get into it as an adult
02:36:00 i don't know why people um it wore out it's welcome like not i mean not for me i mean like
02:36:08 maybe after it ended it started still wearing out it's welcome for me before jk rolling went like
02:36:16 full transphobe um when she started just tacking shit onto it um and then yeah the thing that like
02:36:25 extra soured me on it was the phrase her mayony 2020 like as soon as people started saying
02:36:31 shit like that i was like i didn't see anyone saying that in earnest but i heard about it
02:36:36 whoa and i know this the sentiment is that like it was about them 2020 no it was about warren right
02:36:44 people that were like we should vote for warren because she's her mayony because she has a plan
02:36:48 yeah it was it was more just like there was a certain kind of person who's like really into
02:36:54 harry potter who would like relate shit in politics to harry potter and it became like a huge meme for
02:37:01 a while of like oh my god please read another book i mean that's just that's just particular
02:37:06 fandoms potterheads hoovians things like that single track mind annoying the stuff about jk
02:37:15 rowlings like the thing she used to tweet would they would range from being like actually irritating
02:37:21 to when she the time when she was like oh yeah there was a jewish wizard at hogwarts of course
02:37:27 his name his name was barry goldstein and i've never mentioned him before but he was there all
02:37:32 along uh you know duh um very obnoxious to like the other stuff like the thing about like wizards
02:37:39 would just shit themselves and then oh yeah like that was just fucking hilarious like that's great
02:37:45 most of it was just stupid not all of it was offensive but a decent amount of it was also
02:37:51 offensive where did the shit yeah it got yeah yeah did they did they act right i liked this somewhere
02:37:58 they would vanish it which i think means that it's just gone i'm not sure exactly how harry potter
02:38:04 magic is goofy it it's not mine system it has rules but the rules don't make any fucking sense
02:38:10 have you have you read them or like how familiar are you i read um so this became like a joke at
02:38:16 some point for me that i read the first six books and then never read the seventh and then watched
02:38:20 the first seven movies and never watched the eighth so i still don't know how harry potter ends um
02:38:26 oh my god um i mean i i it ends really weird it ends really weird yeah i hear the ending's bad
02:38:33 so i never had like the motivation i would say i don't know if i would say that it's just bad but
02:38:38 it's like it's just it's just strange and i don't know i don't know that's all i can really say about
02:38:43 it uh uh i was compelled i found it compelling as a kid yeah the last minute they introduce all these
02:38:50 weird like extra macguffins that end up being like fucking key it's the wizard world operates on like
02:38:57 it's all about rules like there's tons of rules but they don't make any sense and they're made up
02:39:02 completely as it goes along um yeah the whole yeah i never was like too um uh critical like
02:39:10 thinking of of the rules i just sort of like took things as they came like i you read them as they
02:39:15 come out and if you don't you don't like cross reference them you don't find contradictions
02:39:20 then it's just it's fun but like yeah clearly was made up a lot as it went um like retro retro fitting
02:39:30 the the various things from the the previous books as the horcruxes it's pretty i mean i don't have
02:39:38 proof that she was doing that but it feels like that all these things that just so happen to be
02:39:44 very important later right at the end there's like the rule that like you can't you can't make food
02:39:53 you can't make food with magic that's like a fundamental law of the universe you can only
02:39:59 make it with no food yes you can only make it with slave labor uh but it's okay because they like it
02:40:09 the the slaves like it though yeah they don't want the sock diving into the political implications
02:40:17 of harry potter is a podcast in and of itself you're right you're right you're right how many
02:40:23 is in uh how many more voicemails do we have uh four more okay cool yeah we're getting there um

02:43:59 It's just a robot.
02:44:00 It doesn't have weapons.
02:44:01 It probably does the same thing as the regular thing.
02:44:08 You just said fuck all you.
02:44:10 That's all it had to do.
02:44:16 Alright.
02:44:19 That's well okay.
02:44:22 I guess there's plot development on that front.
02:44:25 Sure.
02:44:26 Oh god.
02:44:28 Last one is called 9 year old anime girl, huge titties, 3, 2, 1, go.
02:44:35 On the topic of cartoon character age is not mattering, I was watching this one anime where
02:44:41 this character was like 9, but her character trait was that she had the hugest tits in
02:44:46 the entire cast.
02:44:47 Is it the gray hair girl?
02:44:48 And it was really clear that the animators really wanted you to fuck this character
02:44:53 because her tits were so huge and they were like the focal point of every scene she was
02:44:57 on.
02:44:58 So yeah, just don't worry about it.
02:45:01 I want to fuck this 9 year old anime girl and I don't care what Twitter has to say about
02:45:05 it.
02:45:06 That's taken, that's really run in.
02:45:07 That's really run in with what I said a little further than I meant.
02:45:11 This reminds me of last time I said about the girl on My Life Me, I said she was cute.
02:45:19 This reminds me of another anime, which I'm 99% sure is not the one he is talking about
02:45:27 that also has like an elementary school or with giant tits.
02:45:32 That one is called Aiken.
02:45:34 Have either of you seen Aiken?
02:45:35 A-I-K-E-N?
02:45:36 E-I-K-E-N.
02:45:37 Wait, is that really old?
02:45:40 I think I may have seen bits of that.
02:45:42 Yeah, it's old.
02:45:43 It's an old OVA.
02:45:44 Yeah.
02:45:45 Pretty funny looking.
02:45:48 It's like, there was a period of time where this was like the go-to for like examples
02:45:59 of shitty anime boobs.
02:46:02 Like if you just wanted like a generic gif of like giant anime titties bouncing around
02:46:08 in nonsensical ways, you'd pull a clip from Aiken.
02:46:13 These don't even make sense.
02:46:14 No, they look terrible.
02:46:17 But I mean, this is obviously a matter of taste.
02:46:21 Oh, are you talking about the pink-haired one with the glasses?
02:46:24 Yes, yes.
02:46:26 She is exactly who I was thinking of when he said a nine-year-old with huge tits.
02:46:31 Radical.
02:46:32 So this show is awful, unsurprisingly.
02:46:35 For me, it's one of those things where it's like so bad that it loops back around and
02:46:40 becomes funny again.
02:46:42 So like, I get a good laugh out of it because it like, it sucks so hard.
02:46:48 And it's also one of those shows where like, this is funny because this loops back around
02:46:52 to the adaptation thing.
02:46:54 It's an adaptation of a manga, but the manga is like, had actually been going on for a
02:47:00 long time, but they only had like two episodes worth of OVA to do.
02:47:04 So what they decided to do was like, all right, let's just cut between like the very beginning
02:47:09 of the show where we introduce like the main character and then like some highlights from
02:47:14 later in the manga.
02:47:16 So things just start happening with no explanation.
02:47:20 You have no idea who anyone is.
02:47:24 You're just watching wild antics unfold on screen against the will of God.
02:47:32 Okay.
02:47:33 That one on the right, that one on the right in that picture with the short hair, her,
02:47:41 is that a boob?
02:47:42 That is that pink?
02:47:43 No.
02:47:44 Or is that like her gut?
02:47:45 No, that's just like her sweater, just like, it's like the wind or something.
02:47:50 She doesn't look like that.
02:47:52 That's not like how she normally looks.
02:47:54 That's all right.
02:47:55 That's she looks really weird.
02:47:57 Yeah, it's just a weird picture.
02:48:00 Yeah, it's it's just like an anime that like it never takes its foot off the accelerator
02:48:07 and it's just like that for two episodes and then it's done and oh wait, I've seen this.
02:48:14 I've seen this image before.
02:48:18 That is for making.
02:48:19 Yeah.
02:48:20 Yeah.
02:48:21 Okay.
02:48:22 Okay.
02:48:23 Good stuff.
02:48:24 This is what I mean when I say like for a while.
02:48:25 Okay.
02:48:26 I've seen a bunch of these.
02:48:27 Yeah.
02:48:28 This was like the go to for like bad anime titties.
02:48:33 And if you think that that's funny, if you're like me and you're horribly immature, you
02:48:38 will get a good laugh out of Aiken.
02:48:40 I don't know about like watching a whole show of something like that.
02:48:46 Well, you said it was an OVA, so like, not that funny because I'm scrolling down the
02:48:52 Google image results and like, okay, yeah, I've seen a bunch of these gifts.
02:48:55 I probably used to see them on 4chan or whatever.
02:48:58 Yes.
02:48:59 This is like, yep.
02:49:00 4chan or like, I don't know.
02:49:03 Some other anime forum.
02:49:04 Something awful, maybe.
02:49:05 Yeah, probably.
02:49:06 Yeah.
02:49:07 But yeah, it's like, it's two episodes.
02:49:08 It's like an hour total.
02:49:11 When you combine.
02:49:12 Have you ever seen the fucking?
02:49:13 Have you seen Garzi's wing?
02:49:14 I have seen Garzi's wing.
02:49:16 Okay.
02:49:17 And if we're talking about, if we're talking about terrible OVAs, that's a, that's, that's
02:49:22 a good one that we've discussed here on the show before.
02:49:25 Oh yeah.
02:49:26 Garzi's wing is very funny.
02:49:28 It is.
02:49:29 It gets less funny as it goes on, though.
02:49:31 The fact that it was made by the dude starts off really strong.
02:49:34 It was made by the dude who created Gundam, right?
02:49:38 I don't know.
02:49:39 Maybe.
02:49:40 I think so, which like makes it funnier that it was that bad.
02:49:45 It can't have been like written by him, though.
02:49:49 It can't be like, he might have been involved, but it can't be like his brainchild.
02:49:53 There's no way.
02:49:55 The thing about Garzi's wing that it was just sort of badly made, not necessarily that
02:50:00 it was like, um, badly written.
02:50:03 Like the, the dub is really funny because of how bad that's, it says, but like, I thought
02:50:08 it was just sort of.
02:50:10 It was, it was, it's, it's largely the dub that is the problem.
02:50:14 It was written and directed by the creator of Gundam.
02:50:18 And also from what I've heard, while the dub is unbelievably shitty, the anime still
02:50:24 sucks even if you watch it in Japanese.
02:50:26 Yeah.
02:50:27 But I bet it's not like hilariously bad.
02:50:30 I bet it's not.
02:50:31 No, I think I've watched one or something and it was just sort of, it seems like they
02:50:36 didn't have a lot of money or something.
02:50:39 It's like, what is it?
02:50:40 That show ghost stories, the one where they gave it the ridiculous gag dub.
02:50:45 The reason why they did that was because in Japanese it was also a shitty anime, but
02:50:50 it was shitty in the normal way where it's just boring.
02:50:53 And so they were like, well, if this anime sucks, we might as well like make it suck
02:50:57 in a funny way.
02:50:59 Didn't we just, didn't we talk about ghost stories like last week or, I feel like, God,
02:51:04 time is just, time is just going in circles, time, it's cyclical.
02:51:07 There's no past, no present, no future.
02:51:09 We're caught on an infinite loop.
02:51:10 God, tell me something I don't know.
02:51:13 I've become unstuck in time.
02:51:15 Uh, hey, that was the last voicemail.
02:51:20 Yay, we did it.
02:51:22 We made it.
02:51:23 Um, how long have we been gone?
