00:00:00 Hello everyone, welcome to an episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast.
00:00:29 Here we are to listen to your every sin, everything you've done, it's time for you to confess.
00:00:34 It's time for a laid back, therapeutic episode of the PCP.
00:00:38 This is ASMR. This is better than-
00:00:40 HELL NO! We're getting rowdy up in this piece!
00:00:47 We have Digi.
00:00:52 Self-explanatory.
00:00:53 We have Nate.
00:00:55 Self-explanatory.
00:00:56 We have Hippo.
00:00:58 Self-explanatory.
00:00:59 We have Ben.
00:01:01 I'm supposed to be sleeping right now.
00:01:04 No, that's Ben. Don't you know that that seems like it's been fucking banished from ever trying this podcast ever again?
00:01:10 You know, our iconic theme song that everyone knows the words Ann Mellie to has been fucking, you know, obliterated.
00:01:15 It's in the fucking new version! It's in it!
00:01:18 It is in it. It is literally in it.
00:01:21 Wait, the one with the stay at home mom and dad?
00:01:24 Yeah, if you listen close, if you open up the baby ears of yours, you'll hear the melody.
00:01:29 If you open up the frequencies, if you open up the waveforms on a dash, you're gonna be able to make up in, you know, distant.
00:01:33 Distant in the background.
00:01:35 It is the instrumental. He is using the instrumental in the opening song. You can hear it.
00:01:41 I can't hear it. Stupid.
00:01:43 Okay, you have not paid attention then. The fault lies with you friend, not with me.
00:01:49 Ben, you're in a grouchy mood today.
00:01:52 I am in a fucking grouchy mood today. I didn't want to...
00:01:56 I stayed up late last night waking up a ghost, okay? I had to summon a ghost and it was really stupid.
00:02:02 It made me very upset.
00:02:04 Oh yeah, what the hell was that? You said you were going to a seance or something?
00:02:08 Yeah, I had a seance.
00:02:12 Because there's a ghost in my house, you guys.
00:02:15 Or maybe not a ghost. Maybe just a spirit.
00:02:19 Could be a low level.
00:02:21 Maybe not a demon, could be an incubus.
00:02:23 Maybe just a phenomena. Maybe just some kind of phenomena.
00:02:26 How does it feel to be a certified scientist with like a master's degree?
00:02:31 As a bachelor's.
00:02:33 Feels great. Feels wonderful.
00:02:35 In a house with ghosts.
00:02:37 Well...
00:02:39 You're still out of your element, Ben. This house doesn't apply to you.
00:02:42 Yeah, I'm weak to ghosts. I'm literally weak to ghosts type.
00:02:46 And you know what? They really took their toll on me. I had to sleep it off.
00:02:50 I had to sleep off.
00:02:52 How late did you spend?
00:02:54 The time is not matter. The time is not matter. Just because my sleep schedule.
00:03:00 The point is I was supposed to be sleeping through that whole period, but instead I wasn't.
00:03:05 It's funny you say this, Ben, because I also have been up all night.
00:03:09 And Tom was too. I'm guessing that he passed out at some point. That's why he's not here.
00:03:15 For like two seconds before the show started.
00:03:18 And then he was like, fuck this. I can't stay away.
00:03:20 He said like two words that were irrelevant. You know, like usual.
00:03:25 Yeah, three slaves, but you know, irrelevant.
00:03:29 You had a seance. We had a blood sacrifice at this house.
00:03:33 Because Tom spent...
00:03:35 What's going on with you guys? I'm the only pure Christian boy left in the museum.
00:03:38 Were you becoming games?
00:03:40 Tom was setting up for our games to become even greater by building a server and streaming PC in the house,
00:03:47 which he spent like 15 hours doing last night because of a comedy of errors.
00:03:52 One of which was the computer slicing his finger open.
00:03:55 And apparently it was like Kill Bill blood spraying all over the place.
00:03:59 There's like dried blood in places where blood shouldn't reach from a finger.
00:04:04 It's intense. Me and Mae were not home when this happened.
00:04:08 So we just come home and Tom's like, yeah.
00:04:10 He's come home and there's blood everywhere.
00:04:13 Wait, wait, so Ben, what are the specifics of this ghost?
00:04:16 Like has a poltergeist invaded and started knocking down family heirlooms and sacred urns in a hilarious comedic fashion?
00:04:24 Oops, my grandmother's ashes are all over the floor.
00:04:28 Listen, because there is a small chance that my housemates could listen to this podcast,
00:04:34 I'm not going to say that I think they're fucking retards for doing any of this.
00:04:41 I will. I'll say it for you.
00:04:43 Your housemates are fucking retards for believing ghosts.
00:04:47 What about the whole story here?
00:04:50 So one guy, he was smoking on the porch one day and he claims...
00:04:59 The devil's lettuce.
00:05:00 Okay, so we had like a broken door, right?
00:05:03 Like the doorknob was extremely loose and would fall off the door.
00:05:06 That's the work of a ghost right there, for sure.
00:05:08 Well, yeah, to start, yeah.
00:05:10 So this doorknob would fall off very easily. It was not held on very well.
00:05:16 He claims that one day he was sitting out there and the doorknob just flew off the door in an arc and like landed kind of by his feet.
00:05:27 And this spooked him really bad.
00:05:29 You know, for days this was all he would talk about.
00:05:32 Jesus Christ.
00:05:33 Is that he witnessed a paranormal event.
00:05:35 I mean, if that was true, it would be spooky.
00:05:37 Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, whatever.
00:05:39 I get it, I guess.
00:05:41 Did anybody ask him if there was wind that night, by chance?
00:05:44 We're talking about like a metal door.
00:05:46 Look, the thing he describes, if it happened as described, would be very strange and hard to explain for the doorknob to fly off in an arc.
00:05:55 Just the problem is like, how reliable is one sense?
00:05:59 How do you know you didn't just see it at the corner of your eye and that's not really like, you know, how do you know?
00:06:04 Of course.
00:06:05 The human error is a huge factor in these things.
00:06:07 Maybe a squirrel landed on it and then jumped off and it like propelled it off and he saw the squirrel traveling in the arc.
00:06:14 No, Arkham raises that, did you? That's too complicated.
00:06:16 And then saw the Arkham's razor.
00:06:18 I am a chief philosophical mastermind.
00:06:21 If you just strip away all the complexity, it's a ghost.
00:06:24 I mean, there are incidents in like, there's one like South America where like a literal entire village claims to have witnessed some like extremely strange like solar phenomenon.
00:06:33 But it's just like, what's more likely?
00:06:35 God stole the sun for a minute just from this one location?
00:06:39 Or that like there was some sort of mass, I don't know, maybe it was a fucking mass.
00:06:42 Or what's more simpler than that?
00:06:44 A.K. less words and it was a ghost.
00:06:47 That's how we Arkham's razor, it just was a ghost.
00:06:49 Okay, so there's more, so there's more.
00:06:51 So, you know, obviously nobody cared about this, but then naturally this was irrelevant to everything.
00:06:58 But then a couple days, maybe two weeks later, my other housemate, he is a little tipsy or whatever and he hears a bottle cap fall off of a countertop and he looks at the ground.
00:07:15 And he screams as loud as fucking hell.
00:07:17 There's no way that the bottle cap could have fallen that far across the floor just from falling off.
00:07:24 There's just no way.
00:07:25 The counter is a lot of substances involved in these stories.
00:07:29 It went like halfway across the floor, you guys.
00:07:33 It's like almost halfway across the entire kitchen.
00:07:37 Wow.
00:07:38 So, you know, and he didn't even touch it.
00:07:41 Has anyone put a level on the floor of this house yet to see if it's like leaning?
00:07:47 Maybe, not a bad idea.
00:07:49 Or maybe it's a circle and it rolled.
00:07:52 So the point is, so this convinced, let me call these, I don't know, these are, whatever, so these are the ghost bros who are both now convinced.
00:08:05 And then, you know, and then we got me and we got Big John and Little John.
00:08:11 And Little John is like, guys, we should have a seance.
00:08:14 We got to invite people over.
00:08:16 We got to buy a Hasbro brand Ouija board.
00:08:18 And we got to have a seance.
00:08:20 Got to do it.
00:08:21 So that's what we did, you know.
00:08:24 And basically, so the ghost, yeah, it kind of was.
00:08:29 So the ghost boys are totally, totally believing, convinced that there is a presence, there is a spirit, you know.
00:08:37 And the rest of us are just sitting around, just like, you know, intently, intently pretending like this isn't the dumbest thing we've ever seen.
00:08:48 So, yeah.
00:08:50 So, okay, so we started the seance.
00:08:52 We asked the ghost, first question, one of the ghost bros is sitting there.
00:08:57 Two people have their hands on the Ouija board planchette.
00:09:00 One of the ghost bros is one of them.
00:09:02 The other one's this girl who's a friend of the house.
00:09:05 And this guy asks, he's like, first, he's like, is there a presence here?
00:09:12 And the planchette moves immediately to no.
00:09:16 The ghost is immediately denying his involvement in any of this stuff.
00:09:20 So the ghost answered in the negative to his own presence.
00:09:26 Yeah, there was more.
00:09:28 He asked it, he asked it, at one point he asked it, are you fucking with us?
00:09:33 At which point it moves somewhat towards yes.
00:09:36 And then he asked it, do you like to have fun?
00:09:39 And it moves strongly towards yes.
00:09:42 Whatever, whatever.
00:09:45 Oh man, then our downstairs neighbors heard about this and like one of the answers it gave at one point had an eye in it.
00:09:52 And she was like, oh my god, my dad died this last year.
00:09:56 And his name was Irving, I for Irving, I think it was his ghost.
00:10:00 This is legitimately worse than hearing about a dream.
00:10:03 So I literally went outside and threw myself off of the balcony that the ghost removed the original doorknob on.
00:10:11 And then your ghost came back and completed the seance for me.
00:10:16 Yeah, I answered, they asked, you know, how can we help you move on to the next world?
00:10:22 And I answered with a B for Ben and that was proof.
00:10:26 So that's, I'm sorry, was that a boring story?
00:10:30 No, that was fascinating.
00:10:32 I'm fascinated with the story.
00:10:34 You're poking a lot of fun right now, but can you prove that there wasn't a ghost in your house?
00:10:39 I cannot.
00:10:40 Well then there you fucking go.
00:10:42 There you go.
00:10:43 Then shut the hell up and pack it on out of here.
00:10:46 I will.
00:10:47 Anyway, I'm cranky.
00:10:48 I'm cranky and I don't like ghosts.
00:10:51 I ain't afraid of them.
00:10:53 But I don't know why I stayed up.
00:10:55 And from generations from now, apography will be misquoted to all of you.
00:11:00 But famously, I have spoken in many letters that the government is scarier than ghosts.
00:11:05 As I said once in a procrastinators podcast very recently.
00:11:09 And so I don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe in the government, which is way worse.
00:11:13 So it's possible that the NSA in fact planted, you know, an assassination attempt on your friend
00:11:18 and their method of choice was to fling a doorknob at his head as fast as they could.
00:11:23 Not even at his head.
00:11:24 Maybe like towards his knees kind of.
00:11:27 Listen, okay, I'm going to guess that if your guy believes in ghosts,
00:11:31 they probably wouldn't go to the doctors because they would probably be, you know,
00:11:35 some sort of like demon incubi that would rape him in his sleep.
00:11:38 So I'm assuming if his knee was scraped and blood were to come out,
00:11:42 it would probably get a staff infection and he would die.
00:11:44 So the NSA might have better intel on your friend than you do, Ben.
00:11:47 Maybe you're just a fucking idiot. How about that?
00:11:49 I live in a house.
00:11:51 I live in a house with a weird spread, a weird melange of like people from different places on the ideological spectrum.
00:12:01 And there is a certain segment of my house that is like weirdly, apolitically,
00:12:10 like what's it like, neoconservative with like a weirdly spiritual bent.
00:12:18 And I think it's the worst.
00:12:21 That's like dubstep country mashups.
00:12:25 Yeah, these are, we're talking about guys who voted for Trump
00:12:29 just to shake up the establishment and who like regularly talk about going to church
00:12:33 and how much they like going to church, but who don't actually go to church.
00:12:37 I know I'm just the kind of person we're dealing with.
00:12:42 I know I'm about to preach to the choir and say a bunch of shit that's obvious,
00:12:45 but what blows my mind whenever this is the subject of ghosts
00:12:49 is that like you can have people who like by and large don't believe in any weird shit
00:12:55 or superstition or ghosts, but like the second they can't explain something,
00:13:00 it's immediately ghosts.
00:13:02 Okay, so little John, who was the one putting on the seance,
00:13:08 he was telling me that like he would mention the seance to people
00:13:11 because he wanted to invite more people over for it.
00:13:14 And he would get split reactions, like some people would think it was really funny
00:13:17 and others people would be like, oh no, don't do that.
00:13:20 That's a bad idea.
00:13:21 Like people would react negatively to it.
00:13:24 Like it's bad because like, oh no, don't mess with the ghost, dude.
00:13:27 I think, yeah.
00:13:28 Okay, yeah.
00:13:29 Okay.
00:13:30 The thing about...
00:13:31 Not even, like I could almost understand if you were like,
00:13:33 don't mess with your dumb friends like that.
00:13:35 That's really mean.
00:13:36 Yeah.
00:13:37 But I don't care about that.
00:13:38 I mean, sure.
00:13:39 The thing about jumping to ghosts...
00:13:40 Of course I'm going to do it anyway.
00:13:41 ...that gets to me is that like ghosts are like made up by people.
00:13:46 Yeah.
00:13:47 It's like you could have...
00:13:50 There's some biblical references to them,
00:13:52 so maybe people are working from that partially.
00:13:54 If I see something like weird and inexplicable...
00:13:56 Maybe I'm wrong.
00:13:58 If I see...
00:13:59 There's like risen dead or something, but okay.
00:14:00 If I see some weird inexplicable shit and I can't explain it,
00:14:03 like why jump immediately to made up shit instead of just like,
00:14:08 oh, there's probably like a rational thing that I just don't understand
00:14:13 or did not observe enough.
00:14:16 Like...
00:14:17 There's an answer for that.
00:14:18 Are you aware?
00:14:19 I forget.
00:14:20 There's like a name for it I think,
00:14:21 but there's a phenomenon that's just like,
00:14:23 after the events of like,
00:14:26 I forget what it is,
00:14:27 but there was like some alien conspiracy
00:14:29 where specifically like the gray alien...
00:14:31 Roswell?
00:14:32 Like Visage became...
00:14:33 Maybe it was Roswell,
00:14:34 but there was like something where in popular culture,
00:14:36 the gray alien depiction became like the zeitgeist,
00:14:40 what people thought aliens looked like.
00:14:42 Like before that, there had been some alien reports that they'd been kidnapped,
00:14:45 but after that like fake thing happened,
00:14:48 it maybe was like whatever that...
00:14:50 Those encounters of the third kind movie?
00:14:52 Yeah, it might have been that.
00:14:53 It might have been that.
00:14:54 And after that,
00:14:55 like all the very different types of reports about alien abduction,
00:14:59 all very coincidentally settled in on the like gray alien depiction
00:15:04 to describe like what their alien kidnappers looked like.
00:15:07 Because it's a way for you to fill in the blanks.
00:15:09 It's like you see a...
00:15:10 Yeah.
00:15:11 But kind of like with UFO sightings,
00:15:12 it's like there's so many things that look like a floating black disc
00:15:17 that you could see,
00:15:19 that as soon as you mentally associate it with one thing,
00:15:22 that's what you're gonna see.
00:15:23 I think that's what you're trying to say.
00:15:24 These people, they just need to watch some Vsauce
00:15:28 and understand the basics of the human mind
00:15:33 and how it's fallible and learn all the funny things about illusions.
00:15:37 It can't be true.
00:15:38 All your problems.
00:15:39 YouTube, videos, UFO.
00:15:40 I'm so fucking upset with all of you right now, Nate.
00:15:43 You're being so ridiculous right now.
00:15:44 So all these people from different walks of life,
00:15:47 all just coincidentally are talking about the exact same type of aliens
00:15:52 and driving the exact same way.
00:15:54 All these different people at different points, intervals of time.
00:15:57 That's so just a complicated, you know, conspiracy theory, Nate.
00:16:00 The simplest Occam's razor way is just say it's real.
00:16:03 It's just real and they're all describing the same thing.
00:16:05 You're right.
00:16:06 You're an idiot.
00:16:07 You haven't even been to poll.
00:16:08 Occam's razor, man.
00:16:09 You're right.
00:16:10 Jesus Christ.
00:16:11 Come on.
00:16:12 Like as we define Occam's razor to mean the thing that takes the fewest words
00:16:16 to explain.
00:16:17 Yeah.
00:16:18 Yeah.
00:16:19 I mean, we could also, let's just Occam's razor it to gestalt psychology then.
00:16:24 Eh?
00:16:25 Yeah, but no one knows what those words mean.
00:16:27 How many, how few, how few letters can we possibly use?
00:16:30 Oh, oh, no, no, no.
00:16:31 Okay, guys.
00:16:32 No, yeah, I've got it.
00:16:33 Yeah.
00:16:34 Real.
00:16:35 R-E-L.
00:16:36 Real.
00:16:37 It's real.
00:16:38 Yeah.
00:16:39 There you go.
00:16:40 Yeah.
00:16:41 Wait.
00:16:42 Fake also has four letters though.
00:16:43 It's a coin toss.
00:16:44 It comes down to a coin toss.
00:16:45 It's always split.
00:16:46 Everything boils down to a coin toss between fake and real.
00:16:50 Ben, how many people do you, do you live at your house?
00:16:53 Because it just seems like there's just a clown car just constantly revolving door
00:16:56 of just like 20 or so people who are all insane.
00:16:59 Okay.
00:17:00 Not counting my downstairs neighbors because we live in like a split condo.
00:17:04 Hold on.
00:17:05 I want to say six.
00:17:07 Uh-huh.
00:17:08 Whoa.
00:17:09 Six?
00:17:10 If you do three of those, that's the mark of the beast.
00:17:13 Real.
00:17:14 Big John, Lil John, the ghost bros, the other, the anime recluse.
00:17:21 Nice.
00:17:22 Who's Indian name is Clips Through Walls and me.
00:17:28 Sick.
00:17:29 So I think the six.
00:17:30 Yeah.
00:17:31 I think there's six.
00:17:32 My Indian name is Hacks the Mainframe.
00:17:34 Hacks the Mainframe.
00:17:35 Yeah.
00:17:36 Can you imagine each of them up to a My Little Pony character?
00:17:40 Ooh.
00:17:41 Cool.
00:17:43 I don't really know who they are.
00:17:45 We have no way of knowing if their comparisons are accurate.
00:17:48 Yeah.
00:17:49 Let's not do that.
00:17:50 Okay.
00:17:51 Well, no.
00:17:52 We got, we got.
00:17:53 They're all Queen Chrysalis.
00:17:54 They're just all.
00:17:55 Yeah.
00:17:56 Yeah.
00:17:57 Who's the spike of the group?
00:17:58 There's Serendipity.
00:17:59 That's a band, of course.
00:18:00 That's definitely a band.
00:18:01 Yeah.
00:18:02 Yeah.
00:18:03 Yeah.
00:18:04 Yeah.
00:18:05 All right.
00:18:06 Yeah.
00:18:07 There's Serendipity, Chastity, Grace, Serenity, Firefly.
00:18:12 Action Adventure RPG video game.
00:18:15 There's a pony called Chastity.
00:18:17 Yeah.
00:18:18 God, I hope so.
00:18:19 The biggest slut of the bunch.
00:18:21 So I can fuck her.
00:18:22 You know what I'm saying?
00:18:23 What's it like living with your old roommates after living not with them for so long?
00:18:29 I don't know.
00:18:30 It's good.
00:18:31 I like it.
00:18:32 Why are we interviewing Ben?
00:18:34 This is terrible.
00:18:35 Okay.
00:18:36 Hey, hey, hippo.
00:18:37 How's your life going?
00:18:38 Huh?
00:18:39 Oh yeah.
00:18:40 How's your life?
00:18:41 What have you done today?
00:18:42 Oh yeah.
00:18:43 That's real great, dude.
00:18:44 That's real fucking nice.
00:18:45 Oh wow, hippo.
00:18:46 I'm so impressed.
00:18:47 Hey, wait.
00:18:48 Speaking of which, happy birthday, Munchie.
00:18:49 Yeah.
00:18:50 Happy recent birthday.
00:18:51 Oh my god.
00:18:52 You're a fucking adult, aren't you?
00:18:53 He's 18 at last.
00:18:54 It was yesterday, right?
00:18:55 No.
00:18:56 It was the 14th.
00:18:57 Now we can release all those unreleased videos from Radcon 3.
00:19:09 Now they've become retroactively legal.
00:19:13 You better head over to that link, the Gumroad link below.
00:19:17 Get the backseat pass if you know what I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen.
00:19:20 Heyo.
00:19:21 Now I'll be the second PCB member to have their dick shown on camera.
00:19:25 Who was the first?
00:19:27 You.
00:19:28 You.
00:19:29 My dick's never been on camera.
00:19:31 All right.
00:19:32 What are you talking about?
00:19:34 No one's ever seen my dick.
00:19:36 No one ever.
00:19:37 I don't know if you want to get into it.
00:19:40 Wait, do people think my dick is out there on camera?
00:19:45 I think it was.
00:19:47 Of course not.
00:19:48 Like a brief flash, because you had holes in your undergarments.
00:19:52 Oh, you mean the PCB.
00:19:53 There was that thing.
00:19:54 Ah, yes.
00:19:55 I forgot about that.
00:19:57 You didn't see my whole dick, though, right?
00:19:59 No.
00:20:00 I mean, I suppose not.
00:20:01 Not the whole.
00:20:02 You gotta leave a little, you gotta leave a little mist.
00:20:07 Like my foreskin.
00:20:08 Cut this off.
00:20:09 Cut it off.
00:20:10 That's right.
00:20:11 Destroy this whole piece.
00:20:12 Why?
00:20:13 Why?
00:20:14 Well, I don't know.
00:20:15 If you don't care, I don't care.
00:20:16 All right, let's get this phone straight.
00:20:17 Why would I care?
00:20:18 It's not even, it's not available.
00:20:19 Nobody could find it.
00:20:20 I mean, I assume somebody downloaded it.
00:20:22 You know.
00:20:23 And enlarged it and enhanced it.
00:20:25 It was with your podcasting skills.
00:20:27 All right, my podcasting skills.
00:20:28 Hey, guys.
00:20:29 Welcome to another Let's Play.
00:20:30 I'm gonna play Minecraft today.
00:20:31 Have you been sick recently or at school and not been able to release a video?
00:20:36 Yeah, that's what I wanted.
00:20:38 Are you sorry that your voice sounds a little weird because you have a culture?
00:20:42 I'm sorry, guys.
00:20:43 Save me if you would will.
00:20:45 Guys, listen.
00:20:46 When did you first realize that you had wasted your life?
00:20:50 At what point did you realize this?
00:20:52 Today.
00:20:53 Just now, actually, listening to you ask me that question.
00:20:56 You know, I realized I was wasting my life.
00:21:00 It was in college after my girlfriend broke up with me and before I went to Japan.
00:21:06 And then I fixed it and it was pretty good.
00:21:08 Actually, there was actually a second round.
00:21:10 It was after I got back from that and I was before I started doing any YouTube stuff when
00:21:14 I was just going through my shitty school and stuff.
00:21:17 That sucked.
00:21:18 But then it got better.
00:21:19 So that's cool.
00:21:20 Hey, have you guys heard of this Hispanic comedian?
00:21:24 Guzzlin Dispera?
00:21:26 Guzzlin Dispera?
00:21:27 No.
00:21:28 Have you heard of this Hispanic comedian called Munchie Shatsky?
00:21:31 How about Guzzlin Disparity's nuts, bitches?
00:21:35 Wait.
00:21:36 Yeah!
00:21:37 Say that name again?
00:21:38 Guzzlin?
00:21:39 Say it?
00:21:40 Guzzlin Dispera?
00:21:42 Is that it?
00:21:43 That's right, that's right.
00:21:44 Okay, so I'm Guzzling This Pair of Nuts is what I'm...
00:21:47 That's correct.
00:21:48 Yeah, that's what you are doing.
00:21:53 Pretty good.
00:21:54 I like this new meme of names that make people retarded.
00:21:59 Those are good.
00:22:00 I like this new meme of the past time when it's all this desperately trying to cover
00:22:04 up with something to say and then two people talking about it nervously chuckling at one
00:22:09 other.
00:22:10 Other people are just fucking panicking right now.
00:22:12 Just sweating.
00:22:13 Just sweat.
00:22:14 Like bill bullets off their fucking forehead.
00:22:16 Okay, okay.
00:22:17 It's okay.
00:22:18 They're filling up time.
00:22:19 Okay.
00:22:20 Oh, fucking thank, thank, thank.
00:22:21 All right.
00:22:22 That comes courtesy of Big John, who by the way, Big John and Little John are comparably
00:22:28 sized with one another.
00:22:29 Okay.
00:22:30 I just want to put that out there.
00:22:32 Is it a question of personality who fills the room with their charisma?
00:22:37 It's more like Big John is older and was here first.
00:22:41 Pokemon Go.
00:22:42 Here we go.
00:22:43 Pokemon Go topic.
00:22:44 Yeah, let's do it.
00:22:45 I have a thing to say.
00:22:46 Pokemon Go podcast.
00:22:47 PGP, everybody.
00:22:48 Because this is the only thing that I'm constantly doing that isn't just, hey guys, I'm working.
00:22:52 It's like Pokemon Go.
00:22:54 There was a new update where they have allowed for a short period of time, you can send gifts
00:23:01 to friends and stuff.
00:23:02 And sometimes you get like a special, a lowland egg that takes like seven kilometers to open.
00:23:07 And recently they updated it for like a Gen 1 special event where they try to get everybody
00:23:13 to complete their Gen 1 Pokedex by releasing all the Pokemon, all the legendaries are in
00:23:18 raids, and all the Gen 1 Pokemon are all over the place.
00:23:22 But the thing they did that made me really mad and rarer, I'm going to fight, I'm going
00:23:28 to kill, is that they made the Gen 1 region exclusives available in these eggs so that
00:23:34 people don't have to go around the world to catch them anymore.
00:23:39 They can just wait for them to be...
00:23:42 I heard about this on a video by some YouTuber called Gibbentake?
00:23:48 No.
00:23:49 No, you didn't.
00:23:51 This is the first and only place you'll hear about this exclusive news dropped like months
00:23:56 after it stopped being relevant.
00:23:58 But like, it just got me thinking about like how video games are like people feel entitled.
00:24:06 Because I had a lot of people in that comment section of that video by Gibbentake where I
00:24:10 didn't know.
00:24:11 That you didn't make.
00:24:12 That I didn't make.
00:24:13 And they were arguing about like my point that it was bad that this was happening.
00:24:18 And they were saying, oh, but what about the people who can't travel?
00:24:21 What about the people who...
00:24:22 It's good.
00:24:23 It's good because now I can get the thing that I couldn't get before.
00:24:26 Right.
00:24:27 Yeah, their argument basically boiled down to, but I want it.
00:24:30 Why can't I have it?
00:24:31 Yeah.
00:24:32 And it just made me so annoyed.
00:24:34 I don't understand where these people, like, who exists that literally cannot travel ever.
00:24:41 Like, if you're like, I'm 15, I can't travel.
00:24:44 You'll be 18 in three years.
00:24:46 You can get it then.
00:24:47 Like, hold on a second.
00:24:49 To be fair, if you want to get all the region exclusive, you will have to go to, like, if
00:24:54 you have to go to places, you have to go to Japan.
00:24:56 You'll have to go to Europe.
00:24:57 Yeah.
00:24:58 You'll have to, let's say you live in America, so whatever, you're there.
00:25:00 Where else?
00:25:01 Do you have to go like South America?
00:25:02 South America.
00:25:03 This should give you something to strive to, all right?
00:25:05 Yes.
00:25:06 It's expensive to fly to Japan.
00:25:07 Yeah.
00:25:08 That means you should bust your ass and get a job and work really hard and save up your
00:25:12 money so you can get that goddamn far-fetched.
00:25:14 I agree.
00:25:15 In terms of opportunity costs, like, I would argue that, like, the time spent getting a full
00:25:20 Pokedex other than the region exclusives is, like, way bigger.
00:25:24 Yes.
00:25:25 Like, it's a huge commitment.
00:25:28 And especially now with trades, it's not even that you have to go there.
00:25:32 You can just meet someone who's been there.
00:25:34 And how great is that?
00:25:35 You'll be able to meet someone in real life.
00:25:37 You can't trade over online, so you'll meet someone in real life just down the street
00:25:40 or, you know, at your local park or something.
00:25:42 And you'll ask, oh, where'd you get this far-fetched?
00:25:44 Oh, I was in Japan.
00:25:46 I was serving in the standing Japanese army during 1943.
00:25:50 And they're like, wow, you must have done some real nice things.
00:25:52 And he was like, yeah, I did.
00:25:53 And he got the far-fetched.
00:25:55 Wait, was that like a rape of Nan King joke?
00:25:59 Yes, it did.
00:26:01 Okay, good.
00:26:02 I was just checking.
00:26:03 I say it every time about this stuff, but this 100% comes down to just different conceptions
00:26:08 of how the world should be.
00:26:10 Like, if you're, like, a 15-year-old kid, like, obviously you don't have a lot of money right now
00:26:14 and you want to complete your Pokedex, you're going to be, like, bummed out that you don't have enough money
00:26:18 to, like, go to Japan and get far-fetched.
00:26:20 I mean, you're already five years late to start your Pokemon journey.
00:26:22 Okay, fair enough, fair enough.
00:26:23 But, like, so you'll want to do it.
00:26:25 But, like, it'll be hard and it'll be, like, you'll have to find someone online.
00:26:29 And, like, what I'd like this person to do is, like, go online, research, find people in their area
00:26:34 who, like, maybe have been there.
00:26:36 And, like, kind of, I want them to rise to the occasion.
00:26:39 But a lot of people don't want to do that.
00:26:41 They just want to, you know, have things lower down to make it easy for them to do it.
00:26:46 Find someone who's got a phone from that, like, just buy phones from people
00:26:51 who've collected the Pokemon from those regions.
00:26:54 There you go.
00:26:55 I want to know.
00:26:56 I want to know how many of these people, like, how many of these people have a full Pokedex
00:27:00 aside from the region exclusive?
00:27:03 I'm going to bet none.
00:27:04 I'm going to bet, like, zero, zero percent.
00:27:07 I've heard the argument, simply so this is a well-rounded piece of conversation here,
00:27:12 I've heard the argument that the game has been out for so long
00:27:15 that all the people who would have been able to get the regionals would have got them already.
00:27:20 Which I think is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
00:27:23 Like, literally, even if you grow up three years and in three years,
00:27:28 you'll be able to potentially do it.
00:27:30 And, I mean, not that you're limited by being 15 necessarily.
00:27:33 But, like, even if it was literally impossible for you to ever go to Japan
00:27:38 or meet anyone from Japan and get that Lapras, who cares?
00:27:42 Right.
00:27:43 I really come back to that.
00:27:44 Who cares?
00:27:46 Like, guys, there's a problem.
00:27:49 People don't like.
00:27:51 People have a huge problem with the fact that the world is in fact hierarchical.
00:27:56 People hate that, and they think it's unfair.
00:27:59 But, I'm sorry.
00:28:00 It's not even a matter of hierarchy to me so much as just that this is what the conceit of the game is.
00:28:05 Like, it's not that being able to travel makes you a better person,
00:28:09 it's just that this is what the game's purpose is.
00:28:12 It's maybe not meant for people who don't travel.
00:28:16 Like, yeah.
00:28:17 It's almost like it's a social game that's meant for you to travel to different places
00:28:20 to catch different types of Pokemon.
00:28:22 It's almost like that's the goal of the game.
00:28:23 I do sympathize with people who are, like, let's say they're really poor,
00:28:27 but they have a smartphone with Pokemon Go somehow.
00:28:29 Okay, fine.
00:28:30 I'm sure that could happen in some cases.
00:28:32 I do feel for those people, but I just care so much more about preserving, like,
00:28:37 the ability of people to, like, challenge themselves and, like,
00:28:40 accomplish things and, like, obtain greatness by working really hard
00:28:44 and, like, getting exclusive things.
00:28:46 I know this is a silly example of a Pokemon Go game,
00:28:48 but that's so much more important to me
00:28:50 than, like, making sure everyone gets the fucking participation trophy
00:28:54 of a fucking, you know, gimme Pokemon.
00:28:56 And I just need to reiterate, because this is not, like,
00:29:00 like, these are all great points, but this is not an issue of you having to go to Asia anymore.
00:29:05 You literally don't.
00:29:07 Okay, Google search.
00:29:09 Like, the name of your city.
00:29:11 Pokemon Go Discord.
00:29:13 Boom.
00:29:14 You will have, like, 30 fucking people.
00:29:16 You will have, like, thousands of the Pokemon that you want.
00:29:19 Meet up with someone in real life at a nice sunny park,
00:29:22 actually play the game, engage with people socially,
00:29:25 and you'll be able to get the Pokemon you want
00:29:27 for, like, you know, a high amount of stardust.
00:29:30 Who cares?
00:29:31 You don't have to spend literally any money.
00:29:33 I'm sure there's people who are really frustrated by the fact that, like,
00:29:36 there's no online trading, so they can just, like, do it all from home.
00:29:39 But that is not what the game is.
00:29:41 That is not what the game is.
00:29:42 That's not the point of the game is to say you're home.
00:29:44 The point is to go out and walk around.
00:29:46 I'm still, like, completely baffled by spoofers.
00:29:50 Like, the idea of playing the game.
00:29:52 Like, there was this one time when I was, like, there was a raid,
00:29:55 and it was a five-star raid, and I was by myself, and there was no one around.
00:29:58 I was like, well, let's just jump in and see what happens.
00:30:02 I'm not going to win, but, you know, whatever.
00:30:04 I jump in, and then, like, 17, like, level 40 spoofers jump in out of nowhere,
00:30:10 and I'm like, oh, shit, I'm going to get this guy.
00:30:14 And it turns out that these level 40 spoofers just, like, I guess they have,
00:30:19 like, a program that jumps into people to raids that are currently, like,
00:30:23 have people in them to leech off of the, you know, the battle,
00:30:27 because none of them were actually doing anything.
00:30:29 They were just sitting there, hoping that, you know, whatever group had started
00:30:33 the raid would complete it, and then they would catch the Pokemon.
00:30:36 What in the fuck is a spoofer?
00:30:38 It is a person who plays Pokemon Go indoors, like, with a program
00:30:43 that allows them to cheat and go anywhere.
00:30:46 Yeah.
00:30:47 And it's like, the whole idea of Pokemon Go, like, if you strip away the walking
00:30:54 outside and, you know, the experience of being, like, catching Pokemon in real life
00:31:00 and being an explorer and moving and walking and doing all that stuff,
00:31:04 it's not really that good a game that, like, you just tap the screen.
00:31:08 Is there a monetary benefit to doing this?
00:31:11 No.
00:31:12 I mean, technically...
00:31:13 Could sell your account, possibly, maybe?
00:31:15 I guess people might do that.
00:31:17 Because it makes me think about how, like, in World of Warcraft,
00:31:20 like, a lot of botting and shit like that just...
00:31:23 Yeah, for the sake of selling accounts.
00:31:25 Okay, okay.
00:31:26 Niantic has specifically, like, engineered their trading system
00:31:30 in a...
00:31:32 In trying to make it so that, like, World of Warcraft's steam markets can't exist,
00:31:37 which I think personally as a Team Fortress 2 trader is fucking gay as hell
00:31:41 and it's literally the funnest thing about any video game ever
00:31:44 is spending real-life money to buy, like, ones and zeros
00:31:48 that make your character look cooler.
00:31:50 I think that's literally the funnest part of Team Fortress 2,
00:31:52 so I'm fucking upset that there is no underground market for, like...
00:31:56 Well, I mean, sure, but those markets are, like, super illegal and unregulated and, like...
00:32:02 Yeah, it's great! It's fucking cool!
00:32:04 I mean, it's all, like, untaxed purchases going back and forth, so...
00:32:08 Yeah, okay.
00:32:09 I mean, I don't think the gambling side of things there has been much discussion about.
00:32:12 Like, I'm sure that the reason those companies don't want this to happen
00:32:15 is because they don't want the government to start telling them they have to do something to regulate it.
00:32:19 You know?
00:32:20 Of course, of course.
00:32:21 Um, and so they're just like, fuck it, we'll make it so they can't.
00:32:24 Yeah, well, you know...
00:32:26 So, since Hippo brought up the video game I don't give a shit about and know nothing about,
00:32:31 I'm gonna talk about, just to you, Nate,
00:32:34 I started playing Final Fantasy IX and...
00:32:37 Oh, great! Fantastic.
00:32:38 I started playing Final Fantasy VI, so fuck you!
00:32:41 I'm in this conversation too now!
00:32:44 And...
00:32:45 And I ruined it...
00:32:47 I ruined it for myself immediately with fucking Tetra Master.
00:32:52 Oh!
00:32:54 Yeah, that'll, uh...
00:32:55 If I remember correctly, I think Tetra Master was my favorite card game, though it might be the one from 8.
00:33:00 I remember, I played the one from 8 a lot more, but I never actually beat 9, so...
00:33:05 Yeah.
00:33:06 I think the games, like, regularly had card games in them.
00:33:10 They do?
00:33:11 I tried them when I played these when I was a teenager.
00:33:14 Tetra Master...
00:33:15 I guess they don't know anything past, like, 11, so...
00:33:18 Tetra Master's a fucking nightmare.
00:33:20 And...
00:33:21 Yeah.
00:33:22 It was like...
00:33:23 Hell yeah!
00:33:24 So, here's what happened to me.
00:33:26 So, for anyone who doesn't know what this is...
00:33:28 Triple Pride, that's the one for me.
00:33:29 In Final Fantasy IX, there is this card game that you can play with, like, half of the fucking NPCs in the game.
00:33:35 Like, you just walk up to them and press X, and you'll just start up this very bizarre, um, like...
00:33:42 I guess...
00:33:43 Do-da-do-da-do-da-do-da-do-da-do.
00:33:45 Oh wait, that's the 8 one.
00:33:46 I guess how we describe it is, like, go.
00:33:48 Like, the Japanese game go, but with cards.
00:33:51 Kind of.
00:33:52 Right, right.
00:33:53 And the thing is, the game deliberately doesn't tell you any of the fucking rules of the game.
00:33:58 No, it doesn't.
00:33:59 Not a one.
00:34:00 It purposefully keeps it obscure, and at first I thought that was kind of neat, and I was like,
00:34:04 oh, I'll learn the game through playing it.
00:34:07 I mean, while getting all your fucking cards taken by the enemy.
00:34:10 Yeah, so the way this game works is that if you lose, the enemy takes one of your cards, and if you win, you take one of their cards.
00:34:16 But so, if you're just trying to figure out the fucking rules of the game, and almost everyone is stronger than you,
00:34:21 then you can literally lose enough cards that you can never play the game again.
00:34:26 Like, if you have...
00:34:27 You can get cards later, but I mean, yeah, you can fuck yourself up real bad.
00:34:30 So, I didn't really start engaging with the game until I got the Lindblum,
00:34:35 and by that point, the enemies were all too strong, and I didn't understand the game,
00:34:40 so I was just like, man, I feel like I should have collected a shitload of cards at the start of the game
00:34:45 and just hoarded them so that I could have a buffer of stuff I could lose.
00:34:48 So I started the game over, and in the beginning part where you're playing as Vivi,
00:34:53 I got my five cards, and I just started challenging this one dude over and over again,
00:34:58 and just like, just raking him for...
00:35:00 I had like 30 slimes, and all I would use is slimes in every battle.
00:35:04 I was doing this like an hour and a fucking half.
00:35:07 Flans, I mean.
00:35:08 And so, I'm trying to take this guy's whole deck, which I don't think you can actually do,
00:35:15 I'm not sure, but I'm just taking this guy's cards for a long time,
00:35:18 and finally, I start challenging other people and immediately getting my ass kicked,
00:35:23 and I'm just like, what is this game?
00:35:25 So I finally just, I'm like, I'm gonna look up the fucking rules, I'm just gonna read them,
00:35:28 and then I read all the rules and I'm like, oh, it's a nightmare.
00:35:31 It's like, not only is the game extremely complicated,
00:35:35 but like, there's like cards that there's only one of in the game.
00:35:40 Oh yeah, absolutely.
00:35:41 And if you get that card, you're gonna have to use it eventually to get other cards that there's only one of,
00:35:47 and if you were to lose that card in a match, you have to then win it back in the next match,
00:35:52 or else it will just be gone forever.
00:35:54 That's right, that's correct.
00:35:55 And you will never complete your card deck.
00:35:57 Completing the card deck is considered like the most, like, difficult task.
00:36:02 It's prestigious.
00:36:03 Yeah, it's prestigious for sure.
00:36:05 So when I found all that out...
00:36:06 I mean, if you basically imagine, just imagine playing Final Fantasy IX,
00:36:11 not even like, to save the world, or do any of the stuff, it's just,
00:36:15 you're in there to become Setokaiba and have all the blue-eyed white dragons
00:36:21 and destroy the purple one.
00:36:22 That's one of the things I love about the Final Fantasy games,
00:36:23 is the PS1 one.
00:36:24 Well, the thing about, it's really frustrating, because in Final Fantasy,
00:36:28 they always put in something that like, there's like a challenge that would be fun,
00:36:34 except that there's that one thing that's so fucking impossible, that like,
00:36:39 you're just like, there's no way it would remain fun.
00:36:43 Like, as soon as I read the full rules and like, what to expect,
00:36:46 I was like, this will obviously stop being fun at some point,
00:36:49 so I should just stop now before I get disappointed.
00:36:51 I mean, that's fair.
00:36:52 So there is a tournament I think you have to compete in at some point in the game.
00:36:58 Do you have to compete in it? I think you do.
00:37:00 In Final Fantasy X, for example, there's like, if you go back to certain towns,
00:37:06 you have to fight like, insanely powerful versions of the Aeons,
00:37:10 and like, the only way you're gonna have a chance is if you have the ultimate weapons for your characters.
00:37:17 But to get one of the ultimate weapons involves dodging 100 consecutive lightning bolt strikes
00:37:25 in this one place, and predicting them and dodging them is not impossible,
00:37:30 because the controls are not built for this, so like,
00:37:34 and you have to do it 100 times in a row.
00:37:37 Yeah, I did it.
00:37:38 I did it.
00:37:39 You actually did that?
00:37:40 Of course I fucking did it.
00:37:41 How long did it take you?
00:37:43 I mean, the time I did it was like, when it first came out when I first played the game.
00:37:46 I mean, it took me hours. It took me a couple hours to get it done, I think.
00:37:49 Just a couple hours? I spent a couple hours trying to dodge 10 in a row.
00:37:52 Damn. I mean, it gives you some warning with like, the rumble of the thunder or something.
00:37:58 I'm sure dodging 100 lightning bolt sounds really hard to some people,
00:38:02 but we live in a post undertale world.
00:38:05 I spent six hours beating Sans. There's nothing that I can't do.
00:38:11 As a white male in America who beats Sans, there's literally nothing society can stop you from doing.
00:38:18 Did you also beat the jump rope minigame with Vivi in 9?
00:38:22 Oh, there's progressive difficulties. I don't think I ever beat the topmost one.
00:38:27 I beat like the 50 instead of like 200 or whatever the top one is,
00:38:30 but yeah, that one was pretty tough too.
00:38:33 That one I just got fed up with, because like, the reward I looked up and it like, wasn't that great,
00:38:37 so I didn't worry about it that much.
00:38:38 All the rewards are cards.
00:38:39 Cards. Yeah. Okay. There you go. There you go.
00:38:41 It was fun though. I mean, I love that Final Fantasy puts in that kind of stuff,
00:38:45 and you have the freedom to fucking do it or not.
00:38:48 I mean, that's some reason why I love those games so much.
00:38:50 I just wish they made it, I really wish they made it more.
00:38:52 Like, with the Tentrum Master, it's fine, because it's like, it's whole other own world,
00:38:56 but I also wish, because it is actually fun, that like, there was a version of it that wasn't a huge pain in the ass.
00:39:04 I hear that's what Gwent is for Witcher 3 people. Yeah, they just love playing that game so much.
00:39:08 But I would say that Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII, I have to say, is the best.
00:39:13 Like, it's fairly simple, and it's the best of any of the Final Fantasy mini-games,
00:39:18 which is why, incidentally, just unrelatedly, I'm real sad that Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X and XII
00:39:25 are all being ported to Switch, but notably VIII is just being ignored and skipped.
00:39:31 What?
00:39:32 Yeah, they're skipping VIII, they're just skipping VIII.
00:39:34 Also, it's coming to like, Xbox and Polypies 4 and something.
00:39:38 I never understood, I never really understood. People shit on VIII.
00:39:41 They sure do.
00:39:42 Like, it's like a, I don't know, would you say it's like a Dark Horse in that like, era?
00:39:46 It's the most oppressed race in all of gaming, Final Fantasy VIII fans.
00:39:51 Somehow, I feel like it's even less popular than X.
00:39:54 X is awesome.
00:39:55 X is beloved, X is beloved.
00:39:57 Is it? I don't know.
00:39:58 I played it recently and I literally plotted out an entire book.
00:40:03 I wanted to write about it.
00:40:04 That's how excited I was about X.
00:40:06 What? Why?
00:40:07 Hey, did I ever tell you?
00:40:08 I didn't like X as much.
00:40:09 I think age is superior to X for me, but whatever.
00:40:13 This reminds me.
00:40:14 I liked it more than XII.
00:40:16 There, I said it.
00:40:17 Oh, alright, fine, fine.
00:40:18 The first brain-embigging panel I ever went to at an anime convention was something called like,
00:40:24 Final Fantasy X and like, Tidus in the role of Ubermensch, or like something like that.
00:40:30 It was just about how Tidus is like, yeah, it was pretty dope.
00:40:33 It was very brain-long.
00:40:34 I will say my analysis does not incorporate such elements.
00:40:38 I don't.
00:40:39 Okay, alright.
00:40:40 Such elements.
00:40:41 Tidus being the, ah!
00:40:43 So yesterday, I went out, ah!
00:40:48 Yesterday, that scene is, that scene makes sense in the game by the way.
00:40:51 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.
00:40:52 People name that scene so ridiculously hard.
00:40:55 Like deliberately misunderstood.
00:40:57 Jason Arnold, or whatever his name, James Arnold Taylor, the voice actor.
00:41:00 He himself on his own YouTube channel.
00:41:02 Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
00:41:03 Like, a decade later, no, whatever, James Arnold Taylor.
00:41:06 He made a video, like, just clarifying, like, in extensive detail.
00:41:11 And he pulls out the script he was given from Square when he recorded the game.
00:41:16 And it shows an explicit detail, like, all the reasons why he was intended to be forced.
00:41:21 You should be able to tell that immediately by watching the scene.
00:41:25 I know.
00:41:26 People don't, people don't actually know what they're looking at.
00:41:28 It's Spoonie's fault.
00:41:29 Spoonie made fun of it.
00:41:30 It is Spoonie's fault.
00:41:31 It is Spoonie's fault.
00:41:32 He fucking didn't get it because he didn't like the game and he's returning.
00:41:35 Because, I mean, that's, that's Spoonie being very nostalgia critic by just misunderstanding
00:41:39 what that, like, scene is actually.
00:41:41 Yeah, yeah.
00:41:42 Well, you know, Spoonie, you know, Spoonie's dead and nostalgia critic is disgraced.
00:41:48 It looks like those hacks got what was coming to him, just like we all will one day.
00:41:52 Yeah, it's true.
00:41:53 It's coming.
00:41:54 First they came for nostalgia critic and I said nothing.
00:41:57 And I said nothing.
00:41:58 Then they came for Spoonie and I enjoyed it and laughed.
00:42:02 So yesterday I thought, hey, this is just getting better and better.
00:42:05 Yesterday at long last.
00:42:06 I can't wait for the next one.
00:42:08 God damn it, Ben!
00:42:09 Why are you laughing so hard at this?
00:42:16 Yesterday I went out to the local game stores, the local big used game stores finally, which
00:42:22 are amazing out here in Boston land.
00:42:25 Oh, cool.
00:42:26 I went in search of Melee.
00:42:27 You can't find Melee anywhere.
00:42:29 I'll give you Melee for price.
00:42:30 Fucking Mewtwo King bought every copy in the world.
00:42:32 He's hoarding them right now.
00:42:34 Just like Saddlekai, but he's got all the blue eyes, white dragons.
00:42:38 What I did, however, impulse purchase was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
00:42:43 And then six hours later found out that they literally that day announced a port to the
00:42:48 Switch.
00:42:49 Dude, online play for Crystal Chronicles.
00:42:51 Come to the fucking Switch or whatever.
00:42:53 Does it have couch multiplayer?
00:42:55 Does it have what?
00:42:56 Does it have couch multiplayer?
00:42:58 You know, I don't know.
00:42:59 Probably, but I mean, the Switch is built for couch multiplayer, but I didn't check.
00:43:03 And I'm very glad that I did not do what I almost did and buy several Game Boy Advance
00:43:09 SP link cables because I didn't think I had enough Game Boys.
00:43:13 Because for those who don't know, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles has the worst local multiplayer
00:43:17 of all time.
00:43:18 Right.
00:43:19 Where it requires everyone to have a link cable for their GBA to the GameCube so that
00:43:25 you can have a map screen on the GBA screen.
00:43:28 And one of the players has to carry the crystal chalice at all times.
00:43:33 So.
00:43:34 Right.
00:43:35 That's right.
00:43:36 Like basically you have to fight within this little circle that is surrounding this chalice
00:43:40 and one of the players just has to carry the fucking chalice and that's all you get to
00:43:44 do.
00:43:45 But like you can have four players play this game, but one of them is always stuck with
00:43:50 the chalice.
00:43:51 By the way, I'm just looking it up.
00:43:53 Local multiplayer has not been confirmed, but online has.
00:43:56 But here's the hilarious, I was looking this up and I found out that you can play the game
00:44:01 with GameCube controllers as long as you have the Game Boy Advance link cable plugged in when
00:44:05 it loads the level, and then you can swap it out for a GameCube controller and play
00:44:09 it perfectly fine.
00:44:10 So what you're telling me is they really just were doing this to push system sales of GBAs
00:44:15 or something.
00:44:16 Yeah.
00:44:17 I mean big time is for the link cable.
00:44:18 This is also why Four Swords Adventures happened.
00:44:20 These are like around the same time and then they horribly bombed and so they did not
00:44:24 do this again.
00:44:25 Digi, you know what we should do is you and me should do a playthrough of Kirby's Amazing
00:44:30 Mirror is what we should do next time.
00:44:32 I want to play that.
00:44:33 That's my literal favorite Kirby game.
00:44:34 That is the best one.
00:44:35 What do you mean by that?
00:44:36 That's four players.
00:44:37 It's four players, right?
00:44:38 Yeah.
00:44:39 It's four players multiple GBAs.
00:44:40 Oh, I did not know that.
00:44:41 Yeah.
00:44:42 That's sick.
00:44:43 Yeah.
00:44:44 That's a really good one.
00:44:45 I mean I guess if we all meet up in a place and we all have GBAs and link cables, that
00:44:49 can happen.
00:44:50 When are we going to do another Radcom?
00:44:51 Never.
00:44:52 It's banned.
00:44:53 When are we going to do another games?
00:44:56 I want to play video games with my band games.
00:44:58 We should do a Shekels for Hekels and one for Crystal Chronicles when it comes out.
00:45:01 It's a fun one.
00:45:02 It's a game I've never played.
00:45:03 There's like sequel Crystal Chronicles games, but I've never played the original one.
00:45:06 Good.
00:45:07 I've got, well, because I've played, I mean, I bought it again.
00:45:10 I had it when I was younger.
00:45:13 It doesn't play anything like any Final Fantasy game.
00:45:16 It's just an action RPG with like, the level, it kind of just puts you on a level that's
00:45:23 like 20 minutes long and usually you just got to solve a couple puzzles and fight a
00:45:26 bunch of enemies and get to the end and it's just a pleasant little happy time, but it's
00:45:29 got really cool character designs and great music, great art design.
00:45:34 But what about the Chalice?
00:45:36 I thought the Chalice just was terrible.
00:45:38 Well, if you're playing on single player, then you've just got a Mugle that carries
00:45:42 it around for you.
00:45:44 So it's not even a big deal on single player mode.
00:45:46 On multiplayer, it's just a bad game.
00:45:50 Okay, cool.
00:45:52 But on single player, it's perfectly fine.
00:45:54 And then I also bought a Fantasy Star Online, which is the greatest game of all time, Word.
00:46:01 Word.
00:46:02 There's a lot of videos going around right now.
00:46:04 It's like arrows flying over your head in the Indian and Joe's ride Disneyland.
00:46:07 It's just like constantly...
00:46:08 When is my stupid switch owning roommate going to stop being a coward and buy Splatoon
00:46:16 2?
00:46:17 You could buy it.
00:46:19 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:20 I could.
00:46:21 He's got Zelda, he's got Mario Odyssey, but he doesn't have Splatoon 2.
00:46:30 Blown the fuck out by Joseph Anderson, no thanks.
00:46:32 Ben, you know you could just come over here and play it because Tom has a switch.
00:46:38 And that's true.
00:46:39 I'm fairly sure he has Splatoon 2 because he really loves Splatoon.
00:46:45 Maybe I'll do that.
00:46:47 Maybe I'll come over there and be Splatoon 2.
00:46:50 Yeah, it's a good idea.
00:46:52 I recently started playing Metal Gear Solid 1 with my friends and it was totally like
00:47:00 the eye-clap from when I saw it, experience, and willingly and happily, whenever we saw
00:47:06 any sound effect or character, we just went like, I love Solid Snake!
00:47:11 Yeah.
00:47:12 That's the peak experience.
00:47:17 And then when we heard the brand, we just like jumped up from our seats and just clapped,
00:47:22 it's hard as we fucking could, like every single thing that we could, we did.
00:47:27 My friend's mom can testify, we were fucking tearing up the house to see Metal Gear happen.
00:47:32 Every time a new asset appeared on screen.
00:47:35 What happened when you saw my Japanese enemies?
00:47:38 Oh, okay, like me and my friend, Leif, we basically know what was up with Metal Gear
00:47:46 2 to an extent.
00:47:47 My friend Kyle and the Tories Furry, and I've called that many times on the show, bitch,
00:47:52 did not know.
00:47:53 So the entire time, me and Leif were building this the fuck up saying like, Kyle, Kyle,
00:47:57 it's you, you're gonna be on screen soon, it's gonna be you, then I'm gonna start pissing
00:48:00 his pants, and then we jumped up and we started making fun, like Kyle, this is you, you're
00:48:04 a bitch!
00:48:05 Fuck you!
00:48:06 And it was great.
00:48:07 It was, you know, something like...
00:48:08 It was great time.
00:48:09 Fairly owned.
00:48:10 Yeah, we just beat the tank guy, it was a horrible experience.
00:48:15 Vulcan Raven.
00:48:16 The game is scary and awful, and makes up, like, it's like, like, migraines, but visually...
00:48:21 Have you gotten to the part where you have to machine gun down dogs yet?
00:48:25 No, oh, we started to play the first Metal Gear game, and that was a fucking, that was
00:48:30 a trip.
00:48:31 That was a, that was...
00:48:32 Oh, the NES one.
00:48:33 Yeah, I didn't use to emphasize with, you know, prisoners of war and Poland being reduced
00:48:37 to gulags and forced labor, but now I do have to play one video game, and I understand
00:48:41 what it was like for them.
00:48:42 It was a great time.
00:48:45 And too bad the PS3 we were playing on is gone forever, because Kyle moved away, and everyone's
00:48:51 moving away, and this is the part of my life that's in movies, and it's happening right
00:48:55 now.
00:48:56 Oh, they're going to college now, huh?
00:48:57 Yeah, all my friends are gone.
00:48:58 It's like that.
00:48:59 It'll happen again.
00:49:00 This'll happen again when you start to get, like, 50 or 60, only this time they're all
00:49:04 moving to hell.
00:49:05 Munchy, it's literally your favorite Green Day song.
00:49:08 The one that's...
00:49:09 Oh, dude, I want to let you know that literally that night was the last time I saw Kyle, and
00:49:15 for the entire car ride home, we fucking blasted good riddance as loud as we could and screamed
00:49:23 the lyrics.
00:49:24 The lyrics which are as follows.
00:49:26 Tell me why'd you have to go make things so complicated?
00:49:31 See the way, act like somebody else gets me frustrated.
00:49:36 I love that song.
00:49:38 I love the gorillas.
00:49:42 It's crazy.
00:49:43 Everyone's leaving.
00:49:44 I thought it was a joke that people said, like, oh, your friends are going to leave,
00:49:47 and I was like, psh, nah, and then there they are.
00:49:51 They're all going to go off to become boarders managers.
00:49:57 You got to do what I do, Munchy.
00:49:59 Establish an organization that entraps the people that you want to keep nearby with monetary
00:50:03 incentives.
00:50:04 Yeah, financially.
00:50:05 That's the way to do it.
00:50:06 Yeah.
00:50:08 You got to bait the hook.
00:50:09 You got to bait the hook.
00:50:10 Keep them around.
00:50:11 Otherwise, they'll be.
00:50:12 Otherwise, what do you want to be lonely?
00:50:13 What do you want to be abandoned?
00:50:14 Yeah.
00:50:15 Exactly.
00:50:16 Watch the fuck out.
00:50:17 It's this or nothing.
00:50:22 I've got a topic that was kind of brought up.
00:50:25 No, you don't.
00:50:26 I do.
00:50:27 It was brought up via, well, I was reminded of it, because a couple of things.
00:50:32 Munchy was talking about Pokemon Go, and Isabel got confirmed for Smash, which is cool.
00:50:38 And there is a connection, and it's that she's a dog, and it's that I got a dog.
00:50:42 I got a dog recently.
00:50:43 What?
00:50:44 I saw, I saw the dog.
00:50:45 I'm keeping it under wraps.
00:50:46 I saw it on Twitter.
00:50:47 I have a dog.
00:50:48 You got a dog.
00:50:49 I have a dog.
00:50:50 This is the happiest I've ever become on a PCP episode.
00:50:52 And his name?
00:50:53 His name is Lord Sashomaru.
00:50:55 Is this full name?
00:50:56 No.
00:50:57 Come on.
00:50:58 That's his full name.
00:50:59 Dude, that's crazy.
00:51:00 Your dog is Lord Sashomaru, and my cat is Killala.
00:51:03 Killala.
00:51:04 I thought of that, too.
00:51:05 I fucking can't even believe it.
00:51:07 The Inuyasha permeates the culture.
00:51:10 So what do you say when you're calling the dog?
00:51:13 We call him Sessho.
00:51:14 Call him Sessho.
00:51:15 Come here, Sessho.
00:51:16 Sessho.
00:51:17 You got to call him Sessho.
00:51:18 That was the fan girl nickname for Sashomaru.
00:51:20 Was that true?
00:51:21 Okay, good to know.
00:51:22 Good to know.
00:51:23 Probably mix that one in there, too.
00:51:24 Yeah, he's a great guy.
00:51:25 What kind of dog is he?
00:51:27 Okay, get this.
00:51:28 He looks like a small German Shepherd, or a German Shepherd combined with a Chihuahua.
00:51:33 But in actuality, he is half Beagle, half Welsh Corgi.
00:51:37 I see.
00:51:38 It's very strange.
00:51:39 I'm not saying he's a men pin, but no, he's just a freak.
00:51:42 He is a freak.
00:51:43 He's a weird genetic slurry.
00:51:45 Indeed.
00:51:46 That's him?
00:51:47 Isn't it funny what we've done to dogs as a race?
00:51:49 I just sit back and laugh.
00:51:51 Just mess them right the fuck up.
00:51:53 We got him from the SPCA or whatever, like the shelter, and he had recently, like within
00:51:58 like a couple of weeks, gotten his balls removed, and he still has a dangling empty ball sack.
00:52:03 It is quite horrific.
00:52:05 It's just nightmarish to think about, really.
00:52:08 I feel so bad for him.
00:52:10 Why do they...
00:52:11 Why does he just have the sack and not the balls?
00:52:15 Well, apparently the sack like shrinks into the body or like it goes away to some degree
00:52:20 at some point.
00:52:22 Yeah.
00:52:23 Erasing all traces of sexuality.
00:52:26 Thank God.
00:52:27 My dog has a literal genetic dysfunction where he has a boner 100% of the time.
00:52:33 Is that true?
00:52:34 They're told it's painful.
00:52:35 Yeah.
00:52:36 That sounds real.
00:52:37 You got to help him out, dog.
00:52:38 You got to help him out.
00:52:39 I mean, they say you're supposed to go to the hospital after a mere four hours.
00:52:42 Consider an entire lifetime.
00:52:45 It really gets in the way of new dates.
00:52:48 Yeah.
00:52:49 By the way.
00:52:50 If anyone out there wants to make fan art, I've got a picture in my mind of I am...
00:52:56 You know Rin, the little girl who hangs out with Lord Sashomaru?
00:53:00 That's me.
00:53:01 The dog is Lord Sashomaru and Michelle is that little gremlin jack-in who hangs out
00:53:07 and just dances and does kind of Jewish shanties around to announce Lord Sashomaru's presence.
00:53:13 I demand that you become a basic bitch and send us cute dog photos on a regular basis.
00:53:18 Don't do that.
00:53:19 Do not do that.
00:53:20 If you do that, you better make a fucking containment chat.
00:53:23 Yeah.
00:53:24 Why?
00:53:25 Why?
00:53:26 I don't want to see that shit.
00:53:27 What's wrong with dog?
00:53:28 Why?
00:53:29 What's wrong with you guys?
00:53:30 Look, I saw one picture of the dog.
00:53:32 I get it.
00:53:33 I'm not kidding about this.
00:53:35 I have seen none and I get it.
00:53:37 And I didn't even hear it described.
00:53:39 I got up to piss before he started describing it so I wouldn't have to hear it.
00:53:43 I want to see dog photos.
00:53:45 I just thought it was an interesting change in my life because actually I feel a ton of responsibility now
00:53:50 and it's a huge burden in the good way, just something I have to worry about now.
00:53:55 What's it like being able to try and raise a child?
00:53:58 This is the basic training.
00:54:00 So far, so good.
00:54:02 So far, so good.
00:54:03 Doesn't hate you yet?
00:54:04 He doesn't hate me yet, but he's building up to it.
00:54:07 I can see it in his eyes.
00:54:08 He's building up to it.
00:54:09 He's waiting to spring that on me at my weakest moment.
00:54:12 But it's good.
00:54:14 So that shows he's a good lad, but I'm waiting.
00:54:19 How old is he?
00:54:20 How old is he?
00:54:21 Oh, he's just under a year.
00:54:23 So he's a year old.
00:54:24 So he's basically full-grown.
00:54:25 He's small.
00:54:26 Yeah, okay.
00:54:27 I wasn't sure if he was a puppy or not.
00:54:29 Is he for leisure or for pleasure?
00:54:31 He's for farm use.
00:54:36 He's not for pleasure.
00:54:39 I don't know.
00:54:40 Maybe you need a guard dog.
00:54:41 I know you live in Cincinnati, which is a nightmare.
00:54:43 That's true.
00:54:44 He's for pleasure.
00:54:45 He's for my pleasure.
00:54:47 Indeed.
00:54:48 Anyway, that's about it.
00:54:49 I would say probably I'll post pictures on Instagram if anywhere else.
00:54:53 So I mean, you can call me there if you care to.
00:54:55 So there you go, people.
00:54:56 Munchie, did you not know that I already have a dog?
00:54:59 No.
00:55:00 And I also post...
00:55:01 Sunny.
00:55:02 Wait, wait, wait.
00:55:03 I didn't know you post images.
00:55:05 On Instagram.
00:55:06 And sometimes Twitter.
00:55:07 Oh, I don't follow any of your Instagram, so they don't use Instagram.
00:55:10 Same.
00:55:11 Same.
00:55:12 It's a good place to put dogs and cats.
00:55:14 It's where normie things go.
00:55:16 Normie things go on Instagram.
00:55:18 That's how I think of it.
00:55:20 Hmm.
00:55:21 I don't have any normie things.
00:55:23 The most normie thing I did this week was have a fucking séance in my house.
00:55:28 Yeah.
00:55:29 Yeah.
00:55:30 Fucking...
00:55:31 I went for a walk.
00:55:32 Mm-hmm.
00:55:33 Because it was, you know, late and I forgot to spin my poker stop for the day.
00:55:37 Of course.
00:55:38 Gotta hit that.
00:55:39 And I went out and it was dark.
00:55:41 And Luna, my cat, decided to come with us as she sometimes does.
00:55:49 Walking like...
00:55:51 It's very strange if you've ever had a cat walk with you, like go on a walk with you.
00:55:56 We were going through the park.
00:55:58 Cats like to go where they think you're going.
00:56:02 So she would like wait for a bit and then gallop like as fast as she possibly could.
00:56:07 Like at marked speed.
00:56:09 Like 100 meters in front of us and then turn around and wait for us.
00:56:13 So you can like take your cat out and she'll like follow you around?
00:56:16 Yeah, it's weird.
00:56:17 I think what she does, I think that she saw that we take the dog for a walk.
00:56:21 And like part of her is like, I want to be included in that.
00:56:24 So when she's outside and we go outside, she jumps out from the bushes and says,
00:56:29 I'm coming with you.
00:56:30 Mm-hmm.
00:56:31 And it's very...
00:56:32 That's actually amazing.
00:56:35 I lived with a cat.
00:56:37 I lived with a cat who was the opposite of that, who if the door was ever opened,
00:56:42 she would bolt and just run.
00:56:45 Sounds like a captive prisoner.
00:56:47 Yeah.
00:56:48 Oh.
00:56:49 Yeah.
00:56:50 No comment.
00:56:51 How do we know that this person isn't what, you know, Peter Pettigrew was in Harry Potter.
00:56:56 Which is a, you know, a transmogrified human attempting to seek escape.
00:57:00 Listen, I tried to put a harness and a leash on this cat.
00:57:06 It was the scariest thing that ever happened.
00:57:10 Jesus Christ.
00:57:11 All right.
00:57:12 She went completely ballistic.
00:57:17 Trying to get it off was a nightmare too, because she just ran into a corner traumatized
00:57:22 by the fact that she was wearing a thing.
00:57:26 I tried to walk her into the backyard and it was going okay for like two seconds.
00:57:33 Like for two seconds there was like a solid hope like, oh, maybe she's over it.
00:57:37 Maybe she can like walk around on this little cat harness and a little leash.
00:57:41 Wait, wait, okay.
00:57:42 Until I stepped on a twig, until I stepped on a twig and she went nuts and like flew up
00:57:47 to the end of the leash and was like, bah!
00:57:49 I was like, like spun around on the leash like a tether ball.
00:57:52 Like a taut tether ball on a cord.
00:57:54 Okay, I must have missed something.
00:57:56 Were you attempting to expose your therapy on this cat by trying to get her like acclimatized
00:58:00 to like being outside that she wouldn't run away?
00:58:02 Yeah, I was trying.
00:58:03 Sounds like it, right?
00:58:04 The idea was to try and like get her used to wearing this harness so she could be taken
00:58:08 on catwalk.
00:58:09 Makes sense, you know, relatively.
00:58:11 Yeah.
00:58:12 Well, that was a failure.
00:58:13 Yeah, yeah.
00:58:14 Completely failure.
00:58:15 But hey, I just wanted to say that about this Pokemon Go thing, I just love Pokemon Go
00:58:21 because I'll go walk with Sessho and we'll just walk.
00:58:25 It's a little bit of a longer walk, but I'm kind of glad.
00:58:27 It gets me out and doing stuff all the way down to the Pokestop on the end of the road.
00:58:31 And I hit that and then I walk back and it's a great time and I love doing it.
00:58:35 And I'm happy to have an excuse to go do more things.
00:58:38 So I'm getting over the initial anxiety of getting a new responsibility in this dog
00:58:43 and getting way into just the benefits.
00:58:45 And I'm raking them in.
00:58:47 This dog is paying dividends.
00:58:50 This is just such a perfect breeding grounds for fatherly attributes.
00:58:54 You can test out the dad joke.
00:58:56 Are you a Pokemon Sessho?
00:58:58 Literally every single time you walk here to get the exact perfect cadence
00:59:02 so that you can torment your kids every day of their lives.
00:59:05 That's true.
00:59:06 That's absolutely true.
00:59:08 And I look forward to doing so.
00:59:09 I can't wait for the day when Pokemon Go is an old man thing and I'm still doing it.
00:59:13 Hey, by the way.
00:59:14 All the kids are hip and they don't do it and they think it's gay.
00:59:17 That'll be great.
00:59:18 All the kids are playing Fortnite Go.
00:59:21 They're all walking around with VR headsets or whatever.
00:59:25 I'm shooting each other.
00:59:26 This was absolutely incredible to me.
00:59:29 So when we're actually getting Sessho, it was crazy.
00:59:32 We go to the SPCA or whatever it's called, the dog place.
00:59:35 And we look at all the dogs.
00:59:37 And Sessho is by far the cutest and the strongest dog in the whole place.
00:59:43 And so we're like, okay, he seems like he's got kids going places.
00:59:47 So we get him.
00:59:48 And then we go up to the desk and I'm like, all right, what's the damage?
00:59:51 How much for this fucking piece of shit asshole dog?
00:59:54 And they're just like, with that plus the color and the leash,
00:59:57 that'll come down to, they're like bracing me forth.
01:00:00 They're like $56.
01:00:02 And I'm like, this is like a life we're talking about.
01:00:06 It's only $56.
01:00:08 Okay.
01:00:09 And then they hit me with this bombshell.
01:00:10 They're like, okay, but there's something you need to know.
01:00:12 And I'm like, oh shit, what's it going to be?
01:00:14 You can have this.
01:00:16 There is a 30 day return policy.
01:00:18 And if you are one fucking fraction of a split fucking second late,
01:00:22 you'll be on this 30, 30 day policy.
01:00:24 And you bring this dog back anytime.
01:00:26 We will not take it back without paying the fee.
01:00:31 And I'm like, what's the fee?
01:00:33 $14.
01:00:34 $14.
01:00:35 I was just like, guys, relax.
01:00:38 That's like, by the way, you can just leave a dog there for free.
01:00:43 So like, why do you even have to pay anything?
01:00:45 I don't know.
01:00:46 You can leave a dog there for free, but you can't return a dog.
01:00:50 I mean, it's a charity.
01:00:51 Without paying $14.
01:00:52 Just like a man and a dog outside.
01:00:53 And like, they'll, you know, do it.
01:00:55 Oh, okay.
01:00:56 So that's what I'm incentivized to do, to just drop him off, tie him to a fucking post,
01:01:00 pound it into the ground, and then just skid off on my fucking sick electric skateboard.
01:01:05 Like hog time and leave him on the doorstep.
01:01:09 Exactly.
01:01:10 How much time has this taken up?
01:01:11 Stuff an apple in its mouth.
01:01:13 Well, I mean, this was like the week where, oh, do you mean just like getting the dog or since having him?
01:01:17 No, since having him.
01:01:18 Like, like how much maintenance do you have on this guy?
01:01:21 Very little, honestly.
01:01:22 Very little.
01:01:23 It's been, I mean, he honestly has a great attitude.
01:01:26 So like, he has not been up in my shit.
01:01:28 He's been like hanging with me when I was like streaming the other day.
01:01:31 He was in the room and like didn't cause a peep.
01:01:33 He's been real good.
01:01:34 He's sparked like ten times.
01:01:35 How fucking poor are these people like getting dogs from SPCA that they're like having to
01:01:41 brace you for the news that it'll be $56?
01:01:44 Not to be overly condescending, but like honestly, there was a lot of poor people there.
01:01:47 Getting dogs.
01:01:48 So like I could, I could, I got the impression economically.
01:01:51 Absolutely.
01:01:52 Yes.
01:01:53 But like dogs make you happier.
01:01:55 Statistically speaking, maybe not digi here.
01:01:57 I mean, I mean, what do you think?
01:01:59 What do you think it costs like on a weekly basis to maintain a dog?
01:02:03 He doesn't really.
01:02:04 Honestly, not a lot.
01:02:06 I mean, all you really have to pay for is food.
01:02:09 Dog food is all you need pretty much.
01:02:11 And that's like, I don't know, maybe up to 40, maybe $50 a week.
01:02:16 I mean, I have no cons of it.
01:02:19 That's probably way too much.
01:02:21 Feeding your $40 to feed your dog.
01:02:24 That was a retarded guess.
01:02:25 We bought one bag for probably $20.
01:02:26 I don't even eat $40 of food in a week.
01:02:29 Okay.
01:02:30 Honestly, it's probably like $10.
01:02:31 Maybe.
01:02:32 Maybe.
01:02:33 Not even that.
01:02:34 There you go.
01:02:35 All right.
01:02:36 Enough dog talk.
01:02:37 I wasn't trying to bore everybody with the dog talk, but, I like the dog talk.
01:02:39 I wish she was the only dog talk.
01:02:41 We're getting dangerously close to dream.
01:02:45 Sheer.
01:02:46 Sheer.
01:02:47 What's the word?
01:02:48 Sheer.
01:02:49 What's the word for when something doesn't matter?
01:02:53 Sheer.
01:02:54 Irrelevance.
01:02:55 All right.
01:02:56 Yeah.
01:02:57 I'm unbelievably uninteresting.
01:02:58 C.G.P.
01:02:59 Gray has been, I've listened to his latest Hello, Internet episodes and he is going on
01:03:06 a, not a crusade.
01:03:08 He's got a operation Cyclops, which is.
01:03:11 I don't have a way of what this is.
01:03:14 To cut out social media usage, podcasts, Reddit, and just generally internet usage that is
01:03:21 clearly wasting his time and the sort of stuff that he checks without thinking.
01:03:25 Yeah.
01:03:26 Good guy.
01:03:27 I like you.
01:03:28 I'm really into that.
01:03:29 I've been into that for a while, but I've never gone like full force on it because I do
01:03:34 kind of like, you know, it's, well, I mean, you justify it to yourself in a lots of ways.
01:03:41 Yeah.
01:03:42 I was talking about like in that, you know, let's play or something about a similar sort
01:03:49 of thing.
01:03:50 Yeah.
01:03:51 I'm like, I was inspired by M dot strange because I've been like watching a bunch of
01:03:54 his blogs and he has his attitude towards social media is that he has never even bothered
01:04:00 with it.
01:04:01 Like he pretty much identified it as a bunch of horse shit from the beginning and just
01:04:04 like, like out of pocket makes fun of it and is just like, yeah, it's totally worthless.
01:04:08 And I'm like, this is a guy with a career as an internet content creator telling you
01:04:13 that you don't need social media to do that.
01:04:16 So like, why am I tricking myself into thinking I do, you know, good question.
01:04:22 Yeah.
01:04:23 So I was thinking about all that stuff and I'm like, what do I do?
01:04:28 Like I could, I could feel when you're in the paradox of needing to be social media
01:04:33 plugged into a podcast to tell you to get off the internet and stop wasting your time.
01:04:37 I mean, they they talked about that in the hell of internet podcast was like, well, it's
01:04:41 what are you going to say to our listeners then?
01:04:42 Right.
01:04:43 Yeah.
01:04:44 But I think I don't think of a podcast as social media, though.
01:04:48 Well not so.
01:04:49 I mean, CGP Gray was was more about like things that eat up his time that he could do Twitter
01:04:55 obviously and like whatever for me, like podcasts and like long YouTube videos.
01:05:00 Like from the thing, the thing that I should probably unplug from immediately is like, I'll
01:05:04 start up my day and I'll just start my day by like starting up some like some long like
01:05:10 analysis video or something.
01:05:11 I don't know.
01:05:12 Listen to like start up an old like, I don't know, a Matthew Matosis or some yeah, start
01:05:17 up a red letter media to a playlist or something and it'll just go throughout the whole day
01:05:21 and I'll be like, well, just leave it on in the background.
01:05:24 I won't pay attention to it, but like, at some point, at some point I start paying attention
01:05:28 to it and at that point it becomes a waste of time.
01:05:31 That's why ASMR is great because nothing in it is important at all, but just having sound
01:05:35 is helpful.
01:05:37 Just like is this podcast ASMR, nothing in this podcast is helpful at all.
01:05:42 Well, I recommend Ben instead of throwing on interesting analysis videos, just throw
01:05:48 on needle drop videos because I almost apparently uninteresting.
01:05:54 That is deeply uninteresting to me.
01:05:56 So like even more so than you.
01:05:58 That would work.
01:06:00 I mean, probably the best thing, the best thing for me is to put on music.
01:06:04 Like when I put on music, it helps me focus, but I don't care about that.
01:06:09 I can't man, music's too distracting, but whatever it's not just well, I think music
01:06:14 I listen to music that isn't distracting fucking do you like my car, you know, put on
01:06:24 Future Funk and Baby Waves mix, mix-taves.
01:06:27 Yeah, I guess this guy doesn't even know shit about sludge fest.
01:06:31 He's not even listening to raw, slow down, Alvin the Chipmunks, he's not listening to
01:06:37 Country Eye Joe dubstep pre-mixes, he doesn't know what the place is going on.
01:06:41 I was just putting, I was just starting, just starting, Hillary Duff, where'd you come from?
01:06:44 Where'd you go?
01:06:45 Hillary Duff, come rain night four, put on autoplay and just let it go, let it take you
01:06:49 where it may.
01:06:50 Yeah, makes sense.
01:06:52 I've been like to do, to, like I've realized a lot of stuff is just you have your house
01:06:59 and you have your computer and through that you get the internet and everything.
01:07:03 And then like other things in your house are just not there anymore like they used to in
01:07:07 old houses.
01:07:08 Like everybody used to have a piano, everybody used to have like, you know, more like, you
01:07:15 know, you have like the family bike or like a set of tennis racquets or football.
01:07:19 You know, that old slut, they have chained up in the yard, the family bike.
01:07:22 I hear you, I hear you.
01:07:23 Yeah, family bike.
01:07:24 Yeah, rider and all that.
01:07:26 Like, there's just not a lot of stuff in my room and I'm like, like when I don't have
01:07:34 the internet, I have video games, but I don't have like, I'm not a toy guy, I don't play
01:07:38 with toys anymore.
01:07:39 Yeah.
01:07:40 And I threw a lot of them away.
01:07:41 So like, what, what do I get to fill my hours with if not like editing or like, like leisure
01:07:46 hours.
01:07:47 Thinking, yeah.
01:07:48 Yeah.
01:07:49 Literal sitting in the thinker pose for hours on end and you know, yeah, why not?
01:07:53 Why not?
01:07:54 I ask.
01:07:55 I can't think of anything.
01:07:56 Nate, why not?
01:07:57 I don't know.
01:07:58 I'm curious.
01:07:59 Nate, why not?
01:08:00 Would you think with your brain to think about your ideas and who you are?
01:08:05 My ideas.
01:08:06 What's so retarded about that?
01:08:07 My ideas are too dangerous, Munchie.
01:08:09 The world's not ready.
01:08:11 He needs to be distracted from the material goods.
01:08:15 Thinking while that's funny to imagine just sitting down and thinking.
01:08:20 Thinking in the shower is quite good.
01:08:21 I mean, I spend a lot of time just literally sitting and staring at a wall and thinking
01:08:26 about what I'm going to do.
01:08:27 Well, okay.
01:08:28 Literally thinking while doing a manual labor, I find very enjoyable.
01:08:32 Like while doing the dishes can be a very helpful like time to think.
01:08:36 Yeah.
01:08:37 There's only so many dishes.
01:08:38 There's only so many like tools to do.
01:08:39 Yeah.
01:08:40 Yeah.
01:08:41 I'll eat food so I can survive.
01:08:42 Yeah.
01:08:43 Yeah.
01:08:44 I'll drink some water.
01:08:45 Yeah.
01:08:46 Okay.
01:08:47 What I'm trying to get at is that I've started to like right now get more into arts and crafts
01:08:56 in a way that I used to like as a child and a boy.
01:08:59 You mean like macaroni?
01:09:00 No.
01:09:01 I'm crocheting right now.
01:09:02 I'm doing a little crochet and I've realized my brother has like a bunch of like modeling
01:09:08 clay and I'm thinking, yeah, I'm going to get some like tools.
01:09:11 I'm going to model something.
01:09:13 I'm going to make 3D models, but like analog 3D models and like I kind of I kind of want
01:09:22 to get like a wood carving knife.
01:09:23 Oh yeah.
01:09:24 The wristband I made munchy.
01:09:26 I haven't let anything happen to it.
01:09:28 I'm really I appreciate you going down this road hippo.
01:09:32 I feel that I want to start doing something with my hands other than masturbate because
01:09:38 like in Dick Masterson talks about this all the time that like as a man you need to have
01:09:44 like a craft because like it's just something that makes you feel proud of yourself for
01:09:48 like having built something.
01:09:51 And I kind of got a taste of that by putting together Ikea furniture because I built a
01:09:58 bed frame and this fucking mechanical desk I've got and it was just like that sense
01:10:05 of man I took this this looks like it was going to be a pain in the ass and now it's
01:10:10 a thing that I literally use constantly every single day.
01:10:13 Yeah, it's a good feeling.
01:10:15 What if I could just at any time do that like what if I just needed something and I could
01:10:21 just put it together and then have it forever that would feel so badass, you know.
01:10:29 I want it like I think you have to make things like I've always had like like dreams of like
01:10:34 making a fucking real suit of armor with something like chainmail.
01:10:38 It makes sense for me especially because I am so about like customization and like having
01:10:43 everything be just right in my work environment where like I'm always frustrated when I go
01:10:48 out to the store to like buy a shelf and there's no shelf that is the shelf I want.
01:10:52 And so it's like what if I just you know blueprinted out the shelf that I want and then built
01:10:59 that fucking shelf and it would probably be cheaper than trying to buy one.
01:11:04 I mean it's not going to be as pretty but it will be the shelf I want because it doesn't
01:11:09 exist you know.
01:11:10 I have like fantasies of like having an office like Casey Neistat which I consider like Casey
01:11:15 Neistat's office is like his reality marble from Fate Stay Night where it's just like
01:11:20 in there he has infinite power and infinite control over everything that's happening.
01:11:26 Yes.
01:11:27 He should be a Fate Stay Night character and that should be his thing.
01:11:29 I love his office too and it's funny because like when you compare his and MKBHD's like
01:11:35 it's two radically different aesthetic approaches to the same thing.
01:11:40 Both are just very clean, very organized environments but one is like about being uncluttered and
01:11:45 one is about being like immediate.
01:11:47 Casey's is so practical and immediate and we lean towards that one.
01:11:51 I like yeah I definitely lean towards Casey's but like I don't even know if I'd want it
01:11:57 to be so ridiculously organized like he holds on to stuff that he doesn't really need to
01:12:04 like I feel as though he's so attached to having this as much visual noise as possible
01:12:11 and I'm kind of moving away from that because that's how my old room was like I used to
01:12:15 just have anime posters covering every fucking conceivable surface of the room and it was
01:12:19 just like because I wanted it to be like you know the old otaku room pictures you used
01:12:24 to see.
01:12:26 And now I have more appreciation for just like well instead of just covering everything
01:12:30 let's build unique areas like let's think about this wall and what can we make it into
01:12:36 and like not necessarily that it's austere but that there's a theme or an art piece so
01:12:40 that it's like it's not just a chord arrangement that's practical it's like chords arranged
01:12:46 in a to create something like what if you you know spiraled all your chords that are
01:12:52 attached to the wall until like you formed a Pikachu head or something you know.
01:12:56 This image is basically Digi's perfect environment.
01:13:00 His perfect work station.
01:13:01 That's actually pretty great I would not mind that.
01:13:04 Digi no this is a nightmare the whole point of this picture is that it's absolute hell.
01:13:09 I don't know it seems pretty comfy.
01:13:11 This is what like my setup was I mean aside from the fact that it's in a basement this
01:13:14 is like what it kind of was when I was a kid like just a TV on a box and like you got
01:13:20 a fucking you got a husband chair this looks comfy as fuck I mean a husband chair that's
01:13:25 what that's called those are called husbands.
01:13:28 We got to link this one this is a famous meme image of of I literally can't even conceive
01:13:33 of what's wrong with this it looks comfy as long as it's like yeah as long as it doesn't
01:13:37 stink and it's warm does it say rape sucks on the wall and no one knows what that says
01:13:43 I think it says Ray sucks oh yeah it says Ray sucks or is it it might be rare as in
01:13:48 rare abandoned Nintendo to go work with Microsoft I think it's RAYE Ray sucks okay I guess.
01:13:56 All they would need is just like some carpeting like a blanket that would go a long way yeah
01:14:01 well it's like the fucking pliers on the ground and this like shitty towel I mean are these
01:14:05 in the main he probably use the walls and floor aren't good but the actual furnishing
01:14:09 is great I mean I guess it's alright.
01:14:12 Is this is this Jesse's is this the furnace room the furnace room it actually looks worse
01:14:18 than this like this looks more comforting to me than the furnace room how how low how
01:14:24 unfortunate.
01:14:25 I like the two the two the two bottles of water there the two like jugs like once for drinking
01:14:32 and once for peeing in right next to each other and sometimes he makes a little mistake
01:14:36 and grabs the wrong one whoopsie what little oopsie dates.
01:14:43 I mean he's got a great gamer thirst he doesn't have time to stop and check which one he's
01:14:47 grabbing and guzzling currently I'm fairly certain that the VCR is just sitting on top
01:14:51 of a toolbox and the pliers are sitting just outside of the toolbox and I'm thinking he
01:14:56 was probably using them for something with the VCR because every chord you play into
01:14:59 a VCR is like an impossible fucking wait is it I suppose is that is that a portrait of
01:15:04 Iwata yeah it's a torii Iwata okay no way that can't be what that is no it is for Iwata
01:15:11 it is Japan it's a torii Iwata you tell me they love video games he's kind of fucking
01:15:18 oh it's good I mean Iwata is looking real good in this guy it's a real smug I'm I'm
01:15:24 thinking PCPHQ right here I hope we get a set up this good in PCPHQ the love of God let
01:15:33 it happen oh I think okay I studied this picture very closely and I think he's playing
01:15:38 Twilight Princess I think I was wondering what you might be right because if you see those those
01:15:44 like six icons across the top of the screen I think those like the horse whip things you know
01:15:49 how like that could be you hit your horse repeatedly and hands zoom and hands Alexa now
01:15:56 if you want to talk about truly being a poor boy picture if you want it you know this is how
01:16:02 this guy's going to get out of the basement because he has a Gamecube copy of fucking Twilight
01:16:07 Princess and those sell for like a lot he can probably refinance his house on that
01:16:13 Luigi's Mansion is definitely on top of the stack who said gaming doesn't pay I think he's got
01:16:16 fucking fancy star online on the bottom this is a true gamer right here because it looks like the
01:16:21 box all right I mean maybe it's possible I mean it's out like the bottom box is like a color
01:16:27 yeah that white to blue gray it's either like Mario Sunshine visual shit or Sonic Adventure DX
01:16:35 or Fancy Star okay all right well all right does Iwata look a little bit George Costanza-ish
01:16:42 in this picture to anyone I mean I suppose in general oh there's some more pictures of this
01:16:48 well I mean yeah I just found this other one from this definitely confirms that it is Iwata
01:16:53 yeah I mean 100% 100%
01:16:57 oh he's got a hot pocket package like to the left of his TV in the second I think it's like a
01:17:01 chicken pot pie like a frozen pie something like oh wait I do know what I see I see sleeves I see
01:17:07 hot pocket yeah hot on the TV on the milk crate actually it seems like it's more like he's playing
01:17:12 Luigi's looking at this space really is like a tactile experience like I can really feel what
01:17:17 it's like to be there yeah I just I really like the tight and closed spaces because like is like
01:17:23 laying on the ground that's not good oh that is gross yeah like get all just put it on just a towel
01:17:30 on it's a towel on concrete it's literally well let me let me get a dank base I'm gonna go out
01:17:35 on a crazy limb here and say and this this might be racist this is probably an Asian guy
01:17:42 you think so this is just on the basis of my my Asian friends Iwata uh just it's Iwata's
01:17:51 gamer set up he has a picture of himself on the wall walls and floor aside like this is exactly
01:17:56 how my friend Donson would have been playing Gamecube like yeah towel on the ground two water
01:18:02 like two full water jugs like two fucking gallon jugs towel on the ground not towel on the head
01:18:08 and it's because the two water jugs lets me know that this guy does not intend on getting up like
01:18:13 that's true he is not going to stop this sesh although he also has a soda but he probably
01:18:18 just had that for his eating like he clearly ate a plate of something dude the presence of those
01:18:23 water jugs and that like neatly snug fitting box is the most interesting thing here it tells me
01:18:28 this guy is like serious about hardcore gaming incidentally he needs to fuel up what he has
01:18:33 eaten is a banquet pot pie you can see the box for the pot pie I knew it yeah that's right and you
01:18:38 can see the 10 there's also hot pocket things around there's a fucking hidden object game we're
01:18:43 playing yeah playing where's wall though I just feel really comforted by this image in a strange
01:18:49 way it feels like my childhood I I know it's so warmly tinted someone someone please like do a
01:18:54 gif of did you like phasing into this picture like like being absorbed into this world where he's
01:19:00 finally at peace yeah it's like all shitty it's like shitty setups for sat like fantasy novels
01:19:07 like the guy gets sucked into the book it's an isekai this is literally the digi isekai happening
01:19:16 imagine like the opposite of like the getting sucked into the video game where like the
01:19:20 the video game character comes out and then plays the game just sits there and plays the game that
01:19:25 he was trying to do is so easy I think the box that's behind the chair is a glad bag box
01:19:33 like a trash bag trash bags all right guys enough on this fucking picture no I I love this
01:19:41 it's it's it's great I want to I want to go there yeah we all want to be a minute living in this uh
01:19:48 this guy's basement you know what I'm talking about the minish from the minish cap oh yes
01:19:55 living in him from arthur and the invisibles my favorite 3d animated family movie from the 2000s
01:20:03 shout to the guy who made arthur and the invisibles I'm sure he's poor and died yeah
01:20:11 um all right team uh what do we do should we should we go to questions now or anybody else
01:20:16 want to bring up the topic to talk about questions I how long we've been going like an hour and a
01:20:20 half yeah pretty close to an hour and a half did you what's this giant list of topics you've been
01:20:24 talking about have you like what have you written down what are you talking about has he been mentioning
01:20:30 one when did I say anything about a list of topics you said earlier like you've been making an epic
01:20:35 list up all night intending to be on the pcp while making an epic list was the list the list has
01:20:40 nothing to do with the pcp I am just making an epic list and that is why I've been up what what
01:20:45 constitutes an epic list all right here is you want to hear about my list that I'm working on yeah
01:20:50 I'll tell you yeah I do it is called is it a things I want to consume and so number one so okay
01:20:58 you're I think Nate I think you're gonna love this once I've explained it all the way I think
01:21:02 you'll actually be totally down for this idea so what it is is a list of every piece of media
01:21:10 that I want to consume whether it's one that I haven't consumed before or that I want to
01:21:16 re-consume like you know so rewatch replay so far I've gone through anime games books movies and
01:21:23 tv shows so it's just the the the column it's a spreadsheet the columns are as follows format
01:21:31 title time investment in total and time investment in pieces so for instance the first thing on the
01:21:38 list sounds like this sounds this sounds like Oolulili is things I want to do before I die
01:21:43 it's kind of like that except not as autistic just slightly less well that's one man's opinion so
01:21:49 okay like for instance it'll say anime little witch academia time investment total seven hours
01:21:56 time investment in pieces 22 minutes because you can watch 22 minutes at a time um I'm also going
01:22:02 to code it by like categorize it by like casual consumption versus like immediate so you know
01:22:09 something that you could just watch an episode of randomly forever actually way into this idea
01:22:13 already I already love yeah because the idea here and this is this is actually related to what
01:22:17 hippo is talking about um so I have a lot of these moments in my life where I just am not really sure
01:22:24 what to do and I sit around for like an hour trying to think of what to do yep like I just go like
01:22:31 uh do I want to watch a movie do I want to play a game do I want to watch an anime and it's like
01:22:35 I know there's like hundreds of things I want to consume but like how do I fucking pick one like
01:22:42 how do I keep track and then like a big part of it is I don't know uh do I want to like dedicate
01:22:47 myself to a game that's going to take 16 hours you know because like the first game that comes
01:22:51 to mind is some rpg uh so because I have this organized by time investment I can just uh you
01:22:58 know just say all right well I want to spend four hours on a video game so I just literally
01:23:06 go through and find a video game that takes four hours and I go oh I can play this game finally
01:23:10 and then once I beat it it's fucking off the list and so like this making this list has been a really
01:23:17 like I imagine this list is growing a lot faster than it's shrinking um well I mean it's brand new
01:23:23 so it's growing yes it is growing way faster than it's shrinking um however I am being extremely
01:23:29 spartan about this list it's like anything that I don't think I actually want to finish is not
01:23:35 making the list it has to be like stuff that I'm like yeah I really want to finish this like I went
01:23:41 through my mal and cold like shit loads of my on hold and plan to watch list where I was like
01:23:46 because there's a lot of stuff that you tell yourself you're gonna watch because you think it
01:23:49 would be like good to have seen it just to be like more worldly or because like it'll teach you
01:23:55 something about a creator but you don't really care so like this is a list of just stuff that I
01:24:00 like have a personal investment in that I'm like I want to see this thing through and so creating
01:24:06 the list it's simultaneously is a feeling of man I've got a lot of shit I want to consume but on
01:24:12 the other hand it's like this is all of it like I'm going through everything I'm going through
01:24:18 like every recommended chart on you know on every fucking 4chan board like every rec chart every
01:24:25 like list I have of stuff I've consumed and like anything I want to rewatch anything I and there's
01:24:30 a lot of stuff that I'm just like you know what I don't need to rewatch this show like yeah it was
01:24:34 good but I fucking remember it and I'm not going to get anything out of watching it again I don't
01:24:38 care you know so it's not going on the list but so like I'm at 437 items right now and I'm pretty
01:24:46 what is the total hours investment oh it uh make a spreadsheet I mean I spread it is a spreadsheet
01:24:52 spreadsheet oh okay you you might be able to to get a like a little formula to figure that out yeah
01:25:00 I that'd be fun I might I mean it would take fucking forever but well if you if you have a
01:25:05 column that lists things in like the format of just a number and you select the column it should
01:25:10 auto add them if it's in excel then you can see on the right unfortunately I have it written as
01:25:13 like the number and then the word hours and also the number then the word men um because I don't
01:25:20 know why I feel the need to type it out every time but it just makes it more beautiful all right um so
01:25:27 but like yeah it I do organize it that way so that like I can just you know click the column and
01:25:32 then look at all the two hours stuff and be like oh what two hours thing do I want to you know consume
01:25:37 today and and the basic idea was not not just to make it easier to pick out stuff to watch but also
01:25:42 to cut out all the dumb bullshit I do end up filling that time with because usually this is the time
01:25:48 that I'm gonna end up on Twitter and or I'm gonna end up on my discord and just like talk to people
01:25:54 for like an hour about nothing that in none of it matters like you know it's just like literally I
01:26:00 go there to waste time because I couldn't think of what I wanted to do fast enough and this is easier
01:26:06 and that's the main strength I think of this kind of list which is why I love it M dots what really
01:26:11 got me on this was that M dot strange has this video called be your own dope dealer and he just
01:26:16 talks about how like you know all the systems of all the social media is just to make you have dopamine
01:26:20 hits for for everything that you click on and it got me thinking about like what do I go to for
01:26:25 dopamine and it's mostly just the confirmation that people have consumed the thing I made like I
01:26:34 don't really care about likes or views or any of that shit I ever since getting tweet deck which
01:26:40 cuts my Twitter down to like like I have a mentions tab that's available right when I go on the page
01:26:46 and there's nothing else there no likes no retweets no other bullshit it's just the mentions
01:26:51 and since having that that is now the only tab I read I don't actually read Twitter I just look
01:26:58 at my mentions because I get enough of them that I can you know that it that can occupy my time
01:27:03 but it's like why why do I care that people are mentioning me on Twitter other than you know
01:27:09 and eat a little ego rush of like ah people are paying attention to me you know it's the main one
01:27:14 yeah and I get nothing like even when like you can trick yourself by being like well some of my
01:27:21 friends tweet funny stuff or like some of sometimes people draw me fan art and it's like yeah but
01:27:27 that doesn't you're just justifying this you know like that stuff is largely irrelevant you
01:27:32 could spend the same amount of time you saw you spent reading that funny tweet doing something
01:27:36 productive and in my case like consuming media is productive like it is something that will either
01:27:43 give me ideas or enrich my understanding of the things I talk about because my job is media analysis
01:27:48 so like the fact that I spend so much time on stuff that just is utterly inconsequential
01:27:55 I'd like to cut that shit out you know and just focus on things that are that are the very least
01:28:00 fun and enjoyable and like we'll have a lasting impact you know yeah so uh yeah that's my big list
01:28:07 I also have made an epic list kind of recently not the same like not for the same reason
01:28:15 but I just decided one one day to like list every video game I have access to because I own in some
01:28:22 fashion like on Steam or I have the physical thing or it's on one of the consoles I own
01:28:27 and I've made I googled like I made a spreadsheet and then I googled um for like a pick random thing
01:28:35 from a list in excel or google.google sheets or whatever and now I go to that tab and I just
01:28:43 click on the little button and it just pops out a game that I have and can play right then and there
01:28:49 if I really wanted to by the way uh that's cool just if anyone's interested in making a list
01:28:53 like this themselves here's your pro tips for anime my anime list will tell you how many episodes
01:29:01 and the length of each episode I just assumed for most shows 22 minutes but in cases where I know
01:29:07 it's not I listed it differently so you know I just calculated the amount of hours based on 22
01:29:12 minute episodes for games I used how long to beat which is a site that just tells you how long a
01:29:18 game takes to beat there's there's like the main story and then main plus extras and then completion
01:29:23 and it gives you those three times based on you know user submitted times I usually take about as
01:29:29 long as whatever is main um and then for books there's actually a site called how long to read
01:29:37 that tells you how long it takes to read a book based on if you can read 300 words per minute
01:29:41 which I'm pretty sure I read slower than that but I just went with it um and then for movies and tv
01:29:46 shows there's a website called binge binge or like binge time binge something like that that tells
01:29:52 you how long it takes to binge a show so yeah you can find all of the fucking at least a semblance
01:29:58 of the data online um yeah it's pretty sick I mean it'd be helpful I'd like to make one at least for
01:30:03 like I don't know the top 10 things I wanted to consume right now and then just to have that so
01:30:08 I can like ah like last night uh me and uh we watched um what was it um fucking uh we watched
01:30:14 this movie uh Gerald's game do you guys ever see this it's a scary movie it's about it's about the
01:30:19 the lady gets chained to a bed and then her husband dies on top of her and they're all like alone
01:30:24 but a great movie highly recommended um but then after that I wanted to watch something and I was
01:30:29 like I want to watch something what's going on I ended up watching um the purge at like the first
01:30:34 purge it was shit it was garbage uh so I really wish I'd done something else if only I'd thought of
01:30:40 something better or you know sooner than I had that movie instantly god that movie sucked um but
01:30:46 also very funny also another thing about actually making this list sorry budgie is that uh like um
01:30:54 there's a lot of stuff that I am more encouraged now that I know how long it is because like with
01:31:00 with video games in particular people don't usually tell you like the exact length of games
01:31:06 and there's like a lot of games that that like seemed like rpgs to me that go on forever and I
01:31:12 like for instance uh fable is only like 12 hours long that's shocking yeah and like I thought about
01:31:19 it and I was like well that explains how I got so far in it as a kid because I almost beat it as a
01:31:23 kid um but you know this idea of not knowing how long a game is I've wanted to I've I own uh the
01:31:29 last guardian I've really wanted to beat it I just like haven't because I'm like as scared it's going
01:31:33 to take a while but if I know that it's like five hours or something which it probably is
01:31:38 be way more likely to actually play it dude I'm gonna hit you up literally right now it is 12 hours
01:31:43 long okay all right good to know one of the one of the things I did as soon as I've made my gaming
01:31:49 list is like I assumed that to be like the the average time would take to be like every game on
01:31:55 this list is like one week per game if I'm doing other things yeah and then it would take like
01:32:01 actually let me check how many games there are there's like uh 510 games I guess so like 510
01:32:10 weeks that's a lot of years yeah yeah like that's 10 years that's 10 years or so I mean yeah so like
01:32:16 the prospect of buying a new game is like completely gone I didn't have much of a reason to buy into like
01:32:21 to to keep up with modern games or to buy games or to to do things but like there's a lot of these
01:32:27 I don't want to play but it's a lot of them that I do and I think yeah uh I've got I've got plenty
01:32:32 of stuff to keep me occupied I think the biggest shocker on the whole list for me was Mega Man
01:32:37 Legends which I had just because I've only ever played like the first hour or so of it multiple
01:32:42 times over the years and I just had the impression it was an RPG and therefore long it's like a seven
01:32:48 hour game like I could probably beat it in an afternoon in one sitting yeah um that was nice
01:32:54 to know it's empowering yeah I because I will play a game in one sitting you know yeah try to make
01:32:59 a list like this many times in my life like four or five or six times I've tried to but I've just
01:33:04 never I've always wanted to have a mal but for everything I've never just like some media spreadsheet
01:33:10 that was just you know I mean I I spent a lot of time a few years ago my everything list I have
01:33:17 like spreadsheets of everything I've consumed in in each uh each media that I made like a couple
01:33:22 years ago and I've tried to keep updated with but not really well mal is a lot easier obviously but
01:33:28 um but like knowing all the stuff I've completed it doesn't like this how do I put it like with
01:33:37 anime I had like the on hold list and the plan to watch list and like that kind of lets me know
01:33:43 like what's left out there but like eventually I go through the on hold list and I'm like okay half
01:33:49 of the shit doesn't need to be in here like half of this is stuff that I like watched the first
01:33:53 episode and went oh well this wasn't bad so I'm not gonna drop it but then like a year later I'm
01:33:58 like I'm never gonna find time to watch that fucking show like who cares that it wasn't bad
01:34:02 it's not amazing if it didn't make my fucking if it didn't have my balls in a vice in episode one
01:34:08 then it's not good enough to be like on the list of ultimate things I want to consume because
01:34:13 even after cutting all the stuff I don't think I want to get better in the episodes
01:34:24 one thing say one thing doesn't matter I just remember that like I looked into Buffy the vampire
01:34:31 because Jesse is a vampire slayer sorry but like there's like eight seasons of that and every
01:34:39 episode is an hour long right right and it's like some it's just too much like some of the seasons
01:34:45 have like 20 episodes that's just I can't believe I watched three seasons of loss was it good
01:34:51 it's all right all right yeah I was I mean I didn't I didn't see or no was it six seasons
01:34:55 I watched all but once I watched all but once season I didn't watch the last season I am consistently
01:35:00 blown away by the fact that normies watch like entire shows like that they love this watch they love
01:35:06 60 hours of a show in like three days and I'm like how do you even do that like people think I
01:35:12 watched so much anime you know why did you know anime that takes that long outside of like Gintama
01:35:17 you know it's cuz fucking people and this is fine I like this is with me and League of Legends
01:35:22 before it's you they go to work for eight hours they come home they sit their ass down they watch
01:35:27 TV that's what like every person in America does uh and that's you know it's fine but it's you know
01:35:33 also gay so that's yeah I finally instead of just standing at the brink of the bus and just
01:35:40 saying that I will soon I've actually actually taken the plunge and I'm reading books now
01:35:46 shout out to uh Sarah Yowl I hate your voice but your writing is pretty good I'm listening to

01:42:45 question that is acknowledge your female what is that this is why yeah let's just let's just rope
01:42:50 like velvet rope a little corner of the pcp to acknowledge our female fans that sounds like a
01:42:54 good use of time and not at all I didn't mean for her to turn into this I did not know it
01:42:59 I didn't make congratulations one of our like one of our like six female fans you've just
01:43:03 alienated so you know well done look I'm just ribbing her if she can't have a little ribbing

01:45:44 guy who offered the bounty the other day about uh for like the the timestamps of the weird utilitarianism
01:45:50 no it was starfleet it was starfleet that was an entire week ago can you imagine can you believe
01:45:54 that it's hard to it's hard to but that was seven whole days ago that is pretty crazy um uh here here
01:46:01 he's an update so let's just listen to his fucking up to here once bar hey there pcp that once bar
01:46:06 again from the place hey there yeah so uh I will admit wrecked the criticism you know how we're
01:46:12 always complaining about in the last episode saying well deserved hey guys haven't made a video in a
01:46:18 first did you hang on pause yeah um the the reward is credit I'm not oh the bounty he's gonna pay you
01:46:31 an exposure all right thing okay the bounty uh second of all uh getting contact with me uh yeah
01:46:37 don't get me on the uh he's about to show his channel once bar google it you'll figure it out
01:46:42 uh but sorry did you what were you saying what were you saying oh I was deliberately talking over him
01:46:45 but any oh shit I get it the uh I actually don't even remember what I was fucking saying oh just
01:46:52 that like everyone keeps opening with like hey hello pcp it's uh whatever and I'm like just get to the
01:46:58 point yeah get get to it get to it we don't tolerate that from youtube video don't I don't want to hear
01:47:03 voicemail yeah no there's no need for preamble no and keep it we know we are the shortest you
01:47:08 possibly can I'll tell you people if you record one when I see one of these that is longer than a
01:47:12 minute I'm like hmm I don't know about that so there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing in
01:47:19 all of human knowledge that takes more than a minute to pull out the time tested uh a comedic
01:47:25 goal that is hey blank I am blank and then you can proceed to tell your joke and it works every
01:47:31 single time I'll read your name I'll read your name so don't even include that just say the question
01:47:35 or get to the jump like the guy with the robo voice was good he didn't do shit just imagine
01:47:39 just imagine that you're like uh like a drunk guy in the crowd like we're up on stage and you
01:47:44 are heckling us you're just saying whatever comes to mind as loud as you can scream into the microphone
01:47:50 I'd rather you do that I would say that if at all possible try and keep your message under like 15
01:47:57 seconds I think that 99% of the time you can probably say what you want to say in like 15
01:48:03 seconds that's probably true that work on it don't be afraid to do a couple takes I don't give
01:48:08 that that last voicemail could have been hey fuckface all you get is credit dumbass shouldn't
01:48:15 have maybe wasted all your time go to my channel yeah yeah once bar's a good guy but uh that that
01:48:21 true there was some some rambling there so there you go buddy there's some constructive criticism
01:48:25 for you I'm just saying that I made a lot of calls into the biggest problem the universe in the dick
01:48:29 show right and every single time I just sat there and labored over what I was gonna say for minutes
01:48:35 on end to try to make it as funny and concise as possible and I never got played even though I
01:48:42 tried so hard because other people were even better so yeah you know it's a hierarchy uh all right
01:48:49 well let's go to uh we got a fumble the second I fucking actually started talking fair enough uh
01:48:54 ultimatum juniper with another one here what do you what do you got what do you got I'm supposed
01:49:01 to have been working right now okay hang on four years ah okay because of you fuckers
01:49:11 I've lost that time now all I want really is compensation via uh the star fleet brand of
01:49:24 communism you know the one uh so like you guys would be like put in a isolated chamber stop it
01:49:33 where you have to wait stop stop it your time okay doing literally nothing wait no stop just
01:49:39 gonna stop I just stop it gotta try all I want to say is that I ran the numbers I did the math
01:49:45 and I'm pretty sure that if you listen to all of the pcp continuously it would take like eight and a
01:49:51 half days that's a pretty good chunk of that's how much of your life we've stolen yeah there you go
01:49:57 maybe he means like all our independent content too and maybe he like quit his jobs we could be
01:50:02 ready for rad country and watch the whole thing you know I mean I know that my content in total
01:50:07 adds up including pcp adds up to like a month and a half of total time so that's pretty good
01:50:14 it's pretty good digi I recently made I recently made a uh a playlist like that for myself yeah
01:50:21 I got like oh yeah so I got like I got like 450 videos on that it was more than I thought
01:50:27 honestly I have way let oh I think you included everything in tbap and I just didn't go to the
01:50:30 tbap yeah I did include everything in tbap yeah right including including equestria bound which was
01:50:36 like a hundred videos and mine included absolutely everything even if I had like one line in the
01:50:42 background like I put you have to eat your greens in mine like I there were a couple there were a
01:50:47 couple things uh like um oh I I include I think I included analysis anarchy hell yeah
01:50:54 yeah that sounds good I just want to be thorough I even I included that that time that I called into

01:54:04 knocked myself out of ketosis this past week oh no and I think the way that I think it was
01:54:10 I did not eat any carbs I think it was that I ate too much protein damn you Ben because damn yeah
01:54:15 because because I went to the supermarket I went to Wegmans and I got like a deal I got like some
01:54:22 like some there's a Wegmans near you yeah it's the closest supermarket well there's a whole foods
01:54:28 and there's a Wegmans the Wegmans is cheaper we're constantly talking about how much we miss Wegmans
01:54:32 because Wegmans is the only thing in Rochester basically and all the grocery stores here suck
01:54:37 compared to it um do you miss uh do you miss food lion no food lion sucks do you miss uh do you
01:54:45 miss Kroger I would have missed Kroger I would have missed Kroger in Rochester if not for the
01:54:51 fact that Wegmans is even better but now I miss all of them do you have Publix in Virginia Beach
01:54:57 no southern grocery stores are stupid and I hate them uh um chat to violence they need that
01:55:04 they need the shout out from the pcp they need that endorsement um um um wait I was gonna say
01:55:11 okay I went to the supermarket I went to Wegmans and there was like a big thing of sausage super
01:55:17 cheap for like like two dollars and change a pound for this Italian sausage but it was like you know
01:55:23 expiring in maybe like three days yeah so I was like so I bought it and I was like I'm just gonna
01:55:27 eat nothing but sausage for three days I did it was delicious ketosis completely destroyed
01:55:33 it's not well I think I just I just ate too much protein and and yeah flew too close to the sun
01:55:38 flew too close to the sun lost lost that ketosis that was good that was good sausage so cheap I
01:55:43 I just realized that we're gonna have to go to questions after this why don't we just make questions
01:55:48 not a thing and have them just all be voicemails and that will weed out the week who are gonna be able
01:55:52 to do it well we we've been doing fewer questions yeah we've been doing less okay my my only thought
01:55:57 on that is like I let's say someone just doesn't own a microphone but they have like a great question
01:56:03 I'd like to give them away you know that's that's way too theoretical it's probably okay it's
01:56:08 unrealistic people have phones better people do have phones now yeah we should um I suppose we should
01:56:16 really like vet these questions and just pick out like you know the good ones yeah we don't vet them
01:56:22 at all I mean I make sure that they're not like completely nightmarish before playing them but
01:56:27 that's about it yeah speaking of which here's one from Ben St publicist let's uh let's see what he's
01:56:34 got for us so what he goes to this website you see it's um seen comics no what's he got and there's
01:56:43 this um there's this uh this story on there oh no called the vape men uh yeah vapor clouds
01:56:53 and I just wanted to give a quick review uh so that you could improve
01:56:59 your feature ads okay I can't there's not enough weed I can't so I noticed in this story
01:57:05 you got a guy and he's kind of seeing uh so that makes it a zero out of ten for me
01:57:11 and uh if you could just like post a revised version all right all right thanks for that buddy um
01:57:19 I think he was onto something you know sad boys you gotta nix them gotta get rid of the sad boys uh
01:57:25 makes sense all right let's do one more how about from um from you are the more bullet sci-fi
01:57:32 what was that nothing okay all right actually do please don't just read me
01:57:41 all right everyone the pcp is hostage at this very moment if you do not get the patreon
01:57:48 up to 1100 yes by the next episode yes I I'm offing one of the members I'm gonna
01:57:59 I'm sorry to say uh you better reach that goal or one of them's gotta go okay well I volunteer to die
01:58:06 he volunteers to die so we don't have to listen to any more voicemails um I volunteer Nate to die
01:58:12 I mean well he said he said it's a random the the the the choices in his hands we can volunteer
01:58:17 someone but it's really up to him at the end of the day okay this is this is not his doing yeah he's
01:58:21 he's he's subject to the whims of this just like the rest of us yeah so uh I mean there you go actually
01:58:27 the the patreon was above 1100 before but it's dipped down after the end of the month which is
01:58:31 understandable but you better start pledging everybody or we'll be dead so uh yeah I mean
01:58:36 your your favorite you know your favorite pcp member might be no more on the other hand your
01:58:41 least your least favorite one might be destroyed so I guess it's a it's a coin you can either give a
01:58:46 little today and keep a lot tomorrow or you can give nothing in a day and lose it all tomorrow
01:58:52 the choice is yours he's worked you've worked hard for this viewer don't all right that's enough
01:58:58 that's enough of these voicemails here let's just grab like a pity question or two and then
01:59:01 wrap this shit up shall we let's see what we got yeah that's a wrap uh how about um oh no what do
01:59:09 no no oh these are all shit no no let me let me uh this guy fucking posted a screen cap of a
01:59:17 question too long to be posted in a uh fucking tweet can you give me can you give me the cliff
01:59:23 the cliff notes is like what are your thoughts on the value of the game reviews that are objectively
01:59:29 incorrect uh and then he goes on to say reviews of k-mart's two final mix you usually describe
01:59:34 it as mindless button measure blah blah blah stop it stop stop it stop uh no that's that's just
01:59:40 i mean i guess i'd say if it's objectively incorrect i'm not a fan oh by the way that was uh
01:59:45 at karasu underscore b i i yeah here's one here's one from blue nimbus uh questions suck
01:59:53 why would anyone ever ask one this seems like we've entered a paradox uh with this question
01:59:58 iraq son says uh will you replace the voicemail segment with questions i maybe but in reverse
02:00:04 wait yeah i think he probably meant to in reverse uh maybe yeah i don't know i don't know yeah i think
02:00:12 bat sling says chibi bakas when oh yeah chibi bakas when soon munchie has an edited editing of one
02:00:20 there is one they're not that hard am i allowed to say um am i allowed to say what uh what
02:00:29 uh what it's about anime work we want to watch well i mean sure but don't get people's hopes
02:00:35 that this you weren't in the last episode no i haven't i haven't been on one yet right yeah
02:00:42 you can talk about what you want yeah yeah sure oh i really want to do one for s cry ed i don't
02:00:48 know what that is to happen i want i i think they will like it and i want it to happen it's great
02:00:53 it's pretty dope it's pretty especially if you're only watching three episodes because the first
02:00:57 three episodes are strong and wait so is this supposed to be like scared but instead of the
02:01:02 the middle it's cry s cry ed square squared it's like s dot c r y dash ed or something weird like
02:01:10 that it's pronounced it's fucked up it's bizarre i think there's a meaning behind it but it's
02:01:15 retarded and it doesn't matter yeah i there's only one question in here that i think is actually
02:01:20 interesting um kajoro bitter thorn asks what's the most you've ever done to pamper yourself
02:01:28 going to hawaiian vacation was a pretty big pampering experience i mean i didn't like go to
02:01:33 like a spa but like i feel like it's like the same sort of thing that's probably the biggest i've
02:01:37 ever done yeah yeah we've actually got a lot of questions in here oh yeah are they good
02:01:43 in the quite are you guys looking at the i was looking at the that's where i pulled that one from
02:01:47 and that was the only one i found that i thought was that could potentially lead to a funny story
02:01:52 from somebody yeah i don't i don't know about pampering i guess i've been to a salon once to
02:01:57 cut my hair because i had too much hair and a barber wouldn't know what to do with it myself i
02:02:01 don't like i don't like it i i want to get a massage so bad everything i get a massage for
02:02:06 like an entire year but then i have to get my dick jacked off at the end and i you know i just don't
02:02:11 have to go into a fancy restaurant with nate was a pretty big pampering of that was great
02:02:16 shout out to uh uh jack ruby's the precinct or something like the precinct yeah i mean like
02:02:21 because i pretty regularly pamper myself by just going to like expensive restaurants which i would
02:02:26 consider to be pampering yourself oh what i'm what is like pampering is pampering buying something
02:02:32 you like that is no pampering is like i've been pampering myself recently when i go and i buy
02:02:37 pampers and i really you know i tuck myself in i pampering is pampering is you lay in a bathtub
02:02:44 full of mud and you rub some green shit on your face and you put cucumbers over your eyes and
02:02:48 you wrap your head in the towel there's no other way to pamper yourself pampering just indulging
02:02:53 in things unnecessarily for your own benefit slash yeah treat yourself that's a good way of putting
02:02:59 and i was trying to get a dictionary definition and it basically is that uh oh urban dictionary uh
02:03:04 it's time it's time to bring it back oh my god oh our pcp pampering what do we got urban dictionary
02:03:11 to pampering all right here we go it is something you guys aren't aware of most gentlemen and older
02:03:16 men know this after a man and a woman are done with sex the man gets up and prepares a warm
02:03:21 to wet washcloth by setting it in the microwave for 30 seconds the man then comes back to where
02:03:26 his partner lay in either passes the washcloth to to her where she wipes herself down pampering
02:03:31 and cleaning herself or he wipes the woman down thereby pampering the woman not only is the sweet
02:03:36 gesture for your partner it also prevents uti and maintains cleanliness that's the definition
02:03:41 of pampering apparently it's a very bizarre urban dictionary definition why would you why would you
02:03:47 warm up the cloth after what i imagine would be like hot like vigorous sex like i want a cool
02:03:52 cloth well i guess it's better for sticky stuff okay here's just a definition of pamper on urban
02:03:57 dictionary the only pamper the a word only ever used by women over the age of 40 meaning to treat
02:04:03 or indulge yourself in beauty there you go all right well i'm done with this question are we done
