00:00:00 Take me to the channel for the PCP. Listen to some voicemail for the Minecraft stream. I really want to have Radcon funded by you. We can be Pro Crastinators.
00:00:17 Well, it looks like it happened again. Another solo cheesy cast. The only member of the PCP who actually shows up on time around here.
00:00:28 Well, I mean, I guess we could go into questions. I don't got that much to talk about. I usually write notes, but I didn't this week for this.
00:00:39 I told you guys I'm moving, right? Yeah, but I thought long and hard about this, and I'm thinking that I kind of don't want to live in a place with like 10 other people anymore.
00:00:52 I think, I don't know, I think that isn't too good for my psyche. I'm thinking maybe I need to like look for like a solo spot, but Boston is expensive.
00:01:03 And I was thinking like, hmm, it'd probably be cheaper to live in an RV. So yeah, I'm going to invest into getting an RV as soon as I can.
00:01:15 And you know, just shove it in your studio space. Am I right gamers? Am I right gamers?
00:01:25 Anyway, I guess it's question time. Time to pull up the questions right now. Right now.
00:01:36 Ben, you can jump in now. I'm out of material.
00:01:39 Wait, what? Huh? What? Oh, was I supposed to jump in?
00:01:43 Oh, shit. Oh, sorry. I, sorry. I was, um, I was distracted at watching the new Geo Wizard video, uh, the new mission across Scotland.
00:01:52 It was just so engrossing. I know you were doing a bit and I was supposed to jump in, but I just, I started watching his, his journey, his journey across Scotland.
00:02:00 And I was just so engrossed. I couldn't, I couldn't tear my eyes away.
00:02:04 Oh, okay. Well, at least you were doing something productive. Am I right?
00:02:08 Am I right? I just wanted to hear your, I just wanted to hear you, your Ben saying impression. Got to say, I'm offended.
00:02:15 Is that really what you think of me? Is this, is this, is this true?
00:02:21 I think if I want to do a better Ben saying impression to be like.
00:02:24 Was your heart in it?
00:02:25 It would be like, um, have you ever seen the, the movie Italian Spider-Man?
00:02:32 No.
00:02:33 Wait, wait, wait. Is that's the one with the gift of the guy going, oh.
00:02:37 Like he's pointing. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there's this one scene where these, uh, these Italian like college boys are a cat calling one girl.
00:02:46 And then Italian Spider-Man just comes out of nowhere and punches the boys and says, respect women.
00:02:52 And then the woman, the woman, the woman goes up to Italian Spider-Man and says, thank you Italian Spider-Man.
00:02:59 And then Italian Spider-Man just punches her in the face and says, shut up pussy cat. Now give me a macchiato.
00:03:06 Okay. Is it supposed to be funny? It sounds like it's supposed to be funny.
00:03:11 It's like if, um, I, the premise is like, imagine if like in the seventies, like somewhere in Italy, someone made like a bootleg Spider-Man movie where he acts nothing like Spider-Man.
00:03:23 He's just named Spider-Man and that's it.
00:03:27 It's, oh, he's just like, he's just happened to be called Spider-Man, but he has nothing to do with the character.
00:03:34 Right. Yeah. But throughout the whole, yeah, but throughout the whole, the whole movie is on YouTube and I think it's like under 30 minutes.
00:03:40 It's not too long. And yeah. And everyone just calls him Italian Spider-Man.
00:03:45 Like they say that.
00:03:46 Like in the movie, like in the movie, they call him Italian Spider-Man.
00:03:49 Yeah. They call him Italian Spider-Man.
00:03:51 Right. And besides that,
00:03:53 Why are they, are they Italian?
00:03:55 Um, it's implied. I mean, it's, it's the way it's shot is that
00:03:59 Does it take place in Italy?
00:04:01 Um, I don't know. I think it takes place in, I think the, the production company is Australia and I think they filmed the whole thing in Australia.
00:04:07 But, um, the, the joke is that they, they said the whole, they said all the lines in English, but then they dub it over with like Italian, right?
00:04:15 So it looks like, um, you know, it looks like that bad kind of dubbing, but that's like part of the charm, you know?
00:04:22 I see. I don't, I don't understand. I don't get it. I mean, I've seen the GIF.
00:04:28 I'm surprised I don't know more about this movie because I've been hearing about the Italian Spider-Man movie for like years.
00:04:34 Like that's such an old meme.
00:04:36 Yeah.
00:04:37 And yet I, I, this is all news to me.
00:04:39 If you watch the Italian Spider-Man movie at the end, like after the credits, it says, go visit the Italian Spider-Man MySpace page to get more info.
00:04:49 It's, it's that old.
00:04:52 Oh, okay.
00:04:53 Yeah, yeah.
00:04:54 I was going to say, I mean, that's newer than I thought.
00:04:56 Like I thought it was from like the 80s.
00:04:58 No, no, it's supposed, it's supposed to look like it's from like the 70s or 80s.
00:05:03 Like that's kind of like the bit, like they did that on purpose, you know?
00:05:06 Oh, well, they, they got me.
00:05:08 They got you.
00:05:09 They fucking tricked me.
00:05:10 They fooled the Great Ben Saint.
00:05:11 They got him under his fucking nose.
00:05:13 Nothing, nothing gets past me.
00:05:15 Yep. Nothing gets past Ben ever.
00:05:19 Um, I will quickly mention at the beginning of this episode that if you've been listening, you know that every so often I bring up, we have the Kato anthology guys on the Kato anthology, the Kato anthology Kickstarter is ending this weekend.
00:05:36 If you're hearing this, it will be ending on Monday.
00:05:39 So this will be the last weekend.
00:05:41 It is, um, it is closing in on $4,000.
00:05:44 I think the next stretch goal is for $4,200.
00:05:50 Nice.
00:05:51 Or 4,200.
00:05:52 Yeah.
00:05:53 Yeah.
00:05:54 Get in there.
00:05:55 Let's get that to 69.
00:05:56 Am I right?
00:05:57 Am I right?
00:05:58 Yeah.
00:05:59 So link, link in the description.
00:06:01 Check that out.
00:06:02 It's your last chance.
00:06:03 It is the last opportunity.
00:06:05 Um, yeah.
00:06:07 Check it out guys.
00:06:08 Very good.
00:06:09 I would check it out.
00:06:10 I would donate, but, um, I am broke at the moment.
00:06:15 I just moved into a new place.
00:06:16 What are you?
00:06:17 Did I go on?
00:06:18 Broke?
00:06:19 Yep.
00:06:20 What are you fucking, what are you fucking stupid?
00:06:23 Like what's wrong with you?
00:06:24 But you don't have any money.
00:06:26 Is there something genetic?
00:06:28 Something genetically wrong with you, my guy?
00:06:30 Like, well, how can you be broke?
00:06:32 Broke?
00:06:33 You're got, you're being real queer coded right now.
00:06:36 Cheesy.
00:06:37 That's really queer coded.
00:06:40 Ben, you're giving me a lot of gender envy right now, Ben.
00:06:44 I would recommend you stop.
00:06:46 Uh, uh, I mean, that's what I do.
00:06:49 That's why I just go out there and perform my gender in a way.
00:06:52 I just, just, I'm just, I'm a dysphoria machine.
00:06:55 I'm an engine for it.
00:06:57 Everyone's jealous.
00:06:58 I wonder if there's anyone out there who watches, who watched like the
00:07:01 Sonichu lecture and they're all, they look at you and they think,
00:07:04 damn, Ben's giving me some real gender envy right now.
00:07:07 No.
00:07:09 No.
00:07:10 I'm sure there's not.
00:07:13 I'm going to, um, I, I saw, oh man.
00:07:18 Okay.
00:07:19 So I watched the Sarah Zed video about the, the, the, the,
00:07:23 what are they called them?
00:07:24 A Bimbam brothers.
00:07:26 Oh yeah.
00:07:27 McElroy's.
00:07:28 I had, I didn't know anything about those guys.
00:07:30 I had like, I'd heard their names.
00:07:32 I knew that they did a D and D podcast.
00:07:34 I didn't know what they were famous for or anything about them.
00:07:37 But the one with the purple hair looks uncomfortably like me.
00:07:41 Oh no.
00:07:42 With the pink hair.
00:07:43 I didn't, I didn't like, I didn't like seeing that and wrecky like,
00:07:47 oh that's, he's kind of got my vibe going.
00:07:49 Oh no.
00:07:50 He's me.
00:07:51 I don't know.
00:07:52 I don't know if I feel about this.
00:07:54 It looks like me.
00:07:56 He does a podcast with his brother.
00:07:58 This, this is too real.
00:08:00 He does.
00:08:01 It's too spot on.
00:08:03 Um, he's, he's like a, he's like, if, uh, he's like if Ben St.
00:08:07 We're a loser.
00:08:08 That's like what people should say.
00:08:10 I look at what is it to me?
00:08:12 I don't even know which one.
00:08:13 I was about to say, I was about to say it's like if Ben St.
00:08:16 was productive.
00:08:17 I was going to say.
00:08:19 No.
00:08:20 Got him.
00:08:21 No.
00:08:22 Um, I was, um, I was shocked.
00:08:27 I was just, I was surprised listening to that video because she
00:08:32 mentions that one of the Mabim Bams wife does a podcast called
00:08:38 Saw Bones and I had heard of Saw Bones because John Boyce
00:08:44 mentioned Saw Bones in the pretty good episode where he talks
00:08:49 about the set.
00:08:50 I think it's the second ever like Olympic marathon where like,
00:08:56 do you, do you know this, what I'm talking about this video?
00:08:59 Is that the, is that the story about the lady who like cheated
00:09:02 or something?
00:09:04 The lady who cheated.
00:09:06 In like a marathon or?
00:09:08 No, you must be, you must be thinking of something else.
00:09:12 No.
00:09:13 If this, the, the John Boyce pretty good video about the
00:09:16 Olympic marathon, basically the story is that it was held in like
00:09:21 110 degree weather on like a dirt road and it was like, yeah,
00:09:29 like the runners were like collapsing from heat.
00:09:31 They were like breathing in like dust and like choking.
00:09:35 Some of them almost died.
00:09:37 There was like no water available on the route and it turned out
00:09:41 spoilers.
00:09:42 Go watch this video, but if you haven't seen it, it spoiler is
00:09:45 that it turns out that like the guy in charge of it was some kind of
00:09:48 like, I think he was some kind of like sicko fucking Auschwitz
00:09:52 Nazi scientist or something who like used the whole thing as
00:09:56 like an opportunity to test what happens when humans are
00:10:00 deprived of water.
00:10:02 It was like a sick experiment.
00:10:04 Do you know what year this was?
00:10:08 I think it must have been in the 1800s or so.
00:10:11 I don't, I have no idea.
00:10:13 It was like recent enough that there are like pictures of it,
00:10:16 but they're like old timey black and white photographs.
00:10:20 Yeah.
00:10:22 So in that episode, he talks to the lady from Sawbones,
00:10:27 which I guess must be one of the McElroy Brothers wife and asks her
00:10:32 if because one of the doctor, no, not the doctor, one of the
00:10:35 coaches, like one of the runners coaches is like following along
00:10:39 with him in a truck and he won't give the runner water because
00:10:43 he thinks that drinking water will like prevent him from
00:10:46 running.
00:10:47 He instead lets him like coat the inside of his mouth with egg
00:10:52 whites and then gives him like strict nine pills as like a
00:10:56 stimulant.
00:10:57 Yeah, that's what they fucking did.
00:10:59 It sounds like you would fucking puke on on the fucking
00:11:01 spot if you gave me that fucking shit.
00:11:03 Like they all like nobody finished the race.
00:11:07 Like only like a handful of the runners actually finished it.
00:11:10 Well, I mean, if you puke in the middle of the race,
00:11:12 secondly, you should be faster because you have less weight in
00:11:14 you, right?
00:11:15 Well, that must have been what he was thinking.
00:11:18 Right.
00:11:19 You don't want that all that heavy water weighing you down.
00:11:21 Exactly.
00:11:22 You know, maybe also if you shit your pants while you're running,
00:11:24 you should be able to run 10 times faster, right?
00:11:26 Just get it all out.
00:11:27 Right, exactly.
00:11:28 Just get it all out.
00:11:29 Cut your arms and legs off too.
00:11:30 They're just weighing you down.
00:11:31 You know how swimmers are like swimmers like fucking have to
00:11:34 trim all their body hair because hair like slows you down
00:11:37 when you're swimming, right?
00:11:38 It creates drag.
00:11:40 Right, exactly.
00:11:41 I assume it works the same way.
00:11:44 Jesus Christ.
00:11:46 I was just, I was shocked to hear that thing mentioned in,
00:11:53 I don't know.
00:11:54 It was just like, wait, that thing is connected to this thing.
00:11:57 And I know, and I know what that thing is.
00:12:00 And it's two different things.
00:12:02 It's that podcast incest.
00:12:04 I'll tell you that much.
00:12:06 I had another moment like this one, and this one really,
00:12:09 really pissed me off this week.
00:12:11 I've been, I've been listening to a bunch of Tim Rogers stuff from
00:12:16 Kotaku.
00:12:17 Well, yeah, it's a bunch of Tim Rogers videos, his own stuff from
00:12:20 Action Button and his older stuff from Kotaku.
00:12:22 And no, sorry, I've, I've unburied the lead.
00:12:27 I've spoiled a little bit.
00:12:28 Sorry, I meant to bring up, there's a new atrocity guide video
00:12:31 about Bob's game.
00:12:33 Oh yeah, I saw that.
00:12:34 Which is like, yeah, the story about the guy who made a game,
00:12:39 demanded that Nintendo publish it on the DS and staged like a,
00:12:43 like a hundred day strike and did all these like weird protests
00:12:47 to protest Nintendo not publishing his game on the DS.
00:12:51 In that video, she says that like someone who was involved in
00:12:56 like breaking that story was a guy who knew Bob and that was
00:12:59 Tim Rogers.
00:13:00 He like knew the guy.
00:13:02 And I'm like, oh wow, that's a weird coincidence.
00:13:05 And then I'm, I'm listening to want some old Tim Rogers video
00:13:08 on Kotaku.
00:13:09 And he just casually throws out like, yeah, I don't even remember
00:13:11 what we were talking about.
00:13:12 I think they were going shopping for games.
00:13:14 No, it's the video where he's going through games and he's
00:13:18 describing their box art from memory without looking at them.
00:13:21 And he's talking about finding a game on a shelf in a store.
00:13:25 And he says, yeah, I was shopping at a mall with my good friend
00:13:29 Vito Guisualdi.
00:13:31 And I'm like, I know that guy.
00:13:33 I hate that guy.
00:13:34 Fuck that guy.
00:13:35 This makes me so mad.
00:13:36 Isn't Vito that one like edgy, like internet comedian guy?
00:13:39 Yeah.
00:13:40 The guy who, the guy who I thought he seemed okay until I saw him
00:13:45 being like, JK Rowling actually makes some good points.
00:13:48 I was like, okay, nevermind.
00:13:49 Nevermind.
00:13:50 Fuck this guy.
00:13:52 He kind of reminds me of Lilith Lovett, who I hate too.
00:13:58 Who?
00:13:59 Lilith Lovett?
00:14:00 Yeah.
00:14:01 Do you know who Lilith Lovett is?
00:14:02 I do.
00:14:03 I've never heard of them.
00:14:04 No.
00:14:05 She's a trans, like libertarian who like, I don't know.
00:14:09 It's like, there's people on Twitter that I always see who like
00:14:14 every time I see one of their tweets, it's always like a fucking
00:14:17 atrocious ass.
00:14:18 She must know.
00:14:19 I wonder if she knows Aria DiMzzo.
00:14:22 Remember Aria DiMzzo?
00:14:23 That sounds kind of familiar.
00:14:24 Friend of the show.
00:14:25 That sounds kind of familiar.
00:14:26 Friend of the show was running for, was running for sheriff of
00:14:30 that county in New Hampshire.
00:14:32 I mean, they couldn't.
00:14:33 Another trans woman libertarian.
00:14:35 I'm not surprised.
00:14:36 They hope so.
00:14:37 Yeah.
00:14:38 Yeah.
00:14:39 Lilith Lovett was like, I mean, I feel like that's not a huge,
00:14:41 I feel like that's not a huge like, like van diagram crossover.
00:14:44 Those two things.
00:14:45 Maybe there is.
00:14:46 I don't know.
00:14:47 Not really.
00:14:48 I was about to mention earlier that I think one of the
00:14:52 McElroy's brothers were like a former Kotaku writer or something.
00:14:56 Right.
00:14:57 I mean, they're, I wouldn't surprise me at all if they did.
00:15:02 Cause like, I mean, when you're, when you're famous, you can just
00:15:05 write for anyone.
00:15:06 Anyone will publish your shit.
00:15:08 Right.
00:15:09 Yeah.
00:15:10 Yeah.
00:15:11 You could have for like a second.
00:15:12 I just, just made me mad.
00:15:14 Just made me wait.
00:15:16 What?
00:15:17 I said you cut out for a second there.
00:15:19 Oh, sorry.
00:15:20 Um, I just made me mad cause like, um, oh fuck Vito.
00:15:26 Fuck all these people.
00:15:28 They're all in a big club and I'm not in it.
00:15:30 It's all about who you know.
00:15:32 It doesn't mean it's all, it's all, it's, it's all a bunch of horseshit.
00:15:36 You know, you know, people, Ben, right?
00:15:40 You have a laundry list.
00:15:42 No.
00:15:43 Who do I, who do I, this, who do I fucking know?
00:15:45 Who do I fucking know?
00:15:46 Oh, oh, I'm that.
00:15:47 Oh, Ben St.
00:15:49 You mean that guy who's friends with Digi bro?
00:15:51 That's, that's me.
00:15:52 That's my legacy.
00:15:53 Yeah.
00:15:54 That's me.
00:15:55 You might be wondering how I got into the situation.
00:15:58 This, this is what it is.
00:15:59 This is the reality of my situation.
00:16:01 And it's so bad.
00:16:02 It's so shit.
00:16:03 You know, I think at some point in the past I must have thought like, yeah, maybe
00:16:09 like, you know, this is what you do.
00:16:11 You get a bunch of people, you get a bunch of creatives or whatever.
00:16:14 You form a little click.
00:16:15 You form a little collective.
00:16:16 You, you, you, you become like, oh, you're, you're associated with that group.
00:16:20 Oh, that group does all this stuff.
00:16:21 I don't know.
00:16:22 You forge a, you forge a collective identity.
00:16:25 Um, and then you all like mutually support one another and stuff.
00:16:29 Uh, well, I don't know.
00:16:31 Maybe at some point I thought that's what was going to happen, but it didn't work out
00:16:34 that way.
00:16:35 Uh, things didn't go, things didn't go quite how I expected it.
00:16:39 I'm, and I'm, and I don't like it.
00:16:40 It frustrates me.
00:16:41 I'm like, why couldn't I, why couldn't I have been?
00:16:44 We could have, we could have fucking, I don't know.
00:16:45 Maybe if I'd made better friends, we could have, uh, we could have started our own Kotaku
00:16:50 or whatever.
00:16:51 I think the, the real, uh, Genesis point was when, uh, Ben say it became a comedy.
00:16:57 I think that really ruined everything.
00:16:59 That I, if, you know what, if, if that hadn't happened, we probably would be, we probably
00:17:05 would be, we probably would have started a video game journalism outlet on the internet
00:17:10 and, uh, you know, or whatever.
00:17:14 We probably would have, you know, really hit that algorithm and like, you know, just gotten
00:17:18 to the front page of Reddit every, every, every day.
00:17:22 I don't know.
00:17:23 I've been saying, I've been saying this for years.
00:17:24 I've been saying this for years.
00:17:25 Uh, PCPs got to go back to their alt-right roots, you know.
00:17:31 How many years have you been saying it for?
00:17:33 It's been too long.
00:17:34 I've been saying it for years.
00:17:35 Like, yeah, like it was much better when, um, Ben saying didn't like people who are a
00:17:40 darker skin.
00:17:41 It was a way funnier era.
00:17:43 The jokes are funnier.
00:17:45 Um, spiral has continued his, uh, his quest to document every usage of the N word in,
00:17:54 uh, in the PCPs history.
00:17:57 Uh, he says he will eventually make a spreadsheet.
00:18:01 Who said it the most about it?
00:18:04 Um, who said it the most?
00:18:06 Um, I mean, like, is that what he's trying to figure out that like he's going to have
00:18:09 a spreadsheet?
00:18:10 Well, among, among, among other things, among other things, hold on.
00:18:15 Um, um, hold on.
00:18:18 He's posted some of his incomplete data.
00:18:22 Uh, I will summarize.
00:18:26 Was in the lead.
00:18:27 Tell me.
00:18:28 Okay.
00:18:29 Yes.
00:18:30 So it was before, okay.
00:18:36 Apparently there is a, there is a big moment.
00:18:38 There's a big point in which, uh, it gets said a lot, uh, and it was the empathy episode.
00:18:46 And I think that it was like, Trixie says it a lot.
00:18:51 I think a bunch of people had said it before.
00:18:54 Trixie says it a lot in the empathy episode, but I want to see the before empathy and after
00:19:00 empathy numbers.
00:19:02 Oh, wait.
00:19:03 Yeah.
00:19:04 I remember that episode.
00:19:05 She famously said, I have no empathy for the N words.
00:19:07 I remember that classic line.
00:19:10 Is that what she said?
00:19:11 No, that's not what she said.
00:19:13 No, what the fuck?
00:19:14 That's terrible.
00:19:15 No empathy for the N words.
00:19:17 I'd say she has too many, she has too much empathy for N words.
00:19:21 That's why like bird is like transracial or something, right?
00:19:26 No, Riley is transracial.
00:19:28 Oh my gosh.
00:19:29 Or something.
00:19:30 Yeah.
00:19:31 One of them is transracial.
00:19:32 I remember Trixie tweeting one time like, I'm a fusion of like Huey and the other little
00:19:39 girl from BoomDocs.
00:19:42 I forgot, but she's the one who's like mixed.
00:19:44 She has like a black, a black dad is like a lawyer and a white mom.
00:19:48 You know what I'm talking about?
00:19:50 Wait, who are you talking about?
00:19:52 The one little girl character from the BoomDocs.
00:19:56 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:19:59 Oh God, I don't remember her name.
00:20:01 But I know what you're talking about with the big, the big buns.
00:20:04 Yeah, exactly.
00:20:05 Hair buns.
00:20:06 Yeah.
00:20:07 I remember Trixie saying that she was like a fusion of her and Huey.
00:20:11 Wow, that's stupid.
00:20:13 What a stupid thing to say.
00:20:15 I don't know.
00:20:16 You should tweet out your fusion of Applejack and Twilight Sparkle or something.
00:20:22 Okay, so before the empathy episode, which is episode 30, the N word count for soft A
00:20:30 was Trixie 11.
00:20:32 Everyone else, nothing.
00:20:34 Damn.
00:20:35 The hard R count before episode 30.
00:20:39 I think this is right was, no, or is this just the episode, or is this just in the hard,
00:20:49 in the episode?
00:20:50 I don't know.
00:20:52 I think this is in, I'm a little confused looking at the data, but whatever.
00:20:57 The point is after it, after episode 30, episode totals were soft A, Trixie, 15, Nate, 14,
00:21:05 9-0, 4, but gets a pass.
00:21:08 Obviously, DeVoo, 2, Ben, 1.
00:21:11 I think I said it with the A one time during the empathy episode.
00:21:15 I think it was my first one.
00:21:17 Looks like Ben wins again.
00:21:19 Ben's the real winner here.
00:21:21 Well, no, because a bunch of names aren't on here.
00:21:23 That is true.
00:21:24 I'm surprised.
00:21:25 Hard R, hard R, Jesse, 8, Nate, 6, Trixie, 6, Monkey, 6.
00:21:33 Oh, I just wanted to say I'm surprised Monkey's not on the list, but never mind.
00:21:37 Well, he only used the hard R.
00:21:41 Oh, epic.
00:21:43 That's very in line.
00:21:45 Very epic.
00:21:47 It's crazy because now he's on a podcast.
00:21:49 Actually, so did Jesse.
00:21:51 Jesse only ever said it with the hard R and never with the A.
00:21:56 I am not surprised.
00:21:58 It's crazy because Monkey's now on a podcast with Reactor and Rusty Cage.
00:22:04 I don't think he says the N word at all on that podcast.
00:22:06 He saved them all for the PCP.
00:22:08 Reactor fucking sucks.
00:22:10 Reactor's a piece of shit.
00:22:11 I'm not a fan of Reactor.
00:22:12 Rusty Cage, I don't know.
00:22:14 He seems all right.
00:22:15 I thought he was, I don't know.
00:22:17 I have this inclination towards people who just make comics.
00:22:21 It might be a bias.
00:22:22 I kind of just respect people who make comics more than normies, you know?
00:22:26 Absolutely.
00:22:27 Right, exactly.
00:22:28 Absolutely.
00:22:29 If you don't make comics, you're not even human to me at TPH.
00:22:32 As Monchi once said, it's the most heroic art form.
00:22:36 The most heroic art form.
00:22:37 Rest in peace, Monchi.
00:22:39 We miss you, bud.
00:22:40 Rest in peace, Monchi.
00:22:41 Yeah, but that being said, I don't know.
00:22:44 I think what really kind of bothered me was that he was getting a lot of advice from Doug
00:22:49 to Naples.
00:22:50 Doug to Naples probably gave him a good ass comic advice.
00:22:55 That being said, I don't like Doug to Naples.
00:23:00 Yeah.
00:23:01 Well, I think from what I know about him, he's just another, he's a real Scott Cawthon.
00:23:07 Yeah.
00:23:08 He's a real, who's that other one?
00:23:11 He's Two-Faced.
00:23:12 Orson Scott Card.
00:23:13 Oh, it was a guy who makes a Dilbert.
00:23:15 Who's the one that?
00:23:16 Dilbert.
00:23:17 Oh, that guy's his own can of words.
00:23:20 I was going to say he's like another, who's the Timmy Turner, fairly odd parents guy?
00:23:25 Butch Hartman.
00:23:26 Butch Hartman.
00:23:27 He's just one of these fucking like Christian children's entertainment douchebags.
00:23:32 It's funny.
00:23:33 He's like a huge like, transfer, but I remember in, I think in One Stream, I was watching that,
00:23:37 he was on the Drunken Head.
00:23:38 Who, Doug, Doug Tennipal is?
00:23:39 Yeah, yeah.
00:23:40 He's like this huge ass transfer.
00:23:41 Yeah.
00:23:42 On One Stream.
00:23:43 Yeah.
00:23:44 On One Stream, he was talking about how he thinks, he says that Rebecca Sugar is like a genius.
00:23:48 And I mean, I think Rebecca goes by day, I think.
00:23:52 They, um, they were like, yeah, I'm not, I can't remember.
00:23:56 I mean, I could always look it up.
00:23:58 I'll look it up in a second.
00:23:59 But, um, they, um, they consider Rebecca Sugar a genius and Rebecca Sugar is like a former
00:24:04 student of Doug Tennipal.
00:24:06 Cause he, I don't know if he still does like classes on animation, right?
00:24:11 So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting.
00:24:14 I don't know.
00:24:16 Some people are like, I mean, I think Scott Coffin is probably the example of like, oh,
00:24:20 I really love the LGBT community.
00:24:22 You know, the big part of the fandom, but you know, like, like, you know, we shouldn't
00:24:26 like, uh, we shouldn't, uh, you know, we shouldn't encourage it.
00:24:30 We shouldn't alienate people who are Republican and want to wipe out LGBT people.
00:24:34 Have you read his, uh, have you read his apology?
00:24:37 Compromise?
00:24:38 Doug's apology?
00:24:39 Uh, no, um, Scott's apology.
00:24:42 Scott, Scott Coffin's apology.
00:24:44 No.
00:24:45 Yeah, yeah.
00:24:46 I didn't, I didn't actually read it.
00:24:47 I saw it and I was like, I get it.
00:24:49 I saw like, uh, the couple of, like I, I retweet it.
00:24:53 Guys, here's a fucking surprise.
00:24:55 Probably no surprise.
00:24:56 I don't really read the majority of the shit I retweet.
00:24:59 Um, if you follow me on Twitter, it's all kind of blends together after a while.
00:25:04 Yeah.
00:25:05 My, my, my stream, my Twitter is a stream of consciousness.
00:25:07 I'm just fucking retweeting shit.
00:25:09 I do not care.
00:25:10 Like, like the only reason that I see any art on Twitter is because you retweet it.
00:25:16 Um, based.
00:25:17 Um, based.
00:25:18 Pretty based.
00:25:19 That is pretty based.
00:25:20 Pretty based.
00:25:21 Yeah.
00:25:22 That is pretty fucking based.
00:25:23 Um, speaking of art.
00:25:25 So this, by the time this podcast comes out, um,
00:25:28 Speaking of comics, I think.
00:25:29 Speaking of comics.
00:25:30 Yeah.
00:25:31 So I think you're talking about how heroic they are.
00:25:32 Yeah, exactly how you're probably, you're just probably a better person.
00:25:34 You're probably handsome.
00:25:35 You probably got like a big dick too.
00:25:36 Like TBH.
00:25:37 Most likely.
00:25:38 Right.
00:25:39 Most likely.
00:25:40 You ever, um, oh, now that you're, now that you are a Daniel Klaus fan, uh, Ben, have
00:25:45 you ever read that?
00:25:46 True.
00:25:47 You ever read his, is he made like a little comic called Ink Studs?
00:25:51 You ever heard of it?
00:25:53 I think I've heard of it.
00:25:55 I haven't read it.
00:25:56 It's, it's like, what was the one that you, what was the one that you gave me to read
00:25:59 and remind me what the title was again?
00:26:01 Daniel, Daniel boring.
00:26:04 No, it's not.
00:26:05 I mean, David boring, my bad.
00:26:08 David, yeah.
00:26:09 David boring.
00:26:10 Yeah.
00:26:11 Okay.
00:26:12 I knew it.
00:26:13 Okay.
00:26:14 Right.
00:26:15 David boring.
00:26:16 I liked it a lot.
00:26:17 Uh, I'm glad.
00:26:18 I'm glad.
00:26:19 You should read the rest.
00:26:20 But anyway, he made this one comic called Ink Studs.
00:26:21 This is all it is.
00:26:22 It's just one page.
00:26:23 And it's basically just like, hey ladies, ditch these loser musicians guitar, uh, like,
00:26:27 uh, betas and get with the real chats, which are the comic artists.
00:26:30 Oh, wait.
00:26:31 I've, I've seen this.
00:26:32 I've seen, you might have shown this to me actually.
00:26:35 Oh, it's great.
00:26:36 Uh, 10 out of 10.
00:26:37 Also it's true.
00:26:38 And it's not ironic.
00:26:39 Come to think of it.
00:26:40 I'll take an ink stud.
00:26:42 I get it.
00:26:44 Come to think of it.
00:26:46 Hmm.
00:26:47 Per.
00:26:48 Now that I, now that I've run the calculations again.
00:26:50 Uh, yeah.
00:26:51 Gotcha.
00:26:52 Oh God.
00:26:53 But yeah.
00:26:54 What was saying?
00:26:55 Yeah.
00:26:56 Okay.
00:26:57 So also on Monday, I think I'm going to have, I'm going to, no, I'm not, I don't think I'm
00:27:01 going to have pre-orders for the next physical copies of villain verse, but I'm going to
00:27:06 also villain verse.
00:27:08 Yep.
00:27:09 Eleazar.
00:27:10 Hey post, post the cover, post the title or not the, yeah, post the cover for the next
00:27:15 issue that you are, that you are releasing, I guess, publishing, opening up pre-orders
00:27:21 for.
00:27:22 Hold up.
00:27:23 But show it on screen.
00:27:25 Eleazar.
00:27:26 It'll be on the screen right now.
00:27:27 I'm going to post it in a second.
00:27:29 Anyway.
00:27:30 Um, yeah, I'm going to rework it because if you, uh, Ben, you bought like previous copies
00:27:37 of villain verse.
00:27:38 I think I bought, uh, I have two, I have two, uh, comics.
00:27:43 Do I have all of them?
00:27:45 I think you just might have all of them.
00:27:48 Yeah.
00:27:49 Yeah.
00:27:50 Hell yeah.
00:27:51 Yeah.
00:27:52 I think this would be, this would be the, the cover.
00:27:54 All right.
00:27:55 This is the cover for the.
00:27:56 There.
00:27:57 Yes.
00:27:58 Oh dude.
00:27:59 Is that a, is that a champion reference?
00:28:02 Cause he's got tusks.
00:28:04 Oh yeah.
00:28:05 Ben saying inventor of tusks.
00:28:07 I forgot.
00:28:08 I invented tusks.
00:28:09 Yeah.
00:28:10 Hell yeah.
00:28:11 Ben say directed the movie tusks.
00:28:12 It's pretty good.
00:28:13 Check it out.
00:28:14 Is that a Brunswick reference?
00:28:15 Dude.
00:28:16 Epic.
00:28:17 Bro, is that, oh my God.
00:28:18 A reflection.
00:28:19 Is that, is that a vapor's reference?
00:28:21 Oh my God.
00:28:22 Is that a glass, is that a glass reflections my favorite anime YouTuber reference?
00:28:27 It's a vapor's reference because none of the characters in vapors reflect on themselves.
00:28:32 I just spoiled the ending of the vapors.
00:28:37 What was it going to say?
00:28:40 Yeah.
00:28:41 So if, if you, if you, if Ben, if you were to grab your physical copy of villain bridge,
00:28:44 you would notice that it, each physical copy includes like two chapters in them.
00:28:49 Right.
00:28:50 I, I'm aware.
00:28:51 Right.
00:28:52 I've read them.
00:28:53 This was a dumb mistake.
00:28:54 I'm going to fix this.
00:28:57 I see.
00:28:58 Because I only did that because I wanted people to read the prologue and jump right into chapter
00:29:03 one.
00:29:04 Like I didn't want anyone to like take a break or anything or like have to wait for chapter
00:29:08 one.
00:29:09 So that's why like I have the prologue and chapter one in the same book.
00:29:11 And then the next one I put two and three together.
00:29:13 But then I realized like, wait a second, why am I doing these for the next books?
00:29:16 Like the other ones could be just self-contained.
00:29:18 So I, I, what I'm going to do is just make after chapter one, each chapter is just going
00:29:24 to be a single issue and it's not going to like be a combo book anymore because it's
00:29:30 like,
00:29:31 Are they going to be longer chapters or are you just going to chop them up?
00:29:34 No, but chapter five, which is,
00:29:36 I mean, honestly, honestly, the second book is pretty thick.
00:29:39 Like for a, for a, what do you, for like a trade paper, it's, it's quite thick for a
00:29:44 trade paperback comic book.
00:29:46 So like may make sense.
00:29:48 Yeah.
00:29:49 The, the first book was like the prologue is like 20 pages and chapter one is like 25.
00:29:56 And then the second book is chapter two and chapter three and both of them are around
00:30:00 like 26 pages.
00:30:01 Right.
00:30:02 So that's why it's like thicker.
00:30:03 Yeah.
00:30:04 Also, I started adding like, I started adding like bill and verse fun fact sheets at the
00:30:08 end, you know,
00:30:09 Which is good.
00:30:10 That's what, that's what I like.
00:30:12 That's what I like in a trade paperback is.
00:30:14 Extra.
00:30:15 Fun facts.
00:30:16 Fun facts.
00:30:17 Yeah.
00:30:18 If, if I, if I could, maybe I'll start doing this, but I'm a big fan of like the little
00:30:23 like, you know, in the chapters of one piece of what the beginning of each chapter has
00:30:27 like a single image that would be like its own like story that takes place outside of
00:30:31 the one piece story.
00:30:33 Oh, I don't remember what those are called, but I know what you mean.
00:30:36 Yeah.
00:30:37 Yeah.
00:30:38 And then later on in the story, like those would connect back, you know, I kind of want
00:30:44 to fucking, God, I would, I'm tempted to kind of do something like that.
00:30:48 Um, because there's just constantly things happening outside of the main bill and verse
00:30:52 story, you know,
00:30:53 Expand the universe, but naturally.
00:30:56 Right.
00:30:57 Exactly.
00:30:58 But I don't know.
00:30:59 I'm still thinking about it.
00:31:00 I kind of liked the fun fact stuff because it's kind of like, I guess easier to dump.
00:31:05 Like, oh, um, this thing they use, it has a name or some, some random bullshit.
00:31:12 I think I'm going to like highlight like lesser villains and, um, and these next fun fact sheets
00:31:19 like, um, like you see a lot of like villains in the background who don't get names and
00:31:24 I think I'm going to like start naming them.
00:31:26 There's some, wait a second.
00:31:28 I want to highlight.
00:31:29 I want to ask you what one's name is cheesy and entertain them for a moment.
00:31:34 Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, so how about them?
00:31:38 How about them?
00:31:39 Mets.
00:31:40 Am I right?
00:31:41 Gamers?
00:31:42 Oh my God.
00:31:43 If you haven't read Villainverse, uh, go read it.
00:31:45 That shit's free.
00:31:46 It's all going to be free when it's over.
00:31:49 Uh, chapter five should be out by now.
00:31:53 That should took too long.
00:31:54 That should took like five months to make chapter.
00:31:57 Okay.
00:31:58 I'm back.
00:31:59 All right.
00:32:00 I'm back.
00:32:01 All right.
00:32:02 So let me, let me, let me get, uh, let me find the one who I remember.
00:32:06 I was taking a shit as I often do when I picked up my copy of Villainverse chapter three.
00:32:11 Ben ran out of, uh, paper, uh, toilet paper and he thought like, oh, well this Villainverse
00:32:16 chapter might do.
00:32:18 Exactly.
00:32:19 Uh, it's, it's when they're all getting eaten by the bugs, um, spoilers.
00:32:25 Uh, uh, no, it's, it's further ahead than that.
00:32:32 Uh, yes.
00:32:34 Yes.
00:32:35 Shit.
00:32:36 The pages aren't numbered.
00:32:37 Yeah.
00:32:38 No.
00:32:39 Describe the panel.
00:32:40 Describe the panel.
00:32:41 I know all of them by memory.
00:32:42 Okay.
00:32:43 Well it's the page where all the bugs are like coming out of the ground in a big like tornado
00:32:48 and like they're all like coming at the, the camera and they're just crunch, crunch, crunch,
00:32:53 buzz, buzz, buzz.
00:32:54 Right.
00:32:55 And there's the guy in the door face is like running away and he looks scared and underneath
00:33:01 the villain says, yes, yes, eat them up my children, fill your bellies with their flesh.
00:33:05 Right.
00:33:06 While one is one, like he's like black, like he's being bitten and he's being stretched.
00:33:11 He looks like, he looks like a cartoon.
00:33:13 He looks like a, like a squash and stretch cartoon.
00:33:17 Oh, and then on the previous page, on the previous page, there's a bug guy who's shooting bullets
00:33:22 at him.
00:33:23 Oh no.
00:33:24 Or like two pages before there's an action scene and a guy with a, like a praying mantis
00:33:27 head is shooting bullets and this same like squash and stretchy, stretchy black man is
00:33:32 like out of one side.
00:33:34 He's got like drool coming out of his mouth.
00:33:36 Yes.
00:33:37 Oh wait.
00:33:38 Oh wait.
00:33:39 I know what you're talking about.
00:33:40 No, no, no.
00:33:41 Before.
00:33:42 Yeah.
00:33:43 Yeah.
00:33:44 It's like two pages before the eat them up my children.
00:33:45 Yeah.
00:33:46 It's someone, it's like the kind of small, it's kind of like the big, it's like the panel
00:33:51 at the bottom.
00:33:52 I know you're talking about.
00:33:53 Yeah.
00:33:54 Oh, okay.
00:33:55 That's the one.
00:33:57 That guy's name is inky toad.
00:33:59 And he's like inky toad.
00:34:01 Yeah, that's his name.
00:34:02 He was actually like, so what's cool about villain verse is that like it's a good excuse to just
00:34:07 use a bunch of character designs I created when I was younger.
00:34:11 Right.
00:34:12 Yeah.
00:34:13 Cause I drew that guy, I think in like high school, maybe.
00:34:17 And then I like found the drawing of the guy and then I like read.
00:34:21 I'm like, oh, this guy could be like a villain.
00:34:23 Right.
00:34:24 He's like a little guy.
00:34:25 Yeah.
00:34:26 I think, um, I think the bug guy is called like, I think he's just called the roach maybe.
00:34:34 I don't care.
00:34:35 I don't care about that guy.
00:34:36 Yeah.
00:34:37 I'm a big ink.
00:34:38 I'm a big inky toad Stan.
00:34:39 Oh yeah.
00:34:40 Yeah.
00:34:41 There'll be, um, there'll be more inky toad.
00:34:42 Um, like, I guess I think I said this before, but the ending is going to be very Avengers
00:34:47 end game where like everyone comes back and there's like a giant.
00:34:52 It's like a giant fight, but that's, that's the most I'll say.
00:34:57 Cool.
00:34:58 Oh yeah.
00:34:59 There he is.
00:35:00 Mary is prototype.
00:35:01 Yeah.
00:35:02 I, I, I noticed this guy in a couple of shots and I was like, this guy doesn't have a name,
00:35:07 but I'm, I'm kind of interested.
00:35:08 He actually does get it.
00:35:09 I'm sure there's more to him because.
00:35:11 Yeah.
00:35:12 Does he?
00:35:13 Wait, he, um, hold up.
00:35:14 Does, does he get in?
00:35:15 Does he get introduced and I missed it?
00:35:16 Yeah.
00:35:17 Let me just, I'm looking for.
00:35:19 Damn.
00:35:20 Okay.
00:35:21 Wait, this is filed too big.
00:35:23 Ah, I'm going to pull it out in a second, but just say what you're going to say.
00:35:29 I was going to, I mean, there's like, there's like hundreds of these guys that all have
00:35:33 names and numbers.
00:35:34 So I wouldn't be surprised if I missed one.
00:35:37 Oh, there he is.
00:35:38 Inky toad.
00:35:39 VSR.
00:35:40 What is it?
00:35:41 Eight, 20, eight, eight, 89.
00:35:45 That's, that's pretty good.
00:35:48 That's not too bad.
00:35:49 That's not too bad.
00:35:50 Yeah.
00:35:51 I think.
00:35:52 Yeah.
00:35:53 All of these guys are just like little OCs or characters that I created when I was like
00:35:58 younger and I'm just repurposing them.
00:36:00 You know, it's pretty fucking.
00:36:02 Makes sense.
00:36:03 Yeah, it's pretty fucking base.
00:36:04 But, um, also some of them I've been like, I think I'm going to might reuse a couple
00:36:09 other designs that exist out.
00:36:11 Like, like, let's say the inky toad character pops up in a non-villain verse related word.
00:36:16 You know, cause like, why not?
00:36:19 You know, why?
00:36:20 Yeah.
00:36:21 Why not?
00:36:22 Yeah.
00:36:23 Why the heck not?
00:36:24 Yeah.
00:36:25 Yeah.
00:36:26 I guess.
00:36:27 Yeah.
00:36:28 Cause, um, I think later on it's going to be implied.
00:36:29 There's like multiverses.
00:36:30 Right.
00:36:31 Sure.
00:36:32 Yeah.
00:36:33 Sure.
00:36:34 That's that's some of it.
00:36:35 When is the is the is the villain verse going to merge with our reality and the dimensional
00:36:38 merge?
00:36:39 Oh, did you not?
00:36:40 Oh, wait, hold up.
00:36:41 You gotta read the fun facts page, Ben, because I remember one said that one fun facts page
00:36:47 said that humans are extinct and a villain verse.
00:36:50 I remember that.
00:36:51 I remember that.
00:36:52 Um, so, but if our dimensions merged, well, no, it must, it must be a different, it must
00:36:57 be a different universe than C one nine seven because there are definitely humans in C one
00:37:03 nine seven.
00:37:04 God, I wish, I wish, uh, I wish they wouldn't merge.
00:37:06 Um, I wish Chris, uh, Sina would read villain verse.
00:37:10 Please.
00:37:11 That's the, that's the, you just call it Christina.
00:37:13 Uh, is that, oh, it's Christine, right?
00:37:15 Christine.
00:37:16 Yeah.
00:37:17 Yeah.
00:37:18 Yeah.
00:37:19 Um, uh, that's, that's the strat.
00:37:20 Right.
00:37:21 That's the marketing strat.
00:37:22 Yeah.
00:37:23 Christine.
00:37:24 That's how you do it.
00:37:25 No, no, that's how you become, that's how you become famous, wildly successful and famous
00:37:28 is you get that person to acknowledge you and then everyone respects you for your work.
00:37:34 Yes.
00:37:35 Yes.
00:37:36 If you, if you get her to obsess over your, um, like franchise or your, or your IP, your
00:37:42 instant, instant cash starts flowing now.
00:37:45 Are you on board for the hashtag save MLP movement is I, I think I retweeted it.
00:37:53 I think I retweeted your quality, but what is it?
00:37:55 Uh, can you go in specific?
00:37:56 What is it?
00:37:57 I, I, at first I thought that it was just like an account that she made.
00:38:02 Now I'm, I'm not sure.
00:38:03 I think it might just be some other weirdo, but the point is it's a Twitter account dedicated
00:38:07 and, and a petition dedicated to get Hasbro to know, do not make, uh, uh, MLP gen five,
00:38:18 go back to gen four, we, we have to go back, um, we, we, we, we none of these new ponies
00:38:25 keep us with the old ponies, please.
00:38:28 And I guess they want to retcon.
00:38:30 They wanted to like, they want has, they like, literally they want Hasbro to be like, actually
00:38:35 that last episode didn't happen.
00:38:38 That flash forward to like princess twilight didn't happen.
00:38:41 That was all fake, uh, never mind.
00:38:44 We were joking.
00:38:45 It was a dream or something.
00:38:47 You know, this is like, this is not the first time you hear about like people trying to
00:38:51 petition like, Oh, fine episode is not canon anymore.
00:38:55 Like, has that actually fucking worked?
00:38:56 Like, is that like what the fuck, what's the point?
00:39:00 Uh, I wonder, I feel like, well, I mean.
00:39:06 They did, uh, Mass Effect, right?
00:39:09 Everyone complained about the Mass Effect ending.
00:39:12 Did they retcon the ending?
00:39:13 And they didn't like, I think they didn't like change it, but I think they did maybe
00:39:20 retcon some bits of it.
00:39:22 Like in DLC.
00:39:23 Oh yeah.
00:39:24 I remember that.
00:39:25 Actually, there was like a DLC that what I'll go fix it.
00:39:28 I, something like, I remember Mr. B tongue was not particularly impressed with the retconning
00:39:35 job that they did, um, the, um, bass, I guess, uh, so I mean, I guess sometimes it kind of
00:39:44 works a little, it's, I don't know what's like, um, it's so, I don't know.
00:39:50 I wouldn't, isn't that, isn't like, I think like the current, um, the last one is a gen
00:39:56 four.
00:39:57 Is that, is that the one?
00:39:58 Uh-huh.
00:39:59 Yeah.
00:40:00 So gen four is the one with Twilight Sparkle, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, etc.
00:40:03 I think what's kind of really cool here is that they could kind of do like a magical girl
00:40:08 power ranger kind of thing where like each gen, they have like a certain number of like,
00:40:15 um, main six they have to like create, right, but they're like different every gen and then
00:40:20 they just have crossovers with previous gens, you know, like I, I anticipate, I mean, since
00:40:27 gen four was such a hit, I feel like it's a virtual certainty that we'll have references
00:40:33 to it in gen five and, uh, maybe, maybe even some, maybe even some character, I don't fucking
00:40:40 know, it could happen.
00:40:41 I mean, like power rangers do that all the time where they like, um, cross, they always
00:40:46 have an episode where they cross over with the previous, uh, team, right?
00:40:50 Yeah.
00:40:51 Yeah.
00:40:52 And you know, so based, so based, so based, you know, I, uh, that one episode, that one
00:40:57 episode with like the eight, 18 different red rangers from like all the previous incarnations.
00:41:02 And I mean, I've, I've seen the Linkara, I've seen the Linkara retrospective.
00:41:06 Yeah.
00:41:07 Oh, big Linkara.
00:41:08 Pretty much.
00:41:09 Big Linkara head shout outs to tectonic improv to tectonic improv, although that's not technically
00:41:16 about that lecture.
00:41:17 That's about, um, the Toboli flee, which the lecture does not, I guess no, the lecture,
00:41:23 I guess the, I guess the power rangers, he is in character as Linkara.
00:41:28 So I guess it is.
00:41:29 Is he, he doesn't do any like skits on the history of power.
00:41:33 He doesn't, he doesn't do any skits.
00:41:35 No, he doesn't, he doesn't do any skits, but I, I think he's still, I think he's always
00:41:39 like in character as, I mean, because like his, his reviewer persona is Linkara.
00:41:45 So as far as I'm concerned, if he's reviewing something, he's Linkara, whether he's doing
00:41:51 a bit or not.
00:41:52 Where does the, where does, uh, Lewis begin and Linkara and, you know, it's Lewis.
00:41:59 Lewis love hog.
00:42:00 I forgot.
00:42:01 Um, but that's pretty, that's a pretty cool name.
00:42:04 It's, it's all right.
00:42:06 It's all right.
00:42:08 It'll do.
00:42:09 I was thinking about Linkara.
00:42:10 Oh, so, um, yeah, shout out to tectonic.
00:42:13 Um, next time I come back, I always try to come back every two months, like motherfucking
00:42:19 Jeepers, we can't, we can't get rid of you.
00:42:21 Right.
00:42:22 Exactly.
00:42:22 You can't, um, you know, we need a little mosquito buzzing in our ears.
00:42:26 There's too many, there's too many voicemail that, that say we need more POCs on, um,
00:42:31 the PCP dog.
00:42:34 You heard, did you, did you hear the last episode?
00:42:37 Um, I listened to half of it, but, uh, okay.
00:42:40 Well, if you only listened to half, then maybe you don't know about the voice.
00:42:44 I'm dreading the voicemails this episode.
00:42:47 I think they're going to be real bad.
00:42:48 Okay.
00:42:49 Let's just drag this.
00:42:50 I think there's good can and say, Oh, we ran out of time guys.
00:42:52 I'm with the LA's are I can edit the rest though.
00:42:54 No voice fails this week.
00:42:56 We have, first of all, we have a lot of them, which to me seems like a lot of people like
00:43:02 heard the last one and maybe responded to it.
00:43:05 And I'm, I'm, I'm a bit concerned that like the gates have been thrown open and
00:43:09 people suddenly realized, I think the, I'm, I'm, I'm worried that the, the, the
00:43:13 interrupting pig or whatever has like, let people know, yes, you totally can fuck
00:43:19 with a system that, you know, overtly has no oversight or moderation.
00:43:24 And people go, Oh my God, me too.
00:43:26 Oh, I'm going to fuck.
00:43:27 I'm going to make bad voicemails on purpose too.
00:43:28 Ha, it'll be so funny.
00:43:31 It's going to be so cool.
00:43:32 I think it's time to hire a person to look over like all the voicemails.
00:43:38 Right.
00:43:39 This is, this is an app like this is a, this is an application wanted a DM
00:43:43 Ben, if you want to be the, the voice, no, leave, leave me a voicemail.
00:43:48 Leave me a voicemail telling me your qualifications.
00:43:51 Submit your resume, uh, if you want, if you think you have what the gumption,
00:43:55 what it takes prove to Ben, you have good taste.
00:43:58 All right.
00:43:59 Like leave a voicemail and say the most good.
00:44:01 Okay.
00:44:02 Here's, here's the thing.
00:44:03 Here's the standards.
00:44:04 Leave a voicemail and say the one line that proves you have good taste and that
00:44:09 like is evidence that you'd be a perfect moderator for the voicemails.
00:44:13 Right.
00:44:14 It's not, it's not actually true.
00:44:15 I think, I think if it ever hits the point where we have, where I have to
00:44:19 start like reading or like pre-screening the voicemails, I think that's the
00:44:24 point where I just say no more voicemails.
00:44:26 They're over.
00:44:27 Why don't you, um, why don't you just like listen through them while you're like,
00:44:30 I don't know, drawing or something.
00:44:32 Cause that sounds terrible.
00:44:33 Cause that sucks.
00:44:35 What, what, what more do I need to say?
00:44:37 That sounds miserable.
00:44:38 I don't, cause I don't, cause I don't want to.
00:44:40 I guess you're getting paid.
00:44:42 How's that for an answer?
00:44:42 Cause I don't want to get paid enough to do that.
00:44:47 I, the point, the point.
00:44:50 The whole, listen, this, this is the Ben St.
00:44:52 show now.
00:44:52 This is my solo show.
00:44:54 What would be the point if I listened to them before the show and then listen to
00:44:59 them again on, on recording?
00:45:03 Oh my God.
00:45:04 The point is to react to them.
00:45:05 The point is to be surprised.
00:45:07 No.
00:45:07 If, if I have to pre-screen the voicemails, voicemails are over.
00:45:11 All right.
00:45:11 So yeah, if you, if you want, if you, so listen, if, if what you want is further
00:45:16 never to be another voicemail again, then yeah, I guess do flood
00:45:19 the voicemail submission box with deliberately bad voicemails.
00:45:23 I have an excellent idea.
00:45:24 How about you just like, you just accept like the first, I don't know, 10 voicemails
00:45:31 and the rest are instantly thrown in the trash.
00:45:33 So people have like a, like kind of like an, a window, you know, it's like a
00:45:37 death battle style, like voicemail.
00:45:40 I, I guess, yeah.
00:45:41 I mean, I guess that would be one way to do it.
00:45:44 I guess that would be one way to do it.
00:45:46 Right.
00:45:46 So people can't just, you know, I mean, there could be like one guy,
00:45:49 like, well, well, well, that's what I would do if there were just simply too
00:45:53 many good voicemails rather than like being flooded with bad ones.
00:46:00 You know what I mean?
00:46:01 Yeah, it's different.
00:46:02 It's different, uh, uh, just like with Digimon, you know, like different,
00:46:06 different conditions, right?
00:46:08 Like different, like win loss ratios will let your Digimon evolve into a
00:46:11 different champion and ultimate form in the same way.
00:46:15 Like, you know, different qualities of voicemails will cause that segment of
00:46:19 the show to evolve into a different final evolution.
00:46:22 Right.
00:46:22 Exactly.
00:46:24 It's like, it's like raising your chow.
00:46:26 It's like raising your chow.
00:46:27 It's like, are they darker or are they lighter?
00:46:29 You know, are they hero?
00:46:30 I don't want them darker.
00:46:31 I don't want them darker.
00:46:32 I don't know.
00:46:33 Are they a P are they a POC or not?
00:46:35 Yeah.
00:46:37 How neuro divergent are they?
00:46:40 I was fucking playing Sonic Adventure, um, last night actually on my game cube.
00:46:46 No shit.
00:46:47 Yep.
00:46:47 And we went to the chow guarded and the chow guarded in the first, um,
00:46:51 adventure game is kind of, it's kind of boring.
00:46:53 There isn't that much you could do.
00:46:55 Right.
00:46:56 Yeah.
00:46:56 I think in two is where they have all the fucking little funny little fucking
00:47:01 mini animals pieces.
00:47:03 And I mean, I've never played any of them.
00:47:05 So I don't know.
00:47:05 Oh, it's probably for the good.
00:47:07 I mean, like, look, like I love shitting on Aaron Hansen, but he was kind of
00:47:12 right about those adventure games.
00:47:14 Like not going to lie.
00:47:16 Yeah.
00:47:17 What?
00:47:17 And that's just that they're not as good as everyone remembers them.
00:47:19 Yeah.
00:47:19 They're not as good as I'm sorry.
00:47:22 Well, I mean, I mean, I've, I feel like fans recognize that like in, in cyber
00:47:28 shell, not cyber shells in, in, in running Shine's review of it, he's
00:47:31 just like, here's my guide to whether you'll like Sonic Adventure.
00:47:35 If you liked it as a kid, you'll probably like it.
00:47:38 If you didn't, you probably won't.
00:47:40 I, I, yeah, I liked it as a kid.
00:47:42 Like I beat the whole game.
00:47:44 I did, I did every campaign.
00:47:46 Um, and, and just to let you know how much like as a little kid, I liked it.
00:47:49 I didn't realize like I beat like bigs, like level is like campaign, but I didn't
00:47:55 realize that everyone on the internet actually hated that campaign.
00:47:58 I kind of just thought like, oh, yeah, what's so bad about that?
00:48:02 Right.
00:48:03 Yeah.
00:48:03 Sure.
00:48:04 Yeah.
00:48:04 I mean, as a kid, you don't fucking think about those things.
00:48:07 Um, no.
00:48:09 Right.
00:48:09 Right.
00:48:09 Exactly.

00:49:06 You are right.
00:49:07 That's right.
00:49:07 That's right.
00:49:08 I mean, I mean, I mean, I, it's complicated.
00:49:12 Okay.
00:49:13 I think I was going to say that, like, uh, yeah.

00:49:16 Uh, next time I come back, I want to take tonic back.
00:49:19 Love that guy.

00:49:26 It's pretty good podcast.
00:49:29 Oh no, I did a, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, baby.
00:49:31 But, um, what else are you going to say?
00:49:34 Yeah.
00:49:34 Uh, read villain verse, uh, pre-orders will be on Monday.
00:49:38 Um, fuck the Cato anthology.
00:49:39 Just buy villain verse.
00:49:41 I'm sorry.
00:49:42 I'm sorry.
00:49:43 You're like, I would have done the Cato anthology, but like I have my own.
00:49:46 Well, now if you, if listeners, if you hate cheesy and you hate villain verse,
00:49:51 then you should buy the Cato anthology out of spite, cause that would make him
00:49:55 really mad.
00:49:56 Those are the two teams it's.
00:49:58 And same, and same for if you really hate the Cato guys, you should buy villain
00:50:02 verse out of spite.
00:50:03 Cause I, I, they told me this was in DMs.
00:50:06 I won't show screenshots.
00:50:07 They told me that they would be so mad if people bought villain verse.
00:50:11 Yeah.
00:50:11 I'm ironic ruin their day, like behind, like, um, I was, I was supposed to be on
00:50:16 the Cato Cato anthology episode, but then Ben told me, like, yeah, um, they,
00:50:20 they don't fuck with you.
00:50:21 So you can't, they hate you.
00:50:23 They told me, they told me like that guy's toxic.
00:50:27 He, he, he saw what I post on Twitter.
00:50:30 They say I'm too political.
00:50:31 And in my opinion, they were absolutely right.
00:50:34 I wish I had the courage.
00:50:35 Right.
00:50:35 So I wish I had their courage.
00:50:38 I wish I could tell cheesy to a stupid fucking face.
00:50:40 You shut the fuck up on Twitter.
00:50:41 Yeah, but I'm too, I'm too fucking scared though.
00:50:45 Too cocked.
00:50:47 They'll do those teams.
00:50:48 These are the teams.
00:50:48 Team Cato versus team villain.
00:50:50 Uh, which side are you on gamers?
00:50:52 Uh, comment below.
00:50:55 Yeah, please.
00:50:56 Yeah, please.
00:50:57 Okay.
00:50:58 I, I think, uh, okay.
00:50:59 That's it.
00:51:00 Uh, all right.
00:51:01 Uh, see you later, Ben.
00:51:02 I'm like, no, I want to complain.
00:51:04 I want to complain about my life.
00:51:06 All right, all right, baby.
00:51:07 I broke, I broke my fucking toe again.
00:51:09 Remember how I did that before?
00:51:10 Yeah.
00:51:10 You remember how I've done that like five times?
00:51:14 Why it happened again?
00:51:15 Was it the same piece of furniture?
00:51:18 No, I'll, I'll go through the history of my, of my feet.
00:51:22 Um, the, the first time I broke my toe was when it was in this house, same house
00:51:28 I live in now, I was coming down the stairs and I missed a step and I like fell
00:51:33 on my foot and I broke my.
00:51:36 Metatarsal the like side bone on the side of the left foot.
00:51:41 And then at Radcon two, I think I was, I was during the, I think it was during
00:51:47 the Tony Hawk pro skater, let's play that Jesse and Vic were playing.
00:51:52 I run through the door and I stubbed my toe, my left toe, same toe, different
00:51:57 bone against like a piece of furniture, break it, go to the hospital.
00:52:01 Oh my God.
00:52:02 Uh, yeah.
00:52:04 It happened again.
00:52:05 I don't even remember when it happened again, but I like basically the same
00:52:09 thing, stub that same left toe.
00:52:10 This time I didn't go to the hospital because they don't do anything.
00:52:14 All they do is tape it to your next toe and give you a sandal to wear.
00:52:18 And they're like, wear the sandal.
00:52:21 Don't walk on it too hard.
00:52:23 Yeah.
00:52:23 So that's what I did.
00:52:24 So, and that's what I'm doing this time, but this time it's my right foot.
00:52:27 This is the first time I've broken my right, my right pinky toe.
00:52:30 I was, I was working on my game.
00:52:35 Patreon.com slash Ben St joined my patron discord channel where I post
00:52:41 exclusive updates.
00:52:42 I've been posting updates there.
00:52:43 I've been posted whips, works in progress for those that don't know.
00:52:47 I've been posting sprite art.
00:52:50 I've been posting like animations, being like, Hey guys, check out this coming
00:52:54 along, new feature added, new feature added.
00:52:57 The updates are coming fast and loose.
00:52:59 Um, I want, and I, and I was in the zone and I was like, all I want to do
00:53:05 tonight is just grind out sprites.
00:53:08 I know I just have like a hundred sprites to grind out.
00:53:10 I just want to grind them out.
00:53:11 I'm going to go and buy some alcohol and just get a little drunk and just kind
00:53:17 of zone out and do it.
00:53:19 And that's what I did.
00:53:20 And it worked great.
00:53:21 It was working.
00:53:22 The plan was going according to plan.
00:53:24 It was going perfectly.
00:53:25 I wasn't the night was still young and I had gotten plenty done and I had run
00:53:31 to get plan.
00:53:31 I was in the zone and then I go to the bathroom and I'm coming out and I'm
00:53:35 little uncoordinated and I just my toe against the door frame smashed it.
00:53:40 It's horribly bruised.
00:53:42 It still hurts.
00:53:43 I still hurts to walk on it.
00:53:45 Uh, and I am upset.
00:53:48 My summer is ruined.
00:53:50 Uh, this is, this comes on the heels.
00:53:54 No pun intended of me needing to go and like, I need to be house hunting.
00:53:58 I need to be out on the streets, looking for a new place to live.
00:54:01 And now I can't fucking walk without it hurting.
00:54:03 Damn.
00:54:04 This is awful.
00:54:05 It's like you're, you're like a curse or something, you know?
00:54:09 I, it's, it's, it's, it's not fair.
00:54:12 You know what?
00:54:13 It's not fair.
00:54:14 You know, it's not fair.
00:54:15 It's, it shouldn't have been me.
00:54:16 It should have been you.
00:54:17 I wish, I wish it was you instead.
00:54:19 You know, it's funny.
00:54:20 Just right before I got into the recording, I did stuff my toe on like the
00:54:23 doorframe of my bathroom.
00:54:26 Right.
00:54:26 Well, you should have stubbed it harder in solidarity.
00:54:30 It's, it's, it's annoying.
00:54:32 I don't, I don't know.
00:54:33 It's hard to tell if the bone is broken or not.
00:54:35 It doesn't look like bent or anything.
00:54:37 It was quite bruised for a while.
00:54:39 The bruising is, is letting up a little bit.
00:54:42 Um, it doesn't hurt to like push.
00:54:45 I can touch it and it doesn't hurt at all.
00:54:47 And I can like stretch my toes up and that doesn't hurt at all.
00:54:50 But when I curl my toes down, it feels weird.
00:54:53 It hurts.
00:54:54 And if I walk on it, it hurts a little bit and it's, it's uncomfortable.
00:54:58 It's got a weird feeling.
00:54:59 I think the bone is like micro fractured or something.
00:55:02 Yeah.
00:55:03 I'm just bummed.
00:55:04 I'm just bummed.
00:55:05 You're bummed.
00:55:05 What, what, what, uh, bones.
00:55:08 Yep.
00:55:08 You're bones.
00:55:08 It's sad.
00:55:09 It makes me sad.
00:55:10 I am like, when I think about it, I'm just like, oh, that's unfortunate.
00:55:12 An unfortunate thing happened to me.
00:55:14 Why?
00:55:15 Why?
00:55:15 Why, bed?
00:55:16 Well, why, why must this straight?
00:55:18 Why boys suffer so much?
00:55:20 Why must, why must dad things happen to good people?
00:55:25 You know what, Ben, I'm, I'm being honest with you.
00:55:27 Here's my honest opinion.
00:55:28 I don't, I don't believe that you, you broke in your toes or any of your toes
00:55:31 in any, all, I think all those stories are fake.
00:55:34 Um, okay.
00:55:35 And, but I think the only way you can probably, the only, the way you can
00:55:38 probably prove to me that those toes have been broken.
00:55:42 If I don't know, if you took a picture of them every time you're like, I don't
00:55:44 know, stop them and you DM them to me, you know?
00:55:47 Uh, man, it was very purple.
00:55:53 It was very purple and splotchy and horrible looking for a day there.
00:55:57 Uh, it's, it's bad.
00:55:58 It's a little better now.
00:55:59 It's just kind of like red.
00:56:01 The bruising is letting up a bit.
00:56:04 Ugh.
00:56:05 Um, I just want to, I just want this, it came, this happened right as.
00:56:10 Oh yeah.
00:56:11 The rad content has started to come out again.
00:56:13 The, um, did you see the Brad lecture?
00:56:14 I saw, I saw half of it.
00:56:17 Yeah.
00:56:18 It's a, it's funny.
00:56:19 I don't know.
00:56:20 I remember it.
00:56:21 Like it was only yesterday.
00:56:23 So watching, watching it again, I'm like, it's so weird.
00:56:27 All the, all the comments were so like melancholy.
00:56:31 All the comments I noticed that all the comments are like, damn, it's just sad.
00:56:39 Like watching what it used to be.
00:56:42 And it's like, look at the state of things.
00:56:43 Now it's, it makes me sense.
00:56:45 And up, you've, chin up, you fucking, you fucking, you fucking saps you fucking dweebs.
00:56:52 Get over it.
00:56:53 I should have come life has changed.
00:56:54 I should have commented on that.
00:56:56 I was going to, I, I was going to comment like, damn, I, I, oh, like seeing them like
00:57:00 this now, I, I hope that my comic could somehow travel through time and they could
00:57:04 see my comments and just warn them of things to come.
00:57:07 Warn them of the things to come.
00:57:09 Yeah.
00:57:10 Yeah.
00:57:11 You can tell them, no, there will, no, there will be a pandemic.
00:57:14 No, coronavirus.
00:57:16 No, go becoming trans.
00:57:19 No, watch out, it's coming.
00:57:23 It would be like, it would be like Oedipus, like, um, was it the fucking fortune teller guy?
00:57:28 The Sphinx, the Sphinx, right?
00:57:31 Or was it the Oracle?
00:57:32 I don't know.
00:57:33 That was like a, you know, the Oracle tells, um, Oedipus dad that like his son is going
00:57:37 to kill him and bone his, um, his wife and he like tries to prevent it from happening,
00:57:42 but it happens anyway.
00:57:44 So I go back in time and I warned them about, oh, you're all going to transition and that's
00:57:48 going to throw out the PCP.
00:57:51 Everyone, no, it was the Oracle warns Oedipus's dad, but I think, I think at some point he
00:57:58 has to answer a Sphinx's riddle.
00:58:00 I'm like 75% sure that happened.
00:58:03 I think it's, I think it's referenced in the story that he does that.
00:58:07 It's like a previous adventure, right?
00:58:10 Previous adventures.
00:58:12 Yeah.
00:58:12 Yeah.
00:58:13 World building.
00:58:14 Yeah.
00:58:14 A lot of world building, you know, it's like, it's like in, um, Star Wars, uh, new hope
00:58:19 when, uh, Princess Leia said that you help my father in the Clone Wars and you're
00:58:23 wondering, whoa, where are the Clone Wars, right?
00:58:26 Um, that was Ben Kenobi that said that.
00:58:28 He says we fought in the Clone Wars and Lucas, you fought in the Clone Wars and then
00:58:32 Solid Snake, and then Solid Snake goes Clone Wars.
00:58:36 Uh, what's that?
00:58:39 Man, Star Wars sucks.
00:58:41 It's garbage.
00:58:42 I, I agree.
00:58:44 I'm not a fan.
00:58:46 It's overdone.
00:58:47 It's overrated.
00:58:48 There I said it.
00:58:49 Sucks.
00:58:50 Except for episode eight.
00:58:52 How would you say something so controversial and yet so?
00:58:55 I'm going to say it.
00:58:56 I'm not scared to say it.
00:58:57 I'm not going to, I'm not scared to say it.
00:58:58 Star Wars kind of lame.
00:59:00 You're kind of a big nerd.
00:59:02 I wish I had your courage, cheesy to call out the Star Wars to call out Star Wars.
00:59:08 I have a biggest media property in the universe.
00:59:11 If you say that, they're going to come down on you.
00:59:13 I'm going to say this, the fist of an angry guy.
00:59:16 Villainverse is better than Star, Villainverse is like, if Star Wars was good, I'll
00:59:19 tell you that much.
00:59:21 I would, I would say it.
00:59:22 I would say it.
00:59:23 If the corporate, if the corporate oligarchy didn't have their thumb on my, on my.
00:59:28 Yeah, I can't afford to speak the truth like you.
00:59:32 I'm not free.
00:59:33 Villainverse is more nuanced than a Star Wars and Star Wars is like, what?
00:59:37 Oh, I'm, oh, I joined the dark side.
00:59:39 I'm a bad person.
00:59:40 Oh, I joined the light side.
00:59:42 I'm a good person.
00:59:42 I got like, oh, okay.
00:59:44 All right.
00:59:44 Very child, very straightforward, very simple for man, children, you know,
00:59:48 Villainverse, it's like, Villainverse, like looks you right in the face and says,
00:59:52 like, bro, like capitalism, kind of bad, kind of not good.
00:59:56 It causes a lot of villains, causes a lot of villains, if you will, which, which panel
01:00:01 is that the ending, the ending of Villainverse, the villains just grabs you by
01:00:05 the scruff of your fucking shirt and grabs you the viewer and
01:00:10 speaks through the fourth wall.
01:00:12 It says, I am a metaphor for capitalism.
01:00:17 I invented capital.
01:00:19 That's what the villain says.
01:00:20 He invented all that as E1.
01:00:21 Then he says capitalism.
01:00:23 He also says he invented Star Wars too.
01:00:26 But that's, that's, that's, that's, this is Joey.
01:00:28 That's just, that's just a little, that's just something for the fans.
01:00:32 Cool.

01:00:36 Shit.

01:03:46 Yeah, that Ben is advocates too much for lower income people.
01:03:51 So those lower income people only get a little bit of money.
01:03:54 It puts off the, it puts off the high rollers.
01:03:56 Right.
01:03:57 Exactly.
01:03:58 Um, next one is called sad, but surprisingly, no, sorry.
01:04:02 Next one is called smashly three, two, one go.
01:04:07 So in the last episode, you guys were talking about the image you
01:04:10 used for the podcast of the graveyard.
01:04:13 Um, you guys realize that's like a military cemetery, right?
01:04:16 That's why all the two stones are the same.
01:04:19 So basically you guys have been like desecrating soldiers, graves,
01:04:24 pigs coming out of cars for like several months now.
01:04:27 And honestly, that's pretty big military, the American
01:04:34 imperialist machine.
01:04:36 Um, absolutely.
01:04:38 I know, I know, you, I know people are going to be like, Oh,
01:04:41 my brother was in the, oh, my dad's like, they're an idiot.
01:04:44 They're fucking idiot.
01:04:45 I said they're idiot.
01:04:46 Brother is a victim of a, of a system that made them fucking
01:04:50 throw their life on their fucking chopping block.
01:04:52 They got exploited.
01:04:53 American oil dolly.
01:04:54 They did, they did.
01:04:56 They should feel bad about it.
01:04:57 They shouldn't be proud.
01:04:58 I don't, I'm sorry.
01:04:59 Like there's no honor in being exploited, you know, sorry.
01:05:03 I don't, I agree.
01:05:03 The hard truth.
01:05:04 I agree.
01:05:05 Right.
01:05:05 Good voicemail.
01:05:06 Finally, I like, I like that one.
01:05:10 Uh, okay.
01:05:10 Next one is called, um, wait, sorry.
01:05:15 We got, do the, do the one that's numbered three, three, two, eight, three.
01:05:20 Uh, next one is called a sad, but surprisingly enticing boy.
01:05:24 Three, two, one, go.
01:05:33 Hey, Ben, I designated your Kato anthology cover to be
01:05:36 asked a couple of days ago.
01:05:38 That's right.
01:05:38 I had some time to think about my words and I wanted to apologize.
01:05:43 That cover was a mess.
01:05:46 That assessment was way to harsh of me and that stepped out.
01:05:49 Agreed.
01:05:50 Sorry.
01:05:52 We all make, that shit, but though we all make
01:05:54 mistakes.
01:05:56 Well, we all make mistakes.
01:05:59 It's cool.
01:06:00 Did he say that shit fucks though?
01:06:01 Is that what he said?
01:06:03 I think, I think it's, he said it's shit, but yeah, that, that shit, but that shit,
01:06:07 but so, you know, motion in the right direction.
01:06:12 All right.
01:06:13 Okay.
01:06:13 Next one is, next one is called wholesome w or L in disguise.
01:06:17 Three, two, one, go.
01:06:20 I'm really baffled on Twitter right now and I want to know what you guys think.
01:06:23 You know, when someone can't afford their medical expenses and their family has to
01:06:26 like sell possessions or open it, go fund me in order to pay for it.
01:06:29 Sure.
01:06:29 I'm like, wow, that's fucked.
01:06:31 It's a failing of the system and it's a tragedy that it would be put in that
01:06:33 scenario.
01:06:34 That's right.
01:06:34 So from dudes posting their w is a situation that is exactly identical,
01:06:38 except it was a kid got a bunch of donations after selling his Pokemon cards in
01:06:43 order to pay for his dog's medical treatment.
01:06:45 This is not to say that dogs should be under like the healthcare system, but
01:06:49 the point is that regardless, it's a situation that is still fucked in all
01:06:53 the same ways, yet everyone on Twitter is treating it like it's a wholesome W.
01:06:57 Like what do you really think it's a W for this kid that the only thing keeping
01:07:02 his dog from fucking death is the sale of his Pokemon cards?
01:07:06 No, you're insane.
01:07:08 Yeah.
01:07:10 Why do you feel about the count of men posting their W's?
01:07:14 I mean, most of the time when I see it, it does seem pretty wholesome.
01:07:21 Mm hmm.
01:07:22 I don't know if I think I think I've seen that one that he's talking about.
01:07:26 I get it.
01:07:26 I like, they seem pretty like I, it's interesting to see like the contrast
01:07:32 between like men posting their W and women posting their W.
01:07:36 Like the majority of women posting their W is like, oh, I graduated.
01:07:40 Oh, I got a doctorate.
01:07:42 Oh, like my journal got to play.
01:07:44 I got a job or whatever.
01:07:46 Yeah, I used to be a felon, but now I got a, I'm a lawyer.
01:07:49 Yeah.
01:07:49 It's all like very kind of like education, like these big achievements.
01:07:52 But like men posting a W is kind of like, oh, I just kept kicking this little
01:07:57 rock and I was just having fun with it.
01:07:59 And it's, and I think that says a lot about society.
01:08:04 It's a lot of like, it's the ones that I see are usually like, like a good
01:08:09 Samaritan man, like help someone out or, um, I mean, I don't know.
01:08:15 I'm a little torn on this one because like, yeah, I don't know if I think
01:08:17 that like animals should be covered by universal health care.
01:08:22 And if we had, I don't know about that.
01:08:25 So it is, it's kind of nice.
01:08:26 I mean, it's nice.
01:08:28 It's pretty heartwarming to think that a kid like sold it.
01:08:31 Do kids even collect Pokemon cards anymore?
01:08:33 I mean, I mean, it's like, I think it's one of the fucking Paul brothers
01:08:37 made Pokemon cards popular again.
01:08:40 I see, you heard the story about like all these people now buying a shit load
01:08:45 of them, right?
01:08:46 Oh, oh, yeah.
01:08:49 I thought that was magic.
01:08:50 I thought like people were like fucking lining up and like storming stores
01:08:53 for like the new magic set or whatever.
01:08:55 Is it Pokemon too?
01:08:56 Yeah, it's, it's, it's Pokemon.
01:08:57 Like people are buying like Pokemon.
01:08:59 Yeah, like I think now one of the, one of the polls, like on their podcast,
01:09:03 they like do a lot of Pokemon unboxing videos, Pokemon card unboxing videos.
01:09:07 Right.
01:09:08 I mean, it makes sense.
01:09:08 Like I like was a kid when Pokemon first came out.
01:09:11 Right.
01:09:12 So, you know, weren't we all bringing it back?
01:09:15 Huh, not me.
01:09:16 I'm not a nerd.
01:09:19 Nevermind.
01:09:19 I grew up on how old, how old are the Pauls?
01:09:22 Are they like 30?
01:09:23 They're like 20, I think they're around my age, maybe like 25 or wait.
01:09:30 So, so if he was a kid when it came out, then you would have been a kid
01:09:34 when it came out because the generation that came out with the
01:09:37 generation I remember as a kid when in elementary school, it was a Ruby version.
01:09:44 Like that was the, that was, yeah, it was, um, yeah, it was home in that region.
01:09:48 Right.
01:09:49 And then a Diamond and Pearl.
01:09:50 Right.
01:09:50 Those were like the big two I remember.
01:09:53 So, so yeah, it was a, you were a kid.
01:09:55 Okay.
01:09:56 Okay.
01:09:56 I got you.
01:09:57 Um, well, I don't know.
01:10:00 I think it's pretty sweet that a kid sells his Pokemon cards to save his dog.
01:10:06 I think, I think that is heartwarming.
01:10:07 No, I think I'm going to go with it is a W.
01:10:09 I think it's, um, I have this weird, like, if I can like analyze both like
01:10:14 accounts of like, when posting their W and men posting their W's.
01:10:18 Wait, wait, before you, before you do that, before you do that, I just, okay.
01:10:21 Yeah, it's like, yeah, I, I guess I do, I guess I do have to agree that the kid,
01:10:28 the kid's dog probably should have had been able to get that fucking dog
01:10:31 surgery without selling his Pokemon.
01:10:33 I don't know.
01:10:35 Yeah, I, I see what you mean.
01:10:37 It's kind of, it is kind of sad that like, if the story hadn't gone viral or
01:10:41 whatever, if someone hadn't picked up the, then like, oh my God, this kid
01:10:45 selling his Pokemon cards to save his dog.
01:10:46 That's so sweet.
01:10:47 Let's donate.
01:10:48 Like if that hadn't happened, then the dog dies.
01:10:51 Right.
01:10:52 The kid sells his Pokemon cards.
01:10:53 He still can't afford it.
01:10:54 The dog dies.
01:10:56 I mean, yeah, he's fucking terrible.
01:10:57 So I guess it's like, what do you choose your Pokemon cards or your dog
01:11:01 living, right?
01:11:02 Well, it's really sweet that the kid would choose his dog.
01:11:04 Right.
01:11:05 Exactly.
01:11:05 I mean, probably a lot of kids would, but it's nice.
01:11:07 I mean, it sucks that like the surgery costs.
01:11:10 I mean, just like, well, pets are like a luxury, right?
01:11:14 And so of course it's going to be fucking expensive, you know?
01:11:18 Yeah, a little bit.
01:11:19 I don't know.
01:11:20 I don't know.
01:11:20 Vashh hasn't made a video about pet health care, so I have no opinion.
01:11:24 Yeah, it's true.
01:11:25 Yeah.
01:11:26 So we got to move on.
01:11:27 We got to move on.
01:11:28 We're not, we're not qualified to speak on it yet.
01:11:30 Okay.
01:11:31 But what were you saying about the two accounts?
01:11:33 Like, I think it's kind of interesting about like, you know, about, um, obviously
01:11:39 patriarchy, blah, blah, blah, whatever.
01:11:41 But, um, like the, what, what is like the standard for, for men having a W and
01:11:47 what's like the standards for like a woman, right?
01:11:51 Or like, I don't think this is on purpose.
01:11:53 It just might be some sort of subconscious shit where it's like, for a woman,
01:11:57 it's like, they have to have a degree.
01:11:58 They have to have a high paying job.
01:11:59 Like that's like the W standard for women, like a tire.
01:12:03 And for men, it's kind of like, bro, I just found a sick ass stick and
01:12:06 I'm just hitting stuff with it.
01:12:08 Right.
01:12:09 Yeah.
01:12:10 I haven't seen, I haven't seen any men Ws that are just like, lol, I found a cool
01:12:16 rock that looks like Abraham Lincoln or like some, I haven't seen any like goofy.
01:12:20 I'm sure there are some.
01:12:21 I, I swear, I swear, there was like one where, um, oh great.
01:12:26 There's like a shitload of like men posting their Ws accounts.
01:12:30 Huh.
01:12:31 I'm looking for the one, I think, well, there's, but there's the one, but
01:12:34 there's the one big one.
01:12:35 Yeah.
01:12:35 The, the, the one with, with Leonardo DiCaprio, right?
01:12:40 Yeah.
01:12:40 Is the icon.
01:12:41 Yeah.
01:12:41 Yeah.
01:12:42 I'm like looking for it, but I'm seeing like ones about like ones where it's
01:12:48 like men posting their W, but they have like the Swedish gamer.
01:12:53 Um, Swedish gamer.
01:12:55 Well, the guy, the guy was like, no, the guy who says yes.
01:12:59 Oh, the guy was like, gamer.
01:13:02 The, I, I've never heard him called that before.
01:13:05 Isn't, isn't that what that meme is called?
01:13:07 Or what the guy was just saying?
01:13:08 Yes.
01:13:08 And he has like the Chad look.
01:13:10 Yeah.
01:13:11 You know, I don't know what is, I, I, if you'd asked me, like what is he called?
01:13:15 I don't know what he's called.
01:13:17 Maybe he's called Swedish gamer.
01:13:19 I would call him, I would call him Nordic.
01:13:22 Oh, wait, it might be Nordic gamer actually.
01:13:24 Hold up.
01:13:26 He's not, he's not always a gamer though.
01:13:29 No, but I think the original, sometimes he's just a head.
01:13:31 I think the original version was like supposed to be a gamer.
01:13:35 Yes.
01:13:36 Chad, also known as Nordic gamer.
01:13:38 Yeah.
01:13:39 He's when I, I mean, when I think Chad, I think, you know, tiny beetle like
01:13:44 stride arms perpetually in contra posto.
01:13:48 Well, I cannot out shirt.
01:13:51 I cannot find the fucking.
01:13:53 How can you not find the men posting their W's?
01:14:00 It's so weird.
01:14:01 What the fuck?
01:14:01 I can't find it.
01:14:02 It's called, it's called dudes posting double.
01:14:04 I found it.
01:14:05 Oh, it called dudes.
01:14:06 Yeah.
01:14:06 I found it right away from a Google.
01:14:07 It's called dudes posting W's.
01:14:10 Ironically funny and wholesome DMs open for submissions.
01:14:13 Dudes post.
01:14:14 Oh, okay.
01:14:15 I found dudes posting their W twos.
01:14:18 I mean, I see the guy who called an Uber for a, an injured bird, um, uh, a biotech
01:14:30 startup has 3D prints, faked rhino horns, poached rhinos.
01:14:37 I'm going to do my own, um, I'm going to make my own fat guy who lost a bunch of
01:14:41 weight, I'm going to do my own like, uh, dudes posting their W's account, but
01:14:46 every post it just so happens to be like about someone making a comic.
01:14:50 That's just constantly, that's the only W I acknowledge.
01:14:54 And I'm sort of just looking at all these W's too many, a lot of like, a lot of
01:14:57 like fitness and like health related W's, uh, things in things that people
01:15:06 invented, you know, heartwarming moments of like personal, you know, with, with
01:15:12 helped a kid do something.
01:15:14 What do you, what do you think about like wholesome, like wholesome accounts?
01:15:18 I always feel weirdly suspicious about anyone who like parades as like a wholesome
01:15:23 type, you know.
01:15:24 Well, I mean, I mean, the guy who runs the like women posting their L that guy,
01:15:29 um, it's not blackpilled.com.
01:15:32 It's, uh, he's like, uh, what's that guy's fucking name?
01:15:36 I, I, I can't remember, but I know he has like some sort of podcast where he's
01:15:39 like a huge misogynist.
01:15:41 He has like a Duke Nukem avatar or something.
01:15:45 It redux something redux, doesn't he?
01:15:48 Doesn't he kill a redux?
01:15:50 Doesn't he also run the bad movies, opinion account or like bad film takes?
01:15:55 He, he runs a bunch, he runs a bunch of account of like gimmick accounts.
01:15:59 And he sucks.
01:16:00 He sucks really bad.
01:16:01 And sometimes his, and sometimes his L's are just like, I was raped.
01:16:06 Like sometimes that's, like, oh my God, yeah, exactly.
01:16:10 It's so fucking, I remember back when he, when he was running like bad film
01:16:15 takes, like just any, like, any, like film take where someone shits on the
01:16:20 Star Wars prequels, he would consider bad by the fault.
01:16:23 And everyone just kept pointing it out.
01:16:24 So cool.
01:16:25 I just kept saying like, well, like the, yeah, the peaks, the prequels aren't
01:16:28 that good, bro.
01:16:28 And like, why the fuck are you constantly defending them?
01:16:30 And, and he would just quote, he would just like screenshot the tweet and just
01:16:34 post it as the bad take.
01:16:37 Oh my God.
01:16:39 Okay.
01:16:39 I saw, I saw an account.
01:16:44 Uh, whatever.
01:16:47 What?
01:16:47 Yeah.
01:16:48 The, the, the wholesome ones, the W's accounts, they generally seem okay.
01:16:52 Like I haven't seen very many W's that are like, ooh, that's kind of
01:16:56 problematic that you could really, you're calling that a W.
01:16:59 I think the W's accounts are fine.
01:17:01 Whoa.
01:17:01 I mean, I'm not going to fall.
01:17:02 I don't care that.
01:17:03 Whoa.
01:17:03 Father, make sure his children are all of lighter skin.
01:17:06 Whoa.
01:17:06 W, bro.
01:17:08 Whoa.
01:17:09 Father, father, father, uh, uh, convinces his, his trans daughter to be a boy again.
01:17:16 I'm good job.
01:17:17 To de-transition.
01:17:18 Whoa.
01:17:18 This doctor convinces teenagers to de-transition.
01:17:22 Whoa.
01:17:23 Um, based.
01:17:24 Whoa.
01:17:25 Epic.
01:17:25 Based.
01:17:27 Next, next voicemail is called, um, what is this called?
01:17:33 Based Ben, based Ben.
01:17:35 Three, two, one, go.
01:17:38 Based Ben, Homestuck was at its best in the early parts and it peaked in act four.
01:17:46 Uh, I agree.
01:17:47 Yes.
01:17:48 Yeah.
01:17:48 You haven't read Homestuck, have you?
01:17:49 No, I've not, but, um, but I'm going to, I'm just going to say my hate it.
01:17:55 Okay.
01:17:56 Homestuck got, Homestuck got really popular with the addition of the trolls,
01:18:01 which was in like act, it's kind of started, I think in act three, but they got
01:18:06 more and more prominence through acts like four and five.
01:18:10 What's, uh, what's your take on the trolls?
01:18:11 Do you like the trolls?
01:18:12 They're, they're, I don't dislike them.
01:18:14 They're fine, but I mean, I, I think they're good even.
01:18:18 I like the part, I like act five.
01:18:21 I think act five is good.
01:18:22 It was just, um, my favorite part of Homestuck is the early part, which doesn't,
01:18:27 which it's not good because it doesn't have trolls.
01:18:29 It's not like the trolls are ruined it by being there.
01:18:31 It's just my favorite part is the early part, which doesn't have any trolls.
01:18:34 And it's very focused on this very like goofy, very problem, sleuthy kind of
01:18:40 like just sort of winging it, like coming up with weird shit and like giving it
01:18:45 weird, funny names, and then like just kind of making up rules as you go along.
01:18:50 And then like really, really rigidly adhering to those rules, even when it
01:18:54 doesn't make any sense, uh, which the story becomes more of a, the story becomes
01:18:58 more of a traditional narrative as it goes along in lockstep with like the
01:19:03 trolls becoming more and more prominent.
01:19:04 And I think, you know, I think that has more mass appeal.
01:19:09 Right.
01:19:09 So it makes sense.
01:19:10 Right.
01:19:11 But that's, that's not what hooked me about it though.
01:19:13 Did you have them?
01:19:14 Yeah.
01:19:14 This guy's base.
01:19:15 You guys, you guys, you guys talked about the cycloneos, Anthony, right?
01:19:20 We, oh, I don't think we.
01:19:27 Cause I, I think we said we were going to do a, a cast about it and I
01:19:30 haven't reread it yet.
01:19:31 Oh, damn.
01:19:32 Cause I, I, I read, I read all of it.
01:19:34 Yeah.
01:19:35 And I, I don't think.
01:19:36 Yeah, you've read it.
01:19:37 Yeah.
01:19:37 We can, we can talk about it here a little bit.
01:19:39 Oh yeah.
01:19:39 Well, so how, how do you feel?
01:19:41 Spoilers.
01:19:42 Spoilers for cycloneos.
01:19:45 How do I feel?
01:19:46 Um, you know what?
01:19:48 I don't, I don't want to go too deep into it because I do want to record
01:19:50 that cast with Gibb.
01:19:51 I think all I'll say is that like about the ending.
01:19:54 Yeah.
01:19:55 Yeah.
01:19:56 It, go on.
01:19:57 I, it's Fight Club.
01:20:00 The, what?
01:20:01 Cycloneos is Fight Club.
01:20:05 They're literally almost the same story.
01:20:09 Um, okay.
01:20:11 Let me explain.
01:20:12 So I see what you mean.
01:20:14 Right.
01:20:14 So there's like in Fight Club, both are about main characters who, um,
01:20:19 who like created an alter ego and they create like a movement and it becomes
01:20:22 like kind of massive, like huge, almost like out of their hands, right?
01:20:26 And then like at the end, he has to like have a confrontation with his
01:20:29 alter ego and then he kind of realized that that's like what he really
01:20:32 wanted was like, like a human connection, like a relationship, right?
01:20:37 And that's kind of like what cycloneos is.
01:20:39 Like, like, if you read like kind of like the little epilogue thing with
01:20:42 the note in the bottle, it's like, she says, like, loves, like loves the
01:20:47 answer, right?
01:20:48 And, and I thought, yeah, I guess that's okay.
01:20:53 But I thought it was okay to me, like, I guess as a resolution, that's fine.
01:20:58 To me, the story was not like about finding love.
01:21:03 So like the fact that it ends in that way is a little like, okay, I guess.
01:21:08 Whatever.
01:21:09 I guess, I mean, it could be like, you probably make the argument
01:21:12 that's like, oh, influencers and like, what do they need?
01:21:15 Like what, like maybe this void that she was filling with me and an
01:21:18 influencer could have been just filled with like loving someone.
01:21:22 Hold on.
01:21:24 She wasn't, I'm going to, I disagree.
01:21:26 She doesn't, she doesn't fill the void by becoming an influencer.
01:21:29 She fills the void by becoming like a fucking warlord.
01:21:34 Yeah.
01:21:35 Do you, I mean, do you, do you think they're basically one in the
01:21:37 same in, in the, in the story of cycloneos?
01:21:40 I mean, I'm not, I'm not like surprised.
01:21:43 Like that's, that's like what Andrew Hussie is trying to like tell us.
01:21:48 Right.
01:21:48 Yeah.
01:21:48 I think in retrospect, I think I probably overhyped myself too much
01:21:52 with like the socialist angle because it doesn't really go into.
01:21:56 Honestly, the conclusion is very like, oh, you know, everything's
01:22:04 kind of inevitable.
01:22:05 You know, anything ideological is just kind of like the fact
01:22:10 that the fact, the fact that the clown revolution, this is very
01:22:13 spoiler, the fact that the clown revolution is left wing is like
01:22:17 very incidental and ends up kind of not mattering at all.
01:22:20 Like it's just a, it's just a thing.
01:22:23 Yeah.
01:22:23 It's just an aesthetic, which I guess is kind of the point because
01:22:27 like, oh, this is actually a like alien mind plot, which, okay,
01:22:34 makes sense.
01:22:35 But yeah, I guess it's a little disappointing that like the movement
01:22:40 itself and what it stands for is not really important.
01:22:43 Not what the story is about.
01:22:44 It kind of doesn't even have an opinion about it.
01:22:46 Right.
01:22:47 Like really, like it's really more about like.
01:22:50 Human connection.
01:22:51 And I mean, that's fine.
01:22:52 But you know, like, like, I don't know.
01:22:55 Like I was thinking about this and I was saying like, I love
01:22:59 rewatching Fight Club.
01:23:00 I think rewatching Fight Club is pretty great.
01:23:02 I don't know if I like want to like, maybe I'll reread
01:23:06 Cycloneos eventually again.
01:23:08 But it's I am going to reread it.
01:23:10 I think it, I don't know.
01:23:12 I think there's a chance that I might like it less on my second read.
01:23:15 I, but I think there's also a chance I might like it more.
01:23:19 I genuinely don't know what I'm how I'm going to feel about it.
01:23:21 Because I know that you I you made the same.
01:23:24 You chose the same thing I did at the ending, which is the crown.
01:23:27 Right.
01:23:29 Because because to me, that's way more interesting.
01:23:31 Yeah, absolutely.
01:23:32 She chose to me.
01:23:34 Yeah.
01:23:35 It's more.
01:23:37 Here's my calculus.
01:23:38 It's more interesting.
01:23:40 I would say that there's a this is so spoilery.
01:23:44 Whatever, I'll fuck it.
01:23:45 I will elaborate more on this in the eventual in the
01:23:48 eventual Cycloneos cast, but the the choice at the end
01:23:53 between sword or crown, it's like there's a calculus because
01:23:57 this being is telling you like what is to be one if you if
01:24:03 you take the crown and what she's offering is like huge what
01:24:08 she's she's basically offering you like pseudo immortality
01:24:12 and like cosmic power and it's like if she if that's true,
01:24:17 then like obviously you should take the crown like anything
01:24:20 else you could get by refusing the crown is not as good.
01:24:24 But there's a chance that this is just a delusion that you're
01:24:27 having and none of this is real in which case if you take
01:24:30 the crown, you're basically just going to die for no reason
01:24:33 and you there's nothing to be gained in which case like don't.
01:24:36 So yeah, in the end, I'm like, well, is this a delusion or
01:24:40 is this real?
01:24:41 I don't know.
01:24:42 But yeah, it's a more interesting story if I just go for it.
01:24:45 And so I'm going to go for it.
01:24:46 I think I think a part of me was like because like when I was
01:24:49 reading the last chapter, a part of me was like didn't want
01:24:52 to accept that because I had a I had a rousing suspicion that
01:24:56 like the final message was going to be all you needed.
01:24:59 All you need is love and that's so dull.
01:25:02 That's so like it's not it's not it's not super exciting.
01:25:06 Like yeah, like I don't like it's like and then it kind of
01:25:08 makes me rethink about like Andrew Hussey and it's kind of
01:25:11 like, yeah, this guy is like a rich white guy like it's like
01:25:18 I mean a rich fucking white guy who wrote this like all you
01:25:21 need is like fucking like come on.
01:25:23 It's so it's so frustrating.
01:25:24 I started I see what you mean.
01:25:27 I see what you I mean.
01:25:28 I feel like it's it's sad because I feel like Hussey is genuine
01:25:32 in his politics.
01:25:33 He is like a he is like a Bernie bro.
01:25:36 I think he is like left-wing and anti-capitalist in his
01:25:39 personal life, but that's not really that's that's only here
01:25:42 in psycholonials like aesthetically right and it's not
01:25:46 really a theme.
01:25:47 I've been very kind of like we're realizing a couple of
01:25:49 things about like I've been thinking a lot like works of
01:25:52 media like did you did you hear recently about like the the
01:25:55 Bo Burnham like special and there's like a clip.
01:25:58 Sure.
01:25:59 Yeah, there's a clip that going around where like this like
01:26:01 sock puppet the sock.
01:26:02 Yeah, I like mentioned the problems capitalism and people
01:26:05 were calling that radical when it's not it's not radical like
01:26:07 the thing is like here's the thing.
01:26:09 I haven't I haven't seen the special special is good.
01:26:12 I like the contact special is pretty good.
01:26:13 I like the special but that being said it's not radical like
01:26:17 it's not radical to say capitalism is bad.
01:26:21 That's not radical at all.
01:26:23 What's radical is like what do you do about capitalism?
01:26:25 That's radical, right?
01:26:27 And I think yeah and there's like only a handful of works
01:26:30 that I feel like are very explicit of what to do about
01:26:34 like capitalism and I think the first one that comes to mind
01:26:36 is like the movie sorry to bother you.
01:26:38 That one's like very explicit of like what do you do about
01:26:40 capitalism, right?
01:26:41 Is that the one with the white voice?
01:26:43 Yes, you got to watch that Ben.
01:26:45 I think you haven't I haven't I know that one but I haven't
01:26:47 seen it.
01:26:47 It's really it's really good but and and then it got me
01:26:50 thinking about how I like like I love One Piece.
01:26:54 I think One Piece has like moments that feel very like left
01:26:58 but there's like other moments that feel very like like the
01:27:01 fact that like it a lot of the arts kind of end with like
01:27:04 reinstating a monarchy, right?
01:27:07 Which is pretty which is pretty unbased I'll I'll say it's
01:27:10 pretty fucking pretty unbased pretty unbased and in my
01:27:14 head I see it so easily like the fucking social is shown in
01:27:17 it's so visible in my head right like it's easy like it's
01:27:22 like it's like you it's like you take like the One Piece
01:27:24 formula of him going around helping like disenfranchise
01:27:28 people on different island and then he unifies the people
01:27:30 right like like on paper what Luffy is doing and at times in
01:27:35 the narrative it does seem pretty like radical but then what
01:27:39 they actually yeah what they actually do a lot of the time
01:27:43 is they they fight they fight a terrorist and they reinstate
01:27:47 the monarchy.
01:27:48 Right exactly it's totally do yeah it's like a lot of
01:27:51 reinstating monarchies and I guess it goes back to like
01:27:54 because probably in Luffy's head it's all like oh yeah I want
01:27:56 to be the pirate king and here I am helping other kings am I
01:27:59 right and it's so I mean it's so annoying yeah it's it started
01:28:06 making me reflect on my he's got class solidarity Luffy's got
01:28:09 class solidarity with like the Shichi Bukai and stuff like
01:28:13 really they have the same because they're all on the same way
01:28:16 but that's you know it's just like it's just like Tim Rogers
01:28:20 and and Vito Giswaldi and fucking Mr. Bob's game or whatever
01:28:25 they're all they're all the elites they all control our
01:28:28 lives they're all in a big club and you and I aren't invited
01:28:32 right exactly fucking Grimes isn't a fucking communist she's
01:28:35 fucking she's rich.
01:28:36 Yes, you're right like she's an example of course she's going
01:28:41 to fucking date someone like Elon Musk actually communists
01:28:45 should like my billionaire boyfriend owning everything
01:28:48 because he's going to make a spaceship one day it's so fucking
01:28:53 frustrating God it's like it's making me reflect a lot on my
01:28:56 work like I'm gonna say this right now that I mean like
01:28:59 all villain versus like capitalism bad right and like
01:29:02 I'm not gonna say that like villain versus radical at all
01:29:05 it's not it's not like radical but I think from now on I'm
01:29:07 gonna try to like make sure my works are a little bit more
01:29:10 radical right cuz I'm just so tired I'm so tired of like
01:29:14 stories that are very like all you need is love or like like
01:29:18 or humans are stupid right or it's it's kind of like I'm so
01:29:21 tired of stories where it's like humans are these aren't these
01:29:23 aren't radical messages yeah it's not like I know humans are
01:29:26 stupid I live with humans all my fucking life I know they're
01:29:29 fucking stupid I want a story that's like yeah humans are
01:29:31 stupid but like you know we got to still do good despite of
01:29:34 it you know we got to like like change it so it's so
01:29:37 frustrating you know and I guess I got fucking tricked I got
01:29:41 tricked by because Hussey was like oh here's clowns and
01:29:44 communism and I'm like oh base but no it wasn't base it was
01:29:47 actually cringe anyway it's like a 7 out of 10 I can't really
01:29:54 disagree with you I'm gonna I'm gonna do a reread I'm gonna do
01:29:58 reread but I agree it's too aesthetic I mean not I mean not
01:30:03 not not every story has to be no of course message message
01:30:08 laden some times a story can just be about a bunch of really
01:30:12 powerful guys fighting each other right like like that's fine
01:30:16 like that's fine too yeah don't get me wrong it's just I'm
01:30:19 tired of being kind of like like tease you know I'm tired of
01:30:22 like um no I hear I hear you I'm tired of getting like like
01:30:26 fucking I'm getting edged all the time everyone's fucking
01:30:29 edging me all like give like give me a theme like the theme of
01:30:32 psychologials is definitely not you know it's definitely not
01:30:37 that like the workers should own the fruits of their
01:30:42 production productive labor right like that's not what the
01:30:45 story is saying it feels almost like maybe just ideology is
01:30:48 inherently destructive or something which I think is a very
01:30:52 like yeah brain dead fucking take on it because everything
01:30:55 is ideology yeah you're at yeah it's very much like like I
01:31:02 said this before in the end it doesn't matter what the movement
01:31:04 was about the movement was doomed to be co-opted by you
01:31:08 know the the power hungry right it was going to take the same
01:31:12 form no matter what happened it's so which I mean maybe
01:31:17 maybe that's true but it's not radical yeah yeah it's not
01:31:20 right it's not radical right I mean yeah okay not every piece
01:31:23 of work has to be radical but like I like I like stories like
01:31:26 devil man I think they'll man is like pretty good because I
01:31:31 think it's I haven't read it it's pretty it's pretty short
01:31:33 actually like the man goes not too long I would recommend
01:31:38 just like watching devil man cry baby but anyway here's here's
01:31:40 devil man here's devil man if I wrote it this this would be
01:31:43 me yeah hell yeah there's devil there's devil man if I had
01:31:49 read it right there's devil man once you read the man's gonna
01:31:52 make more sense you're gonna be like oh it was capitalism
01:31:55 the real enemy was it actually capitalism no it was it was
01:31:59 God it was God and the inherent like the ultimate theme and
01:32:06 like devil man it's kind of like human fear is like
01:32:09 incredibly destructive right sure right make sense and then
01:32:14 there's like a there's like a little moment in devil man
01:32:16 where it's kind of like I'm gonna unify all the devil people
01:32:19 together and I'm like oh yeah base awesome right but that's
01:32:23 like only like towards a little bit towards the end and then
01:32:25 it kind of it has like a spoiler is like a sad ending I guess
01:32:29 you know a good story anyway 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 all
01:32:35 right let's let's move right along all right cool we've we've
01:32:37 got another voicemail here this one that I posted before it is
01:32:41 called what is it called a glimpse into the future bends
01:32:48 ascension three two one go the year is 20 xx Boston has become
01:32:55 a massive super city now known as megachucin space neo
01:33:01 American England a true capitalist hellhole this is where
01:33:06 our story begins in the slums a small apartment with Ben
01:33:10 Saint hard at work on his keto gummies it was upon a certain
01:33:15 day there in a Thursday that Ben Saint perfected his keto
01:33:20 gummy recipe Saint consumed the first of the batch but he would
01:33:25 find no need to consume another as the slime shaped gummy dissolved
01:33:29 into Ben's gut all of his chakra gate flung open and he entered
01:33:34 a state which many only theorized of 13th level ketosis
01:33:41 rapidly releasing energy Saint's apartment and much of the
01:33:45 city block was consumed in a blaze Ben nowhere to be seen
01:33:50 the naysayers assumed he was dead but soon signs would be
01:33:54 found that Ben had not perished in the fire but ascended no
01:33:59 longer Ben Saint but Ben God this is the future before you even
01:34:06 now the hands of fate move ever closer to the eventuality this
01:34:11 the really based future I gotta I guess I better get back to
01:34:16 making the gummies again because my substitute for the
01:34:21 isomalt oligosaccharides the Alulose it just isn't very good
01:34:25 I haven't had good results with that it's been very discouraged
01:34:28 very discouraged and can't you not buy this isn't that the
01:34:31 replacement for like another ingredient that you like ran out
01:34:34 over something
01:34:36 no it was it was the isomalt oligosaccharides where the
01:34:39 powder that I can't get from China anymore Alulose is like
01:34:44 another it's like another sweetening powder that I saw the
01:34:48 the the product that inspired me the sweet smart this sorry
01:34:52 the smart sweets that inspired me to try making them they
01:34:55 changed their recipe they still taste all right they switched
01:34:58 from isomalt oligosaccharide to Alulose I was like well I guess
01:35:01 I'll try Alulose and it's not good you're not it's just taste
01:35:05 weird I like not like mixing it right and the proper ingredient
01:35:08 you're not you're not turning the knob correctly maybe
01:35:13 I may have like cooked it too much and given it's sort of
01:35:16 like a burnt flavor in like trying to cook it down and
01:35:20 like dehydrate it to make it chewy because it's like has
01:35:24 like a sort of caramely flavor that I didn't that sounds good
01:35:29 when I say like that but it's not good it's it's not good
01:35:34 anyway it's true it's all true next voicemail is called a
01:35:38 fuck been saints that mp3 3 I said what I was thinking

01:38:02 Yes I'm crashing the PCP.
01:38:05 Oh my God I knew this would happen remind me this would happen
01:38:08 eventually remind me who zero is again.
01:38:12 I'm from Kata.
01:38:13 Oh that's why we were just talking shit about you really here.
01:38:17 That's right.
01:38:18 That's right.
01:38:19 Yeah I should have crashed the podcast.
01:38:20 Yeah we have a rivalry now you and I we are we're rivals in
01:38:25 the sense.
01:38:27 Are you hot hot blooded rivals.
01:38:29 Yeah yeah yeah we established earlier.
01:38:31 Yeah I was talking mad garbage about Kato and I told people
01:38:35 don't read the Kato anthology read my comic villain verse far
01:38:38 superior now there's two teams team villain team Kato right.
01:38:44 Oh my goodness yeah yeah that's the only way I recommend you
01:38:47 also read it had to be it had to be this way I recommend you
01:38:50 also read villain verse so you know your enemy you know.
01:38:54 Right of course you want to know who you're dealing with.
01:38:57 The one way to settle this right of course you just everyone
01:39:00 has to read both and come to their own conclusion.
01:39:02 Okay yeah okay read both which one read Kato.
01:39:06 Yeah look all I got to say is that Kato needs like how many

01:42:35 Hey PCP monotone bitch here.
01:42:38 A couple weeks ago I called and I like pee pee poo poo.
01:42:40 I don't understand why you want to draw comics.
01:42:42 I just like illustrations because I'm a lazy loser terrible
01:42:45 and I actually read you all sorry and holy shit because
01:42:48 they're so cool.
01:42:49 Then aside from the insanely strong character writing my
01:42:51 favorite part of the Vapors is how you play with lighting
01:42:54 and the lack thereof.
01:42:55 Wow that page in the first chapter where Vincent is walking
01:42:58 at the games club and it's all dark and everything made me
01:43:01 kill myself because it was so good.
01:43:03 Yeah Lord of ghosts and give you have all these sick panel
01:43:06 layouts like when the flower head slices the blood worm in
01:43:08 half and I'm just like whoa whoa that's so cool.
01:43:12 Anyway I finished that and now I have two comic pages sketched
01:43:15 out and I'm going to do another one after work.
01:43:17 So thank you guys for being so inspiring I guess fucking hell
01:43:21 yeah.
01:43:22 More voicemails like this where you just gush about how cool
01:43:25 our stuff is.
01:43:27 Got another one.
01:43:29 Yeah I got I just I just happened to be a little bit
01:43:32 looking at I had Saint comics open the other day and I just
01:43:36 happened to be open to I think the exact page you're talking
01:43:39 about where he's walking down the path and like the lanterns
01:43:43 are on and he sort of has this little shadow is coming off
01:43:47 of his feet and he'd like the silhouette of the of the buildings
01:43:51 in the background I think I know the exact panel this guy's
01:43:53 talking about I thought he was going to say the one where
01:43:56 Vincent comes through the door and he's sort of like shadowed
01:44:00 in the front with the the the the the what's the word for the
01:44:05 little dots that you put on a comic the screen tone though
01:44:09 he's got the screen tone shading on but no no the inky the
01:44:12 inky blackness of that night with the bubbling lights of the
01:44:15 of the lanterns the the the the light the light posts yes
01:44:20 thank you guys.
01:44:26 The villain versus pretty cool that guy hey that guy gig a gig
01:44:30 a chat or whatever his name is got some Kirby crackle coming
01:44:33 out of his head I mean that's oh yeah I'm a fucking I'm a
01:44:35 fucking sucker I'm a simp for the Kirby crackle I'm a big Kirby
01:44:39 simp I I I feel it I feel it oh wait Kirby deserves simps
01:44:47 I think he deserves simps yeah more than stand there I said
01:44:50 it was wait wait I'm him saying that he now is working on
01:44:55 a comic just made me realize something you guys know about
01:44:58 the Eisner's yeah yeah I saw Casey I saw Casey Noak tweeting
01:45:03 about the Eisner's and saying that they suck the other oh they
01:45:08 do but I still want one anyway sure and I think I know how
01:45:13 so apparently like this year that they're like doing these
01:45:16 forms where if you're just working if you just work in the
01:45:19 comic book industry you just fill it out and then they'll
01:45:22 send you like some sort of like email where like you get to
01:45:25 vote on who wins but and then and and the thing is that it's
01:45:28 just like an open link like anyone could get the link and I
01:45:32 applied for it because I like technically self published
01:45:35 something right and I'm seeing I'm seeing if maybe if that
01:45:39 allows me to be able to vote which makes me think like
01:45:42 maybe I could rig the Eisner's or like one of my things to
01:45:47 that's what I'm hoping because like it may be because what's
01:45:49 like exact like this because it's like what what what are the
01:45:52 qualifications do I have to have worked in the big two or just
01:45:57 like those indie stuff count if I indie and like relevant enough
01:46:00 that's fine because there's like so many people who don't work
01:46:03 or Marvel and DC who who are like mostly indie guys and
01:46:06 they're getting like Eisner's even people who do like web
01:46:09 comics you know like they get Eisner's too so it's like you
01:46:13 have to just like make a comic to get an Eisner so I'm thinking
01:46:17 because I'm pretty soon in the next couple of months I'm
01:46:20 doing this one podcast with like my other with other like
01:46:23 friends who also make comics and we're going to really push
01:46:26 like our audience to make comics and I'm thinking like if I
01:46:28 get enough of my audience to have published a comic in a way
01:46:32 maybe I could get them to sign up to do Eisner voting and then
01:46:36 like rig it so I win.
01:46:38 That's my and if you can swing it. Yeah, that's swing it.
01:46:43 What do you say?
01:46:45 She said Casey Noak said God the Eisner's are stupid congrats
01:46:48 to the four or five people who deserve it and dumb grats to
01:46:51 Craig Thompson and the rest of the mediocre dipshits.
01:46:55 I don't know who Craig Thompson that sounds very aggressive
01:46:59 is your is your your comics Gator.
01:47:03 Oh, I know what you're talking about.
01:47:05 I have no clue.
01:47:07 Craig Thompson's graphic novelist best.
01:47:09 Oh, I've heard of some of these ways.
01:47:12 Is he like a groomer or something?
01:47:15 I couldn't tell you because like every other like graphic
01:47:18 novel motherfucker turns out to be like some sort of groomer
01:47:21 creep.
01:47:24 Just he made he made blankets.
01:47:26 I think I've heard of blankets blankets covers familiar.
01:47:29 I think I've seen it in stores.
01:47:31 Wait, I think I own.
01:47:34 No, wait, Trixie loaned me that book.

01:47:44 I think you should read more Daniel Klaus.
01:47:49 Yeah.
01:47:53 Yeah.
01:47:53 Yeah.
01:47:54 Okay.
01:47:54 All right.
01:47:55 Next voicemail is called next voicemail is called

01:48:04 Okay.
01:48:04 Three, two, one, go.
01:48:08 All right.

01:48:59 Uh, thank you.
01:49:01 Donate to patreon.com slash been saying.
01:49:06 Yeah, you said it.

01:49:09 He said he said the line.
01:49:10 He said it more voicemails like this.
01:49:12 Please voice grail voice grail voice grail.
01:49:15 Hmm.
01:49:16 Hmm.
01:49:16 No, I don't know.
01:49:18 I don't got a fucking vote in that.
01:49:20 No, I'm just I'm just I could I could if I wanted to just
01:49:25 voice grail this person on my own, but I would feel wrong.
01:49:28 I'm just I would feel wrong.
01:49:30 I'm just fan favorite reoccurring guest cheesy Manfredo.
01:49:32 I have no say in the grail or not.
01:49:35 True.
01:49:37 Okay.
01:49:38 Next voicemail is called grill ish three two one go.
01:49:45 Then why don't you like the dick show?
01:49:47 Give what are your thoughts?
01:49:49 Why don't I like the dick show?
01:49:52 Well, I don't.
01:49:55 Go on.
01:49:56 He's annoying.
01:49:57 He is annoying.
01:50:00 He's yeah, he's annoying.
01:50:01 It's I I don't know.
01:50:03 I think like, like, look, don't get me wrong.
01:50:06 Cheesy Manfredo loves a good misogynistic joke here and there.
01:50:10 Right.
01:50:10 But I think I think Dick's whole bit is like incredibly like overplayed at
01:50:17 this point.
01:50:17 What I don't.
01:50:18 What even is his bit?
01:50:19 Does he even do any bits?
01:50:21 Like I don't even think anything is a bit.
01:50:22 I the thing is like all of his fans like think he's all of his fans think
01:50:26 he's a fucking genius and that he doesn't really he doesn't believe
01:50:29 in anything he said, but he's been saying the same shit for like years.
01:50:32 Now he's he's he's like.
01:50:35 Remember that time Tim Poole was like from now on.
01:50:38 I'm just going to say random shit all the time.
01:50:40 So no one knows what I really think about anything.
01:50:43 Dick is like that, but he didn't actually say it.
01:50:45 All his fans just assumed it for him.
01:50:49 Yeah, it's so weird.
01:50:50 Like, oh my God, what's this?
01:50:51 Like is Dick is Dick a genius?
01:50:55 Like I don't see it.
01:50:56 It's so Dick is a someone's responded to me on Twitter the other day and they
01:51:01 said the thing like Dick being a gene like the idea that Dick is smart
01:51:06 probably came from the fact that he was on biggest problem and Maddox is so
01:51:11 dumb and Dick looks so smart in comparison.
01:51:14 Oh my God, like Dick seemed like a genius at the time because he because he
01:51:18 clowned on this on this idiot.
01:51:21 This idiot this idiot that people used to respect.
01:51:24 He clowned on him really hard.
01:51:25 He made him look like a fool and then he fucking bounced off of that and he
01:51:29 got a bunch of clout over it and he made a bunch of money and it's like,
01:51:33 yeah, he sure did.
01:51:35 He that sure was a that sure was he sure was a dude posting a W right
01:51:39 there.
01:51:40 He is the embodiment of dude posting the W.
01:51:42 Am I right gamers?
01:51:43 But what is that really?
01:51:44 What does that really say about him other than the fact that Maddox is an idiot?
01:51:48 Nothing.
01:51:49 No, I find these content creators who like capitalize on comment wars about
01:51:56 the dumb shit.
01:51:57 They say very interesting that kind of is that kind of is the the the cycle.
01:52:03 Right.
01:52:04 It's like say say something say something that will annoy people and then and
01:52:10 then make sort of a public spectacle about like, you know, responding to or
01:52:15 or, you know, doubling down on or or even apologizing.
01:52:19 You can play it any number of ways.
01:52:21 But the way you get clout is you say something that annoys a lot of people
01:52:24 and then you make a big show about responding to the outrage.
01:52:27 And I mean, that's all he does.
01:52:29 That's all that's all veto does.
01:52:30 That's all anyone around the people who defended you at the start
01:52:34 will just stick around.
01:52:36 Yeah, right.
01:52:36 They'll never change their mind.
01:52:38 So do you guys remember when you guys know the game, Yic right?
01:52:44 10 out of 10 game.
01:52:45 Oh, the Y2K the postmodern the postmodern RPG.
01:52:49 Right.
01:52:50 Exactly.
01:52:50 You know, like that guy was like that guy is like a fan of the Dick show
01:52:54 and he even put Dick in Andrew Allinson.
01:52:57 He put Dick in the game.
01:52:58 Yeah.
01:52:58 Dick's in the game.
01:52:59 You could meet him and I think he has like voice over lines too.
01:53:02 And he gives you a red pill.
01:53:03 No, no, no wonder.
01:53:05 No wonder that game came out so good.
01:53:06 No wonder it was so epic.
01:53:08 I mean, the thing is that I think like it's funny because the whole game is
01:53:11 about kind of like about this like straight white guy like kind of
01:53:14 reflecting on his character, right?
01:53:17 But the game like the game does like a terrible job of doing that.
01:53:20 And I think I think evidence of the fact that maybe this guy could
01:53:23 never truly reflect on being like a straight white guy is due to the fact
01:53:29 that he's like a Dick show fan.
01:53:30 Like I think that's like evidence that he probably could not do this
01:53:34 like introspective on himself, you know.
01:53:36 I mean, yeah, it's it's it fits.
01:53:43 It fits my it fits my my serial killer like forensic profile
01:53:48 style understanding of like the listener of the to the Dick show.
01:53:52 Oh, yeah.
01:53:53 Yeah, I do that too.
01:53:56 I feel like I think at some point I thought that Dick Masterson
01:53:59 or the Dick show seemed like Jordan Peterson, but for people who don't
01:54:03 think they need to improve.
01:54:06 Like like if you if you're like, oh, man, I'm all fucked up.
01:54:11 You know, oh, my I got to get back to my traditional values and sort
01:54:14 my life out.
01:54:15 Then you go to Jordan.
01:54:17 But if you're like, I'm gonna I'm fine.
01:54:20 You know, it's just fucked up.
01:54:21 But like I'm kind of above it.
01:54:23 I don't care any.
01:54:24 I don't care that it's fucked up.
01:54:25 Like I actually kind of like that.
01:54:27 Then you're like then you go to listen to the Dick show instead, which way
01:54:31 Western man obviously just women are just terrible.
01:54:34 Like on ironically, well, I mean, either way.
01:54:37 Yeah, either way.
01:54:38 Obviously, we can all agree on that as we unify this brings us brings us
01:54:44 together.
01:54:45 Yeah.
01:54:45 Anyway, sometimes dicks have some funny stuff.
01:54:47 That's about it.
01:54:49 I have I have laughed at a few.
01:54:51 I mean, I thought that I thought the biggest problem was pretty funny,
01:54:54 but I just don't think he seems like a very good guy.
01:54:56 I don't think he's a good person.
01:54:58 I don't I don't agree with anything he does.
01:55:01 I just yeah, I think he's I think he's garbage.
01:55:05 Yeah, garbage funny guy.
01:55:06 But I mean, and I mean, and I mean the the the the Maddox thing was funny
01:55:11 back in the day, but that was like six years ago.
01:55:14 And yeah, I know that like Maddox Maddox brought the lawsuit against them
01:55:17 and that was pretty shitty.
01:55:19 And like, okay, yeah.
01:55:21 Still like that's the thing.
01:55:23 And like who who cares anymore?
01:55:26 In my opinion, I hope that answers your question.
01:55:30 Anyway, yeah, what?
01:55:32 Yeah, Dick Masters in front of the show.
01:55:34 A great guy.
01:55:35 Ten of ten.
01:55:36 He come on some time.
01:55:38 Hey, buddy.
01:55:39 Next.
01:55:40 We should have you we should have you and him on to debate.
01:55:43 Oh, you should debate.
01:55:45 You should debate whether or not someone who makes the better argument
01:55:49 wins or someone who's right wins the argument.
01:55:53 Oh, yeah, I got this.
01:55:54 I got this in the bag.
01:55:55 I got this and I have to like prove it.
01:55:57 I didn't have to prove that I'm right.
01:55:58 I got in the bag.
01:56:00 You just you just have to be right.
01:56:01 And then you win automatically.
01:56:03 If you're right.
01:56:03 Yeah, exactly.
01:56:05 Next voicemail is called Benjamin St.
01:56:08 Jimman three, two, one, go.
01:56:12 I mean, I am I hold my anime stuff in like a box for a while.
01:56:18 And I'm trying to set up my room and I I I wanted to put up my serial experiments
01:56:24 lane wall scroll.
01:56:26 Don't do that.
01:56:27 And I noticed I can't find it.
01:56:29 Oh, I think I think Ben St.
01:56:32 took my scroll.
01:56:33 So I think I'm going to make 20 more voicemails about this.
01:56:38 I think it would make a thousand more voicemails about this to become a new character.
01:56:42 I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like the Samurai guy.
01:56:45 I'm going to be like the Samurai guy.
01:56:47 I would be like, I'm going to be PCP famous and I don't want to fuck me.
01:56:52 I was like a fucking.
01:56:53 Oh, my God, imagine wanting to be PCP famous.
01:56:59 Typical, typical PCP listener right there.
01:57:03 That's what they're all thinking.
01:57:05 Average PCP fan, average dick show enjoyer.
01:57:09 Am I right, guys?
01:57:10 If like, you know, yeah.
01:57:12 You know how, you know, like ever you see that you see the Amogus everywhere.
01:57:17 Well, if you listen to the PCP everywhere you look, everything looks like a scroll
01:57:21 and you think like, how can I pretend that Ben stole this from me?
01:57:28 Why? Yeah.
01:57:29 This might be a dumb question, but why a squirrel?
01:57:33 I don't know.
01:57:35 Is it just because he's the first one?
01:57:37 The original just picked the scroll and that's it.
01:57:39 Yeah, that's the sort of thing you would steal.
01:57:43 I asked Cassidy or Cassidy said something to me about this one
01:57:48 and because I was like why a scroll and she she said that like I said something
01:57:53 about a scroll like I responded to the samurai off the top of my head.
01:57:57 Just like something about a sacred samurai scroll.
01:58:01 So like I apparently I came up with it.
01:58:04 So it's my fault that it's weird.
01:58:06 They're trying to gaslight you and to believe in you came up with the with the scroll.
01:58:10 I probably that's probably true.
01:58:13 It's they use the Shadow Clone Kagi Bunshin Jutsu to deceive me.
01:58:21 Okay.
01:58:22 Next voicemail is called my toe hurts my broken toe hurts and it's making me upset.
01:58:30 That's a weird name for now.
01:58:31 That's right.
01:58:32 Henlo Corgo five voicemail grail and jail three, two, one go.
01:58:38 So I finally checked out that Google doc of the voicemail grail and jail and I mean
01:58:45 if I suppose if there is an easier way to listen to these, you'll mention it when you
01:58:49 respond to this in the next episode.
01:58:51 But I really want to check those out and find out why they're both in the grail or the
01:58:56 jail and I can't really find an easy way to do that besides listening to every fucking
01:59:01 episode of the show.
01:59:02 So if you could make it slightly easier to track those down and listen to them, much
01:59:07 appreciated.
01:59:09 I'm not going to do that.
01:59:12 I'm not going to go back through all the episodes and keep track of who got grailed
01:59:17 when Ben doesn't get good luck to fucking do.
01:59:21 I don't get paid and I don't get paid enough to do that.
01:59:24 Yeah, I'm sorry.
01:59:25 Like that sounds like a fan thing to do.
01:59:26 You know, fans love to go back and like count maybe maybe maybe spiral.
01:59:31 A spiral is going through them anyway.
01:59:33 I don't think he's he's probably well before the point where voicemails even started.
01:59:37 So maybe out of the kindness of his heart, he might be willing to take down some notes
01:59:42 on when people get grailed as he completes his coveted n word tally.
01:59:50 Once he gets the n word trophy, he's going to get the grail trophy.
01:59:53 That's right.
01:59:55 They're one in the same.
01:59:57 Yeah, next voicemail is called sorry.
02:00:00 I didn't put it here in time.
02:00:02 It is called wait.
02:00:05 No, sorry.
02:00:05 Listen to the one that's called three two nine five.
02:00:08 That one is called hi Ben three two one go.
02:00:13 Hey, what's up guys?
02:00:14 So for the last decade of my life, I've been reading the secret pretty constantly
02:00:18 and I think I willed into the universe.
02:00:21 The inevitable crossover between my two favorite podcasts.
02:00:25 That being the procrastinators podcast.
02:00:28 That's me as well as a podcast called let me tell you about.
02:00:33 So I started willing this into the universe around 2017, 2018.
02:00:38 Is he peeing?
02:00:38 And slowly but surely, I think he's peeing through sheer power of will.
02:00:43 Yeah, that's me.
02:00:44 All right.
02:00:44 So let me tell you about has now crossed over into the loudest podcast,
02:00:49 which is loosely affiliated with you guys through Trixie and The Dick Show.
02:00:54 And I'm I'm supposed to be on Chris Dery.
02:00:58 So by the way, I've been supposed to be going to cross over.
02:01:04 So why not go ahead and make it happen now?
02:01:06 It's a lot less willpower on me and my spiritual chakras.
02:01:11 And I mean, I got both.
02:01:13 I got into both of your podcasts around the same time trying to look for a way
02:01:19 to introduce normies into Chris Chan.
02:01:21 So I feel like you guys have a lot to talk about.
02:01:25 Yeah, yeah.
02:01:26 So yeah, make it happen.
02:01:27 All all the stereos or Sriracha needs to do is just message me because they
02:01:32 long, long ago, they said, Ben, you should be on an episode of Chris Dery.
02:01:36 And I said, sure, of course.
02:01:39 And since then, it's come up.
02:01:42 They've said like, yeah, we're going to do that.
02:01:43 You're all they have to do is ask all they have to do is ask.
02:01:47 I'm down.
02:01:48 I don't know if a crossover would work because I actually have seen.
02:01:53 I used to watch.
02:01:54 Let me tell you about whenever they would talk about a topic I was interested
02:01:59 in and basically the premise is that one guy just tells us co-hosts all about
02:02:03 a topic, right?
02:02:04 Yeah, I've seen the I've seen it around.
02:02:08 I've never listened to one.
02:02:09 And I forget his name.
02:02:10 I think his name is Ted or tab.
02:02:14 Oh, dude, I'm sorry.
02:02:15 I forgot this guy's name.
02:02:16 But he's he seems like a cool guy.
02:02:17 He's been on the he's been on the Laos podcast a couple of times.
02:02:22 I mean, I mean, I could see Ben and him being on the podcast together
02:02:25 because sometimes like a stereo likes to get little group chats together for bits.
02:02:30 But I don't know.
02:02:31 I don't know how like connected Ben is to a stereo's.
02:02:37 You ever listen to like my little podcast that I did with a stereo's?
02:02:43 No, it's something I notice about a stereo's that like
02:02:48 in retrospect should have been obvious is that like, you know, you've been
02:02:52 on a podcast before you talk to people and then you you'll pause to let like
02:02:56 the other person say something after you like say after you say something,
02:02:59 you let someone you pause and you let that person react, right?
02:03:03 Yeah, right.
02:03:04 Like for some reason, I would pause for a stereo's to react to something I said
02:03:08 and he would not say anything.
02:03:10 It was just kind of stay silent and I just I guess I just got to keep talking.
02:03:14 I just kept on talking because they didn't want there to be dead air.
02:03:17 And then I realized something comfortable.
02:03:20 Yeah.
02:03:20 Yeah.
02:03:21 It felt weird.
02:03:21 I don't even know if a stereo's realizes this, but um, but then I realized something.
02:03:26 I realized something that a stereo's only talks after you explain something
02:03:30 very long to him.
02:03:32 And that should have been obvious weird.
02:03:34 And that should have been obvious because on the loudest podcast,
02:03:36 all that is is Sriracha explaining stuff to him.
02:03:40 That's it.
02:03:42 Wow.
02:03:43 Okay.
02:03:44 Yeah.
02:03:44 I mean, that's the vibe I got.
02:03:46 I don't know if you talk to him and things just feel different.
02:03:50 Maybe I'm maybe I'm the weird.
02:03:51 I've never I've never I've never I've never like talked to him with my voice.
02:03:56 I've like, we've like tweeted at each other a little bit.
02:04:02 It's someone asked the stereo's why he's so weird like that.
02:04:05 Um, he's probably just because he's a boomer.
02:04:08 Probably because he's a boomer or maybe I'm the one next voicemail is called
02:04:13 Hi Ben two, three, two, one, go.
02:04:17 Sorry, I forgot to flush.
02:04:19 Yes.
02:04:21 Good, good man.
02:04:23 Never forget to flush.
02:04:24 That's a that's a W.
02:04:25 That's a dude posted his W.
02:04:26 That dude posted his W right there.
02:04:29 That's a blistered mail grill.
02:04:31 That was a good, that was a good, that was a good bit.
02:04:33 I'm like the inferior, um, like metal was called metalhead pig.
02:04:39 The one I just interrupt.
02:04:39 Yeah.
02:04:40 We can all agree that the interrupting pig is a bit that was just basically
02:04:46 just doomed to be bad just by its very, just by its very conception.
02:04:52 Just the very idea behind is just rotten to the core.
02:04:54 Has any like interruption joke ever been like funny?
02:04:58 Maybe.
02:05:00 But not this time.
02:05:01 Next one is called two five, two five, two, three, two, one, go.
02:05:08 Which radcon was the best?
02:05:10 Hmm.
02:05:14 Um, I, uh, I'm going to say three.
02:05:19 That I'm going to say three, four.
02:05:22 No, four was the last one.
02:05:23 You fucking dingus.
02:05:24 Yeah, I don't watch radcon.
02:05:28 For, I mean, four was fun, but we've said this before four was really busy.
02:05:34 Like we were like on all of radcon for we had like every day we had to wake up
02:05:40 and we're like, okay, we're going to film this.
02:05:41 Okay, we're going to, we're going to work on this.
02:05:43 We're going to make that we're going to stream that we got to get ready
02:05:45 for such and such.
02:05:47 Um, so like it was in terms of which one I think I enjoyed three more
02:05:52 because we didn't have as much to do.
02:05:55 We didn't have as much like in mind of like, okay, these are the things
02:06:00 we're going to make while we're here.
02:06:01 We were just kind of like, we'll get together and we'll just make a bunch
02:06:05 of shit and whatever we want to do.
02:06:07 So it was more relaxed like that.
02:06:08 So I would say right on three.
02:06:10 Um, I mean, I guess we had the arena, but that was like, you know, that was
02:06:15 so we recorded that in one day, uh, the, the OVA and stuff took like several
02:06:20 days, uh, including the Brad lecture, which is out now on the channel and
02:06:27 more stuff related to that will be coming soon.
02:06:30 I think more rad content.
02:06:33 Close to being ready to come out the pipeline.
02:06:38 Lamar base.
02:06:40 Um, base.
02:06:42 Okay.
02:06:43 Next voicemail is called Riley singing.
02:06:46 Add the backing track.
02:06:48 Ellie is our earn your keep.
02:06:50 Okay.
02:06:51 Three, two, one go.
02:06:55 Hey, what's up?
02:06:56 Fuckers.
02:06:57 It's me, Riley.
02:06:58 The busy.
02:06:59 This is definitely do it.
02:07:00 Gazing.
02:07:01 And I thought that was had peaks up for a second.
02:07:03 Have a clear reference point for my beautiful singing voice.
02:07:08 Three, two, one.
02:07:09 Let's hit it.
02:07:10 My T is gone.
02:07:11 Call the boy ring.
02:07:12 Why I got out of bed at all.
02:07:16 The morning rain clouds up my window.
02:07:19 Yeah.
02:07:20 Can't see it all.
02:07:22 Amen.
02:07:22 If I could.
02:07:24 Put your picture on my wall.
02:07:28 It reminds me.
02:07:30 It's not so bad.
02:07:32 It's not so bad being me.
02:07:35 Riley.
02:07:36 I know this is do it.
02:07:38 Do it.
02:07:38 Gazers because do do it.
02:07:40 Gazers particular quirk is that his Riley impression sounds like a cold
02:07:44 Corona impression.
02:07:46 Oh my God.
02:07:47 No wonder.
02:07:48 Trixie.
02:07:51 They right.
02:07:53 Yeah.
02:07:54 Magnet magnetized.
02:07:56 Yeah.
02:07:57 Yeah.
02:07:58 I thought I thought he was going to go into the the rapping bit from the
02:08:04 what's the name of the song that samples.
02:08:06 It's Stan Stan.
02:08:08 Yeah.
02:08:08 Stan like dear Trixie.
02:08:10 So just so and so.
02:08:11 So I can't do it right now.
02:08:13 I don't know what the lyrics.
02:08:14 That would be you could probably make a pretty good a pretty good Stan
02:08:19 you could probably make a better one than Riley's a weird like parody
02:08:26 discord.
02:08:28 You might not have.
02:08:29 Did you hear did you hear that last episode?
02:08:31 I did not.
02:08:31 Yeah.
02:08:32 I don't think I got that that far.
02:08:34 But what is it?
02:08:35 It's it's hold on.
02:08:38 The procrastinators podcast.
02:08:40 Yeah.
02:08:40 Someone someone submitted a voicemail that is a clip of Riley singing a very
02:08:46 slightly altered lyrical version of the discord song discord.
02:08:50 I'm howling at the moon.
02:08:52 Oh yeah.
02:08:52 I got to that part.
02:08:53 Yeah.
02:08:54 Okay.
02:08:54 Well, it's real.
02:08:56 Oh shit.
02:08:57 Someone who who posted it.
02:09:01 I'm going through the comments.
02:09:04 Neckbeard bananas in the comments last time posted a here it is too.
02:09:09 I'll we don't have to listen to it, but it's a real fucking thing.
02:09:14 It's like a him and some guy I've never heard of called a hazen cruise and the
02:09:19 joke of the song is like that someone is like talking shit or like trying to
02:09:26 cancel this guy hazen cruise and they're doing it by posting screenshots on discord.
02:09:32 And so the song is like ha discord is the villain because that's where
02:09:36 they're trying to cancel hazen whatever.
02:09:39 The point is just that it Riley sounds really bad.
02:09:41 Riley's voice just sounds really bad on this track and it's very fun.
02:09:45 I mean, so we thought it was fake.
02:09:48 We discussed it last time and we both me and give fight.
02:09:52 I'd be like, this would be really funny if it was real, but no, I can't be real.
02:09:55 No, this sounds weird.
02:09:56 No, that doesn't sound right.
02:09:57 I think it's fake.
02:09:58 It's real.
02:09:58 It's real in case anyone was still wondering.
02:10:02 It is amazing.
02:10:03 It is.
02:10:04 It is amazing.
02:10:05 It's a pretty good find.
02:10:06 It's pretty good find.
02:10:08 A pretty good archaeological discovery.
02:10:12 We need to describe what the topic of the song was.
02:10:14 I'm like, yeah, that sounds like what a dick show would like talk about.
02:10:20 That sounds like their priority.
02:10:22 Yeah, I mean, they're trying to cancel.
02:10:25 They're trying to cancel my boy hazen cruise.
02:10:28 We got to record a we got to record a fucking parody brony
02:10:32 diss track at them to shut up the haters.
02:10:37 Yeah.
02:10:39 Hello, this is Ben from the future with a with an urgent urgent alert.
02:10:45 Red alert.
02:10:46 Red alert.
02:10:47 The song has been deleted.
02:10:49 The the legendary the the legendary track by a vizier
02:10:56 of yig and the presumably also legendary hazen cruise performing
02:11:02 their relevant Tory hit single discord by the living tombstone.
02:11:08 I think has been deleted in shame.
02:11:12 If anyone has a saved copy, I would love to see it.
02:11:16 If not, then I guess these episodes of the PCP will be the only
02:11:22 place you will ever be able to hear these lost masterpieces that
02:11:30 just wanted to just wanted to keep you updated.
02:11:33 Okay, back to the episode.
02:11:36 Next, next voice.
02:11:38 Next voice.
02:11:38 Now listen to 3299.
02:11:42 Oh, sorry.
02:11:43 Yeah, you're right.
02:11:44 Yeah, listen to 3299 is called High Ben three three two one go.
02:11:52 Hey, what's up, Ben?
02:11:54 What's next after 102 and slime and punishment?
02:11:58 The game, the webcomic, the game.
02:12:01 Yeah.
02:12:02 Inquiring minds would like to know.
02:12:04 I think baby you want to say anything?
02:12:14 What the fuck?
02:12:15 Um, okay, uh, after, uh, yeah, after I finished the game and slime and
02:12:22 punishment, I think the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go back
02:12:26 and I want to finish Beast Capades because Beast Capades had an ending.
02:12:31 I knew exactly what the ending was going to be and I can just finish it.
02:12:37 It might take me a little while, but I know how it ends.
02:12:40 So I just have to do it because because when I have an idea.
02:12:45 When I have something that I want to make or an idea for a thing that I
02:12:48 could make, it is a demon inside of me and it torments me until I can
02:12:53 manifest it into the world and put it out there.
02:12:57 And the demon of Beast Capades is still inside me.
02:13:00 It has been tormenting me this entire time.
02:13:02 Uh, so it'll be the easiest.
02:13:03 It'll be the easiest one to exercise.
02:13:06 Uh, once, once I get this slime demon out once he's gone.
02:13:11 Uh, that's, that's the plan anyway.
02:13:14 Okay, next one is called Mark Fisher is what?
02:13:17 Huh?
02:13:18 What?
02:13:18 Huh?
02:13:18 Yes, something to say.
02:13:19 I was going to make a con joke, but we could keep on going.
02:13:23 Okay.
02:13:24 Next one is called Mark Fisher is dope.
02:13:25 Three, two, one, go.
02:13:28 Been talked about Tim Rogers recently and as I have an unhealthy
02:13:31 parasocial relationship with the fellow, I'll shut some contacts for the
02:13:34 second time I'll speed myself up.
02:13:36 You can piece the story together by watching his stuff as it's a mixture
02:13:37 of personal anecdotes and game analysis.
02:13:39 This is what I've pieced together.
02:13:40 He lived in Japan for a decade, working out a few large companies before he
02:13:42 lost his reason how to leave his friend to go back to America.
02:13:44 He worked in various shitty games.
02:13:45 I think that's self-amended and notably, notably no more heroes.
02:13:47 He did stuff in America for a while, then got a job making video content
02:13:49 for Kotaku.
02:13:50 This enlarged how many people knew about him.
02:13:51 He's been writing on action button net for over 20 years now, but
02:13:53 games highly recommend his written f of six review called how and why I
02:13:56 never finished becoming a detective.
02:13:57 Anyway, when he left Kotaku, he announced he was going to start making
02:13:59 his own videos and the wide reach of a large corporation ended up with
02:14:01 him having a huge Patreon.
02:14:02 But really, there's no one like him that I've found.
02:14:04 There's so much overlap between his videos.
02:14:05 He has an interesting writing style and little things that you'll pick up
02:14:07 if you pay attention.
02:14:08 Spoilers for his f of seven and toky make a video in the middle of toky make
02:14:11 he goes off and attention about his best friend in Japan.
02:14:12 Tim often uses friend when referring to his girlfriend and how they
02:14:14 chatted every week until he says a date and then cuts himself off before
02:14:17 going back to the analysis, implying that something happened.
02:14:20 And the end of his f of seven series.
02:14:21 He explains quickly why it's important to him and how it overlaps
02:14:24 with his best friend who died.
02:14:25 I'm pretty sure they're the same person.
02:14:26 It gave me chills when I connected it and it still does.
02:14:29 Anyway, cool guy.
02:14:30 Interesting.
02:14:30 Oh my God.
02:14:31 He knew a guy.
02:14:32 He knew someone that killed himself.
02:14:34 Oh my God.
02:14:36 That blows my fucking mind.
02:14:38 So hard to shit, dude.
02:14:40 Oh my God.
02:14:41 It's a twist ending kind of based.
02:14:46 I mean, it's a good series.
02:14:48 I watched the final fantasy seven series.
02:14:50 It's a good series.
02:14:51 Yeah, it ends with spoilers.
02:14:53 It ends with kind of the twist that he's been talking about this friend
02:14:55 every once in a while.
02:14:57 In the end, he reveals like, yes, she killed herself later.
02:15:00 And it's like, oh, that's sad.
02:15:03 He annoyed me.
02:15:04 He annoyed me in one of, not in that video, in a different video.
02:15:09 Someone, I think it was about the, the, it was either the action
02:15:12 button review of the final fantasy seven remake or it was the Kotaku
02:15:16 pre-review of the final fantasy seven remake.
02:15:18 He says that people have been asking him if he's going to make a
02:15:23 like slow translation video series about the remake like he did
02:15:27 with the original.
02:15:28 And he says no.
02:15:29 And then he says like, and by the way, the final fantasy seven
02:15:32 video wasn't about making fun of a bad translation.
02:15:36 It was about, you know, going back to a work and having like new
02:15:40 perspective on it later in life.
02:15:43 And if you think it was about, you know, making fun of a bad
02:15:47 translation, I don't know how to help you.
02:15:49 He says that he says it in a way that's very much like, if you
02:15:52 think that's what it's about, you're wrong and you're stupid.
02:15:55 And I think that he's an idiot because it is about the thing that
02:15:59 he said it is about going back to final fantasy seven and having
02:16:03 a new perspective on it from gained life experience, but it is
02:16:06 also definitely to some extent about pointing out funny bad
02:16:11 translations and having a good time doing so.
02:16:14 It definitely is.
02:16:16 It's about fucking both.
02:16:17 You fucking, you fucking dweeb.
02:16:19 That was a real, that was a real pretentious moment.
02:16:22 That was a real, that was a real Jesse moment right there.
02:16:25 I didn't like it.
02:16:25 Real Jesse moment.
02:16:27 That was a real Jesse moment.
02:16:30 Real Jesse.
02:16:32 Here's my, here's my, here's my, here's my Tim, my Tim
02:16:36 Rogers impression.
02:16:39 That's why Tokimeki Memorial objectifies love and makes you
02:16:45 a fucking demon for playing and that's the bottom line.
02:16:50 And I would know.
02:16:51 I mean, I had six pack abs in high school.
02:16:55 I ran a five minute mile.
02:16:58 That's, that's, that's Tim.
02:17:00 Oh my God.
02:17:01 Um, we should get Tim on the show.
02:17:05 We should get Tim on the show.
02:17:06 Um,
02:17:08 Tim, come on down, buddy.
02:17:09 There's a, people, people have, people, Tim says weird stuff
02:17:13 about himself and I don't know.
02:17:15 He, he says, he sometimes will talk about like the memory thing.
02:17:19 He claims to have like a memory condition that makes him remember
02:17:22 everything all the time.
02:17:23 And I don't think that's real.
02:17:25 Oh, like Dr.
02:17:25 That sounds like some, that sounds like some Chunebio,
02:17:28 like, um, Alexandria's Genesis, like, like fake disability stuff.
02:17:33 I don't know.
02:17:35 I know that like, idetic memory is a thing, but that sounds fake.
02:17:38 How does he remember things all the time?
02:17:42 I don't know.
02:17:43 Like, just kidding.
02:17:44 Just, just have perfect memory is other words.
02:17:49 I don't know.
02:17:50 Just sometimes, sometimes he claims to have a, I haven't read
02:17:54 that Final Fantasy six essay.
02:17:56 I should, I should find it because he mentions it in, um,
02:18:00 I think it's the Final Fantasy seven remake review.
02:18:03 I think I haven't seen it yet.
02:18:05 Uh, he, he obviously doesn't remember everything because in
02:18:10 the video where he remember, he recollects game box art covers
02:18:14 from memory, he doesn't get everyone exactly right.
02:18:17 He's pretty good at a lot of them, but he definitely doesn't
02:18:20 get all of them right.
02:18:21 So his memory is not perfect.
02:18:23 And like, what, what does it even mean to like remember everything?
02:18:27 Also, apparently he's a Mensa member, which is not impressed
02:18:29 me.
02:18:30 That just makes me think he's a dweeb, uh, being, being, being
02:18:34 in Mensa's lame.
02:18:34 It's not cool.
02:18:35 What does it even mean?
02:18:37 I don't think he has perfect memory.
02:18:39 He, um, he didn't make a video talking about memory 9-11.
02:18:45 He forgot.
02:18:45 He forgot.
02:18:46 He forgot.
02:18:47 I forgot.
02:18:47 I'm like 9-11 is crazy.
02:18:50 Whatever.
02:18:50 He's his videos are kind of good.
02:18:53 I guess I like them.
02:18:54 I guess at the end of the day, he's like, he's my class enemy.
02:18:57 He's like, he has, he, him and he has more in common with Vito
02:19:00 guess Walde than he has with me.
02:19:02 He doesn't, he lacks solidarity.
02:19:04 He's my fucking enemy.
02:19:05 He's a class trader.
02:19:06 I will behead him.
02:19:08 Given half the chance.
02:19:09 Um, that's what I'm, that's what I'm saying.
02:19:13 That's the PCP is pro guillotine proitarian podcast.
02:19:20 Prolet, the, that, the P, the, that would be the PTP.
02:19:24 No, no.
02:19:25 Yeah.
02:19:25 Change to the PTP.
02:19:28 Next voicemail is called lesbian.
02:19:32 Three, two, one.
02:19:35 I'm going to read it.
02:19:35 I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to announce these like Tim
02:19:37 Ryder's now three, two, one go.
02:19:41 Hey guys, I'm at work.
02:19:43 I just thought about this since when is Trixie been into dudes?
02:19:47 I just realized she's dating Riley, but I've seen like she's not dating
02:19:51 Riley video ever.
02:19:52 Nobody can keep it straight.
02:19:54 And she's always been like super into lesbianism and you know, like only
02:19:59 watched lesbian porn and like all that stuff.
02:20:01 How the hell does that happen?
02:20:03 Uh, yeah, it's true.
02:20:07 It's true that now she likes guys, I guess.
02:20:11 I don't, I mean, I don't know.
02:20:13 It's not, it's not crazy because I don't, I've known a couple of
02:20:16 like, uh, trans ladies who were like kind of explicitly lesbian, but
02:20:22 then dated like guys, which isn't a bad thing.
02:20:26 You know?
02:20:26 So they, so they weren't, so they weren't exclusively lesbian.
02:20:30 Yeah.
02:20:31 I guess maybe they find out they're like bisexual.
02:20:32 I mean, I don't know what Trixie would classify herself.
02:20:37 Who can even say who even fucking knows whatever people, people's tastes
02:20:41 change.
02:20:42 They change their mind.
02:20:43 They try any things they do, whatever.
02:20:44 I don't know.
02:20:45 How the fuck should I know?
02:20:46 Ask Trixie.
02:20:46 What are you asking me this shit for?
02:20:48 She's got a podcast.
02:20:49 She's got a podcast.
02:20:50 She's, she's.
02:20:51 Yeah.
02:20:51 Ask Colin, Colin to fucking void gazer.
02:20:53 I'm sorry.
02:20:54 I'm, I'm, I'm being mean.
02:20:56 I don't mean to be mean to this person, but I genuinely have no clue and I
02:20:59 don't know why you would think I would know.
02:21:00 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to get into another void gazer live show.
02:21:05 Maybe.
02:21:06 Yes, please.
02:21:10 Next, next voicemail is called, um, it's, it's the three three zero two.
02:21:15 It's called Lord of ghosts, fake, angry face.
02:21:18 Three, two, one, go.
02:21:21 Wait, so the Lord of ghosts isn't an actual ghost?
02:21:26 I know.
02:21:27 Why the fuck is it called Lord of ghosts?
02:21:30 My God.
02:21:31 That's like calling yourself the Lord of marine life.
02:21:34 If you're not actually a goddamn aquatic creature.
02:21:38 It just bundles my mind.
02:21:40 Why?
02:21:40 Why are they fake?
02:21:42 That hurts so fucking much.
02:21:49 Okay.
02:21:49 Uh, you could be.
02:21:53 Well, it's like.
02:21:56 Well, it's like Jesus, right?
02:21:58 Jesus was king of the Jews, but obviously he wasn't a Jew because
02:22:02 he was a Christian and he believed in his own divinity.
02:22:05 So there you go.
02:22:09 That's how it's like,
02:22:11 it's funny because she's not even here to shame and answer this question.
02:22:15 There's, there's, um, I mean, there's so many like kings.
02:22:20 There's so many like kings and royalty that ruled one country that
02:22:23 were from another country.
02:22:24 Like I'm pretty sure several of the Henry's were just like Dutch or something.
02:22:30 I don't know.
02:22:31 This happens all the time.
02:22:32 You can be the Lord of something without being a member of something.
02:22:35 You can just be their Lord.
02:22:37 Um, it's easy.
02:22:38 Easy shit, man.
02:22:39 This is, this is basic.
02:22:42 I think I, I think I recognize this voice, but I'm not 100% sure.
02:22:46 I think it's, I think it's a friend of mine.
02:22:49 Um, God, I hope not.
02:22:50 Yeah, I hope not.
02:22:51 Imagine being friends with this freak.
02:22:53 This guy.
02:22:54 Okay.
02:22:55 Oh, okay.
02:22:56 If it, I think it, I think it is, um, it's, I think it's death alchemist.
02:23:00 We send that voicemail and all I have to say to that voice.
02:23:03 You think so?
02:23:04 I know, I know death alchemists.
02:23:05 I think that sounds like, well, death alchemist.
02:23:08 I talked to him like every other day cause he's very acted in my server.
02:23:12 Um, but that sounded like him.
02:23:15 And all I have to say to his question is that, um, the Batman in the dark night
02:23:19 returns is a fascist death.
02:23:23 He's a fascist.
02:23:24 I'm sorry.
02:23:25 I'm sorry to death.
02:23:25 He is a fucking fascist.
02:23:27 Like he fits the description perfectly.
02:23:30 Bomber.
02:23:31 Yeah.
02:23:31 Bomber.
02:23:32 Then it goes to the next place now.
02:23:33 I'm sorry to hear that.
02:23:35 Yeah.
02:23:35 I'm sorry to hear that I'm right.
02:23:37 Yeah.
02:23:37 You know, I'm sorry to hear that too.
02:23:40 Next voicemail is called, uh, I'm stupid.
02:23:45 Uh, the next voicemail is called influences.
02:23:49 Uh, oh, well, can't wait to listen to it.
02:23:53 Here we go.
02:23:54 Three, two, one, go.
02:23:58 So in regards to influences, I think one thing that I just want to say
02:24:01 is don't pull from the influences that other people want you to pull from.
02:24:03 You got to pull from your door.
02:24:05 This is definitely, no, you're right.
02:24:06 This is that.
02:24:07 Actually based on a robot from Wallace and grommet, like really
02:24:10 Wallace and grommet is connected to undertale.
02:24:13 Like, do you have any idea how weird that sounds?
02:24:16 It doesn't need to be anything big when it comes to your death.
02:24:18 I already told you that.
02:24:19 Oh, we are a serial mascot.
02:24:20 You like my return.
02:24:21 Yes.
02:24:22 I want to put this in my webcomic, put it in your webcomic or just
02:24:25 something you like, even from a YouTube video.
02:24:27 Hmm.
02:24:28 Yes.
02:24:28 I will take this and put it in and make it unique me uniquely my own.
02:24:32 Just, just some food for thought.
02:24:35 I absolutely agree with the sentiment.
02:24:38 And also that's really funny that Mediton was based on the robot
02:24:44 from the wrong trout.
02:24:45 Wait, no, it's not the wrong trout.
02:24:47 It's the one from the.
02:24:50 It's the isn't when they go to the moon.
02:24:53 No, no, no, the one in the wrong trousers.
02:24:55 The villain is like a penguin.
02:24:56 Yeah, I think the one where they go to the moon.
02:24:59 Yeah, the villain is like a it's basically like a refrigerator.
02:25:02 Yeah, the ski is around on the cheese.
02:25:04 Yeah, that's me.
02:25:05 Uh, I totally see it.
02:25:07 It's totally true.
02:25:08 That's so funny.
02:25:09 I never saw that before, but I completely believe it and I like it a lot.
02:25:15 Okay.
02:25:17 Fucking fucking Windows Explorer just like keeps freezing on me
02:25:21 and not letting me click and drag like that's voicemails.
02:25:25 It's fucking late.
02:25:25 By the way, we had it's so late.
02:25:28 We have we don't have that many left.
02:25:30 Okay, no, we got one, two, three, four, five,
02:25:34 six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 34.
02:25:37 We've only got 16 more.
02:25:38 So we're good.
02:25:39 Okay.
02:25:40 That's too many.
02:25:41 I'm leaving.
02:25:43 All right.
02:25:43 I don't forget to read villain or not fucking left.
02:25:46 All right.
02:25:47 By zero zero couldn't take it.
02:25:49 Honestly, honestly, I can't blame him.
02:25:51 Honestly, I can't play have the boys on like us.
02:25:56 The next one is called inmates in the asylum, the sharpest sharpest
02:25:59 swords on the horizon.
02:26:00 I think I know what this is going to sound like.
02:26:03 Three, two, one, go.
02:26:06 Yep.
02:26:07 All of it.
02:26:14 Sharpening a skill to be a giant sword that lies on the horizon.
02:26:19 People head to the intro music doesn't go into the learning
02:26:23 do something brand new.
02:26:27 You're a single drop that amid something huge, a single fluid
02:26:32 motion through the roiling ocean.
02:26:36 Just go with the flow until you know for sure.
02:26:40 You gave it all you got and you can give it some more.
02:26:44 We're inmates in an asylum now.
02:26:48 We'll try again and again until we learn how the intro music,
02:26:57 the pipe organ didn't flow into the poem.
02:27:02 They were like two different things that just cuts off and then
02:27:04 the poem started.
02:27:05 I don't know.
02:27:06 I feel like I feel like it should connect.
02:27:08 I feel like I thought that the poem was supposed to interrupt
02:27:11 the pipe organs.
02:27:13 Well, then what's the point of the organ intro?
02:27:15 I don't know to throw you off.
02:27:18 I feel like I'm not sure.
02:27:20 I don't really like these.
02:27:22 This is the like the bear cyborg guy, right?
02:27:27 Yes, this is this is this is the bear.
02:27:30 I think I think these need to I think these need to shake up
02:27:34 the formula a little bit.
02:27:35 Yeah, a lot of these are kind of starting to sound the same.
02:27:40 Oh, zero says.
02:27:42 A screenshot.
02:27:44 I got a screenshot.
02:27:45 Zero says, ha, ha, canceled on discord.
02:27:48 You're going to post this around all over the place.

02:28:46 It'll be great.
02:28:47 And by the way, Gib, I have a playlist of good YouTube poops.
02:28:50 If you ever want to take a look at it.
02:28:52 Oh, this is typical death.
02:28:53 Always showing his YouTube poop playlist.
02:28:55 He does this in all the other chats.
02:28:58 No, this is not joking.

02:29:00 He does like show his YouTube poop playlist.
02:29:04 Must be very proud of it.
02:29:06 Proud of his poop.
02:29:07 Ben, Ben, please, Ben, please just agree with me.
02:29:10 Please just agree with me that Batman's a fascist in the Dark Knight Returns.
02:29:14 Just say you believe in me.
02:29:16 I haven't seen the Dark Knight Returns.

02:29:27 It's all I needed.
02:29:28 Next one.
02:29:29 Next one is called Japanese learning English, not hentai.
02:29:33 Three, two, one, go.
02:29:36 I have a bad case of diarrhea.
02:29:44 I have a bad case of diarrhea.
02:29:46 I have a bad case of diarrhea.
02:29:48 I have a bad case of diarrhea.
02:29:51 I have a bad case of diarrhea.
02:29:53 Wow.
02:29:54 Wasn't this from like a Jon Tron video?
02:29:56 I don't know.
02:29:59 I remember he made a video.
02:30:01 I think I think he made a video where he watched like Japanese like VHS tapes
02:30:05 or something and I think what this was like one of the bits maybe.
02:30:10 Lame.
02:30:12 Okay.
02:30:13 Next one is called this is a 3307 based to cringe to question mark.
02:30:20 Three, two, one, go.
02:30:23 So Ben, I got to say at first the rad con with you in show was kind of funny.
02:30:28 Then it got really cringe, but now I think it's come back around to being
02:30:32 actually good and funny.
02:30:33 So you got to keep it and for all you bronies out there.
02:30:36 That's the real horseshoe theory.
02:30:39 Oh, also, if Ben is so flanged, why hasn't Eleazar put some flanger on his voice?
02:30:46 Take care.
02:30:46 Tom will never die.
02:30:48 Is a flanger like an audio effect?
02:30:50 I'm the bull.
02:30:52 I don't know anything.

02:31:14 Hey, guys.
02:31:15 So that's what you were talking about when it's okay to accept free work from
02:31:17 people and you specifically mentioned turning down offers of editing episodes of
02:31:21 the PCP are making a website.
02:31:22 Well, I know that's a lot of hot shit because it in a 2019.
02:31:25 I made that exact same offer and you guys welcomed it with open arms.
02:31:29 Now granted, I came to you guys and said that I'd do the work for free, but
02:31:32 not once did any of you resist the idea.
02:31:34 I'll refer any money and that's despite the fact that I paid for a
02:31:37 domain, web server and premium plugins all out of pocket.
02:31:40 Instead, you let me do dozens of hours of unpaid work and then when the site
02:31:44 was 99% completed, you just went silent and ghosted me.
02:31:47 So here I am.
02:31:48 I go to be past telling you to quit spouting that bullshit.
02:31:51 Whoa.
02:31:52 Okay.
02:31:53 Okay.
02:31:54 I believe this.
02:31:55 I believe this could be true.
02:31:58 I don't, uh, I don't know.
02:32:01 This might be true.
02:32:04 I remember.
02:32:06 Okay, but we didn't use the website.
02:32:09 I don't, I don't think because there is because there is because the website
02:32:14 we okay.
02:32:16 The website we ended up using is, um, it's the pro natures.com.
02:32:24 Um, I feel like I didn't talk to this person.
02:32:31 I remember someone offered to make the website.
02:32:36 Oh my God.
02:32:37 Wait a second.
02:32:39 Okay.
02:32:39 This is off topic, but I just typed in the procrastinators.com.
02:32:43 Yeah.
02:32:44 And it's like a country.
02:32:46 It's like a country band.
02:32:48 It's two guys sitting on their porch strumming guitars.
02:32:52 They are they are they called the procrastinators.
02:32:56 Yeah.
02:32:58 The procrastinators.com.
02:33:00 They've got a fucking Texas flag as their logo.
02:33:04 What is their anti PCP?
02:33:10 The procrastinators.
02:33:11 Um, I'm getting as a bunch of clips for the amazing world of the gun ball.
02:33:17 Okay.
02:33:18 Now I don't really remember.
02:33:19 I didn't talk to this person very much.
02:33:20 I knew that someone had offered to make the website.
02:33:25 I don't know what was discussed or with who, but I'm pretty sure we didn't
02:33:32 use the stuff because like you said, no one offered.
02:33:38 No one offered to pay you, but we didn't use what you offered us either.
02:33:42 I mean, I think that's why.
02:33:43 I mean, I don't think that we like took what you were giving us and said
02:33:49 buy.
02:33:51 Uh, I think it was like that.
02:33:54 The Nate will know more about this.
02:33:58 Maybe prop probably.
02:34:02 Adam, Adam on Twitter.
02:34:04 Does even use Twitter now?
02:34:08 Nate tweets once in a once in a long, long while.
02:34:14 I don't know.
02:34:15 Okay.
02:34:15 I'm Michelle at Michelle.
02:34:18 This is on four.
02:34:19 I feel, I feel bad.
02:34:20 I feel bad.
02:34:21 I feel like maybe if we, if we weren't going to use this guy's work, we
02:34:26 probably should have just told him, no, we don't want you to make a website
02:34:30 for us, but maybe we were like, oh, maybe we should.
02:34:33 Maybe you got to financially compensate him for his time.
02:34:37 I don't know about that.
02:34:41 I don't know about that.
02:34:42 He has to, he has to actually prove that, um, he does to happen.
02:34:48 He needs like receipts.
02:34:49 He needs like screenshots.
02:34:50 He needs like emails, you know?
02:34:54 Yeah.
02:34:56 Because I guess any asshole in here and like, I don't want him.
02:35:01 I don't, I don't want to like shit on this guy because it seems like he
02:35:05 feels like we did, we done, we done wronged him.
02:35:10 Uh, which, uh, I don't even, I genuinely don't know.
02:35:15 I genuinely don't know the details of, of what was discussed here.
02:35:19 I just kind of heard about it from other people and like, oh, is that guy
02:35:22 making a website or is he going to do that?
02:35:25 Or is, are we, are we like in use it or what's the deal?
02:35:27 Oh, no, I guess we'll see.
02:35:28 I guess we'll see.
02:35:31 Kind of lame, kind of lame.
02:35:34 Yeah.
02:35:34 Well, like, uh, yeah, I guess, I guess he won't get no conversation
02:35:37 because no one could remember who he was.
02:35:41 I remember that this was that I remember that this person is real
02:35:45 and I believe that this is probably a real voicemail from that person.
02:35:49 I don't see any reason not to believe that this person is real,
02:35:54 but we don't acknowledge is real as being a real thing.
02:35:57 So I get by that logic.
02:36:00 This didn't happen.
02:36:02 Absolutely.
02:36:04 Okay.
02:36:05 The next voicemail 3309 is called reused voicemails three, two, one go.
02:36:12 Whoa, someone reused old voicemails.
02:36:15 That was surreal.
02:36:15 Is it going to be a pig?
02:36:16 I sent that creative immortality mail like two years ago or something
02:36:19 and remember quite clearly that you guys were talking over it.
02:36:23 There's a prankster among us.
02:36:25 Don't only PCP members have access to the voicemail archive.
02:36:30 They're, I mean, yeah, we have, you know, we do actually.
02:36:34 We do have access to the archive.
02:36:36 I don't know if we can like, can we look search for it?
02:36:40 Imposter.
02:36:41 There's an imposter in the PCP.
02:36:44 Funnily enough, old voice mail.
02:36:45 No, you know what?
02:36:46 I'm an idiot.
02:36:47 We, we, we can.
02:36:48 Yeah.
02:36:49 Yeah.
02:36:49 No, I can like type a search thing and go through our archive and be like
02:36:53 and find voicemails based on what they were titled.
02:36:57 That is totally a thing I can do.
02:36:58 I didn't realize.
02:37:01 Next voicemail is called SM part four.
02:37:06 And sorry, I'm posting it right now.
02:37:09 SM part.
02:37:12 No, sorry.
02:37:13 Yeah.
02:37:13 No, SM part three.
02:37:14 This is SM part three.
02:37:15 Okay.
02:37:16 Three, two, one, go.
02:37:18 I'm the guy who sent in Riley seeing discord the other week.
02:37:22 Just want to say that was 100% real.
02:37:26 I don't know why you guys would think that some fan would just
02:37:30 pretend to be Riley seeing discord would be a really weird,
02:37:35 strange thing to do.
02:37:37 Anyway, it's on a sound cloud.
02:37:38 It's like a parody of discord related to the Maddox drama.
02:37:45 That's why he said I'm not a fan of Redditors.
02:37:48 Instead of I'm not a fan of puppeteers.
02:37:51 Yeah.
02:37:52 Anyway, verse two.
02:37:54 I got fishes that is cool.
02:37:56 He sounds so bad.
02:37:59 Oh God, you like breathe in the middle of his lines.
02:38:01 He sucks.
02:38:03 He sucks.
02:38:08 Oh, his voice breaks.
02:38:09 He tries to like do a falsetto and he cracks.
02:38:13 He doesn't crack, but he's so breathy.
02:38:16 It's really floundering.
02:38:18 Sucks.
02:38:20 Um, yeah, it would it would be weird for someone to fake it.
02:38:25 But I mean, people do weird things all the time.
02:38:27 I don't know.
02:38:28 I mean, I know that it's real.
02:38:29 How old is that like sound cloud account?
02:38:31 I don't know how the account is, but the song is only like eight
02:38:34 months old, I think.
02:38:36 I mean, and eight eight months ago, like no one knew who the
02:38:40 fuck any of these guys were.
02:38:43 Oh, no one in the PCP circle.
02:38:46 Maybe not no one in the PCP did.
02:38:48 That might be true.
02:38:51 Wait, hold on.
02:38:52 Let me confirm the song was posted.
02:38:57 I mean, the comments are from like eight months ago.
02:39:00 So I don't know if I can see whatever it doesn't matter.
02:39:05 But that's like if it's about the Maddox drama, that seems
02:39:07 really late.
02:39:09 Yeah.
02:39:09 Okay.
02:39:09 No, it was posted two years ago or more than a year ago.
02:39:13 Well, they still talk about Maddox.
02:39:16 I don't know.
02:39:18 I'm sure.
02:39:19 Yeah, too.
02:39:20 A bit.
02:39:21 I mean, I don't think he's been doing.
02:39:23 I think now they just kind of like will like see Maddox
02:39:28 live streaming and like make fun of him being awkward.
02:39:31 I think that's just kind of where it's at.
02:39:35 How entertaining.
02:39:37 How how.
02:39:38 Yeah, I know, right?
02:39:39 Uh, okay.
02:39:41 Next one is called quick and painless, right?
02:39:47 Wait, it's loading.
02:39:48 Oh, is that a 3 3 13?
02:39:51 3 3 13 is called quick and painless.
02:39:54 All right.
02:39:55 Wait, did we skip one?
02:39:56 Did we skip 3 3 12?
02:39:57 Yes.
02:39:58 All right.
02:39:58 3 3 12 is called read.
02:39:59 Just do computer science, bro.
02:40:01 3 2 1 go.
02:40:04 So CS is a very good way to make money that with minimal
02:40:08 with less less time in college than you need to be like a
02:40:11 lawyer or a doctor or whatever.
02:40:13 I just would warn that that caller that not everybody is
02:40:16 cut out for it.
02:40:17 And this is the test.
02:40:18 Watch the three blue one brown linear algebra series on
02:40:23 YouTube and if you can make it through it and you enjoy it
02:40:26 and you can follow along with what he's saying, then you're
02:40:28 fucking perfect for it.
02:40:30 But if not, it might you might not be the thing for you
02:40:33 because CS just requires that a lot of math and a lot of
02:40:37 abstractions.
02:40:38 It requires you to be able to think an entirely theoretical
02:40:41 space a lot in order to do it well.
02:40:44 But if you pass that test, you'll you'll do fine.
02:40:46 I have never heard of three three blue one brown.
02:40:52 It's a YouTube channel.
02:40:55 I guess.
02:40:57 Okay.
02:40:58 I mean, check it out if you want to know about thinking next
02:41:04 to voicemail is called quick and painless, right?
02:41:08 Three, two, one, go.
02:41:10 You know how your perception of time can change like particularly
02:41:13 when you're in pain or under stress?
02:41:17 What if as your head is being crushed?
02:41:20 It feels like a fucking million years or some shit.
02:41:23 Yeah.
02:41:25 That would be so epic.
02:41:27 I would.
02:41:27 I would suck.
02:41:28 I would not have a good time.
02:41:29 What if when you die, you.
02:41:32 You're dead, but your consciousness doesn't disappear.
02:41:37 Rather, it's just stuck in whatever sensation you were
02:41:40 feeling at the moment of death forever.
02:41:43 I'll be there.
02:41:44 Oh, God, I hope that's how it would die coming.
02:41:48 Hope I die coming.
02:41:49 Yeah, I'll be on my death bed and I'll tell my my my son's like
02:41:53 got really fucking drinking off your dog.
02:41:57 I'm really this is this is important.
02:42:00 This is the one thing I'll ever ask of you, son.
02:42:02 You got me.
02:42:03 Yeah, you drive me up and up on his death bed.
02:42:06 And I'm going to the only way I'm going to die when the nut hits.
02:42:11 I got to die in fucking bliss.
02:42:14 You ever pull the plug when the nut you ever see that one that
02:42:18 one tweet that was a good screenshot of a fortune for it
02:42:20 where this guy was talking about how you like he pitched his
02:42:23 idea for a book to so many publishers.
02:42:26 And I'm one and like, I think he kept getting denied because
02:42:30 his book was too fetishistic.
02:42:32 And people are kind of like, well, what's your book about?
02:42:35 And he said like, oh, it's about a guy who like, I think
02:42:37 it gets into like a car accident or or no, it's about a kid
02:42:41 who I think falls into like a cement mixer or something and
02:42:43 that kills him.
02:42:44 But his consciousness is still in the cement and that cement
02:42:48 is like used to like pave like streets and he talks about
02:42:52 all the sensations of like feeling people's like feet on
02:42:55 him and how much he likes it when like he likes like women's
02:42:58 like bare feet to walk on him.
02:43:02 I see.
02:43:03 Yeah.
02:43:04 I have not seen that post but I get it.
02:43:09 Next voicemail.
02:43:10 Next voicemail is called rebutting Nate revisionism.
02:43:13 No, sorry.
02:43:14 Next one is called games for Ben.
02:43:16 Three, two, one, go.
02:43:18 Ben, are you aware of disco Elysium?
02:43:21 It's a very Bencore game.
02:43:22 You probably like it.
02:43:24 The characters in the setting and shit are all extremely
02:43:27 Bencore because they're about like cops that fucking suck
02:43:31 in like conflict between communists and libs and yeah,
02:43:35 I've seen the setting is like there's this fucking actually
02:43:39 I won't spoil that but the setting is fucking crazy.
02:43:41 You'd like it.
02:43:42 The it looks like maybe this kind of story I would like
02:43:46 but it's also like one of those isometric are CRPG's and I
02:43:50 like don't really play those.
02:43:51 So I'm like maybe I'd like it.
02:43:55 Maybe.
02:43:56 Maybe.
02:43:58 Maybe.
02:43:58 I don't know.
02:43:59 It sounds cool.
02:44:00 I want to play it eventually.
02:44:02 That's just not my usual genre.
02:44:04 It could be good anyway.
02:44:06 Next one is called rebutting Nate revisionism.
02:44:09 Three, two, one, go.
02:44:11 Nate was not a good host like he was all right.
02:44:14 But remember when Nate had the most control over the podcast
02:44:19 like around episode 120 X or one one X or so.
02:44:26 It was fucking terrible.
02:44:27 Every single episode needed to have a fucking topic and it
02:44:30 was terrible and nobody had anything to say about the topic.
02:44:34 So it sucked.
02:44:34 That's true.
02:44:36 Nate was weirdly Nate was and like continues to be weirdly
02:44:41 fixated on the idea that like the podcast must have a topic
02:44:44 or it's like not worth doing even as though as though the
02:44:52 it was ever about the topics like it like all it was always
02:44:56 the case that like the topic of the episode was just an excuse
02:44:59 to like get the ball rolling and get us like talking about
02:45:02 our own weird shit.
02:45:04 I don't know how he doesn't understand that.
02:45:06 I really don't get it.
02:45:08 But he but when I asked when I've asked him he said like,
02:45:11 yeah, you know, the show's different now.
02:45:13 It's you know, it's not about topics anymore.
02:45:15 You know, it used to be about the topics, man.
02:45:17 It used to be about the topics now.
02:45:19 I don't know, man.
02:45:21 Just without those topics.
02:45:22 I'm just I'm just not feeling it anymore.
02:45:24 I mean, I'm paraphrasing obviously some but he has a he's
02:45:28 weird.
02:45:28 He's weird about I don't get it.
02:45:29 I genuinely don't understand what what the thought I process
02:45:33 even though I've asked him and he's explained it to me.
02:45:35 I still don't understand it.
02:45:36 I remember back when you guys still did topics and how I let
02:45:40 I left like a paragraph long like comment on the on the episode
02:45:46 titled monsters because like it didn't really seem like everyone's
02:45:50 favorite.
02:45:50 Yeah, no one had nothing.
02:45:51 No, no, no monsters.
02:45:52 Monsters to was the one that was like legendarily bad.
02:45:55 Right.
02:45:56 Well, I thought monsters to was a patron exclusive.
02:46:00 I thought maybe maybe you're right.
02:46:03 Yeah.
02:46:04 No, I think you're right.
02:46:04 Actually.
02:46:05 Yeah.
02:46:05 Yeah.
02:46:06 Because monsters one was the one where like, yeah, it just seemed
02:46:08 like you guys did like it's so weird because it's like this was
02:46:11 back when you guys would still actively talk about like Pokemon
02:46:13 and that's like a monster, right?
02:46:15 Like because we always talked about Pokemon.
02:46:17 We don't have anything else to say about Pokemon.
02:46:19 And I don't fucking care at all about like Kaiju's or whatever.
02:46:24 Right.
02:46:24 Right.
02:46:25 Exactly.
02:46:25 Oh, wait, did you, um, did you see the trailer for that like
02:46:28 Pokemon knockoff game?
02:46:32 Oh, the one where they're like working in a sweatshop.
02:46:35 They have guns.
02:46:35 Yeah.
02:46:37 Yeah.
02:46:38 It looks stupid.
02:46:39 I don't know.
02:46:40 I kind of think that yeah, go on.
02:46:44 It doesn't look like the kind of it looks like the kind of thing
02:46:47 that would generate interest from its kind of like surprising theme,
02:46:52 but then like wouldn't actually be a good game underneath it.
02:46:56 I'm very that's that's what it seems like.
02:46:59 I'm very interested.
02:47:00 I'm hoping it's a good game.
02:47:01 I think it'd be very funny if it was a good game because I kind of
02:47:04 like it would be cool if it was good.
02:47:06 Yeah, I'm kind of interesting.
02:47:08 I mean, I like the angle of like, yeah, yeah, this is just like dog
02:47:11 fights and we're just criminals and we poach and we use sweatshops.
02:47:16 It's just I don't know.
02:47:17 It's like your team rocket.
02:47:19 It's like you're playing as Team Rocket, though.
02:47:21 Finally, finally.
02:47:23 Well, we all want it.
02:47:26 Yeah, it could be cool if it's good, but I kind of think it won't be good.
02:47:30 All right.
02:47:31 I don't know.
02:47:31 You got to go next voice mail.
02:47:32 I don't know.
02:47:34 Yeah, absolutely.
02:47:35 Next one is called more thoughts on archiving.
02:47:38 Three, two, one, go.
02:47:41 The destruction of knowledge, like the removal of an archive so that
02:47:44 you can only know about something through fucking memory and word of mouth
02:47:49 again, like in the in the prehistoric age, the fucking destruction of
02:47:54 knowledge like that of information, of media, of whatever is like
02:48:00 existentially horrifying to me.
02:48:03 It's terrifying.
02:48:04 I hate it.
02:48:05 I haven't heard anything from like whoever's in charge of the archive or
02:48:10 I mean of the of the PCP Wiki.
02:48:12 I don't know if maybe that person like reconsidered their position on like
02:48:18 deleting or privating the Wiki.
02:48:19 I kind of hope they do since like I and I kind of think most people
02:48:25 think it's not what should happen.
02:48:29 What happened to them?
02:48:30 I guess I didn't hear about this.
02:48:32 Some someone someone said that like the Wiki was being deleted because
02:48:36 like things changed and it was things were different now.
02:48:42 As though like that's not the purpose of an archive is to record
02:48:45 how things previously were right.
02:48:48 Yeah.
02:48:48 Yeah.
02:48:50 Yeah, that's that's weird.
02:48:51 Like what if things change you are super weird.
02:48:55 If things change, you archive the changes.
02:48:57 You don't like that's what you need an archive.
02:49:00 Yeah.
02:49:00 You don't fucking rewrite old like information just because things
02:49:04 change like you don't just like, uh.
02:49:07 Yeah, you know now we got we got Darwin's.
02:49:09 We got Darwin's theory of not intelligence.
02:49:13 We got Darwin's theory of evolution now.
02:49:14 Like I guess we better I guess we better burn all these like
02:49:17 Lamarckian books on like on design design or whatever.
02:49:21 Like we don't do the science has changed.
02:49:23 So this shouldn't be archive.
02:49:24 We should delete it.
02:49:25 It's like if it's like in like if the like Marvel or DC comic
02:49:29 Wiki like every time they read with a character, they just get rid
02:49:31 of the old information or replace with the new one.
02:49:34 No, delete it all.
02:49:35 Delete it all.
02:49:35 We can't have anyone remembering that.
02:49:37 Yeah, that character isn't like that no more.

02:52:37 Trump was the funniest president.
02:52:39 We could have all just enjoyed it and had a good giggle
02:52:41 except people had to go and get serious people had everyone
02:52:45 had Trump was being ironic guys.
02:52:47 It was just satire everything he was doing.
02:52:49 Trump Trump was being ironic and then some idiots had to go
02:52:52 and take it too seriously.
02:52:53 They took it too far.
02:52:54 They ruined it for all of his fans.
02:52:56 I don't know that he's ironic.
02:52:58 He's supposed to be satirical and they just took.
02:53:00 Yeah, they took it too far.
02:53:02 Yeah, it's true.
02:53:03 It's true.
02:53:04 I choose to believe that it's true.
02:53:06 Donald Trump has the worst fandom of any of any show on the
02:53:10 hub, right?
02:53:12 That is discovery.
02:53:13 Okay, next.

02:53:21 Next voicemail is called Henlo Corgo 6 3 2 1 go.
02:53:31 Okay, so I honestly cannot remember for the life of me
02:53:34 which lecture it was.
02:53:36 There was a PCP lecture where you been reference the song
02:53:43 Communist daughter by neutral milk hotel with the lion's
02:53:47 seam and stains the mountain tops.
02:53:50 And for you, I've said I've referenced that all the time
02:53:52 just sticking around.
02:53:53 I can tell but since in the airplane over the seat by
02:53:59 neutral milk hotel is my favorite album of all time.
02:54:03 I was just kind of wondering like how much you actually
02:54:07 like the album or if it's actually had an influence.
02:54:12 This is goofy.
02:54:13 This is a goofy question.
02:54:14 Just please talk about neutral milk hotel.
02:54:17 Just talk about neutral milk hotel.
02:54:19 I don't care if you love the album.
02:54:21 We're eating a lot of neutral milk hotel talk about
02:54:23 neutral milk hotel.
02:54:24 I have the I think I do remember the others one lecture
02:54:29 where I just starts on seam and stains the mountain tops.
02:54:33 I yell.
02:54:35 I mean, when I lived at Digi House with Trixie and Davoo,
02:54:40 there was like we had a running joke where we would just
02:54:44 start yelling neutral milk hotel.
02:54:47 We would just start yelling I love you Jesus.
02:54:52 And I've done it on the podcasts many, many times.
02:54:56 I mean, it is a funny joke and it's a funny meme and
02:54:59 they're funny lyrics and it's fun to go.
02:55:07 I mean, genuinely, I really like them.
02:55:09 I don't listen to very much music, but that's like one of
02:55:11 the few albums that I have like that I do come back to
02:55:15 every once in a while, listen to the album.
02:55:17 I would say I'm a big fan of that album specifically the
02:55:20 album as a whole.
02:55:22 I think it's a masterpiece.
02:55:23 It makes me cry.
02:55:26 That's what I think about it.
02:55:28 But also it's funny to go.
02:55:33 All I know about that album is that it was for and Frank or
02:55:38 not.
02:55:39 Yeah, yeah, that's all I know.
02:55:42 You're gonna say Lisa Frank.
02:55:44 Yeah, Lisa Frank.
02:55:46 I love.
02:55:47 Yeah, Rip Lisa Frank.
02:55:49 She didn't have it come Rip Lisa Frank then.
02:55:52 Yeah.
02:55:52 Yeah, I see taken from us too soon.
02:55:54 If I if I see those Nazis, it's on site.
02:55:56 I'll just tell you that much.
02:55:58 Lisa Frank still has shooters out here.
02:56:02 Nazis were based until they killed Lisa Frank and then
02:56:05 it got too real with Nazis that Hitler was being ironic
02:56:08 and he was just being satirical and like I took it too
02:56:11 fucking far.
02:56:11 They just took they didn't they had no sense of humor.
02:56:15 Exactly.
02:56:16 That's like oh my God.
02:56:17 That's why I hate the left on ironically he was he was
02:56:20 just he was just being he was just being a contrarian.
02:56:23 You know, he was just putting some he was just putting
02:56:25 some controversial shit out there to stir up some controversy.
02:56:28 Get people talking make a big spectacle out of it.

02:56:46 Nobody was operating on the same wavelength.
02:56:49 Oh, yeah.
02:56:50 Um, yeah.

02:57:23 If you type in villain verse, um, you'll, you'll find like
02:57:26 this should be a tumbler that has like the first three
02:57:29 chapters that are free.
02:57:30 Actually, no, by the time this comes out, that'll be the
02:57:32 first four chapters that are free.
02:57:34 You know, I plan to eventually have all of all of villain
02:57:37 versus going to be free to read when it's over.
02:57:38 I promise you that.
